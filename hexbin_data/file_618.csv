Pulmonary samples were examined for histopathologic patterns and specific features within these patterns, while immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were designed to detect the intralesional antigens of viral infectious disease agents and Mycoplasma bovis. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 91.4% (32/35) of these cases; neither pneumonia nor any of the infectious disease pathogens evaluated occurred in three cows. The presence of multiple respiratory pathogens in 75% (24/32) of these cases indicated the complex origin of pneumonia in cattle. Interstitial pneumonia, necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia and suppurative bronchopneumonia were the principal patterns of pulmonary disease identified by histopathology. The most frequent pathogens identified by IHC were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV; n = 18), M. bovis (n = 16) and bovine alphaherpesvirus type 1 (BoHV‐1; n = 14), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV; n = 11) and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV‐3; n = 5). Obliterative bronchiolitis and peribronchial lymphocytic cuffings were the characteristic histopathologic features associated with M. bovis. Necrohemorrhagic bronchitis with bronchial angiogenesis was associated with BoHV‐1. Necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis were associated with BVDV, BoHV‐1 and BRSV. Ballooning degeneration of the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelia was associated with BRSV and BoHV‐1. This is the first report from Brazil that correlated the histopathologic findings of BRD with the associated infectious disease agents by immunohistochemistry. M. bovis was frequently detected in the tissues of cows with fatal pulmonary disease during this study and may be a possible primary disease pathogen associated with the development of BRD in dairy cows. Additionally, the histopathologic features identified within patterns of pulmonary disease during this investigation may be an efficient diagnostic tool to associate histopathologic findings with specific agents of BRD in dairy cows.","Oliveira, Thalita Evani Silva; Pelaquim, Isadora Fernanda; Flores, Eduardo Furtado; Massi, Rodrigo Pelisson; Valdiviezo, Milton James Jiménez; Pretto‐Giordano, Lucienne Garcia; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo; Saut, João Paulo Elsen; Headley, Selwyn Arlington",Transbound Emerg Dis,618,1

FeLV is quite similar to the better-studied murine leukemia viruses in structure and genetic map. The virus particles bud from cytoplasmic membranes into either extracellular spaces or into vacuoles. FeLV has long been considered a typical noncytopathogenic, longlatency leukemia virus based on its behavior in fibroblasts in vitro. Recent evidence suggests that its in vivo behavior in critical target hemolymphatic tissues is as likely to be cytopathic as transforming. The type of FeLV-related disease that occurs and the disease-free interval probably are influenced by viral envelope proteins and glycoproteins and the consequences of proviral integration. FeLV subgroup specificity apparently determines when and what type of disease will occur. The ecotropic FeLV-A is the most frequent subgroup found in pet cats and is transmitted contagiously. Immunosuppression is the most frequent and the most devastating manifestation of FeLV viremia in clinical and experimental studies. It seems that multiple cell types and multiple processes are involved in the development of feline retrovirus-induced immunosuppression. Although no solid evidence is available for the malfunctioning of cat T helper cells because of the paucity of T-cell specific markers, the circumstantial evidence provided thus far indicates an impaired T helper function in FeLV-infected cats similar to that observed in humans infected with HIV. Studies on the pathogenesis of FeLV-induced immunosuppression might provide a valuable mode for a better understanding and means of control of human AIDS.","ROJKO, JENNIFER; ESSEX, MYRON; TRAININ, ZE'EV",Adv Vet Sci Comp Med,618,16

However, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been highlighted as a global threat by different health organizations, and pathogens resistant to antimicrobials cause substantial morbidity and death. As resistance to multiple drugs increases, novel and effective therapies as well as prevention strategies are needed. In this Review, we discuss evidence that vaccines can have a major role in fighting AMR. Vaccines are used prophylactically, decreasing the number of infectious disease cases, and thus antibiotic use and the emergence and spread of AMR. We also describe the current state of development of vaccines against resistant bacterial pathogens that cause a substantial disease burden both in high-income countries and in low- and medium-income countries, discuss possible obstacles that hinder progress in vaccine development and speculate on the impact of next-generation vaccines against bacterial infectious diseases on AMR.","Micoli, Francesca; Bagnoli, Fabio; Rappuoli, Rino; Serruto, Davide",Nat Rev Microbiol,618,9

A heuristic CB approach incorporating feature weighting and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is used, along with the TF-IDF method and functionality of tuning the importance of product features to adjust its logic to the needs of various e-commerce sites. The problem of efficiently producing recommendations, without compromising similarity, is addressed by approximating product similarities via the LSH technique. The methodology is evaluated on two sets with real e-commerce data. The evaluation of the proposed methodology shows that the produced recommendations can help customers to continue browsing a site by providing them with the necessary “next step”. Finally, it is demonstrated that the methodology incorporates recommendation diversity which can be adjusted by tuning the appropriate feature weights.","Beleveslis, Dimosthenis; Tjortjis, Christos",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,618,16

The problem is even more stringent in regions subjected to high temperatures in which protective cold chain is difficult to maintain due to a lack of infrastructure. Here, a simple, cost-effective solution to increase the thermostability of the malaria candidate vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is described. This vaccine currently needs to be stored between 2 and 8 °C due to the sensitivity of liquid AS01 to higher temperatures. The strategy was to increase thermostability by co-lyophilizing the RTS,S antigen and AS01. METHODS: Co-lyophilization was achieved in a solution containing 5% sucrose, 10 mM potassium phosphate and 0.0312% polysorbate 80 at pH 6.1. The physicho-chemical characteristics and immunogenic properties of the resulting solid product, called CL-vac, fresh or stored at high temperature, were compared to those of the candidate RTS,S/AS01. RESULTS: CL-vac proved to be acceptable in terms of visual appearance and physico-chemical characteristics. The structural integrity of both RTS,S and AS01 within CL-vac and its equivalence to the RTS,S/AS01 candidate vaccine were shown. Further, the stability of CL-vac was demonstrated for storage periods including 1 year at 4 °C, 1 year at 30 °C, and up to 6 months at 37 °C. In addition, CL-vac could withstand a heat excursion consisting of 1 month at 45 °C after storage for 1 year at 30 °C. Equivalence and stability were demonstrated by the various analytical tools and the immunogenicity of the samples after storage was also demonstrated in mice. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the co-lyophilization process appeared as a promising approach to increase RTS/AS01 vaccine thermostability.","Fortpied, Juliette; Collignon, Sylvie; Moniotte, Nicolas; Renaud, Frédéric; Bayat, Babak; Lemoine, Dominique",Malar J,618,16

Thus, SPO’s applicability depends on the durability of pushouts after this transition. There is a wide range of work on the question when pushouts exist in categories with partial morphisms starting with the pioneering work of Löwe and Kennaway and ending with an essential characterisation in terms of an exactness property (for the interplay between pullbacks and pushouts) and an adjointness condition (w.r.t. inverse image functions) by Hayman and Heindel. Triple graphs and graph diagrams are frameworks to synchronize two or more updatable data sources by means of internal mappings, which identify common sub-structures. Comprehensive systems generalise these frameworks, treating the network of data sources and their structural inter-relations as a homogeneous comprehensive artifact, in which partial maps identify commonalities. Although this inherent partiality produces amplified complexity, Heindel’s characterisation still yields cocompleteness of the category of comprehensive systems equipped with closed partial morphisms and thus enables computing by SPO graph transformation.","König, Harald; Stünkel, Patrick",Graph Transformation,618,16

First of all, a chemotaxis step size using levy distribution takes the place of fixed chemotaxis step size, which makes a good balance between local search and global search through frequent short-distance search and occasional long-distance search. Moreover, fuzzy variables are used to signify the uncertainty of future risks and returns on assets and some constrained conditions are taken into consideration. The results of the simulation show that the model can be solved more reasonably and effectively by LBFO algorithm than the original bacterial foraging optimization (BFO).","Wu, Xinzheng; Zhou, Tianwei; Qiu, Zishan",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,618,16

In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.","Wang, Ning; Fu, Yuting; Zhang, Hu; Shi, Huipeng",Precis Clin Med,618,16

The aim was to integrate positive and negative conceptualizations of mental health for predicting attitudes towards suicide, and towards suicide prevention, among students of the helping professions. The study participants (166 women and 73 men, mean age 22.84 ± 5.15) answered a set of questionnaires, including a Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Suicide, Goldberg Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWB-42) and Centrality of Religiosity Scale. Multiple regression analysis showed that environmental mastery, purpose in life and positive relationships, controlled for religiousness and psychological problems related to general mental health, predicted the variability of attitudes towards suicide and pro-preventive orientation. Sociodemographic variables were not related to attitudes towards suicide. Our findings suggest that positive mental health, represented jointly by low mental health problems and eudaimonic components of happiness, plays a role in predicting pro-preventive attitudes. Therefore, improving positive mental health among students in the helping professions, these being the future gatekeepers, could be considered an auxiliary strategy for suicide prevention.

Blast trauma may cause extensive injuries requiring improved early resuscitation and prevention of haemorrhage. Randomized prospective trials are logistically and ethically challenging, and large animal models are important for further research efforts. Few severe blast trauma models have been described, which is why we aimed to establish a comprehensive polytrauma model in accordance with the criteria of the Berlin definition of polytrauma and with a survival time of > 2 h. Multiple blast injuries to the groin and abdomen were combined with hypoperfusion, respiratory and metabolic acidosis, hypoventilation, hypothermia and inflammatory response. The model was compared to lung contusion and haemorrhage. METHODS: 16 landrace swine (mean weight 60.5 kg) were randomized to “control” (n = 5), “chest trauma/hem” by lung contusion and class II haemorrhage (n = 5), and “blast polytrauma” caused by multiple blast injuries to the groin and abdomen, class II haemorrhage, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infusion and hypothermia 32 °C (n = 6). RESULTS: The blast polytrauma group had an Injury Severity Score of 57 which resulted in haemodynamic shock, hypothermia, respiratory and metabolic acidosis and inflammatory response. The chest trauma/hem group had an Injury Severity Score of 9 and less profound physiologic effects. Physiologic parameters presented a dose–response relationship corresponding to the trauma levels. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive blast polytrauma model fulfilling the Berlin polytrauma criteria, with a high trauma load and a survival time of > 2 h was established. A severe, but consistent, injury profile was accomplished enabling the addition of experimental interventions in future studies, particularly of immediate resuscitation efforts including whole blood administration, trauma packing and haemostasis.","Dahlquist, Albin; Elander Degerstedt, Louise; von Oelreich, Erik; Brännström, Andreas; Gustavsson, Jenny; P.

Hip fractures affect elderly populations, necessitate hospital admissions, and place this group at particular risk from COVID-19 infection. This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 infection on 30-day hip fracture mortality. METHOD: Data related to seventy-five adult hip fractures admitted to two units during March and April 2020 was reviewed. The mean age was 83.5 years (range 65-98 years) and most (53, 70.7%) were females. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: The COVID-19 infection rate was 26.7% (20 patients), with a significant difference in the 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19 positive group (10/20, 50%) compared to COVID-19 negative group (4/55, 7.3%), with mean time to death of 19.8 days (95% confidence interval 17.0-22.5). The mean time from admission to surgery was 43.1 hours and 38.3 hours, in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups, respectively. All COVID-19 positive patients had shown symptoms of fever and cough, and all ten cases who died were from hypoxia. Seven (35%) cases had radiological lung findings consistent with viral pneumonitis which resulted in mortality (70% of mortality). 30% (n = 6) contracted the COVID-19 infection in the community and 70% (n = 14) developed symptoms after hospital admission. CONCLUSION: Hip fractures associated with COVID-19 infection have a high 30-day mortality. COVID-19 testing and chest x-ray for patients presenting with hip fractures, helps in early planning of high-risk surgeries and allows counselling of the patients and family using realistic prognosis.","Fadulelmola, Ahmed; Gregory, Rob; Gordon, Gavin; Smith, Fiona; Jennings, Andrew",Trauma,618,16

This review also systematically evaluates the polio transmission and health economic modeling papers published in English in peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2019, highlights differences in approaches and methods, shows the geographic coverage of the transmission modeling performed, identified common themes, and discusses instances of similar or conflicting insights or recommendations. EXPERT OPINION: Polio modeling performed during the last 20 years substantially impacted polio vaccine choices, immunization policies, and the polio eradication pathway.

Various techniques have been proposed to overcome this difficulty, such as applying a gel on the mask edge. Our objective was to determine whether the gel technique will improve ventilation and to assess the comfort of the provider. A randomized crossover design was conducted to assess the efficacy of gel in a bearded simulation model. Respiratory therapists (RT) were recruited by convenience sampling to hold the mask using a two-handed technique for a two-minute ventilation session. During the session, the ventilator provided a fixed Tidal Volume (TV) of 550 mL and a respiratory rate of 12 per minute, and the simulated model measured the received volumes. We compared the median TV and number of failed ventilation attempts with or without the gel. The comfort level while using the gel was assessed with constructed questions. We recruited 74 respiratory therapists working in Riyadh city. More than half of the participants had more than 5 years experience. The median tidal volume for standard mask ventilation without the gel was 283 mL [interquartile range (IQR) 224, 327], whereas that with the gel was 467 mL [451, 478], respectively (p < 0.01). The number of successful ventilations was recorded out of 24 breaths during the 2-min ventilation period for each technique; the proportion of successful ventilations increased significantly by 65% (95% CI 51–75%, p < 0.01) with the gel. In addition, only nine participants believed the technique was not comfortable, while the remaining individuals found it comfortable or natural. In our bearded simulation model, applying the gel significantly improved ventilation without negatively affecting comfort. Further studies and education are encouraged in the field of basic airway management.","Althunayyan, Saqer M.; Mubarak, Abdullah M.; Alotaibi, Raied N.; Alharthi, Musab Z.; Aljanoubi, Mohammed A.; Alshabanat, Sulaiman; Mobrad, Abdulmajeed M.",Intern Emerg Med,618,1

We consider some of the obstacles to such access when these relatives are deceased and suggest how they might be navigated. RECENT FINDINGS: We explore an issue first highlighted in 2004 by Lucassen et al. (Br Med J 328:952–953, 2004) and re-evaluate it in the wake of novel technologies and mainstreaming of genomic medicine. We find that it is still an issue in practice despite professional guidelines advocating access to familial information (Joint Committee on Genomics in Medicine 2019) and that the Human Tissue Act 2004 is often wrongly constructed as a reason to block access. Access is often obstructed by failing to adopt the necessary relational concept of autonomy that applies in genetic medicine as reported by Horton and Lucassen (Curr Genet Med Rep 7:85–91, 2019) and by considering confidentiality to be absolute, even after death. In response to a recent legal case about the confidentiality of genetic test results, and their disclosure to family members (ABC v St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust 2020), Dove et al. (J Med Ethics 45:504–507, 2019) suggested that a duty to consider the interests of genetic relatives could co-exist alongside a duty of confidentiality to a patient. In this way, healthcare professionals can use professional judgement about the relative value of genetic information to family members. This is equally relevant in accessing deceased relatives’ information. A recent systematic review found a high level of acceptability of postmortem use of genetic data for medical research amongst participants and their relatives, and it is reasonable to assume that this acceptability would extend to clinical practice as reported by Bak et al. (Eur J Hum Genet 28:403–416, 2020). SUMMARY: Within clinical practice, access to medical records/samples of deceased relatives is often obstructed unnecessarily, potentially resulting in harm to the living relatives seeking advice. Consent to such access is important but need not be the bureaucratic hurdle that is often imposed.","Tadros, Shereen; Carley, Helena; Lucassen, Anneke",Curr Genet Med Rep,618,4

Because of the high number of patients and the supply chain disruption, it generated a shortage of medical devices and personal protective equipment. In this context, initiatives from the additive manufacturing community emerged to fight the lack of devices. Diverse designs were produced and are currently being used in hospitals by patients and health workers. However, as some devices must follow strict standards, these products may not fulfill these standards. Therefore, to ensure the user’s health, there is a need for understanding each device, their usage, and standards. This study reviews the use of additive manufacturing during COVID-19 pandemic. It gathers the source of several 3D printed devices such as face shields, face masks, valves, nasopharyngeal swabs, and others, discussing their use and regulatory issues. In this regard, the major drawbacks of the technology, addressed for the next pandemic scenario, are highlighted.

The infection was molecularly diagnosed by detecting coronavirus RNA in nasal swabs of patients. RESULTS: Mean age was significantly elevated in cases compared to controls (48.2 ± 13.8 vs. 29.9 ± 9.0 year; probability [p] < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the predictive significance of age in COVID-19 evolution (Area under curve = 0.858; 95% CI: 0.841 – 0.875; p < 0.001). Males outnumbered females in cases (60.4 vs. 39.6%) and controls (56 vs. 44%). Stratification by age group (< 30, 30 – 39, 40 – 49 and ≥ 50 years) revealed that 48.3% of cases clustered in the age group ≥ 50 years. ABO blood group analysis showed that group A was the most common among cases, while group O was the most common among controls (35.5 and 36.7%, respectively). Blood groups A (35.5 vs. 32.7; corrected p [pc] = 0.021), A+AB (46.3 vs. 41.7%; pc = 0.021) and A+B+AB (68.0 vs. 63.3%; pc = 0.007) showed significantly elevated frequencies in cases compared to controls. Logistic regression analysis estimated odds ratios (ORs) of 1.53 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16 - 2.02), 1.48 (95% CI: 1.14 - 1.93) and 1.50 (95% CI: 1.17 - 1.82) for blood groups A, A+AB and A+B+AB, respectively. Blood group frequencies showed no significant differences between age groups of cases or controls. Regarding gender, male cases were marked with increased frequency of group A (39.9 vs. 28.9%) and decreased frequency of group O (25.9 vs. 41.0%) compared to female cases. Independent re-analysis of ABO blood groups in male and female cases demonstrated that group A was increased in male cases compared to male controls (39.9 vs. 33.1%; OR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.24 - 2.21; pc = 0.006). On the contrary, no significant differences were found between females of cases and controls.

By 2050, this population is expected to increase by 1.6 billion. Multiple bi-directional connections exist between oral disease and overall health. [Methods] Faculty from the Dental Hygiene Department, New York University College of Dentistry conducted an extensive outreach effort and randomly selected assisted living facilities. Facilities were offered the opportunity to receive at no-cost, a dental hygiene-led, educational, preventive oral health program delivered virtually to their residents as a community service. Incentives discussed. [Results] Twenty-one facilities were contacted, 17 (94.4%) had no oral healthcare program; one had an oral health component. In 13 (72%), the concierge functioned as gatekeeper, unwilling to transfer calls or deliver messages. In five (28%), calls were directed to the activity coordinator. Feasibility concerns and uncertainty about oral health service necessity and resident safety were voiced. Two facilities mentioned familiarity with dental hygiene professionals. Strategic changes in outreach resulted in successfully engaging with facility administrators. Strategies included identifying directors with familiarity or experience with dental hygiene profession, establishing a portfolio and utilizing technology that facilitate incorporating COVID-19 protocols. [Conclusions] Efforts to initiate a dental hygiene-led virtual oral health program encountered gatekeeper challenges. Although facility activity coordinators acknowledged benefits for their population, they were not final decision-makers. It was necessary to implement strategies that facilitated discussing the virtual oral hygiene program directly with the facility’s executive leadership.","Attanasi, Kim; Raveis, Victoria",Innov Aging,618,1

Anti-ageism critics have taken issue with the oft-repeated statement that “only” older adults are at risk, a construction that dismisses and devalues the nuances within this population. The purpose of this study was to analyze instances of ageism in national media sources during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search returned 287 articles concerning older adults and COVID-19 published in four major newspapers in the United States—USA Today, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post—between March 11 and April 10, 2020. Combining the strengths of content analysis and critical discourse analysis, we deductively and inductively reviewed the articles for patterns related to implicit and explicit forms of ageism. While ageism was rarely discussed explicitly, ageist bias was evident in implicit reporting patterns, such as frequent use of the phrase the elderly, which was often paired with statements describing older adults as vulnerable. Infection and death rates among older adults, as well as institutionalized care practices, were among the most commonly reported topics, providing a limited portrait of aging during the pandemic. While some authors utilized a survivor narrative by portraying older adults as having survived hardships, this construction implicitly places blame on those unable to do so. Older adults, when quoted directly, produced more complex and nuanced narratives of aging during the COVID-19 pandemic. Such narratives can combat societal ageism and promote self-determination and -definition.","Jeong, Mijin; Jen, Sarah; Kang, Hyun; Riquino, Michael",Innov Aging,618,24

The survey included the GAD-7 anxiety scale, PHQ-9 scale of depression severity and the UCLA Revised Loneliness Scale (3rd revision), as well as questions about the pandemic’s impact on physical and mental wellbeing in the month of April and long-term physical and mental health. Although loneliness did not differ among groups, students reported the highest levels of moderate/severe depression (46.6%), followed by faculty (21.1%) and staff (6.9%). Students also reported the highest levels of moderate/severe anxiety (48.6%) compared with faculty (29.4%) and staff (12.1%).

Most changes in the virus genome due to mutation and recombination during serial passaging in embryonated chicken eggs occur in the S1 gene. In the current study, we tried to predict the potential linear B-cell epitopes of the S1 subunit of two Iranian 793/B isolates and then we analyzed their changes at passage level 90 due to mutations at this passage level. To predict linear B-cell epitopes of the S1 protein belonging to two Iranian 793/B isolates, we used two online epitope prediction programs called BepiPred and ABCpred. Some of the most important features of proteins including antigenicity, physicochemical properties, and secondary structure composition were analyzed. The predicted epitopes were studied between wild viruses and their passage level 90 viruses. We identified 15 potential linear B-cell epitopes among which six epitopes had the highest scores of physicochemical properties and antigenicity. Due to amino acid substitutions, seven predicted epitopes had different amino acid sequences at passage level 90. Among eight epitopes with no amino acid substitution at passage level 90, three epitopes had the highest scores. These three conserved epitopes including NH2-NQLGSCPLTGMI-COOH, NH2-GNFSDGFYPFTNSSLVKD-COOH, and NH2-GPIQGGC-COOH might be strategic and potential candidates for use in designing epitope-based vaccine researches. In conclusion, based on scores of physicochemical properties and antigenicity, it seemed that the sequence of most epitopes in wild viruses might be more antigenic and immunogenic compared to their sequence in viruses of passage 90.","Salarpour, Arezoo; Toroghi, Reza; Nikbakht Brujeni, Gholamreza; Momayez, Reza",Vet Res Forum,618,20

In the present study, we systematically examined wearing-off phenomena during nusinersen maintenance dosing using a patient-centered approach. We found that adult SMA patients perceived wearing-off after nearly half of 51 investigated nusinersen administrations, primarily within the last month prior to the next administration. Symptoms and functions affected were mainly general strength and arm and leg muscle function next to endurance and independence in daily routine. Lack of walking ability and higher body mass index were characteristic phenotypic features in patients with consistent wearing-off effects. We assume that specific SMA phenotypes might benefit from higher dosing, shorter treatment intervals, change of treatment administration or a combination of all. Efforts towards treatment optimization may result in higher efficacy in distinct phenotypes.","Osmanovic, Alma; Schreiber-Katz, Olivia; Petri, Susanne",Brain Sci,618,0

Common leflunomide side-effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea), occurring in 10–20% of patients treated with leflunomide. Scarce evidence exists that leflunomide can cause colitis. AIMS: We present the case of a 61-year-old female, with Lupus Erythematosus who presented with colitis induced by long-term leflunomide treatment. METHODS: Case report and review of literature RESULTS: A 61-year-old female was seen by the gastroenterology team with complaints of diarrhea ongoing for 6 weeks associated with 10 lb weight loss. The patient had a complex medical history, including lupus, hypothyroidism, asthma, atrial fibrillation, recurrent C. difficile infection, Bell’s palsy and avascular necrosis secondary to long-term corticosteroid therapy. Previous immunosuppressive therapies included prednisone, mycophenolic acid (Myfortic), hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, mycophenolate (CellCept) but due to multiple intolerances, she was initiated on leflunomide in 2014 and has been maintained on it since. Stool analysis ruled out infectious causes. COVID-19 testing was also negative. A CT of the abdomen revealed pancolitis. This was confirmed on colonoscopy, which revealed mild, Mayo 1 pancolitis and normal terminal ileum. She was initiated on Mezavant as a treatment for possible ulcerative colitis. However, during the hospitalization her symptoms, worsened and bloody diarrhea was noted. She underwent a subsequent endoscopic evaluation which revealed more severe disease, Mayo 2–3 colitis, with mucosal hyperemia and ulcerations, as well as effacement of the vasculature. Initial pathology results revealed mild colitis, but repeat pathology results revealed moderate active colitis, with cryptitis, crypt abscesses and significant apoptosis consistent with drug-induced colitis. Given these findings, the diagnosis of leflunomide-induced colitis was made. Leflunomide was therefore discontinued, the patient was initiated on a higher dose of corticosteroids and cholestyramine was initiated. Following these measures, her diarrhea resolved. CONCLUSIONS: Leflunomide may cause diarrhea in up to 33% of patients. Challenges related to the diagnosis of leflunomide-induced colitis exist, including the rarity of the diagnosis, a not completely understood mechanism for acute leflunomide-induced diarrhea, as well as variable endoscopic and histologic findings associated with the diagnosis. This report illustrates a case of leflunomide-induced colitis which should be considered in patients on leflunomide, who present with symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea, even years after medication initiation.

Though this reception period has been heavily criticized, especially in relation to mental health, few scholars examined its impact on refugee integration. Since host country language learning is the main focus for most recent arrivals, this study re-examines the impact of the (renewed) reception period on both refugee mental health and host country language proficiency. Using a unique dataset including 3209 Syrian permitholders in the Netherlands, we test a structural equation model to examine those relations directly and indirectly. Results partly replicate previous findings, showing the negative impact of the number of relocations on mental health as well as the negative impact of both length of stay and relocations on host country language proficiency. Nevertheless, we did not find support for a negative relationship between length of stay and mental health. Moreover, the image of the reception period is not as gloomy as before; activities asylum seekers can engage in during their stay is positively related to both mental health and host country language proficiency. The relationships between both relocations and activities and host country language proficiency can partially be explained by mental health. These results indicate that the reception period can be seen as both an obstacle and a facilitator. Since the context of reception is a post-migration stressor, these findings should inform receiving societies and inspire them to accommodate their refugee reception accordingly, ensuring a smooth(er) start for future refugees.

This narrative review provides a comprehensive overview on the small empirical literature available thus far. In particular, insights from uses and gratification theory in the realm of TikTok are highlighted, and we also discuss aspects of the TikTok platform design. Given the many unexplored research questions related to TikTok use, it is high time to strengthen research efforts to better understand TikTok use and whether certain aspects of its use result in detrimental behavioral effects. In light of user characteristics of the TikTok platform, this research is highly relevant because TikTok users are often adolescents and therefore from a group of potentially vulnerable individuals.","Montag, Christian; Yang, Haibo; Elhai, Jon D.",Front Public Health,618,16

For this purpose, time series data of Turkey over the period 1975–2018 were evaluated. Moreover, household consumption, life expectancy at birth, trade, and foreign direct investments were added as control variables. Cointegration analysis was performed to test whether all variables are cointegrated in the long term. Causality test was successfully employed to investigate the relationship between health expenditure and economic growth in the short term. The achieved results exhibited that Johansen Cointegration test results suggest the existence of cointegration among all variables in the long term. In addition, the Granger causality test results indicate unidirectional causality from health expenditure to economic growth in the short term. Existence of a long-term relationship among related variables and a short-term relationship between health expenditure and economic growth displays the importance of investments on health care services in Turkey. Therefore, investments in the health sector should be encouraged and the share allocated by the government for health expenditures from the budget should be increased in Turkey.","Esen, Ethem; Çelik Keçili, Merve",J Knowl Econ,618,17

With high mortality and limited capacity; appropriate decisions to escalate to critical care were vital for just resource allocation but also to prevent harm where interventions would not change outcomes. NICE guidance highlighted Clinical frailty scoring (CFS) as central to the decision-making process. 1, Despite initial criticism, recent evidence has confirmed increasing CFS as an independent risk factor to inpatient mortality in COVID-19.2 We conducted a quality improvement project with the aim of improving CFS documentation at the Royal Free Hospital. METHODS: We reviewed the notes of 71 inpatients over the age of 65 years from 6 wards on 08/05/20–12/05/20 for both a CFS score documentation and clear treatment escalation plan at time points of initial clerking, post-take and following ward admission with an audit standard of 100%. We developed teaching sessions, promoted the CFS mobile application, developed a post-take sticker and an elderly medicine ward admission proforma. We re-audited 66 inpatient notes from the same 6 wards from 25/06/20–07/07/20. RESULTS: Documentation.of CFS improved from 7% to 17% for clerking and post-take and from 13% to 24% on the ward admission. The number of patients with treatment escalation plans was 50%. CONCLUSION: CFS is crucial for the COVID-19 era and beyond. We have demonstrated that increased awareness improves use of CFS, though it is not yet being widely used in escalation decisions. 1.

METHOD: 285 cases OVER A 1-MONTH PERIOD were RETROSPECTIVELY reviewed to evaluate the effectiveness of managing patients using the ‘one-stop’ model and the new Urgent Treatment Centre (UTC). RESULTS: 277 patients were included in the study. During Covid-19, operative cases fell by 62%. 86.3% (239/277) of cases were managed in the UTC; 54.4% (130/239) required conservative management and 45.6% (109/239) required minor procedures (in UTC). REMOVABLE SPLINT USE was optimized through design of ‘softcasts’ for non-operative management of distal radius fractures. A patient education video: ‘softcast removal at home’ was created and in cases requiring sutures, 95.1% (39/41) were absorbable, thereby avoiding COVID-19 exposure for follow-up. Only 50.5% (140/277) of patients had formal follow-up arranged and patient information follow-up cards were developed. CONCLUSIONS: The one-stop model prevents delay in definitive treatment, allows effective initial treatment, and minimizes the need for face-to-face follow up. In light of a possible second wave of COVID-19 cases, this new model should be considered for implementation by all hand’s units for the foreseeable future.","Khajuria, A",Br J Surg,618,1

This research explores machine learning (ML) techniques to forecast the epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in India. We used 22 ML algorithms develop forecasting models and selected the four best ones on the basis of their performance using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Feature extraction and feature selection techniques were also employed to improve performance with cumulative and daily data obtained from Mar. 2 to Apr. 25, 2020. Because of the linear nature of cumulative data, the model built with these time series data outperforms with an MAPE of 0.498, 0.240, and 0.430, respectively, for cases that are confirmed or recovered and deaths using the extra tree regressor compared with the model built with daily data with an MAPE of 1.377, 1.302, and 0.488, respectively. Moreover, the study confirms that the models perform well at the validation stage with an MAPE of 4.123, 5.411, and 4.553, respectively, for confirmed or recovered cases and deaths using a model built with cumulative data and an MAPE of 6.261, 7.576, and 6.273, respectively, using a model built with daily data.

Between March and May 2020, the region of southern Switzerland was affected by the first pandemic peak, which was managed by dividing hospitals in Covid and non Covid facilities and by reducing elective surgery. At the end of the pandemic peak hospitals returned to their original structure but there was concern as to possible avoidance of former COVID facilities by patients because of fear of contracting of COVID-19 infection. For acute situations such as acute appendicitis, this could imply a delay of treatment. The aim of this retrospective study is to analyse the increment in incidence of complicated appendicitis in the post-pandemic period at our institution. METHODS: Clinical data of patients who underwent appendectomies in the period before and after the COVID-19 pandemic were analysed and compared. Diagnosis was based histopathological examination and/or on intra-operative or CT findings. Complicated appendicitis was defined as the presence of perforated or gangrenous appendicitis on histopathology or the presence of an abscess on CT scan. The incidence of complicated appendicitis, the time between onset of symptoms and patient admission (TOSA), the initial inflammatory blood tests and the complication rate was compared between the two periods. RESULTS: 79 patients were included in the study, 31 in the post-COVID-19 peak group (A), April - October 2020, and 48 in the pre-pandemic group (B), April - October 2019. Incidence of complicated appendicitis was significantly higher in group A (55% vs 14% p = 0.02). These findings correlate with a greater TOSA (mean time 35 hours vs 17 hours, p = 0.01) and higher inflammatory values in the initial blood test, (mean WBC count 14.8 G/l vs 12.9 G/l, p = 0.08 and mean CRP value 73 mg/l vs 43 mg/l, p = 0.01) in group A. CONCLUSION: Our data show a clear increase of incidence of complicated acute appendicitis after the pandemic peak in our hospital. Indeed patients tended to wait longer to visit our emergency department after the pandemic peak. One explanation is a possible fear by the patients of contracting COVID-19 infection in a former COVID hospital. Management of surgical emergencies during and after a pandemic peak phase should take into account the fact that patients may wait longer to visit a doctor thus aggravating the degree of their disease.","Passoni, S; Giuliani, M; Arigoni, M",Br J Surg,618,10

This article offers empirical examples of practices of what we termed ‘virtual academic hospitality’: during a series of online collaborative and cross borders workshops with teachers of English based in the Gaza Strip (Palestine), we performed academic hospitality through virtual convivial rituals and the sharing of virtual gifts, which are illustrated here. We propose a revision of the concept of academic hospitality arguing that: firstly, academic hospitality is not limited to intellectual conversations; secondly, that the relationship between hospitality and mobility needs to be revised, since hospitality mediated by the technological medium can be performed, and technology may even stretch hospitality towards the unreachable ‘unconditional hospitality’ theorised by Derrida (Of hospitality: Anne Dufourmantelle invited Jacques Derrida to respond. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2000); and thirdly, that indigenous epistemics, with their focus on the affective, may offer alternative understandings of conviviality within the academy.

It marks an important step forward as a high-profile publication trying to radically re-think the challenge of sustainable development and revisit what it means to develop as human beings interconnected within earth systems. This article provides a critical reading of the report, and human development literature more widely, in assessing the role of lifelong learning in educating for just transitions, which it broadly understands as the transformation of all social systems, including economic systems, to bring them back into balance with earth systems in which they are embedded. The report maintains its trademark “human development lens” which has characterised the series since their inception in 1990. It prioritises consideration of capabilities, agency and values as central to the challenge, and opens up a discussion of how we need to change our understandings, values and actions, including what it means to be human, in order to effect just transitions towards sustainability. However, as the authors demonstrate, the report falls short of considering the lifelong learning challenge inherent and central to just transitions. The authors argue that the pressing challenge of responding to the climate emergency requires a richer understanding of how humans learn throughout their life course.

Molecular subtype provides a new framework for the study of MIBC heterogeneity. Clinically, MIBC can be classified as basal and luminal subtypes; they display different clinical and pathological characteristics, but the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Lipidomic and metabolomic molecules have recently been considered to play an important role in the genesis and development of tumors, especially as potential biomarkers. Their different expression profiles in basal and luminal subtypes provide clues for the molecular mechanism of basal and luminal subtypes and the discovery of new biomarkers. Herein, we stratified MIBC patients into basal and luminal subtypes using a MIBC classifier based on transcriptome expression profiles. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the lipids and metabolites of basal and luminal MIBC subtypes and identified their differential lipid and metabolite profiles. Our results suggest that free fatty acids (FFAs) and sulfatides (SLs), which are closely associated with immune and stromal cell types, can contribute to the diagnosis of basal and luminal subtypes of MIBC. Moreover, we showed that glycerophosphocholine (GCP)/imidazoles and nucleosides/imidazoles ratios can accurately distinguish the basal and luminal tumors. Overall, by integrating transcriptomic, lipidomic, and metabolomic data, our study reveals specific biomarkers to differentially diagnose basal and luminal MIBC subtypes and may provide a basis for precision therapy of MIBC.","Feng, Chao; Pan, Lixin; Tang, Shaomei; He, Liangyu; Wang, Xi; Tao, Yuting; Xie, Yuanliang; Lai, Zhiyong; Tang, Zhong; Wang, Qiuyan; Li, Tianyu",Front Genet,618,10

Therefore, this study explores intimate partner violence (IPV) prevalence among Bahraini women, predictors of IPV, and reliability of the Women Abuse Screening Tool (WAST) questionnaire in IPV against women. METHODS: The current prospective cross-sectional study included 810 Bahraini women meeting the inclusion criteria, who were asked to share any IPV experience witnessed during their marriage. A questionnaire comprising of 25 questions, including those of WAST-short and WAST-long, was used. The reliability of the screening tools was determined using Cronbach's alpha test. RESULTS: The prevalence of IPV among Bahraini was found to be 71.11%. During pregnancy, husbands' violent behavior towards family members, relatives or friends; escalation of violence; substance abuse; general antisocial behavior; criminality and mental health issues were significantly associated with IPV (P < 0.001). Relationship problems with the husband, individual behavior of women supporting violence, and history of violence from other family members were significantly associated with abuse (P < 0.05). WAST-short was shown to have a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 18.8%. Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the full questionnaire, WAST-short and WAST-long were 0.82, 0.76, and 0.84, respectively.

The window Reynolds number (Re(w)) was specified to characterize the indoor flow and dispersion. The indicators of RRC (ratio of relative change) or DR (K_DR) (difference ratio of dimensionless concentration) ≤ 5% were applied to quantitatively determine the critical Re(w) for indoor flow and turbulent diffusion. The results show that the critical Re (Re(crit)) value is position-dependent, and Re(crit) at the most unfavorable position should be suggested as the optimal value within the whole areas of interest. Thus Re(H,crit) = 27,000 is recommended for the outdoor flows; while Re(w,crit) = 15,000 is determined for the indoor flows due to the lower part below the window showing the most unfavorable. The suggested Re(w,crit) (=15,000) for indoor airflow and cross ventilation is independence of the window size. Moreover, taking K_DR ≤ 5% as the indicator, the suggested Re(w,crit) for ensuring indoor pollutant diffusion enter the Re-independence regime should also be 15,000, indicating that indoor passive diffusion is completely determined by the flow structures. The contours of dimensionless velocity (U/U(0)) and concentration (K) against the increasing Re(w) further confirmed this critical value. This study further reveals the Re-independence issues for indoor flow and dispersion to ensure the reliability of the data obtained by reduced-scale numerical or wind-tunnel models.","Cui, Peng-Yi; Chen, Wei-Qiu; Wang, Jia-Qi; Zhang, Jin-Hao; Huang, Yuan-Dong; Tao, Wen-Quan",Build Simul,618,20

Experts warn that future pandemics may emerge more frequently with greater devastating effects on population health and the world economy. Although viruses are unable to propagate on lifeless surfaces, they can retain their infectivity and spread further on contact with these surfaces. The objective of our study is to analyze photoreactive composite films that exert antiviral effects upon illumination. Reactive plasmonic titanium dioxide-based polymeric nanocomposite film was prepared with a thickness of 1–1.5 µm, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) under visible light irradiation (λ ≥ 435 nm). These species are suitable for photooxidation of adsorbed organic molecules (e.g., benzoic acid) on the nanocomposite surface. Moreover, high molecular weight proteins are also degraded or partially oxidized in this process on the composite surface. Since the Ag(0)-TiO(2)/polymer composite film used showed excellent reactivity in the formation of OH• radicals, the photocatalytic effect on high molecular weight (M = ∼66.000 Da) bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein was investigated. Given that changes in the structure of the protein were observed upon exposure to light, we assumed virucidal effect of the illuminated photoreactive composite film. We tested this hypothesis using an airborne-transmitted herpesvirus. As a result, we obtained a drastic decrease in infection capability of the virus on the photoreactive surface compared to the control surface.","Boldogkői, Zsolt; Csabai, Zsolt; Tombácz, Dóra; Janovák, László; Balassa, Lilla; Deák, Ágota; Tóth, Péter S.; Janáky, Csaba; Duda, Ernő; Dékány, Imre",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,618,22

However, social isolation measures have deeply changed their lifestyle, which is believed to have a psychological impact on them. The objective was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the emotional health of children and adolescents attending primary or secondary school. POPULATION AND METHODS Parents of children and adolescents from San Carlos de Bariloche participated in the study. Adults' perception of the emotional and behavioral impact of lockdown on children and adolescents, changes in sleeping habits, screen use, sports-related activities, eating, and medical consultations, was assessed. RESULTS A total of 267 parents were included. Of them, 96.3 % noticed emotional and behavioral changes. The most common ones were that their children were more bored (76.8 %), more irritable (59.2 %), more reluctant (56.9 %), and angrier (54.7 %). It was observed that they woke up and went to bed later, and slept 30 minutes more. Moreover, leisure screen use increased by 3 hours on weekdays. Time dedicated to physical activities did not change, but the type of activities did: swimming and team sports were replaced by biking, walking, and skiing. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 lockdown affected the emotional health and habits of children and adolescents. Boredom, irritability, and reluctance were more present during lockdown. The possibility of doing outdoor physical activities allowed them to keep practicing sports.","Schnaiderman, Diego; Bailac, Mariana; Borak, Laura; Comar, Haydeé; Eisner, Ana; Ferrari, Alejandra; Giannini, Gabriela; Risso, Fernando; Vetere, Carolina; Garibotti, Gilda",Archivos argentinos de pediatria,618,1

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our data from 175 patients who underwent various urological LESS procedures via the same ergonomic and geometric principles between 2008 and 2011. LESS procedures performed included adrenalectomy (N = 23), radical nephrectomy (N = 5), radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff resection (N = 5), varicocelectomy (N = 12), nephropexy (N = 4), lumbar sympathectomy (N = 4), orchiectomy for intra-abdominal testis (N = 1), pyeloureterostomy (N = 1), dismembered pyeloplasty (N = 1), and adult inguinal hernia mesh repair (N = 119). RESULTS All procedures were completed successfully without the use of ancillary ports or articulating instruments except two cases that required laparoscopic conversion. The mean patient age was 48.9 years. Mean operative time was 99.7 min, mean estimated blood loss was 17.3 ml, and mean hospital stay was 2.1 days. There were no intraoperative complications. CONCLUSION According to our ergonomic and geometric principles, use of conventional laparoscopic instruments is feasible and safe in LESS procedures.","Tsai, Yao-Chou; Lin, Victor Chia-Hsiang; Chung, Shiu-Dong; Ho, Chen-Hsun; Jaw, Fu-Shan; Tai, Huai-Ching",Surgical endoscopy,618,1

This study examines current trends in students pursuing a dual doctor of medicine (MD)-master of public health (MPH) degree (MD-MPH) in the United States. METHODS We conducted an extensive literature review of existing MD-MPH databases to determine characteristics (eg, sex, race/ethnicity, MPH area of study) of this student cohort in 2019. We examined a trend in the MD community to pursue an MPH career, adding additional public health and health care policy training to the MD workforce. We conducted targeted telephone interviews with 20 admissions personnel and faculty at schools offering MD-MPH degrees in the United States with the highest number of matriculants and graduates. Interviews focused on curricula trends in medical schools that offer an MD-MPH degree. RESULTS No literature describes the US MD-MPH cohort, and available MD-MPH databases are limited and incomplete. We found a 434% increase in the number of students pursuing an MD-MPH degree from 2010 to 2018. The rate of growth was greater than the increase in either the number of medical students (16%) or the number of MPH students (65%) alone. Moreover, MD-MPH students as a percentage of total MPH students more than tripled, from 1.1% in 2010 to 3.6% in 2018. CONCLUSIONS As more MD students pursue public health training, the impact of an MPH degree on medical school curricula, MD-MPH graduates, and MD-MPH career pursuits should be studied using accurate and comprehensive databases.","Reilly, Jo Marie; Plepys, Christine M; Cousineau, Michael R",Public health reports,618,5

Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides bind their receptors in T cells, and induce multiple beneficial T cell functions. Yet, T cells of different people vary in the expression levels of Neurotransmitter and Neuropeptide receptors, and in the magnitude of the corresponding effects. Therefore, we performed an individual-based study on T cells of 3 healthy subjects, and 3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC usually develops due to chronic inflammation. The inflamed liver induces reduction and inhibition of CD4+ T cells and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Immune-based therapies for HCC are urgently needed. We tested if selected Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides decrease the key checkpoint protein PD-1 in human T cells, and increase proliferation and killing of HCC cells. First, we confirmed human T cells express all dopamine receptors (DRs), and glutamate receptors (GluRs): AMPA-GluR3, NMDA-R and mGluR. Second, we discovered that either Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and/or CGRP (10nM), as well as DR and GluR agonists, induced the following effects: 1. Decreased significantly both %PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression level per cell (up to 60% decrease, within 1 h only); 2. Increased significantly the number of T cells that proliferated in the presence of HCC cells (up to 7 fold increase), 3. Increased significantly T cell killing of HCC cells (up to 2 fold increase). 4. Few non-conventional combinations of Neurotransmitters and Neuropeptides had surprising synergistic beneficial effects. We conclude that Dopamine, Glutamate, GnRH-II, Neuropeptide Y and CGRP, alone or in combinations, can decrease % PD-1+ T cells and PD-1 expression per cell, in T cells of both healthy subjects and HCC patients, and increase their proliferation in response to HCC cells and killing of HCC cells. Yet, testing T cells of many more cancer patients is absolutely needed. Based on these findings and previous ones, we designed a novel ""Personalized Adoptive Neuro-Immunotherapy"", calling for validation of safety and efficacy in clinical trials.","Levite, Mia; Safadi, Rifaat; Milgrom, Yael; Massarwa, Muhammad; Galun, Eithan",Neuropeptides,618,19

In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of COVID-19 taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling COVID-19, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission.

The planes where the main vascular structures run are marked on the liver surface. Parenchymal transection is performed and each vessel recognized during LUS exploration is divided. RESULTS From 01/2009 to 10/2013, in 61 out of 742 liver resections (8.2 %), a laparoscopic approach was attempted. The conversion rate was 9.8 % (six patients). No conversion was related to bleeding or intraoperative complications. The remnant 55 patients were affected by benign lesions in 11 cases and malignant tumors in 44. The resections included 3 left hepatectomies, 14 bisegmentectomies Sg2-3, 5 segmentectomies, and 38 wedge resections. Associated procedures were performed in eight patients (14.5 %), including four colorectal resections. Median duration of surgery was 150 min (60-345 min). Median operative blood loss was 100 mL (0-500 mL). Median size of resected tumor was 2.5 cm (0.9-8 cm). Median surgical margin in oncological resections was 7 mm (0-50 mm). Postoperative complications occurred in four patients (7.2 %), all grade 2 according to Dindo classification. No liver-related morbidity occurred. Median length of hospital stay was 5 days (3-9 days).

At present, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic. What are the clinical features of this disease? What is the clinical diagnosis and how should such patients be treated? As a clinician, mastery of the clinical characteristics, basic diagnosis, and treatment methods of COVID-19 are required to provide help to patients. CASE SUMMARY A 42-year-old male patient with a cough lasting 6 d without obvious cause, as well as fever and fatigue for 1 d, was admitted to Hankou Hospital on January 22, 2020 and transferred to Huoshenshan Hospital on February 4. The main clinical symptoms were dry cough, fatigue, and fever. He was diagnosed with COVID-19. From the 4th d of admission, the patient's condition gradually worsened, with increased respiratory rate and body temperature. Peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased progressively. On the 8th d of admission, the patient's highest temperature was 40.7 °C, and oxygen saturation was 83% despite high-flow oxygen inhalation. Chest computed tomography results showed that the virus progressed rapidly. The number of lesions significantly increased with expanded scope and increased density. The distribution of lesions advanced from peripheral to central. In addition to nasal catheter oxygen inhalation and symptomatic support, antiviral drugs were used throughout the treatment. On January 22, oseltamivir phosphate capsules were given orally (75 mg, twice daily) for 6 d. On January 24, three tablets of lopinavir and ritonavir were added orally (twice daily). After 6 d, this was changed to 0.2 g (two tablets) arbidol, taken orally (three times daily) for 5 d. During the severe stage, methylprednisolone was given (40 mg) once every 12 h, immunoglobulin (20 g) was administered by intravenous drip infusion once daily, and thymosin (1.6 mg) was injected subcutaneously once daily combined with immunotherapy. On February 2, symptoms decreased, various indicators improved, and pulmonary inflammation was obviously reduced. Throat swabs on February 4 and 9 were negative for novel coronavirus nucleic acid. After 19 d in the hospital, the patient was successfully treated and discharged. CONCLUSION COVID-19 in young adults can be successfully treated with active treatment.

The IFN-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases (OASs) and ribonuclease (RNase) L are components of a potent host antiviral pathway. We previously showed that murine coronavirus (MHV) accessory protein ns2, a 2H phosphoesterase superfamily member, is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves 2-5A, thereby preventing activation of RNase L. The PDE activity of ns2 is required for MHV replication in macrophages and for hepatitis. Here, we show that group A rotavirus (RVA), an important cause of acute gastroenteritis in children worldwide, encodes a similar PDE. The RVA PDE forms the carboxy-terminal domain of the minor core protein VP3 (VP3-CTD) and shares sequence and predicted structural homology with ns2, including two catalytic HxT/S motifs. Bacterially expressed VP3-CTD exhibited 2',5'-PDE activity, which cleaved 2-5A in vitro. In addition, VP3-CTD expressed transiently in mammalian cells depleted 2-5A levels induced by OAS activation with poly(rI):poly(rC), preventing RNase L activation. In the context of recombinant chimeric MHV expressing inactive ns2, VP3-CTD restored the ability of the virus to replicate efficiently in macrophages or in the livers of infected mice, whereas mutant viruses expressing inactive VP3-CTD (H718A or H798R) were attenuated. In addition, chimeric viruses expressing either active ns2 or VP3-CTD, but not nonfunctional equivalents, were able to protect ribosomal RNA from RNase L-mediated degradation. Thus, VP3-CTD is a 2',5'-PDE able to functionally substitute for ns2 in MHV infection. Remarkably, therefore, two disparate RNA viruses encode proteins with homologous 2',5'-PDEs that antagonize activation of innate immunity.","Zhang, Rong; Jha, Babal K; Ogden, Kristen M; Dong, Beihua; Zhao, Ling; Elliott, Ruth; Patton, John T; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,618,1

Although migraine as such seems an ideal option for telemedicine, a systematic study reviewing feasibility, efficacy, and advantages of current advanced telecommunication technologies in children with migraine is lacking. METHODS Clinical details of telephonic consultations performed between March 25 and June 4, 2020, including migraine characteristics, analgesic/prophylactic drug regimens, headache frequency/severity/disability, compliance, drug-related/unrelated adverse effects and unavailability of drugs were recorded. Suitable change in the dose/commercial brand of drug regimen and the addition of new drugs were done as required. Voice call, text messages, picture/video messages, and all other possible measures were used to accumulate maximum clinical information in real time. Unless contacted for trivial reasons, most children were later followed up telephonically to ensure health care concern was resolved and to fill up one 6-item trichotomous quality control questionnaire. RESULTS A total of 146 telephone consultations were performed in 51 participants. Thirty-six patients were identified to have 42 significant clinical events (worsening clinical status/partial response to medications [18; 44%], drug-related adverse effects [10; 19%], unrelated systemic complaints [7; 13%], and worsening of headache due to stress/triggers [7; 13%]). In the rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included concern regarding COVID-19-related symptoms. Twenty-nine children required increment in drug dose or addition of new drug or commercial brand. Around 90% of caregivers were satisfied with the quality of teleconsultation.

We compared human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) incidence and residual risk before and after this policy change using data from >50% of the US blood supply. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Three estimation intervals from the Transfusion-Transmissible Infections Monitoring System were compared: 15-months pre- and two consecutive, nonoverlapping 15-month post-MSM deferral implementation. Repeat, first-time, and weighted all-donor incidences were estimated. Residual risk was calculated for all incidence estimates using the incidence/window-period method. RESULTS HIV repeat donor incidence was 1.57 per 100 000 person-years (phtpy) in the second 15-month post change and not significantly different from pre-MSM incidence of 2.19 phtpy. Similar values were seen for HCV (1.49 phtpy vs 1.46 phtpy) and HBV (1.14 phtpy vs 0.97 phtpy). In some cases, higher estimated incidence, but without significant change from pre-MSM to the second post change period occurred for males and first-time donors (eg, first-time donors, second post change period: 6.12 phtpy HIV, 6.41 phtpy HCV and 5.34 phtpy HBV). Estimated per donation residual risk was 1:1.6 million for HIV, 1:2.0 million for HCV and 1:1.0 million for HBV based on weighted incidence for all donors. CONCLUSIONS Repeat, first-time, and overall donor incidence did not vary significantly comparing pre-MSM to either of the post-MSM estimation intervals. Residual risk estimates vary by study, but all yield residual risks in the United States of ≤1 per million, and thus far have not shown increasing risk with the 12-month MSM policy change.","Steele, Whitney R; Dodd, Roger Y; Notari, Edward P; Haynes, James; Anderson, Steven A; Williams, Alan E; Reik, Rita; Kessler, Debra; Custer, Brian; Stramer, Susan L",Transfusion,618,28

The potential interactome of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) N protein was mapped using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) coupled to a green fluorescent protein-nanotrap pulldown methodology and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The addition of the SILAC label allowed discrimination of proteins that were likely to specifically bind to the N protein over background binding. Overall, 142 cellular proteins were selected as potentially binding to the N protein, many as part of larger possible complexes. These included ribosomal proteins, nucleolar proteins, translation initiation factors, helicases, and hnRNPs. The association of selected cellular proteins with IBV N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting, cosedimentation, and confocal microscopy. Further, the localization of selected proteins in IBV-infected cells as well as their activity during virus infection was assessed by small interfering RNA-mediated depletion, demonstrating the functional importance of cellular proteins in the biology of IBV. This interactome not only confirms previous observations made with other coronavirus and IBV N proteins with both overexpressed proteins and infectious virus but also provides novel data that can be exploited to understand the interaction between the virus and the host cell.","Emmott, Edward; Munday, Diane; Bickerton, Erica; Britton, Paul; Rodgers, Mark A; Whitehouse, Adrian; Zhou, En-Min; Hiscox, Julian A",Journal of virology,618,16

The benefits of the polymer in a clinically relevant injury model remain unknown. We hypothesized that potassium-binding cartridges would control serum potassium concentration in a porcine hemorrhagic shock model with supraceliac aortic occlusion and a limb crush injury. METHODS Ten Yorkshire-cross swine were anesthetized and instrumented. Pigs underwent splenectomy and bilateral nephrectomy. Hemorrhagic shock was induced for 30 minutes while a leg compression device was applied. Pigs underwent supraceliac aortic occlusion for 60 minutes and were resuscitated with shed blood. The leg compression device was removed 20 minutes after balloon deflation. After 20 minutes of reperfusion, animals were randomized to extracorporeal circulation with (treatment) or without (control) the potassium binding cartridges. In both groups, blood was circulated through a hemodialyzer with a peristaltic pump. In the treatment group, the ultrafiltrate was diverted from the hemodialyzer through cartridges containing the polymer and returned to the extracorporeal circuit. Animals were resuscitated with 0.9% saline boluses and a norepinephrine infusion. The change in serum potassium concentration (ΔK) was calculated as serum [K]T390 - serum [K]T0. RESULTS There was a significant difference in serum potassium concentration between groups (p < 0.001). ΔK was significantly higher in the control than the treatment group (3.75 [3.27-4.42] and 1.15 [0.62-1.59] mmol/L, respectively; p = 0.03). There were no differences in mean arterial pressure (p = 0.14), isotonic crystalloids requirement (p = 0.51), or norepinephrine dose (p = 0.83) between groups. Serum lactate concentration was significantly higher in the control group (p < 0.001). At the end of the experiment, the [K] was reduced by 25% (24.9%-27.8%) across the cartridges. CONCLUSION The cartridges controlled serum potassium concentrations without dialysate and retained potassium binding capabilities over 4 hours. There were no deleterious effects on hemodynamic parameters. Those cartridges might be beneficial adjuncts for hyperkalemia management in austere environments.

METHODS The OTG cohort contained 35 cases, which were performed from April 2003 to October 2005. The LATG cohort contained 46 cases, which were performed from November 2005 to November 2008. Postoperative changes over time in various parameters relating to minimal invasiveness were evaluated. We used the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale to evaluate pain. Vital signs and a face scale were analyzed using daily maximum values on postoperative days (POD) 1-7. A hematological examination was performed on the preoperative day and POD 1, 4, 7, and 10. The number of days until oxygen saturation level (SaO2) was 95% or more in room air was used to evaluate respiratory function. RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were obtained in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, 5, and 7. There was a significantly lower body temperature in the LATG group on POD 7. A significantly lower white blood cell count was revealed for LATG patients on POD 10, and for C-reactive protein on POD 1. Significantly higher serum total protein values were observed in the LATG group on POD 1, 4, and 7. Significantly lower blood sugar level was found in the LATG group on POD 4 and 7. The number of days until SaO2 was 95% or more in room air was significantly fewer in the LATG group.

Methods to detect fibrinolysis abnormalities are less simple and poorly standardized compared with common coagulation tests. Fibrinolysis can be accelerated by preparing euglobulin from plasma to reduce endogenous inhibitors, or by adding plasminogen activators to normal plasma. However, these manipulations complicate interpretation of results and diagnosis of a ""fibrinolysis deficit."" Many observational studies on antigen levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, zymogen or active enzyme have been published. However, conclusions are mixed and there are clear problems with harmonization of results. Viscoelastic methods have the advantage of being rapid and are used as point-of-care tests. They also work with whole blood, allowing the contribution of platelets to be explored. However, there are no agreed protocols for applying viscoelastic methods in acute care for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis or to direct therapy. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the dangers of associated coagulopathy provide new challenges. A common finding in hospitalized patients is high levels of D-dimer fibrin breakdown products, indicative of ongoing fibrinolysis. Well-established problems with D-dimer testing standardization signal that we should be cautious in using results from such tests as prognostic indicators or to target therapies.","Longstaff, Colin",Hamostaseologie,618,22

We studied a novel 'add-on' cuff, which can be inserted over an existing tracheal tube and advanced into the subglottic region. The physical properties of the novel silicone cuff (BronchoGuard, Ciel Medical, USA) were evaluated in comparison with the Hi-Lo® tracheal tube. In a bench study, we identified saline inflation volumes required to transmit pressures between 15 and 30 cmH2 O against artificial tracheas of 18, 20 and 22 mm internal diameter. We computed cuff compliance, and minimal inflation volume to achieve air sealing during mechanical ventilation. Finally, we compared the leakage flow rate of artificial saliva across the novel cuff. On average, the mean (SD) inflation volumes necessary to transmit tracheal pressures of 15, 20, 25 and 30 cmH2 O were 4.1 (2.2), 4.4 (2.3), 4.6 (2.4) and 4.8 (2.4) ml for the novel cuff and 7.7 (2.5), 8.0 (2.6), 8.4 (2.6) and 8.7 (2.7) ml for the Hi-Lo tube, respectively (p < 0.001). The minimal inflation volumes to achieve air sealing were 3.8 (0.9) and 10.5 (2.1) ml (p < 0.001), which resulted in transmitted tracheal pressures of 8.3 (9.8) and 27.6 (34.8) cmH2 O (p < 0.001). Compliance was 0.026 (0.004) and 0.616 (0.324) ml.cmH2 0-1 , respectively (p < 0.001). Although massive leak was found when the novel cuff transmitted pressures ≤ 20 cmH2 O against the trachea, leakage was avoided with pressures ≥ 25 cmH2 O, owing to optimal contact between the cuff and the tracheal wall. In contrast, the standard cuff consistently leaked irrespective of the pressure. We conclude that the novel cuff has advantageous properties that warrant clinical corroboration.","Li Bassi, G; Chiurazzi, C; Aguilera, E; Travierso, C; Battaglini, D; Yang, M; Motos, A; Yang, H; Meli, A; Marti, D; Ranzani, O T; Blasi, F; Pelosi, P; Chiumello, D; Torres, A",Anaesthesia,618,31

However, RCTs are not always scientifically necessary and therefore not always ethical. Unfortunately, it is not clear when an RCT is not necessary or how this should be established. This study seeks to systematically catalogue justifications offered throughout the medical and ethics literature for performing randomisation within clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will systematically search electronic databases of the medical literature including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Web of Science Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov; databases of philosophical literature including Philosopher's Index, Phil Papers, JSTOR, Periodicals Archive Online, Project MUSE, National Reference Centre for Bioethics; the library catalogue at the University of Ottawa; bibliographies of retrieved papers; and the grey literature. We will also pursue suggestions from experts in the fields of medical ethics, philosophy and clinical trial methodology. Article screening, selection and data extraction will be performed by two independent reviewers based on prespecified inclusion/exclusion criteria. A third reviewer will be consulted to resolve any discrepancies. We will then extract the reasons given to justify randomisation using methodology established to extract data in a defensible, systematic manner. We will track the reasons given, their frequency of use and changes over time. Finally, using grounded theory, we will combine the reasons into broader themes. These themes will form the foundation of our subsequent analysis from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. This review will map existing arguments that clinicians, ethicists and philosophers use to ethically justify randomisation in clinical trials. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No research ethics board approval is necessary because we are not examining patient-level data. This protocol complies with the reported guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews. The findings of this paper will be disseminated via presentations and academic publication. In a subsequent phase of this research, we hope to engage with stakeholders and translate any recommendations derived from our findings into operational guidelines.","Dewar, Brian; Fedyk, Mark; Jurkovic, Lucas; Chevrier, Stephanie; Rodriguez, Rosendo; Kitto, Simon C; Saginur, Raphael; Shamy, Michel",BMJ open,618,17

Donanemab, an antibody that targets a modified form of deposited Aβ, is being investigated for the treatment of early Alzheimer's disease. METHODS We conducted a phase 2 trial of donanemab in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease who had tau and amyloid deposition on positron-emission tomography (PET). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive donanemab (700 mg for the first three doses and 1400 mg thereafter) or placebo intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 72 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS; range, 0 to 144, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive and functional impairment) at 76 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), the 13-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog13), the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-iADL), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), as well as the change in the amyloid and tau burden on PET. RESULTS A total of 257 patients were enrolled; 131 were assigned to receive donanemab and 126 to receive placebo. The baseline iADRS score was 106 in both groups. The change from baseline in the iADRS score at 76 weeks was -6.86 with donanemab and -10.06 with placebo (difference, 3.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.12 to 6.27; P = 0.04). The results for most secondary outcomes showed no substantial difference. At 76 weeks, the reductions in the amyloid plaque level and the global tau load were 85.06 centiloids and 0.01 greater, respectively, with donanemab than with placebo. Amyloid-related cerebral edema or effusions (mostly asymptomatic) occurred with donanemab. CONCLUSIONS In patients with early Alzheimer's disease, donanemab resulted in a better composite score for cognition and for the ability to perform activities of daily living than placebo at 76 weeks, although results for secondary outcomes were mixed. Longer and larger trials are necessary to study the efficacy and safety of donanemab in Alzheimer's disease.

Unfortunately, tendons have limited regenerative potential and as a result, repair may be protracted months to years. Current treatment strategies do not offer localized delivery of biologically active proteins, which may result in reduced therapeutic efficacy. Surgical sutures coated with nanostructured minerals may provide a potentially universal tool to efficiently incorporate and deliver biologically active proteins directly to the wound. Additionally, previous reports indicated that treatment with bone morphogenetic protein-12 (BMP-12) improved tendon healing. Based on this information, we hypothesized that mineral-coated surgical sutures may be an effective platform for localized BMP-12 delivery to an injured tendon. The objective of this study was, therefore, to elucidate the healing effects of mineral-coated sutures releasing BMP-12 using a rat Achilles healing model. The effects of BMP-12-releasing sutures were also compared with standard BMP-12 delivery methods, including delivery of BMP-12 through collagen sponge or direct injection. Rat Achilles tendons were unilaterally transected and repaired using BMP-12-releasing suture (0, 0.15, 1.5, or 3.0 μg), collagen sponge (0 or 1.5 μg BMP-12), or direct injection (0 or 1.5 μg). By 14 days postinjury, repair with BMP-12-releasing sutures reduced the appearance of adhesions to the tendon and decreased total cell numbers. BMP-12 released from sutures and collagen sponge also tended to improve collagen organization when compared with BMP-12 delivered through injection. Based on these results, the release of a protein from sutures was able to elicit a biological response. Furthermore, BMP-12-releasing sutures modulated tendon healing, and the delivery method dictated the response of the healing tissue to BMP-12.","Chamberlain, Connie S; Lee, Jae-Sung; Leiferman, Ellen M; Maassen, Nicholas X; Baer, Geoffrey S; Vanderby, Ray; Murphy, William L",Tissue engineering.

Here, we describe the impact of the constitutive loss of cDCs on the progression of AD-like inflammation by using binary transgenic (Tg) mice that constitutively lacked CD11chi cDCs. Unexpectedly, the congenital deficiency of cDCs not only exacerbates the pathogenesis of AD-like inflammation but also elicits immune abnormalities with the increased composition and function of granulocytes and group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) as well as B cells possibly mediated through the breakdown of the Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L)-mediated homeostatic feedback loop.

We aimed to identify nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles and link these profiles to acute severity in infants hospitalised for bronchiolitis.We conducted a multicentre prospective cohort study of 1005 infants (age <1 year) hospitalised for bronchiolitis over three winters, 2011-2014. By applying a 16S rRNA gene sequence and clustering approach to the nasopharyngeal aspirates collected within 24 h of hospitalisation, we determined nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles and their association with bronchiolitis severity. The primary outcome was intensive care use, i.e. admission to an intensive care unit or use of mechanical ventilation.We identified four nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles: three profiles were dominated by one of Haemophilus, Moraxella or Streptococcus, while the fourth profile had the highest bacterial richness. The rate of intensive care use was highest in infants with a Haemophilus-dominant profile and lowest in those with a Moraxella-dominant profile (20.2% versus 12.3%; unadjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.07-3.11, p=0.03). After adjusting for 11 patient-level confounders, the rate remained significantly higher in infants with Haemophilus-dominant profiles (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.08-3.62, p=0.03). These findings were externally validated in a separate cohort of 307 children hospitalised for bronchiolitis.","Hasegawa, Kohei; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Ajami, Nadim J; Espinola, Janice A; Henke, David M; Petrosino, Joseph F; Piedra, Pedro A; Shaw, Chad A; Sullivan, Ashley F; Camargo, Carlos A",The European respiratory journal,618,4

The purpose of this study was to perform a subgroup analysis of angiographic and clinical outcomes of medium-sized aneurysms in the HELPS trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with medium-sized aneurysms (5-9.9 mm) were selected from the HELPS trial. Outcomes compared between the HydroCoil and bare-platinum groups included the following: 1) any recurrence, 2) major recurrence, 3) retreatment, and 4) mRS score of ≤2. Subgroup analysis by rupture status was performed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for aneurysm neck size, shape, use of adjunctive device, and rupture status was performed. RESULTS Two hundred eighty-eight patients with medium-sized aneurysms were randomized (144 in each group). At 15-18 months posttreatment, the major recurrence rate was significantly lower in the HydroCoil group than in controls (18.6% versus 30.8%, P = .03, respectively). For patients with recently ruptured aneurysms, the major recurrence rate was significantly lower for the HydroCoil group than for controls (20.3% versus 47.5%, P = .003), while rates were similar between groups for unruptured aneurysms (16.7% versus 14.8%, P = .80). Multivariate analysis of patients with recently ruptured aneurysms demonstrated a lower odds of major recurrence with HydroCoils (OR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.12-0.58; P = .0007). No difference in retreatment rates or mRS of ≤2 was seen between groups. CONCLUSIONS HydroCoils were associated with statistically significant and clinically relevant lower rates of major recurrence for recently ruptured, medium-sized aneurysms in the HELPS trial. Because this was not a prespecified subgroup analysis, these results should not alter clinical practice but, rather, provide insight into the design of future clinical trials comparing bare platinum with second-generation coils.","Brinjikji, W; White, P M; Nahser, H; Wardlaw, J; Sellar, R; Cloft, H J; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

Endoscopic therapy is the first option for PD while surgery is indicated for the advanced stages of the disease (Spiegelman III-IV). Pancreas-sparing duodenectomy (PSD) was proposed as a less aggressive alternative to pancreatoduodenectomy (PD), leaving the entire pancreas in situ while the number of anastomoses is reduced. Open PSD with Billroth or pillorus preserving reconstruction is the general used. The use of a Roux limb is very limited in literature, as it increases the procedure complexity, the number of anastomosis and it may reduce the endoscopic access for the postoperative surveillance after total duodenectomy. We aim to describe the technique for Laparoscopic Pancreas Sparing Total Duodenectomy (LPSTD) with Roux-en-Y reconstruction and to present the procedure's outcomes in a patient presenting Spigelman IV duodenal polyposis associated with FAP after open total colectomy. Method: Laparoscopic Pancreas Sparing Total Duodenectomy (LPSTD) with antrectomy cholecystectomy and Roux en Y reconstruction was performed in a 39-year-old man with a history of FAP, open colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis and duodenal polyps. The preoperative investigations and the surgical steps of the laparoscopic approach are described in details. Results: The operative time was 280 minutes. Two postoperative complications were encountered, a self-limited pancreatico-jejunal anastomosis hemorrhage occurred in POD 1 and necrosis of the cystic duct stump with bile peritonitis (POD7). Both of them required laparoscopic exploration. Oral feeding was introduced in the POD 2. The patient has been discharged in the POD 14. No other complications like delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic or biliary fistula at the site of PJA or ulcer were encountered. The 6 months postoperative evaluation, including the CT scan and the endos-copic retrograde inspection of the neo-papilla revealed no recurrence on the jejunum. Conclusions: Although it is a complex technique, LPSTD represents a good alternative to PD for patients with FAP and large, periampullary villous adenoma especially those with high grade dysplasia. The use of laparoscopy and of Roux en Y reconstruction may reduce the postoperative morbidity rate in PSD.","Copaescu, Catalin; Smeu, Bogdan; Constantin, Alina; Saftoiu, Adrian",Chirurgia,618,31

Patients received preprocedural dual antiplatelet medications and intraprocedural heparinization. Point-of-care platelet reactivity testing was performed before the procedure, and nonresponders (>213 P2Y12/ADP receptor reactivity units) received additional thienopyridine. Transcranial Doppler sonography was performed within 12-24 hours. Microemboli were detected in 3 patients (13%), 2 of whom were initially nonresponders. There was no association between the presence of microemboli and procedural or neurologic complications, aneurysm size, number of stents, or procedure time. Eight procedures (34.8%) required additional thienopyridine for inadequate platelet inhibition, and 3 required further treatment for persistent nonresponse to point-of-care platelet reactivity testing. There were 6 technical and 2 postoperative complications; none were associated with inadequate platelet inhibition or microemboli. The combination of routine point-of-care platelet reactivity testing and postprocedural microembolic monitoring may help identify patients at risk for thromboembolic complications after flow-diverting stents.","Levitt, M R; Ghodke, B V; Hallam, D K; Sekhar, L N; Kim, L J",AJNR.

Pathological examination revealed the accumulation of mucoid material within the airways and lungs in association with enlargement of the entire lung. We performed a full necropsy and histological examination on 12 affected green tree pythons from 7 different breeders to characterize the pathogenesis of this mucinous pneumonia. By histology we could show a marked hyperplasia of the airway epithelium and of faveolar type II pneumocytes. Since routine microbiological tests failed to identify a causative agent, we studied lung tissue samples from a few diseased snakes by next-generation sequencing (NGS). From the NGS data we could assemble a piece of RNA genome whose sequence was <85% identical to that of nidoviruses previously identified in ball pythons and Indian pythons. We then employed reverse transcription-PCR to demonstrate the presence of the novel nidovirus in all diseased snakes. To attempt virus isolation, we established primary cultures of Morelia viridis liver and brain cells, which we inoculated with homogenates of lung tissue from infected individuals. Ultrastructural examination of concentrated cell culture supernatants showed the presence of nidovirus particles, and subsequent NGS analysis yielded the full genome of the novel virus Morelia viridis nidovirus (MVNV). We then generated an antibody against MVNV nucleoprotein, which we used alongside RNA in situ hybridization to demonstrate viral antigen and RNA in the affected lungs. This suggests that in natural infection MVNV damages the respiratory tract epithelium, which then results in epithelial hyperplasia, most likely as an exaggerated regenerative attempt in association with increased epithelial turnover.IMPORTANCE Novel nidoviruses associated with severe respiratory disease were fairly recently identified in ball pythons and Indian pythons. Herein we report on the isolation and identification of a further nidovirus from green tree pythons (Morelia viridis) with fatal pneumonia. We thoroughly characterized the pathological changes in the infected individuals and show that nidovirus infection is associated with marked epithelial proliferation in the respiratory tract. We speculate that this and the associated excess mucus production can lead to the animals' death by inhibiting normal gas exchange in the lungs. The virus was predominantly detected in the respiratory tract, which renders transmission via the respiratory route likely. Nidoviruses cause sudden outbreaks with high rates of mortality in breeding collections, and most affected snakes die without prior clinical signs. These findings, together with those of other groups, indicate that nidoviruses are a likely cause of severe pneumonia in pythons.","Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Laimbacher, Andrea; Romero-Palomo, Fernando; Jelinek, Christine; Keller, Saskia; Smura, Teemu; Hepojoki, Satu; Kipar, Anja; Hetzel, Udo",Journal of virology,618,25

Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) strains can be classified into two major genetic groups, P1 type 1 (P1-1) and P1 type 2 (P1-2). It remains unknown if clinical manifestations of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children differ between the two genotypes. We aimed to determine if M. pneumoniae P1 genotype is associated with severity of LRTI in children. Methods. Medical charts of 420 children (≤ 15 years-old) with signs of acute LRTI who were PCR-positive for M. pneumoniae from pharyngeal swabs in a recent M. pneumoniae epidemic were analyzed. We used a culture and pyrosequencing approach for genotyping PCR-positive samples. We compared epidemiological and clinical data of children with either P1-1 or P1-2 LRTI. Results. P1-2-infected children presented with a significantly higher median baseline C-reactive protein level and were admitted to the hospital more often. P1 genotype had a significant predictive value in a multiple linear regression model predicting C-reactive protein levels in our study sample. Moreover, P1 genotype significantly affected the likelihood of hospital admission in a logistic regression model. Our modelling results were also confirmed on an additional, independent sample of children with M. pneumoniae LRTI. Conclusions. Results from our large patient group indicate that the two M. pneumoniae P1 genotypes may have different pathogenic potential and that LRTI with P1-2 strains may have a more severe disease course than those with P1-1 strains in children. P1 genotyping is not routinely performed, but could be used as a predictor of M. pneumoniae LRTI severity, enabling patient-tailored treatments.","Rodman Berlot, Jasna; Krivec, Uroš; Mrvič, Tatjana; Kogoj, Rok; Keše, Darja",Journal of clinical microbiology,618,29

The challenge in treating rectal cancer is selecting the proper approach for the appropriate patient. In a small number of rectal cancer patients local excision may be the best approach. In an attempt to achieve two goals-cure of disease with a low rate of local failure and maintenance of function and quality of life-multiple approaches can be utilized. The key to obtaining a good outcome for any one patient is balancing the competing factors that impact on these goals. Any effective treatment aimed at controlling rectal cancer in the pelvis must take into account the disease in the bowel wall itself and the disease, or potential disease, in the mesorectum. The major downside of local excision techniques is the potential of leaving untreated disease in the mesorectum. Local management techniques avoid the potential morbidity, mortality, and functional consequences of a major abdominal radical resection and are thus quite effective in achieving the maintenance of function and quality of life goal. The issue for the transanal techniques is how they fare in achieving the first goal-cure of the cancer while keeping local recurrence rates to an absolute minimum. Without removing both the rectum and the mesorectum there is no completely accurate way to determine whether a rectal cancer has moved outside the bowel wall, so any decision on local management of a rectal neoplasm is a calculated risk. For benign neoplasia, the challenge is removing the lesion without having to resort to a major abdominal procedure.","Touzios, John; Ludwig, Kirk A",Clinics in colon and rectal surgery,618,16

While there are limited data on the management of severe COVID-19 during pregnancy, information on pharmacological treatments of moderate COVID-19 is lacking. We report clinical outcomes of pregnant women hospitalized due to moderate COVID-19 illness treated with a 5-day course of remdesivir, antibiotics, and/or glucocorticoids. MATERIALS AND METHODS Case series of pregnant women hospitalized with moderate symptoms of COVID -19 pneumonia at two INOVA Health System hospitals from April 1 to December 31, 2020. Primary outcome was clinical recovery (breathing on ambient air and/or hospital discharge) on hospital day 7 (HD7). Cox regression analysis was performed to evaluate which variables were associated with the primary outcome. RESULTS Out of 748 pregnant women with confirmed infection by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, 35 were hospitalized due to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia (median gestational age 29 weeks). There was no maternal death. Seventeen patients received remdesivir within 48 hours of hospitalization: 15 remained with moderate symptoms and 2 (who also received glucocorticoids) had progressed to critical COVID-19 at remdesivir initiation; all 17 women in this group achieved clinical recovery on HD7. Seven women received remdesivir >48 hours following admission after they began treatment with glucocorticoids ± antibiotics and worsened to severe or critical disease; they all required supplemental oxygen on HD7. Eleven women were treated with antibiotics ± glucocorticoids but no remdesivir; on HD7, 3/11 achieved clinical recovery. Clinical recovery was significantly different among treatment groups; p < 0.001. When analyzing only women who remained with moderate symptoms at pharmacological treatments initiation, all 15 on remdesivir and only 3 of 11 on antibiotics achieved clinical recovery on HD7; p < 0.001. Delaying remdesivir for >48 hours after admission (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.45-4.16) and >4-day duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.27-3.50) had an inverse association with clinical recovery.

Bacteremia accounts for approximately 15% of all nosocomial infections and affects 1% of all hospitalized patients. AIM To describe the clinical, epidemiological and microbiological characteristic of episodes of nosocomial bacteremia occurring in a Colombian hospital. METHODS Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study including adult patients, hospitalized in the internal medicine unit at the University Hospital of Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, during years 2014 to 2016, who met the criteria of the CDC for bloodstream infection. The protocol was approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee and by the Research Ethics Committee of the Industrial University of Santander. RESULTS We reviewed 450 clinical records with 148 patients and 182 microbiological isolates. 53% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were: high blood pressure (46.6%), HIV infection (29.7%). The vascular and urinary systems were the most frequent anatomical sites as the source of the infection (respectively 37.3% and 38.3%). Case fatality rate was 29%. The pathogens most frequently isolated were: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (globally: 49.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus 12.1%.

The Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations and the NCD Roadmap created at the request of the Pacific Finance and Economic Ministers identify prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases as core priorities. Among the various risk factors responsible for the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), overweight and obesity are particularly of concern with the potential to negate many of the health benefits that have contributed to increased life expectancy. With the increase in childhood obesity across the region, it has become apparent that surveillance data remains a challenge; however, it is essential to inform the development of effective policies and strategies to tackle the challenge of childhood obesity in the Pacific region. RECENT FINDINGS The paper highlights the paucity of childhood obesity surveillance data available in the Pacific region and how the absence of a standardised tool to collect this data makes it difficult to do comparative analysis between countries. Drawing on a global protocol and identifying the gaps that currently exist in the region, the paper aims to highlight opportunities via which childhood obesity surveillance data can be improved to monitor better childhood obesity across the Pacific region.","Ravuvu, Amerita; Waqa, Gade",Current obesity reports,618,1

Factors that influence the heat exchange include the temperature and humidity of the air and the temperature of surfaces in contact with and around the infant. Neonatal thermoregulation has a different pattern as they have an immature thermoregulatory system. For this purpose, mathematical models can provide detailed insights for the heat transfer processes and its applications for clinical purposes. A new multi-compartment mathematical model of the neonatal thermoregulatory system is presented. The formulation of the model is based on the Pennes' bio-heat equation with suitable boundary and initial conditions. The variational finite element method has been employed to determine heat transfer and exchange in the biological tissues of premature infants. The results obtained in this paper have shown that premature infants are unable to maintain a constant core temperature and resemble the empirically obtained results, proving the validity and feasibility of our model.

91243,91243,91243,The Toll of COVID-19.,17.006094,4.923848,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND Free-text descriptions in electronic health records (EHRs) can be of interest for clinical research and care optimization. However, free text cannot be readily interpreted by a computer and, therefore, has limited value. Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can make free text machine-interpretable by attaching ontology concepts to it. However, implementations of NLP algorithms are not evaluated consistently. Therefore, the objective of this study was to review the current methods used for developing and evaluating NLP algorithms that map clinical text fragments onto ontology concepts. To standardize the evaluation of algorithms and reduce heterogeneity between studies, we propose a list of recommendations. METHODS Two reviewers examined publications indexed by Scopus, IEEE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the ACM Digital Library, and the ACL Anthology. Publications reporting on NLP for mapping clinical text from EHRs to ontology concepts were included. Year, country, setting, objective, evaluation and validation methods, NLP algorithms, terminology systems, dataset size and language, performance measures, reference standard, generalizability, operational use, and source code availability were extracted. The studies' objectives were categorized by way of induction. These results were used to define recommendations. RESULTS Two thousand three hundred fifty five unique studies were identified. Two hundred fifty six studies reported on the development of NLP algorithms for mapping free text to ontology concepts. Seventy-seven described development and evaluation. Twenty-two studies did not perform a validation on unseen data and 68 studies did not perform external validation. Of 23 studies that claimed that their algorithm was generalizable, 5 tested this by external validation. A list of sixteen recommendations regarding the usage of NLP systems and algorithms, usage of data, evaluation and validation, presentation of results, and generalizability of results was developed. CONCLUSION We found many heterogeneous approaches to the reporting on the development and evaluation of NLP algorithms that map clinical text to ontology concepts. Over one-fourth of the identified publications did not perform an evaluation. In addition, over one-fourth of the included studies did not perform a validation, and 88% did not perform external validation. We believe that our recommendations, alongside an existing reporting standard, will increase the reproducibility and reusability of future studies and NLP algorithms in medicine.","Kersloot, Martijn G; van Putten, Florentien J P; Abu-Hanna, Ameen; Cornet, Ronald; Arts, Derk L",Journal of biomedical semantics,618,1

Nowadays, Systematic Review is an established method also in the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) field. It is the Cochrane Work Review Group that facilitates authors to produce Cochrane reviews of intervention topics in this area. A variety of guidelines used Cochrane Work reviews for underpinning their recommendations. Due to the comprehensive search and reproducibility of the methods of a systematic review, it turned out that systematic reviews can be powerful in changing beliefs. For example, studies published in the eighties advocated the use of back schools. Nowadays, we know that the total body of evidence has changed the traditional view that training in lifting techniques could prevent back pain. 'Sitting is the new smoking' is an eye catching nicely alliterating motto, but it is of course highly overstated. The findings of a Cochrane review of the effects of interventions to decrease sitting at work showed that sitting time can be reduced by a bit less than two hours per day by providing sit-stand desks plus education. However, it is unclear if this is sufficient to counter the effects of sitting. A wealth of evidence on OSH interventions has been collected by international collaboration in the Cochrane Work Review Group. This can be extended to systematic reviews of the effects of exposure of workers to assess to which risks of adverse health effects they are exposed.","Verbeek, Jos; Mattioli, Stefano; Curti, Stefania",La Medicina del lavoro,618,28

METHODS Systematic review. We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, and Embase, on March 2020. We included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that compared ""Luteal,"" random-start ovarian stimulation or DuoStim with ""Conventional""; we analyzed them by subgroups: oocyte freezing and patients undergoing ART treatments, both, in the general infertile population and among poor responders. RESULTS The following results come from a sensitivity analysis that included only the low/moderate risk of bias studies. When comparing ""Luteal"" to ""Conventional,"" clinically relevant differences in MII oocytes were ruled out in all subgroups. We found that ""Luteal"" probably increases the COH length both, in the general infertile population (OR 2.00 days, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.19, moderate-quality evidence) and in oocyte freezing cycles (MD 0.85 days, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.18, moderate-quality evidence). When analyzing DuoStim among poor responders, we found that it appears to generate a higher number of MII oocytes in comparison with a single ""Conventional"" (MD 3.35, 95%CI 2.54-4.15, moderate-quality evidence). CONCLUSION Overall, this systematic review of the available data demonstrates that in poor responders, general infertile population and oocyte freezing for cancer stimulation in the late follicular and luteal phases can be utilized in non-conventional approaches such as random-start and DuoStim cycles, offering similar outcomes to the conventional cycles but potentially with increased flexibility, within a reduced time frame. However, more well-designed trials are required to establish certainty.","Glujovsky, Demian; Pesce, Romina; Miguens, Mariana; Sueldo, Carlos E; Lattes, Karinna; Ciapponi, Agustín",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,618,4

Our experience and recent publications suggest fat implantation may deliver a long-lasting improvement. This study aims to present the long-term outcomes for vocal fold fat augmentation using strict harvesting, preparing, and implantation protocols. STUDY DESIGN A prospective cohort conducted between 2014 and 2020 (recruitment 2014-2017). SETTING An academic tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Twenty-two patients with glottic insufficiency were enrolled: 11 had unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP), and 11 had atrophy or scar. Harvested fat was injected unilaterally or bilaterally into multiple sites. Six of these patients also had simultaneous microlaryngoscopic removal of other benign glottic lesions. Outcome measurements included video stroboscopy; Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain (GRBAS) score; Voice Handicap Index (VHI); and acoustic analysis, performed preoperatively, 3, 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery. RESULTS Ten augmentations were unilateral and 12 bilateral. Comparing the preoperative and 36-month postoperative periods, the mean VHI score improved from 73.45 (±22.78) to 44.88 (±28.93), P = .001, and the mean GRBAS decreased from 8.64 (±3.89) to 2.82 (±2.3), P = .001; 24 months postoperatively, the mean fundamental frequency decreased from 163.88 Hz (±41.61) to 150.44 Hz (±41.47), P = .012. Stroboscopic analysis revealed statistically significant improvement in mucosal wave propagation, phase closure, and phase symmetry. Best results were achieved in the UVFP subgroup. Computed tomography scans demonstrated long-term viability of the implanted adipose tissue. CONCLUSION Fat is an excellent source of autologous graft. With careful patient selection and proper surgical technique, fat is suitable for long-term correction of glottic insufficiency. Fat augmentation should be considered as a long-lasting or even permanent solution, rather than temporary.","Lahav, Yonatan; Malka-Yosef, Liron; Shapira-Galitz, Yael; Cohen, Oded; Halperin, Doron; Shoffel-Havakuk, Hagit",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,618,1

OBJECTIVES This study aimed to examine the complexities of IPE group learning processes by examining how the material and intersubjective intertwine when newly formed interprofessional groups (Chinese medicine, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and social work) synchronously engaged with face-to-face and online learning in a blended, team-based learning environment. METHODS It was a micro-ethnography study using a sociomaterial theoretical lens. We selected two undergraduate interprofessional healthcare student groups within a large scale programme for contrastive video analysis of synchronous spatial and physical configurations, associated talk, and online activity. RESULTS Video analysis of evolving physical configurations indicated that Group B was spatially more evenly grouped, and physically orientated to an identifiable leader, despite their blinded peer evaluations indicating distributed leadership. Group A faced a critical event at a public forum leading to spatial disruption breaking into subgroups and isolates; however, this group identified one member as a defined leader in the peer evaluations. CONCLUSIONS Based on online scores, we found that peer identification of leaders may influence learning processes but not learning outcomes in the first IPE team meeting. The design of the physical and virtual learning environments contributed to the developing, sociomaterial processes of group cohesion in interprofessional team-based learning.","Bridges, Susan M; Chan, Lap Ki; Chen, Julie Y; Tsang, Joyce P Y; Ganotice, Fraide A",Nurse education today,618,9

We hypothesize that bilirubin inhibits the function of lipid rafts (LR), microdomains of the plasma membrane critical for signal transduction. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of free bilirubin (Bf) between 7.6 and 122.5 nM on LR-dependent functions of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1). METHODS Cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were plated on poly-L-lysine overnight, and neurite length was determined after 1 h treatment with L1 alone or L1 and bilirubin. L1 activation of ERK1/2 was measured in CGN in the presence or absence of bilirubin. The effect of bilirubin on L1 distribution in LR was quantitated, and the localization of bilirubin to LR was determined. RESULTS The addition of bilirubin to CGN treated with L1 significantly decreased neurite length compared to L1 alone. L1 activation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by bilirubin. Bilirubin redistributed L1 into LR. Bilirubin was associated only with LR-containing fractions of a sucrose density gradient. CONCLUSION Bf significantly inhibits LR-dependent functions of L1 and are found only associated with LR, suggesting one mechanism by which bilirubin may exert neurotoxicity is through the dysfunction of protein-LR interactions. IMPACT This article establishes lipid rafts as a target for the neurotoxic effects of bilirubin.This article provides clear evidence toward establishing one mechanism of bilirubin neurotoxicity, where little is understood.This article paves the way for future investigation into lipid raft dependent functions, and its role in neurodevelopmental outcome.Fig. 1BILIRUBIN INHIBITS L1-MEDIATED NEURITE OUTGROWTH AT PHYSIOLOGIC CONCENTRATIONS OF BF.: a Distribution curve of neurite lengths without L1, L1, or L1 plus 5, 10, or 50 µM of bilirubin from a representative experiment. b Bar graph of mean ± SEM neurite lengths of CGN grown without L1, L1, or L1 plus 5, 10, or 50 µM of bilirubin normalized to CGN grown on PLL alone.

OBJECTIVE To describe characteristics, treatment, and outcomes of critically ill patients in Canada with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A prospective observational study of 168 critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection in 38 adult and pediatric intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada between April 16 and August 12, 2009. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measures were 28-day and 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included frequency and duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of ICU stay. RESULTS Critical illness occurred in 215 patients with confirmed (n = 162), probable (n = 6), or suspected (n = 47) community-acquired 2009 influenza A(H1N1) infection. Among the 168 patients with confirmed or probable 2009 influenza A(H1N1), the mean (SD) age was 32.3 (21.4) years; 113 were female (67.3%) and 50 were children (29.8%). Overall mortality among critically ill patients at 28 days was 14.3% (95% confidence interval, 9.5%-20.7%). There were 43 patients who were aboriginal Canadians (25.6%). The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days (interquartile range [IQR], 2-7 days) and from hospitalization to ICU admission was 1 day (IQR, 0-2 days). Shock and nonpulmonary acute organ dysfunction was common (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment mean [SD] score of 6.8 [3.6] on day 1). Neuraminidase inhibitors were administered to 152 patients (90.5%). All patients were severely hypoxemic (mean [SD] ratio of Pao(2) to fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio(2)] of 147 [128] mm Hg) at ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was received by 136 patients (81.0%). The median duration of ventilation was 12 days (IQR, 6-20 days) and ICU stay was 12 days (IQR, 5-20 days). Lung rescue therapies included neuromuscular blockade (28% of patients), inhaled nitric oxide (13.7%), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (11.9%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.2%), and prone positioning ventilation (3.0%). Overall mortality among critically ill patients at 90 days was 17.3% (95% confidence interval, 12.0%-24.0%; n = 29). CONCLUSION Critical illness due to 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in Canada occurred rapidly after hospital admission, often in young adults, and was associated with severe hypoxemia, multisystem organ failure, a requirement for prolonged mechanical ventilation, and the frequent use of rescue therapies.","Kumar, Anand; Zarychanski, Ryan; Pinto, Ruxandra; Cook, Deborah J; Marshall, John; Lacroix, Jacques; Stelfox, Tom; Bagshaw, Sean; Choong, Karen; Lamontagne, Francois; Turgeon, Alexis F; Lapinsky, Stephen; Ahern, Stéphane P; Smith, Orla; Siddiqui, Faisal; Jouvet, Philippe; Khwaja, Kosar; McIntyre, Lauralyn; Menon, Kusum; Hutchison, Jamie; Hornstein, David; Joffe, Ari; Lauzier, Francois; Singh, Jeffrey; Karachi, Tim; Wiebe, Kim; Olafson, Kendiss; Ramsey, Clare; Sharma, Sat; Dodek, Peter; Meade, Maureen; Hall, Richard; Fowler, Robert A",JAMA,618,31

The objective of this study is to compare the risk of leaks and stenosis of a mechanical gastric pouch jejunal anastomosis between the usual interrupted sutures and a continuous barbed suture for gastrojejunotomy, in order to reduce procedure time and costs. METHODS A comparative trial of 100 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed between October 2010 and July 2011. The population was divided into two groups of 50 consecutive patients. In the first group, gastrojejunotomy was sutured with resorbable interrupted sutures and the second with continuous barbed suture. Diabetes, body mass index and the American Society of Anaesthesiology score were compared. The time required for suturing and the incidence of anastomotic leaks and stricture were also compared after 6 months. RESULTS No fistulas or anastomotic stenoses had occurred at post-operative month 6 in either group. Gastrojejunotomy suture time was significantly shorter in the barbed suture group (11 versus 8.22 min; p < 0.01). Total costs of material to complete the reconstruction were significantly lower in the barbed suture group (€26.69 versus €18.33; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The use of barbed suture is as safe as usual sutures and allows easier and faster suture in the closure of gastrojejunotomy. This suture could be incorporated in the standard laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass technique.","De Blasi, Vito; Facy, Olivier; Goergen, Martine; Poulain, Virginie; De Magistris, Luigi; Azagra, Juan Santiago",Obesity surgery,618,1

OBJECTIVES Our goal was to examine variations in airway and systemic inflammation, spirometry, and quality of life during steady state, bronchiectasis exacerbations, and convalescence (1 week following a 2-week antibiotic treatment) to determine whether potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were associated with poorer conditions during bronchiectasis exacerbations. METHODS Peripheral blood and sputum were sampled to detect inflammatory mediators and bacterial densities. Spirometry and quality of life (St George Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]) were assessed during the 3 stages. RESULTS Forty-eight subjects with bronchiectasis (43.2 ± 14.2 y of age) were analyzed. No notable differences in species and density of potentially pathogenic microorganisms were found during bronchiectasis exacerbations. Except for CXCL8 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), serum inflammation was heightened during bronchiectasis exacerbations and recovered during convalescence. Even though sputum TNF-α was markedly higher during bronchiectasis exacerbations and remained heightened during convalescence, the variations in miscellaneous sputum markers were unremarkable. Bronchiectasis exacerbations were associated with notably higher SGRQ symptom and total scores, which recovered during convalescence. FVC, FEV1, and maximum mid-expiratory flow worsened during bronchiectasis exacerbations (median change from baseline of -2.2%, -0.8%, and -1.3%) and recovered during convalescence (median change from baseline of 0.6%, 0.7%, and -0.7%). Compared with no bacterial isolation, potentially pathogenic microorganism or P. aeruginosa isolation at baseline did not result in poorer clinical condition during bronchiectasis exacerbations. CONCLUSIONS Bronchiectasis exacerbations are characterized by heightened inflammatory responses and poorer quality of life and spirometry, but not by increased bacterial density, which applies for subjects with and without potentially pathogenic microorganism isolation when clinically stable.

However, prospective studies linking circulating miRNAs to incident acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are limited, and the underlying effect of associated miRNA on incident ACS remains unknown. Methods and Results Based on a 2-stage prospective nested case-control design within the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort, we profiled plasma miRNAs from 23 pairs of incident ACS cases and controls by microarray and validated the candidate miRNAs in 572 incident ACS case-control pairs using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We observed that plasma miR-4286 was associated with higher risk of ACS (adjusted odds ratio according to an interquartile range increase, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.48]). Further association analysis revealed that triglyceride was positively associated with plasma miR-4286, and an interquartile range increase in triglyceride was associated with an 11.04% (95% CI, 3.77%-18.83%) increase in plasma miR-4286. In addition, the Mendelian randomization analysis suggested a potential causal effect of triglyceride on plasma miR-4286 (β coefficients: 0.27 [95% CI, 0.01-0.53] and 0.27 [95% CI, 0.07-0.47] separately by inverse variance-weighted and Mendelian randomization-pleiotropy residual sum and outlier tests). Moreover, the causal mediation analysis indicated that plasma miR-4286 explained 5.5% (95% CI, 0.7%-17.0%) of the association of triglyceride with incident ACS. Conclusions Higher level of plasma miR-4286 was associated with an increased risk of ACS. The upregulated miR-4286 in plasma can be attributed to higher triglyceride level and may mediate the effect of triglyceride on incident ACS.","Shen, Miaoyan; Xu, Xuedan; Liu, Xuezhen; Wang, Qiuhong; Li, Wending; You, Xiaomin; Peng, Rong; Yuan, Yu; Long, Pinpin; Niu, Rundong; Yang, Handong; Cheng, Xiang; Pan, An; Tanguay, Robert M; Zhang, Xiaomin; He, Meian; Wang, Chaolong; Liang, Liming; Wu, Tangchun",Journal of the American Heart Association,618,12

In order to detect changes in cognitive function, cognitive tests should be performed repeatedly. Currently existing cognitive tests come in only a single version, so the subject is likely to remember the contents with repeated testing. And, under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in-person assessment should be avoided. This study was performed to develop a new cognitive test (brain assessment, BA) that has 5 versions and can be performed on a personal computer (PC) through the Internet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five thousand subjects performed the online BA, which consisted of 5 subtests: number memory, word memory, mental rotation test, N-back test, and judgment test. We standardized the raw scores (cognitive scores, CSs) using mean and standard deviation, which were 50 and 10, respectively. Then, we calculated the mean CS for each sex and age, plotted the relationships between ages and mean CSs on figures, and calculated the formula of cognitive changes during normal aging. RESULTS The CSs of all subtests decreased with aging. The regression coefficient was from -0.31 to -0.45. It is noteworthy that in most subtests, the CSs started to increase at 85 years of age. DISCUSSION Our BA has 5 versions and can be done on a PC using the Internet. We tested the BA in a large number of subjects, and the standard values of CSs were measured in individuals up to 89 years of age. By performing this test repeatedly, subjects can evaluate the degree of their cognitive decline. If the rate of cognitive decline is greater than that predicted using the normalized formula, the subjects can undertake strategies to improve their control of lifestyle-related diseases or other habits of daily living.

Herein, several ultrashort peptidase inhibitors against the RBD-ACE2 interaction were obtained by a computer-aided approach based on the RBD-binding residues on the protease domain (PD) of ACE2. The designed peptides were tested on a model coronavirus GX_P2V, which has 92.2 and 86% amino acid identity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and RBD, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy analysis predicted a potential binding pocket on the RBD of the spike protein, and this was confirmed by the specifically designed peptides SI5α and SI5α-b. They have only seven residues, showing potent antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay result also confirmed their inhibitory ability against the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The ultrashort peptides are promising precursor molecules for the drug development of Corona Virus Disease 2019, and the novel binding pocket on the RBD may be helpful for the design of RBD inhibitors or antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Pei, Pengfei; Qin, Hongbo; Chen, Jialin; Wang, Fengli; He, Chengzhi; He, Shiting; Hong, Bixia; Liu, Ke; Qiao, Ren Zhong; Fan, Huahao; Tong, Yi-Gang; Chen, Long; Luo, Shi-Zhong",Briefings in bioinformatics,618,17

Despite the commitment of professional societies such as the American College of Radiology to diversity in Radiology, the field and its residency training programs remain the least diverse. With COVID-19 related suspension of in-person medical student rotations, our Department of Radiology redesigned and implemented a virtual radiology internship for underrepresented minority (URM) medical students. METHODS A four-week virtual radiology internship was designed to provide clinical exposure to radiology and to allow students to gain an understanding of what a career in radiology entails. Course design included videoconference patient care sessions, didactic lectures, online modules, mentoring, and extra-clinical curriculum. Feedback from students was collected using online surveys assessing pre- and postcourse attitudes and understanding of a career in radiology and the students' perceived aptitude for such a career, as well as course component evaluation. RESULTS Three participants were enrolled in the inaugural clerkship. All noted exceptional educational course content and ample opportunities to build connections with faculty and residents-with mentoring seen as the highlight of the course. All indicated a significant shift in perception of the field and in declaring interest in pursuing a career in radiology. CONCLUSION Virtual radiology internship for URM students is a feasible paradigm to address potential impediments to diversification of the specialty by both engaging interested URM medical students in a career in radiology and arming them with the tools for a successful application to radiology residency.","Dodelzon, Katerina; Belfi, Lily; Schweitzer, Andrew D; Lamparello, Nicole; Legasto, Alan C; McGinty, Geraldine; Spottswood, Stephanie; Min, Robert J; Babagbemi, Kemi",Academic radiology,618,16

The virus's blend of lethality and transmissibility have challenged officials and exposed critical limitations of the traditional public health apparatus. However, throughout this pandemic, technology has answered the call for a new form of public health that illustrates opportunities for enhanced agility, scale, and responsiveness. The authors share the Microsoft perspective and illustrate how technology has helped transform the public health landscape with new and refined capabilities - the efficacy and impact of which will be determined by history. Technologies like chatbot and virtualized patient care offer a mechanism to triage and distribute care at scale. Artificial intelligence and high-performance computing have accelerated research into understanding the virus and developing targeted therapeutics to treat infection and prevent transmission. New mobile contact tracing protocols that preserve patient privacy and civil liberties were developed in response to public concerns, creating new opportunities for privacy-sensitive technologies that aid efforts to prevent and control outbreaks. While much progress is still needed, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted technology's importance to public health security and pandemic preparedness. Future multi-stakeholder collaborations, including those with technology organizations, are needed to facilitate progress in overcoming the current pandemic, setting the stage for improved pandemic preparedness in the future. As lessons are assessed from the current pandemic, public officials should consider technology's role and continue to seek opportunities to supplement and improve on traditional approaches.","Uohara, Michael Y; Weinstein, James N; Rhew, David C",Population health management,618,1

Implications for the COVID-19 pandemic.,17.382793,4.801077,2021-02-21,"Many viruses use programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting to express defined ratios of structural and enzymatic proteins. Pseudoknot structures in messenger RNAs stimulate frameshifting in upstream slippery sequences. The detailed molecular determinants of pseudoknot mechanical stability and frameshifting efficiency are not well understood. Here we use single-molecule unfolding studies by optical tweezers, and frameshifting assays to elucidate how mechanical stability of a pseudoknot and its frameshifting efficiency are regulated by tertiary stem-loop interactions. Mechanical unfolding of a model pseudoknot and mutants designed to dissect specific interactions reveals that mechanical stability depends strongly on triplex structures formed by stem-loop interactions. Combining single-molecule and mutational studies facilitates the identification of pseudoknot folding intermediates. Average unfolding forces of the pseudoknot and mutants ranging from 50 to 22 picoNewtons correlated with frameshifting efficiencies ranging from 53% to 0%. Formation of major-groove and minor-groove triplex structures enhances pseudoknot stem stability and torsional resistance, and may thereby stimulate frameshifting. Better understanding of the molecular determinants of frameshifting efficiency may facilitate the development of anti-virus therapeutics targeting frameshifting.","Chen, Gang; Chang, Kung-Yao; Chou, Ming-Yuan; Bustamante, Carlos; Tinoco, Ignacio",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,618,30

In the past decade, several studies have investigated the phenomenon, commonly known as the obesity paradox, with mixed results thus far. We sought to determine whether outcomes differ between patients with large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) after endovascular therapy (ET) according to their body mass index (BMI). Methods We reviewed our prospectively collected endovascular database at a tertiary care academic institution. All patients that underwent ET for acute LVOS were categorized according to their BMI into 4 groups: (1) underweight (BMI < 18.5), (2) normal weight (BMI = 18.5-25), (3) overweight (BMI = 25-30), and (4) obese (BMI > 30). Baseline characteristics, procedural radiological as well as outcome parameters where compared. Results A total of 926 patients qualified for the study, of which 20 (2.2%) were underweight, 253 (27.3%) had a normal weight, 315 (34%) were overweight, and 338 (36.5%) were obese. When compared with normal weight (reference), overweight patients were younger, had higher rates of dyslipidemia and diabetes and higher glucose levels, while obese patients were younger, less often smokers, and had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes and higher glucose levels. Other baseline and procedural characteristics were comparable. The rates of successful reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia, 2b-3), parenchymal hematomas, 90-day good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale, 0-2), and 90-day mortality were comparable between groups. On multivariate analysis, BMI was not associated with good outcomes nor mortality. Conclusion In patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, BMI is not associated with outcomes. However, patients who are overweight or obese have more comorbidities and a higher stroke risk and, thus, should strive for a normal weight.","Bouslama, Mehdi; Perez, Hilarie J; Barreira, Clara M; Haussen, Diogo C; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Belagaje, Samir R; Bianchi, Nicolas A; Anderson, Aaron M; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,618,4

In 500 patients randomized between IAT and standard care, collateral status was graded from 0 (absent) to 3 (good). Final infarct volumes (FIV) were calculated on post-treatment CT. FIVs were compared between treatment groups per collateral grade. Multivariable linear regression with interaction terms was performed to study whether collaterals modified IAT effect on FIV. Four-hundred-forty-nine patients were included in the analysis. Median FIV for the IAT group was significantly lower with 54.5 mL (95% IQR: 21.8-145.0) than for the controls with 81.8 mL (95% IQR: 40.0-154.0) ( p = 0.020). Treatment effect differed across collateral grades, although there was no significant interaction (unadjusted p = 0.054; adjusted p = 0.105).

This research was aimed to focus on the antiviral properties of CGA on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in vivo and in vitro for the very first time. The outcome of in vitro experiments validated that, out of five previously reported antiviral components, CGA significantly reduced the relative mRNA expression of IBV-N in CEK cells. At high concentration (400 mg/kg), CGA supplementation reduced IBV-N mRNA expression levels and ameliorated the injury in trachea and lungs. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12, and NF-κB were considerably turned down, but IL-22 and IL-10 were enhanced in trachea. However, CGA-H treatment had considerably increased the expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TLR7, MyD88, IRF7, IFN-β and IFN-α both in trachea and lungs. Moreover, CGA-H notably induced the CD3+, CD3+ CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ proliferation and significantly increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in the serum. In conclusion, these results showed that at high concentration CGA is a strong anti-IBV compound that can effectively regulate the innate immunity through MDA5, TLR7 and NF-κB signaling pathways and have the potential to induce the cell mediated and humoral immune response in IBV infected chickens.","Abaidullah, Muhammad; Peng, Shuwei; Song, Xu; Zou, Yuanfeng; Li, Lixia; Jia, Renyong; Yin, Zhongqiong",International immunopharmacology,618,19

We set out to test whether decision aids can support self-isolation. DESIGN We conducted a pre-registered online experiment with a nationally representative sample (n = 500). Three stages tested: (i) whether decision trees help people to decide whether they need to self-isolate; (ii) whether an online planning tool increases people's confidence in their ability to self-isolate; and (iii) whether infographics help people to absorb advice on managing a household in which someone must self-isolate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES (i) Accuracy of matching symptom patterns to a response scale for the need to self-isolate; (ii) self-reported confidence in coping with self-isolation; (iii) objective tests of recall and comprehension. RESULTS Decision trees improved decisions about when self-isolation was necessary, although participants systematically underestimated the need to self-isolate with less common COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. sore throat, fatigue).

Outpatient maintenance hemodialysis seems to entail an increased risk of contagion, and previous reports inform of increased mortality among this population. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and laboratory parameters, outcomes, and management once discharged of CKD-5D patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 from our health area. RESULTS Out of the 429 CKD-5D population, 36 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (8%): 34 on in-center hemodialysis and 2 on peritoneal dialysis. Five were asymptomatic. The most common symptom was fever (70%), followed by dyspnea and cough. History of cardiovascular disease and elevation of LDH and C-reactive protein during admission were associated with higher mortality. Thirteen patients died (36%), 8 patients were admitted to an ICU, and survival was low (38%) among the latter. The mean time to death was 12 days. Most discharged patients got negative rRT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs within 26 days of diagnosis. However, there is a portion of cured patients that continue to have positive results even more than 2 months after the initial presentation. CONCLUSIONS Patients on dialysis have an increased mortality risk if infected with SARS-CoV-2. Preventive measures have proven useful. Thus, proper ones, such as universal screening of the population and isolation when required, need to be generalized.

We generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) possessing a two-segmented genome. Each genomic segment is flanked by authentic NDV 3' and 5' noncoding termini allowing for efficient replication and transcription. A reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into one segment, and a red fluorescent protein dsRed gene was inserted into the other segment in order to easily detect the replication and transcription of segments in infected cells. The rescued viruses grew well and were stable in embryonated chicken eggs over multiple passages. We were able to detect the expression of both reporter genes in the same cell infected with the virus possessing a segmented genome, and viral particles can contain either one or two types of RNA segments. We also rescued a two-segmented virus expressing GFP and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus spike S protein, which is about 200 kDa.

METHOD Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of universal, school-based interventions that included strategies to strengthen a minimum of 3 internal resilience protective factors, and included an outcome measure of mental health problems in children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years. Six databases were searched from 1995 to 2015. Results were pooled in meta-analyses by mental health outcome (anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, hyperactivity, conduct problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress), for all trials (5-18 years). Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (child: 5-10 years; adolescent: 11-18 years), length of follow-up (short: post-≤12 months; long: >12 months), and gender (narrative). RESULTS A total of 57 included trials were identified from 5,984 records, with 49 contributing to meta-analyses. For all trials, resilience-focused interventions were effective relative to a control in reducing 4 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress. For child trials (meta-analyses for 6 outcomes), interventions were effective for anxiety symptoms and general psychological distress. For adolescent trials (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. For short-term follow-up, interventions were effective for 2 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For long-term follow-up (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. CONCLUSION The findings may suggest most promise for using universal resilience-focused interventions at least for short-term reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents, particularly if a cognitive-behavioral therapy-based approach is used. The limited number of trials providing data amenable for meta-analysis for some outcomes and subgroups, the variability of interventions, study quality, and bias mean that it is not possible to draw more specific conclusions.

Gore & Associates; Flagstaff, AZ) is preferentially used at our institution for percutaneous closure of the patent foramen ovale (PFO). Adequate deployment of the device requires capture of three sequential eyelets by the locking loop. At times, the right atrial eyelet is not caught, particularly when a long tunnel PFO causes too much separation between the discs. Although rarely, unlocked devices have been left in the atrial septum with no untoward events provided they appear stable in the catheterization laboratory and the shunt has been eliminated. We report a patient in whom an unlocked, but otherwise well positioned, HSO subsequently unraveled with the right atrial disc migrating through the tricuspid valve while the left atrial disc remained well apposed to the left side of the atrial septum. The PFO was closed prior to liver transplantation to prevent an embolic event during the transplant. The patient required placement of several internal jugular central lines prior to transplant, and this instrumentation in the right atrium may have caused unraveling of the device. The HSO was removed percutaneously 15 weeks after implantation despite a well-seated and likely partially endothelialized left atrial disc.","Suntharos, Patcharapong; Komarlu, Rukmini; Prieto, Lourdes R",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,618,5

The risks of staffing challenges and clinician exposure are of significant concern. One resource, telecritical care (TCC), has the potential to optimize efficiency, maximize safety, and improve quality of care provided amid large-scale disruptions, but its role in pandemic situations is only loosely defined. Planning and Preparation Phase: We propose strategic initiatives by which TCC may act as a force multiplier for pandemic preparedness in response to COVID-19, utilizing a tiered approach for increasing surge capacity needs. The goals involved usage of TCC to augment ICU capacity, optimize safety, minimize personal protective equipment (PPE) use, improve efficiencies, and enhance knowledge of managing pandemic response. Implementation Phase: A phased approach utilizing TCC would involve implementing remote capabilities across the enterprise to accomplish the goals outlined. The hardware and software needed for initial expansion to cover 275 beds included $956,670 for mobile carts and $173,106 for home workstations. Team role deployment and bedside clinical care centering around TCC as critical care capacity expand beyond 275 beds. Surge capacity was not reached during early phases of the pandemic in the region, allowing refinement of TCC during subsequent pandemic phases. Conclusions: Leveraging TCC facilitated pandemic surge planning but required redefinition of typical ICU staffing models. The design was meant to workforce efficiencies, reduce PPE use, and minimize health care worker exposure risk, all while maintaining quality care standards through an intensivist-led model. As health care operations resumed and states reopened, TCC is being used to support shifts in volume and critical care personnel during the pandemic evolution. The lessons applied may help health care systems through variable phases of the pandemic.","Singh, Jaspal; Green, Michael B; Lindblom, Scott; Reif, Michael S; Thakkar, Nehal P; Papali, Alfred",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,618,16

Limited resources for cancer control are one of the contributors to cancer health disparities. We explored the feasibility and benefit of conducting outreaches in partnership with local communities using the ""asset-based community development (ABCD)"" model. METHODS We analyzed the quarterly Uganda cancer institute (UCI) community outreach cancer health education and screening output reported secondary data without individual identifiers from July 2016 to June 2019 to compare the UCI-hospital-based and community outreach cancer awareness and screening services based on the ABCD model. RESULTS From July 2016 to June 2019, we worked with 107 local partners and conducted 151 outreaches. Of the total number of people who attended cancer health education sessions, 201 568 (77.9%) were reached through outreaches. Ninety-two (95%) cancer awareness TVs and radio talk-shows conducted were sponsored by local partners. Of the total people screened; 22 795 (63.0%) cervical, 22 014 (64.4%) breast, and 4904 (38.7%) prostate screening were reached through community outreach model. The screen-positive rates were higher in hospital-based screening except for Prostate screening; cervical, 8.8%, breast, 8.4%, prostate, 7.1% than in outreaches; cervical, 3.2%, breast, 2.2%, prostate, 8.2%. Of the screened positive clients who were eligible for precancer treatment like cryotherapy for treatment of precervical cancer lesions, thousands-folds monetary value and productive life saved relative to the market cost of cancer treatment and survival rate in Uganda. When the total number of clients screened for cervical, breast, and prostate cancer are subjected to the incremental cost of specific screening, a greater portion (98.7%) of the outreach cost was absorbed through community partnership. CONCLUSIONS Outreaching and working in collaboration with communities as partners through asset-based community development model are feasible and help in cost-sharing and leverage for scarce resources to promote primary prevention and early detection of cancer. This could contribute to bridging the cancer health disparities in the target populations.","Jatho, Alfred; Mugisha, Noleb M; Kafeero, James; Holoya, George; Okuku, Fred; Niyonzima, Nixon",Cancer medicine,618,16

We aimed to determine the acceptance, safety and effectiveness of exercise interventions in SOT candidates. METHODS Online databases were searched. Studies of any design were included. Outcomes of interest were acceptance, safety, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS Twenty-three articles were included. Acceptance ranged from 16% to 100%. In the fifteen studies that assessed adverse events, none mentioned any adverse events occuring during the study. Five out of seven studies reported an increase in maximal exercise capacity post-exercise in the intervention group (range of mean change: 0.45 to 2.9 mL/kg). Eight out of fourteen studies reported an increase in 6-minute walking distance in the intervention group after the training period (range of mean change: 40 to 105 meters). Two articles showed an improvement in the mental composite scores as well as in the physical composite scores post-exercise in the intervention group. CONCLUSION There was a lack of significant finding among most randomized controlled trials. Exercise training is acceptable and safe for selective SOT candidates. The effects of exercise training on exercise capacity and quality of life in SOT candidates are unclear.","Pesce de Souza, Fernanda; Massierer, Daniela; Anand Raje, Uma; Tansey, Catherine M; Boruff, Jill; Janaudis-Ferreira, Tania",Clinical transplantation,618,24

A key factor for Grft potency is glycosylation at N295 of gp120, which is directly adjacent to N332, a target glycan for an entire class of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Here we unify previous work on the importance of other glycans to Grft potency against HIV-1, and Grft's role in mediating conformational change of gp120, by mutating nearly every glycosylation site in gp120. In addition to significant loss of Grft activity by removal of glycosylation at N295, glycan absence at N332 or N448 was found to have moderate effects on Grft potency. Interestingly, in the absence of N295, Grft effectiveness could be improved by mutation that results in the glycan at N448 shifting to N446, indicating that glycan importance may be related to their effect on glycosylation density. Grft's ability to alter the structure of gp120, exposing the CD4 binding site, only correlated with the presence of glycosylation at N295 in B clade strains, but not C clade strains. We further demonstrate that Grft can rescue the activity of bNAbs PGT121 and PGT126 in the event of loss or shift of glycosylation at N332, where the bNAbs suffer a drastic loss of potency. Despite targeting the same region, Grft in combination with PGT121 and PGT126 produced additive effects. This indicates Grft could be an important combinational therapeutic.","Fischer, Kathryn; Nguyen, Kimberly; LiWang, Patricia J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,618,1

We conducted a systematic review of the literature from 1946 to January 2019 identifying studies that compared propofol TCI with other propofol regimens for procedural sedation in the adult population. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Seven articles were included. There was significant methodological heterogeneity in all aspects of study designs and definitions of adverse events which precluded a meta-analysis. A systematic review of the studies demonstrated fewer respiratory and cardiovascular adverse outcomes in three of the seven studies. It was not possible to determine if propofol TCI reduces the incidence of adverse events when compared with other sedating regimens using propofol using a descriptive systematic review of the relevant literature. Further research is required to compare the incidence of adverse events using propofol TCI for procedural sedation with other methods of administration in the ED.

Small processing changes during preparation modulate host tissue response, which influence material efficacy and longevity. In this pilot study, a rat model was used to determine the specific influence of tissue origin, decellularisation treatment and 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) cross-linking. METHODS Materials (1 cm2) were implanted subcutaneously into 6-week-old Wistar rats (4 materials per animal, n=6/material per time point) for 2, 5, 7, 14 and 28 days. Histologic processing was carried out after resin infiltration, observing classical histopathology and pathologic indexing. Materials comprised 6 tissue-based grafts covering both experimental and commercial porcine decellularised dermal and small intestinal submucosal materials. RESULTS Subcutaneous delivery of biologics demonstrated material-specific inflammatory/host responses. Controlled variations of the PermacolTM manufacturing process showed sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was the most proinflammatory decellularisation reagent, and HMDI cross-linking had no effect on host response. All materials remained recoverable after 28 days, although SurgisisTM had partially resorbed. CONCLUSION Differences in host responses exist between biologic implants for hernia repair in this rat model. It is postulated that these modifications are induced during processing and may have an effect on the clinical outcome of hernia repair.","Bryan, Nicholas; Ashwin, Helen; Smart, Neil J; Wohlert, Stephen; Bayon, Yves; Hunt, John A",Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials,618,31

As we have routinely employed the assay for patients undergoing flow diversion, we elected to explore the relationship between P2Y12 hyporesponse as indicated by a P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU) value >200 and treatment outcomes, including intraprocedural platelet aggregation and ischemic complications. METHODS All successful intracranial aneurysm Pipeline treatments performed at our institution from November 2011 to May 2019 were included. The rate of P2Y12 hyporesponse and treatment outcomes were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to determine independent predictors of treatment outcomes. RESULTS 333 qualifying treatments were performed in 297 patients. Clopidogrel hyporesponse was initially noted in 24%, falling to 17% by day-of-procedure by dose titration. A glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor was administered prophylactically in 3% of cases for persistent, profound hyporesponse. 27 (8.1%) patients developed acute platelet aggregation; only 6 demonstrated day-of-procedure P2Y12 hyporesponse. Day-of-procedure hyporesponse was not associated with intraprocedural platelet aggregation or ischemic complications. Greater Pipeline embolization device (PED) diameter was associated with a reduced odds of platelet aggregation (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85; p=0.019). Antiplatelet non-compliance (OR 25.20, 95% CI 3.86 to 164.61; p=0.001) and treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.22 to 22.33; p=0.026) were the only independent predictors of ischemic complications. CONCLUSIONS P2Y12 hyporesponse was not associated with acute platelet aggregation or ischemic complications in our patients undergoing Pipeline embolization of intracranial aneurysms, possibly due to aggressive management of the hyporesponse using clopidogrel dose titration and/or GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor administration.","Miller, Timothy R; Wessell, Aaron; Jindal, Gaurav; Malhotra, Ajay; Simard, J Marc; Gandhi, Dheeraj",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,618,20

The Greek translation of the Zung self-rating depression scale questionnaire was used to screen for the presence of depressive symptoms. In addition, demographic, academic and dietary information was collected. The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality, Pearson correlation test, Chi-square test, t-test and Mann Whitney U test were employed for statistical analysis. RESULTS We enrolled 55 female and 91 male military medicine cadets with a mean age of 19.84 years (SD = 0.99). The mean Zung crude score was 43.32 (SD = 4.55): 42.8 (SD = 4.43) for female cadets and 43.64 (SD = 4.6) for male cadets. Cadets were further subdivided into low and high risk groups for the presence of depressive symptoms. We identified 57 (39 %) cadets with a total Zung crude score of 45 or above: 21 females and 36 males.

With the number of cases increasing rapidly, the epidemiological data on the nutritional practice is scarce. In this study, we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and nutritional practice in a cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, ambidirectional cohort study conducted at 11 hospitals in Hubei Province, China. All eligible critical COVID-19 patients in the study hospital intensive care units at 00:00, March 6th, 2020, were included. Data collection was performed via written case report forms. RESULTS A total of 44 patients were identified and enrolled, of whom eight died during the 28-day outcome follow- up period. The median interval between hospital admission and the study day was 24 (interquartile range, 13- 26) days and 52.2% (23 of 44) of patients were on invasive mechanical ventilation. The median nutrition risk in critically ill (mNUTRIC) score was 3 (interquartile range, 2-5) on the study day. During the enrolment day, 68.2% (30 of 44) of patients received enteral nutrition (EN), while 6.8% (3 of 44) received parenteral nutrition (PN) alone. Nausea and aspiration were uncommon, with a prevalence of 11.4% (5 of 44) and 6.8% (3 of 44), respectively. As for energy delivery, 69.7% (23 of 33) of patients receiving EN and/or PN were achieving their prescribed targets. CONCLUSIONS The study showed that EN was frequently applied in critical COVID-19 patients. Energy delivery may be suboptimal in this study requiring more attention.","Lin, Jiajia; Ke, Lu; Doig, Gordon S; Ye, Bo; Jiang, Zhengying; Liu, Zhiyong; Guo, Feng; Yin, Jiangtao; Yu, Wenkui; Sun, Jiakui; Sun, Liqun; Ding, Renyu; Xu, Hongyang; Chang, Zhigang; Long, Yi; Qian, Yajun; Tong, Zhihui; Li, Weiqin",Asia Pacific journal of clinical nutrition,618,29

We assessed the association between collaterals and functional outcome in EVT treated patients and investigated if this association is time dependent. METHODS We included consecutive patients from the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in The Netherlands (MR CLEAN) Registry (March 2014-June 2016) with an anterior circulation large vessel occlusion undergoing EVT. Functional outcome was measured on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. We investigated the association between collaterals and mRS in the MR CLEAN Registry with ordinal logistic regression and if this association was time dependent with an interaction term. Additionally, we determined modification of EVT effect by collaterals compared with MR CLEAN controls, and also investigated if this was time dependent with multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS 1412 patients were analyzed. Functional independence (mRS score of 0-2) was achieved in 13% of patients with grade 0 collaterals, in 27% with grade 1, in 46% with grade 2, and in 53% with grade 3. Collaterals were significantly associated with mRS (adjusted common OR 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.7)) and significantly modified EVT benefit (P=0.04). None of the effects were time dependent. Better collaterals corresponded to lower mortality (P<0.001), but not to lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (P=0.14). CONCLUSION In routine clinical practice, better collateral status is associated with better functional outcome and greater treatment benefit in EVT treated acute ischemic stroke patients, independent of time to treatment. Within the 6 hour time window, a substantial proportion of patients with absent and poor collaterals can still achieve functional independence.","Jansen, Ivo Gh; Mulder, Maxim Jhl; Goldhoorn, Robert-Jan B; Boers, Anna Mm; van Es, Adriaan Cgm; Yo, Lonneke Sf; Hofmeijer, Jeannette; Martens, Jasper M; van Walderveen, Marianne Aa; van der Kallen, Bas Fw; Jenniskens, Sjoerd Fm; Treurniet, Kilian M; Marquering, Henk A; Sprengers, Marieke Es; Schonewille, Wouter J; Bot, Joost Cj; Lycklama A Nijeholt, Geert J; Lingsma, Hester F; Liebeskind, David S; Boiten, Jelis; Vos, Jan Albert; Roos, Yvo Bwem; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van der Lugt, Aad; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik Wj; van den Wijngaard, Ido R; Majoie, Charles Blm",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,618,1

Given the development times and manufacturing requirements for new products, repurposing of existing drugs is likely the only solution for outbreaks due to emerging viruses. In the studies described here, a library of 290 compounds was screened for antiviral activity against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Selection of compounds for inclusion in the library was dependent on current or previous FDA approval or advanced clinical development. Some drugs that had a well-defined cellular pathway as target were included. In total, 27 compounds with activity against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were identified.

METHODS Morphological MRI (T2-weighted [T2-w] + contrast-enhanced [CE] T1-w) and DWI (T2-w + DWI) and Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in 25 patients/30 pNETs were retrospectively evaluated. Per-patient and per-lesion detection rates (pDR and lDR, respectively) were calculated. Apparent diffusion coefficient values were compared among pNET and surrounding and normal pancreas (control group, 18 patients). Apparent diffusion coefficient and standardized uptake value (SUV) values were compared among different grading and staging groups. RESULTS No statistically significant differences in PET/CT and MRI session detection rates were found (morphological MRI and DW-MRI, 88% pDR and 87% lDR; combined evaluation, 92% pDR and 90% lDR; Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT, 88% pDR and 80% lDR). Consensus reading (morphological/DW-MRI + PET/CT) improved pDR and lDR (100%). Apparent diffusion coefficient mean value was significantly lower compared with surrounding and normal parenchyma (P < 0.01). The apparent diffusion coefficient and SUV values of pNETs among different grading and staging groups were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS Conventional MRI, DW-MRI + T2-w sequences, and Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT can be alternative tools in pNET detection. Diffusion-weighted MRI could be valuable in patients with clinical suspicion but negative conventional imaging findings. However, the consensus reading of the 3 techniques seems the best approach.","Farchione, Alessandra; Rufini, Vittoria; Brizi, Maria Gabriella; Iacovazzo, Donato; Larghi, Alberto; Massara, Roberto Maria; Petrone, Gianluigi; Poscia, Andrea; Treglia, Giorgio; De Marinis, Laura; Giordano, Alessandro; Rindi, Guido; Bonomo, Lorenzo",Pancreas,618,1

Secondly, taste function was tested in all included subjects using the standardised 'Taste Strips' test. RESULTS Data showed a statistically statistically significant difference in overall taste perception between OLP patients with tongue lesions and control subjects (p = 0.027) for the tested taste function. The sensation of 'sour' showed the most pronounced difference (p = 0.08). The subjective taste perception and that of individual taste qualities did not differ statistically significantly between the three groups, and the correlation between subjective and objective taste perception was low. There was also a low correlation between taste scores and the presence of lesions on different areas of the tongue.

All related data are registered prospectively in cooperation with the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgery at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. METHODS Data collection regarding obesity and metabolic surgery was started in an online database in 2005. Follow-up data are collected once a year. Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. RESULTS Since 2005, 10,330 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedures have been performed in Germany. In total, 8,013 patients were female and 2,317 were male. Male patients suffered significantly more comorbidities than female patients. The men also had higher body mass indexes (BMIs) and ages than the women at the time of operation. Data on the gender-specific aspects of RYGB from the Nationwide Survey of Bariatric Surgery in Germany (GBSR) showed a significant difference in anastomotic insufficiency at the gastro-entero-anastomosis.

Several years ago, this was showed by some leading surgeons in the USA but a concept of improving results was not consistently pursued. Later, surgeons in Europe and Japan have increasingly adopted the more radical principle of complete mesocolic excision (CME) as the optimal approach for colon cancer. The concept of CME is a similar philosophy to that of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer and precise terminology and optimal surgery are key factors. METHOD There are three essential components to CME. The main component involves a dissection between the mesenteric plane and the parietal fascia and removal of the mesentery within a complete envelope of mesenteric fascia and visceral peritoneum that contains all lymph nodes draining the tumour area (Hohenberger et al., Colorectal Disease 11:354-365, 2009; West et al., J Clin Oncol 28:272-278, 2009). The second component is a central vascular tie to completely remove all lymph nodes in the central (vertical) direction. The third component is resection of an adequate length of bowel to remove involved pericolic lymph nodes in the longitudinal direction. RESULT The oncological rationale for CME and various technical aspects of the surgical management will be explored. CONCLUSION The consensus conference agreed that there are sound oncological hypotheses for a more radical approach than has been common up to now. However, this may not necessarily apply in early stages of the tumour stage. Laparoscopic resection appears to be equally well suited for resection as open surgery.","Søndenaa, K; Quirke, P; Hohenberger, W; Sugihara, K; Kobayashi, H; Kessler, H; Brown, G; Tudyka, V; D'Hoore, A; Kennedy, R H; West, N P; Kim, S H; Heald, R; Storli, K E; Nesbakken, A; Moran, B",International journal of colorectal disease,618,12

Some of these are undoubtedly the aftermath of the developing inflammation and increased coagulation processes. However, there is also a group of symptoms that derive from possible autoimmune processes. These include primary hyperkinetic movement disorders such as myoclonus, ataxia, opsoclonus, and tremors. This study systematically reviews scientific reports presenting patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders as one of the neurological symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS The available literature was systematically reviewed as per the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). The PubMed database was used in the range from 1 April, 2020, to 31 July, 2021. RESULTS The PubMed database search identified 102 cases of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed hyperkinetic movement disorders. After excluding patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (n = 46) and a few other cases (n = 7), a group of 49 non-intubated patients was obtained. The mean age of the patients was 57.92 years, and 75.51% of the patients were male. The most common hyperkinetic movement disorders were ataxia (83.67%), myoclonus (67.35%), and tremor (30.61%). Symptoms appeared on average within two weeks of the first symptoms of infection. Most patients had symptoms significantly reduced or withdrawn (67.44%) or early partial improvement (30.23%). CONCLUSIONS Based on the meta-analysis, it can be concluded that hyperkinetic movement disorders in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection are an early symptom with a potential autoimmune background. They have a good prognosis with the applied treatment. Further observations are needed to determine their frequency and the most effective methods of treatment.","Hirschfeld, Adam S",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,618,8

The aim of this study was to compare simultaneously surgical performance in single-port versus multiport approaches, and small versus large working spaces. METHODS Ten novice, 4 intermediate, and 1 expert surgeons were recruited from a university hospital. A preclinical randomized crossover study design was implemented, comparing performance under the following conditions: (1) multiport approach and large working space, (2) multiport approach and intermediate working space, (3) single-port approach and large working space, (4) single-port approach and intermediate working space, and (5) single-port approach and small working space. In each case, participants performed a peg transfer and pattern cutting tasks, and each task repetition was scored. RESULTS Intermediate and expert surgeons performed significantly better than novices in all conditions (P < .05). Performance in single-port surgery was significantly worse than multiport surgery (P < .01). In multiport surgery, there was a nonsignificant trend toward worsened performance in the intermediate versus large working space. In single-port surgery, there was a converse trend; performances in the intermediate and small working spaces were significantly better than in the large working space. CONCLUSIONS Single-port approaches were significantly more technically challenging than multiport approaches, possibly reflecting loss of instrument triangulation. Surprisingly, in single-port approaches, in which triangulation was no longer a factor, performance in large working spaces was worse than in intermediate and small working spaces.","Marcus, Hani J; Seneci, Carlo A; Hughes-Hallett, Archie; Cundy, Thomas P; Nandi, Dipankar; Yang, Guang-Zhong; Darzi, Ara",Surgical innovation,618,23

We analysed tumours with pl and evaluated the relationship between the PLC status and pl. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 428 surgically treated patients who had been diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer with pl and had their PLC status examined between 2000 and 2016. We investigated the influence of a PLC-positive status on the prognosis and searched for the factors predictive of a PLC-positive status. RESULTS Seventy-eight (18%) patients were PLC positive. The recurrence-free survival of PLC-positive patients was significantly worse than that of PLC-negative patients in pl1 and pl2, but not in pl3 (5-year recurrence-free survival rate, PLC positive versus PLC negative: pl1, 22.0% vs 60.0%, P = 0.002; pl2, 30.4% vs 59.7%, P = 0.015; pl3, 50.0% vs 59.6%, P = 0.427). A multivariable analysis showed that the degree of pl (pl2-3 versus pl1) [odds ratio (OR) 5.34, P < 0.001] was an independent predictive factor for PLC positivity. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positivity (OR 5.48, P = 0.042) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ≥5 ng/ml (OR 3.78, P = 0.042) were associated with a PLC-positive status in patients with pl2-3. We found that the PLC-positive rate in patients with pl2-3 was 35.6%; however, if the tumour was EGFR mutation positive and had CEA ≥5 ng/ml, the PLC-positive rate increased to 77%.

However, the LAA is an important source of natriuretic peptides and plays a role in left atrial reservoir function. Changes of HF biomarkers after LAAC compared to NOAC has not been studied. The aim of the study was to compare the changes in concentrations of heart failure (HF) biomarkers between left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and non-vitamin K anticoagulants (NOAC) patients. METHODS Of 402 patients randomized in the PRAGUE-17 trial, biomarkers were analyzed in 144 patients (73 in the NOAC and 71 in the LAAC group). Both groups had similar baseline characteristics. Serum concentration of NT-proBNP, NT-proANP, Galectin-3, and GDF-15 were measured at baseline (before the procedure in the LAAC group), at the 6-month (and at 24-month for NT-proBNP) follow-up timepoint. RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline, 6-month, and delta (δ = baseline - 6-month) concentrations of NT-proANP between the groups (NOAC: baseline 2.6 (0.5; 4.9), 6-month 3.1 (1.8; 4.8), p=0.068; LAAC: baseline 3.3 (1.1; 4.6), 6-month 2.6 (0.9; 5.3), p=0.51; p value for δ in concentrations between groups = 0.42). Similarly, there were no significant differences in baseline, 6-month, 24-monht and delta concentrations of NT-proBNP between the groups (NOAC: baseline 461.0 (113.5; 1342.0), 6-month 440.0 (120.5; 1291.5), 24-month 798 (274; 2236), p = 0.39; LAAC: baseline 421.0 (100.0; 1320.0), 6-month 601.0 (145.0; 1230.0), 24-month 855 (410; 1367), p=0.28; p value for δ in concentrations between groups = 0.73 at 6 months, and 0.58 at 24 months). Finally, no significant differences were present in baseline, 6-month, and δ concentrations of Galectin-3 and GDF-15 between the two groups.

Differences in processing techniques among biologic materials may impact hernia repair outcomes. This study evaluates the outcomes of hernia repair with a terminally sterilized human acellular dermal matrix (TS-HADM) (AlloMax(®) Surgical Graft, by C. R. Bard/Davol, Inc., Warwick, RI, USA) treated with low-dose gamma irradiation. METHODS A single-arm multi-center retrospective observational study of patients undergoing hernia repair with TS-HADM was performed. Data analyses were exploratory only; no formal hypothesis testing was pre-specified. RESULTS Seventy-eight patients (43F, 35M) underwent incisional hernia repair with a TS-HADM. Mean follow-up was 20.5 months. Preoperative characteristics include age of 56.6 ± 11.1 years, BMI 36.7 ± 9.9 kg/m(2), and mean hernia defect size 187 cm(2). Sixty-five patients underwent component separation technique (CST) with a reinforcing graft. Overall, 21.8% developed recurrences. Recurrences occurred in 15% of patients repaired with CST. Major wound complications occurred in 31% of patients overall. Based upon CDC surgical wound classification, major wound complications were seen in 26, 40, 56, and 50% of Class 1, 2, 3, and 4 wounds, respectively. No grafts required removal. CONCLUSIONS Hernia recurrences are not uncommon following complex abdominal wall reconstruction. Improved outcomes are seen when a TS-HADM is utilized as reinforcement to primary fascial closure.","Roth, J S; Brathwaite, C; Hacker, K; Fisher, K; King, J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,618,16

As a result, multi-board guide signs have been increasingly set up on expressways. The main aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the directional road sign displayed on multi and single-board signs on driver mental workload and behavior. 32 participants including 16 females (mean age = 24.7 years, standard deviation = 1.9 years) participated in the experiment and completed 3 driving simulation scenes. The setting of each scene-sign board was different: 1 board, 2 boards, and 3 boards. The driver needed to reach the designated destination according to the guidance of the road signs. Eye tracker was used to measure the fixation, saccade and electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to measure the alpha (8-13 hz) band absolute power in different signage scenarios. There are two major findings of the study. First, when the number of place names is less than or equal to 7, the multi-board sign generates more mental workload than the single-board sign does. The alpha band power of the driver's frontal area under the multiple boards is lower and affects driving performance (the deceleration is greater). Second, when the number of place names is more than 7, there is no significant difference in the effect on mental workload whether multi or single-board sign is used. However, compared to the single-board sign, drivers in the case of multi-board sign are likely to reduce the fixation duration and increase the number of saccades. The results suggest that it is not necessary to use multi-board signs when the number of place names is less than 7. These findings provide more safety considerations for the setting of multi-board guide signs in the future.","Yang, Yanqun; Chen, Yubin; Wu, Changxu; Easa, Said M; Lin, Wei; Zheng, Xinyi",Accident; analysis and prevention,618,12

The aim of this systematic review was to characterize the demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and histologic features of LyE in observational studies of adult and pediatric patients. DESIGN We searched the Embase, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS databases for relevant studies in 2018. Two authors reviewed and extracted data from studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS We identified 20 studies for analysis of demographic, clinical, and endoscopic features of LyE. The mean age ranged from 9 to 67 years. When pooled, there were 231 (52.7%) patients with LyE that were female. The most common presenting symptom was dysphagia reported in 191 (48.8%) patients. On endoscopy, most patients with LyE tended to have abnormal findings (69.0%), which included erosive esophagitis, multiple esophageal rings, linear furrows, and narrow-caliber esophagus. In the 31 studies used to assess the histologic definition, the cut-off number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) was reported in 16 (51.6%) studies, peripapillary IEL specification in 18 (58.1%) studies, and presence of spongiosis in 6 (19.4%) studies.

DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE and EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus via EBSCO were searched from inception to 22 May 2018. STUDY SELECTION Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of adults with base of thumb osteoarthritis investigating an injection-based intervention with any comparator/s. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS Data were extracted and checked for accuracy and completeness by pairs of reviewers. Primary outcomes were pain and function. Comparative treatment effects were analysed by random-effects model for short-term and medium-term follow-up. RESULTS In total, 9 RCTs involving 504 patients were identified for inclusion. All compared different injection-based therapies with each other, no studies compared an injection-based therapy with a non-injection-based intervention. Twenty injection-based intervention groups were present within these nine trials, consisting of hyaluronic acid (n=9), corticosteroid (n=7), saline placebo (n=3) and dextrose (n=1). Limited meta-analysis was possible due to the heterogeneity in the injections and outcomes used, as well as incomplete outcome data. Meta-analysis of two RCTs (92 patients) demonstrated reduced Visual Analogue Scale pain on activity with corticosteroid versus hyaluronic acid (mean difference (MD) -1.32, 95% CI -2.23 to -0.41) in the medium term, but no differences in other measures of pain or function in the short term and medium term. Overall, the available evidence does not suggest that any of the commonly used injection therapies are superior to placebo, one another or a non-injection-based comparator. CONCLUSION Current evidence is equivocal regarding the use of injection therapy in base of thumb osteoarthritis, both in terms of which injection-based therapy is the most effective and in terms of whether any injection-based therapy is more effective than other non-injection-based interventions. Given limited understanding of both the short-term and long-term effects, there is a need for a large, methodologically robust RCT investigating the commonly used injection therapies and comparing them with other therapeutic options and placebo.

METHODS Active prospective surveillance using the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit with monthly reporting by pediatricians of national demographic and clinical data on children with <15 years of age hospitalized with severe complications of laboratory-confirmed influenza during ten influenza seasons 2008-2017. RESULTS Of 722 children notified, 613 had laboratory-confirmed influenza and at least one severe complication. Most (60%) were <5 years of age; 10% were <6 months, hence ineligible for vaccination. Almost half of all cases were admitted to ICU and 30 died. Most children were previously healthy: 40.3% had at least one underlying medical condition. Sixty-five different severe complications were reported; pneumonia was the most common, occurring in over half of all cases. Influenza A accounted for 68.6% hospitalizations; however, influenza B was more often associated with acute renal failure (P = 0.014), rhabdomyolysis (P = 0.019), myocarditis (P = 0.015), pericarditis (P = 0.013), and cardiomyopathy (P = 0.035). Children who died were more likely to be older (5-14 years), have underlying medical conditions, be admitted to ICU, and have encephalitis, acute renal failure, or myocarditis. Only 36.1% of all children reported received antiviral medications, and 8.5% were known to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza. CONCLUSIONS Severe influenza complications cause morbidity and mortality in children, which may increase if coinfection with COVID-19 occurs in the 2020 season and beyond. Increased vaccination rates, even in healthy children, early diagnosis and timely antiviral treatment are needed to reduce severe complications and death.","Teutsch, Suzy M; Zurynski, Yvonne A; Nunez, Carlos; Lester-Smith, David; Festa, Marino; Booy, Robert; Elliott, Elizabeth J",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,618,8

Indeed, CD20, CD38, CD22 and HER2/neu could constitute therapeutic targets. However, few studies have reported on the expression level of these markers. Such investigations would be useful to appreciate the potential efficacy/toxicity of immunotherapies targeting these antigens. Indeed, a cohort of 125 B-ALL patients (1-25 years old) was retrospectively enrolled, for whom the same multiparametric flow cytometry assay had been performed over the whole period, allowing for fluorescence intensities comparison. CD20, CD38 and CD22 were expressed in respectively 53,6%, 99,2% 98,4% of the cases, rather homogeneously and at intermediate levels. HER2/neu, a marker of breast cancer also expressed in a subset of ALL, was present in 16 samples (13,4%), but not detectable on hematogones. Interestingly, in this subgroup, patients had a significantly lower 5-year EFS compared to patients without expression of HER2/neu (63,0% versus 80,5%, p=0.02). In conclusion, these 4 antigens could be alternatives of interest especially since CD19 can be downmodulated after current therapies targeting this antigen. Trastuzumab could also be a potential interesting immunotherapy in the HER2/neu expressing group, especially in relapsed childhood ALL. This article is protected by copyright.

A relative reliability study in prospective samples of community dwellers and rehabilitation centre residents was undertaken in order to validate the translation. In terms of nocturia severity, these groups were considered to be representative of patients at both ends of the scale, and therefore suitable validation purposes. Patients and Methods The prospective descriptive study took place between 07 and 09/2020. Fifty residents in a rehabilitation centre and thirty-seven community dwellers were included in the study. All participants had more than one episode of nocturia per night. They were asked to complete the newly translated TANGO-Gr Questionnaire twice (test-retest procedure). TANGO-Gr includes three possible answers (""yes"", ""no"", and ""DK/NA"") to facilitate increased validity. The study group evaluated the socio and demographic characteristics, the level of independence and the comprehensive frailty of all participants. Results Both groups satisfactorily completed questionnaire responses. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.753 (community-dwelling people: 0.776; rehabilitation centre residents: 0.531). A test-retest statistical analysis to determine reliability found an overall median Kappa of 0.88 (IQR: 0.79-0.94) in community dwellers and 0.91 (IQR: 0.84-1.00) in rehabilitation centre residents, thereby confirming an almost perfect respective agreement. Conclusion The validity of the newly translated TANGO-Gr Questionnaire was proven. It should be considered to be a reliable, self-administered screening tool suitable for clinical practice, and therefore invaluable for Greek-speaking people. The study also determined that certain environment-related variables may contribute to nocturia in rehabilitation centre populations, which is a finding which invites further study.","Zachariou, Athanasios; Filiponi, Maria; Kaltsas, Aris; Dimitriadis, Fotios; Sapouna, Vagia; Giannakis, Ioannis; Mamoulakis, Charalampos; Karagiannis, Andreas; Zikopoulos, Athanasios; Paschopoulos, Minas; Takenaka, Atsushi; Sofikitis, Nikolaos",Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare,618,16

Investigations on inhibitory/facilitatory modulation of vision, touch and pain show that conditioning stimuli outside the receptive field of testing stimuli modulate the central processing of visual, touch and painful stimuli. We asked whether contextual modulation also exists in human temperature integration. What is the main finding and its importance? Progressive decreases in whole-body mean skin temperature (the conditioning stimulus) significantly increased local thermosensitivity to skin warming but not cooling (the testing stimuli) in a dose-dependent fashion. In resembling the central mechanisms underlying endogenous analgesia, our findings point to the existence of an endogenous thermosensory system in humans that could modulate local skin thermal sensitivity to facilitate thermal behaviour. Although inhibitory/facilitatory central modulation of vision and pain has been investigated, contextual modulation of skin temperature integration has not been explored. Hence, we tested whether progressive decreases in whole-body mean skin temperature (Tsk ; a large conditioning stimulus) alter the magnitude estimation of local warming and cooling stimuli applied to hairy and glabrous skin. On four separate occasions, eight men (27 ± 5 years old) underwent a 30 min whole-body cooling protocol (water-perfused suit; temperature, 5°C), during which a quantitative thermosensory test, consisting of reporting the perceived magnitude of warming and cooling stimuli (±8°C from 30°C baseline) applied to the hand (palm/dorsum) and foot (sole/dorsum), was performed before cooling and every 10 min thereafter. The cooling protocol resulted in large progressive reductions in Tsk [10 min, -3.36°C (95% confidence interval -2.62 to -4.10); 20 min, -5.21°C (-4.47 to -5.95); and 30 min, -6.32°C (-5.58 to -7.05); P < 0.001], with minimal changes (∼0.08°C) in rectal temperature. While thermosensitivity to local skin cooling remained unchanged (P = 0.831), sensitivity to skin warming increased significantly at each level of Tsk for all skin regions [10 min, +4.9% (-1.1 to +11.0); 20 min, +6.1% (+0.1-12.2); and 30 min, +7.9% (+1.9-13.9); P = 0.009]. Linear regression indicated a 1.2% °C-1 increase in warm thermosensitivity with whole-body skin cooling. Overall, large decreases in Tsk significantly facilitated warm but not cold sensory processing of local thermal stimuli, in a dose-dependent fashion. In highlighting a novel feature of human temperature integration, these findings point to the existence of an endogenous thermosensory system that could modulate local skin thermal sensitivity in relationship to whole-body thermal states.","Filingeri, Davide; Morris, Nathan B; Jay, Ollie",Experimental physiology,618,31

METHODS In an open randomized controlled trial, 47 employed patients were allocated to US-guided carpal tunnel release (USCTR) and 42 to an open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) procedure. The main outcome was symptom severity measured by the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire (BCTQ-S). Secondary outcomes were hand functionality (BCTQ-F), nerve conduction, two-point discrimination, handgrip and pinch strength, pain (visual analog scale), work leave and complications. For BCTQ-S and BCTQ-F, minimal clinically important differences (MCID) were also considered. Follow-up duration was 12 months. RESULTS Mixed model analyses detected no significant differences between the two treatment arms in BCTQ-S (P = .098) while BCTQ-F scores were significantly better in the USCTR group (P = .007). This benefit was, however, not supported by the MCID data. Remaining variables were similar in the two groups except pain which was lower in USCTR at 3 months follow-up. All variables but two-point discrimination showed significant improvement after 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Our findings reveal similar symptom relief benefits following OCTR or USCTR in these patients.

The aim of this study was to report our initial experience with SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair in 100 patients by a single-port laparoscopic surgeon who had no prior experience of conventional TEP hernia repair. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between October 2012 and December 2013, 100 patients underwent SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair by a single surgeon. The procedures that were performed in the preperitoneal space did not differ from those in conventional TEP repair. Patient demographics, type of hernia, and operative and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. Also, we compared the results of current series with the data of the other studies for single-port TEP inguinal hernia repair. RESULTS Among the 100 patients, SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair was successful in 99 patients; 1 patient required additional incisions for inserting the trocar. The mean operative time and postoperative length of stay were 97.8 minutes (range, 55-185 minutes) and 1.3 days (range, 1-4 days), respectively. In the current series, the operation time was longer than those in the other studies for SPLS TEP repair. Recurrent hernia, history of lower abdominal surgery, and peritoneal tear during the operation were significantly associated with prolonged operation time. The other data, including perioperative complications, were similar. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, the transition from standard hernioplasty to SPLS TEP inguinal hernia repair by an experienced SPLS surgeon was feasible.

This study investigated the therapeutic effects of Qu Du Qiang Fei I Hao Fang (QDQF1) ""Eliminating Virus and Strengthening Lung-No.1 Formula,"" in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. QDQF1 consists of Shēng Huáng Qí, Běi Shā Shēn, Chuān Jié Gěng, Zhì Fáng Fēng, Qīng Lián Qiáo, Jīn Yín Huā, Bǎn Lán Gēn, Chǎo Cāng Zhú, Zǐ Huā Dì Dīng, and Shēng gān căo. Materials and Methods: A literature survey was performed by conducting systematic electronic searches in PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and in books. Results: Each herb in this formula has long been used to treat various diseases due to their pharmacologic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects that inhibit microbial adherence to mucosal or epithelial surfaces, inhibit endotoxin shock, and selectively inhibit microbial growth. Conclusion: The herbs chosen for the QDQF1 formula have been historically paired, and cast a wide net over the potential COVID-19 symptomatology. Their combined functions provide comprehensive and balanced therapeutics from both TCM and allopathic perspectives. Individual herbs and herbal combinations are analyzed for their applicability to pertinent TCM patterns of COVID-19 presentations, including heat and cold patterns, damp and phlegm syndromes, toxicity, and deficiency patterns.

A total of 18 participants including 10 persons with dementia and eight family caregivers participated in five focus groups held in two urban cities in Canada. All focus group deliberations were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed in five stages using a semantic thematic approach. All participants expressed some form of engagement in ACP, but understandings were limited and divergence was expressed regarding the timing of more expansive conversations about future care. Although some persons with dementia were ready to engage in future care discussions, most preferred focusing on the present and suggested their families did not require direction. This placed families in the complex dilemma of protecting their loved ones while compromising their own needs for dialogue. Although individually focused models of ACP engagement hold promise for those persons with dementia ready to engage in future planning, our findings suggest that early engagement of families in the reflective process may go a long way in supporting ACP activation. Our findings further suggest that persons with dementia who do not have close family/friends may require extensive ACP encouragement and support from service providers.","Sussman, Tamara; Pimienta, Rebecca; Hayward, April",Dementia,618,16

Minimizing cervical spine movement with manual in-line stabilization is essential for patients with cervical spine injuries such as multiple trauma. However, the intubation time of the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet and complications associated with intubation in patients with manual in-line stabilization in the neutral-head and head-lift positions remain unclear. METHODS Patients (20-80 years old) who were scheduled to undergo surgery that required general anesthesia with tracheal intubation were randomly allocated to either a neutral-head (n = 62) or a head-lift position (n = 62) group. Manual in-line stabilization was performed to limit cervical spine mobility. We aimed to evaluate orotracheal intubation time and success rate in these 2 positions with the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet. RESULTS Intubation was faster in the head-lift than in the neutral-head position (20 ± 10 and 25 ± 13 seconds, respectively, P = .000); intubation was equally successful in the 2 positions (96.8% vs 96.8%). Responses to intubation did not differ between positions (heart rate, P = .142; visual analog scale scores for throat soreness, P = .54). The only significant predictor of intubation time was the body mass index in the head-lift position group (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Intubation using the Trachway Videolight Intubating Stylet with manual in-line stabilization is faster in the head-lift position, and therefore preferable. However, if the head-lift position is not suitable, the neutral-head position is a sensible alternative, with comparable intubation success rate, heart rate change, and postoperative throat soreness.","Chan, Wei-Hung; Cheng, Chiao-Pei; Chiu, Yu-Lung; Hsu, Yung-Chi; Hu, Mei-Hua; Huang, Go-Shine",Medicine,618,7

Here we reported the mental health status of Chinese residents as well as the community's prevention and control during the pandemic period of COVID-19 and further explored the influencing factors of mental status. Methods In this cross-sectional study, convenience sampling and snowball sampling methods were adopted from February 16 to February 23, 2020, and Chinese community residents were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Three questionnaires, including General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and a self-designed ""Community prevention and control questionnaire"", were used. A multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to analyze the impact factors of anxiety and depression. Results A total of 3,001 community residents were included in this study. In total, 85.6% and 83.7% of participants had minimal anxiety and depression, respectively. Among all the community residents, 16.6% of participants proved that the communities they lived in had confirmed cases. 95.3% of participants reported that the residents were screened for mobility and contact history. 97.8% of participants reported the entrance and exit of the community were managed in their communities. There were 97.5% and 99% of participants needed to take body temperature and wear masks in their communities. Ninety-two percent (92%) of communities have their public areas and facilities disinfected daily, and 95.4% of communities have conducted health education about COVID-19. Factors including gender, education level, chronic illness, the frequency of going out, achieving information about COVID-19 by community and newspaper, and confirmed cases in the community, show association with community residents' anxiety and depression. Conclusions The vast majority of Chinese residents have little anxiety and depression, and most communities have adopted standardized control measures following the government's regulations and policy, which plays a vital role in the control of COVID-19 and improving residents' anxiety and depression.","Li, Simin; Ye, Zhiyu; Du, Chunping; Wei, Quan; He, Chengqi",Annals of translational medicine,618,24

BACKGROUND Previous studies into the effects of HS boots on postural control have produced controversial results. Some studies reported postural control impairments with ski boots in bipedal postural tasks due to ankle movement restrictions without quantifying the actual restrictive effect of these boots and specifying the adaptations of the postural control system. METHOD Eighteen young healthy subjects took part in the experiment. Bilateral postural control was assessed on stable and unstable surfaces, while standing barefoot or wearing ski boots. Center of pressure (COP) parameters, ankle, knee, and hip joints movements were calculated and EMG activity from main postural muscles was recorded. RESULTS Ski boots did not restrict the amplitude of ankle angular movements and largely impacted COP parameters and EMG activity on stable ground. In conditions of mediolateral instability, COP data illustrated an enhanced postural control in the frontal plane when wearing ski boots. CONCLUSIONS Ski boots do not affect bipedal postural balance by restricting the ankle angular motions but induce complex adaptations of the postural control system which combine factors of a mechanical, motor, and sensorial nature. They impede postural control mainly when standing on stable ground without producing similar deleterious effects on unstable surfaces. APPLICATION Our results show that HS boots as ski boots can improve lateral balance on unstable surfaces, which can contribute to prevent fall risk and ankle sprain.","Noé, Frédéric; García-Massó, Xavier; Ledez, Damien; Paillard, Thierry",Human factors,618,24

Entry is mediated by the viral membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA), which triggers membrane fusion and genome release under acidic conditions in the endosome. In addition to changes in the receptor binding domain, the acid stability of HA has been linked to the successful transmission of virus between avian and human hosts. However, to fully understand the connection between changes in HA and host tropism, additional factors relevant to HA structure-function and membrane fusion are also likely to be important. Using single-particle-tracking (SPT) techniques, individual membrane fusion events can be observed under specific conditions, which provide detailed information regarding HA pH sensitivity and acid stability and the rate and extent of membrane fusion. This provides a comparative way to characterize and distinguish influenza virus fusion properties among virus strains. We used SPT to quantify the fusion properties of three H3 influenza strains: A/Aichi/68/H3N2 (X:31), A/Udorn/72/H3N2 (Udorn), and A/Brisbane/07/H3N2 (Brisbane). The rate of fusion for the most clinically relevant strain, Brisbane, is generally insensitive to decreasing pH, while the fusion of the egg-adapted strains Udorn and X:31 is strongly dependent on pH (and is faster) as the pH decreases. All strains exhibit similar acid stability (the length of time that they remain fusogenic in an acidic environment) at higher pHs, but the egg-adapted strains become less acid stable at lower pHs. Thus, it appears that the laboratory-adapted H3 strains tested may have evolved to compensate for the faster HA deactivation at low pH, with a commensurate increase in the rate of fusion and number of proteins facilitating fusion, relative to the Brisbane strain. IMPORTANCE The ability of influenza virus to release its genome under different acidic conditions has recently been linked to the transmission of influenza virus between different species. However, it is yet to be determined how acid-induced membrane fusion varies with virus strain and influences tropism. The results presented here are the results of an intra-H3-subtype study of acid stability and fusion kinetics. Using a single-particle-tracking (SPT) technique, we show here that the highest pH that initiates fusion is not necessarily the pH at which the kinetics of fusion is fastest and most abundant for a given strain. Strains exhibit different fusion behaviors, as evidenced by their unique kinetic trends; pH sensitivities, as evidenced by the differences when the first fusion events commence; and HA stabilities, as evidenced by the length of time that virions can persist in an acidic environment and still be fusion competent.","Costello, Deirdre A; Whittaker, Gary R; Daniel, Susan",Journal of virology,618,16

The theoretical basis is that steam may help congested mucus drain better and heat may destroy the cold virus as it does in vitro. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of inhaling heated water vapour (steam) in the treatment of the common cold by comparing symptoms, viral shedding and nasal resistance. SEARCH STRATEGY In this updated review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1966 to July Week 1, 2010), EMBASE (1990 to July 2010) and Current Contents (1994 to July 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using heated water vapour in participants with the common cold or participants with experimentally-induced common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We reviewed all retrieved articles and excluded any articles, editorials and abstracts with inadequate outcome descriptions. The studies we included were subjected to a methodological assessment. MAIN RESULTS Six trials (394 trial participants) were included. Three trials in which patient data could be pooled found benefits of steam for symptom relief for the common cold (odds ratio (OR) 0.31; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.60). However, results on symptom indices were equivocal. No studies demonstrated an exacerbation of clinical symptom scores. One study conducted in the USA demonstrated worsened nasal resistance, while an earlier Israeli study showed improvement. One study examined viral shedding and antibody titres in nasal washings; there was no change in either between treatment and placebo groups. Minor side effects (including discomfort or irritation of the nose) were reported in some studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Steam inhalation has not shown any consistent benefits in the treatment of the common cold, hence is not recommended in the routine treatment of common cold symptoms until more double-blind, randomized trials with a standardised treatment modality are conducted.","Singh, Meenu; Singh, Manvi",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,618,1

OBJECTIVE Our objective was to explore the motivational factors and barriers to recruitment and participation in clinical trials among postmenopausal women with POP who are intending to have surgical management. DESIGN Qualitative study based on in-depth face-to-face interviews with postmenopausal women attending urogynaecology clinics in the UK intending to have surgical management for pelvic organ prolapse. These women were eligible to participate in the on-going clinical trial on the use of local vaginal oestrogen as an adjunct to surgical treatment. Twenty-two postmenopausal women aged 52-76 years were interviewed. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis method. RESULTS Many women participated because of altruistic motivations; however, we found that clarity of information provided, timing of approach and acceptability of study design played a pivotal role in women. Of the women who declined participation, the following themes emerged: uncertainty of the investigational product, fear of experimentation, logistical concerns and regret that their condition was trivialised at an early stage. CONCLUSION We have gained a valuable insight into women's views and experience in the decision making process. Understanding the elements that will enhance trial participation such as clarity of information provided, balance between professional guidance whilst maintaining equipoise, easy access to trial teams and timing of approach will ultimately enable us to improve our recruitment to clinical trials.","Verghese, Tina Sara; Merriel, Abigail; Leighton, Lisa; Latthe, Pallavi",International urogynecology journal,618,5

Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS A preclinical and short-term prospective study was performed. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 5 groups, with 4 rabbits per group, each receiving a different concentration of Artemia salina. In each rabbit, an extract of Artemia salina (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) was randomly instilled in one eye and saline solution (negative control) in the other eye. Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured before and after the instillation of 5 drops per eye (1 drop per hour) on the same day. RESULTS In tear secretion, there was an increase of 43.88 ± 6.73% with 4% Artemia salina in comparison with its baseline measurement (P = 0.049). The rest of the groups did not show differences (P ≥ 0.05). For tear break-up time, none of the groups showed differences (P ≥ 0.05), while for corneal staining score, there was an improvement of 0.88 ± 0.83 with 4% Artemia salina (P = 0.038) and a deterioration of 0.50 ± 0.83 with control solution (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Short-term instillation of eye drops with 4% Artemia salina produced both stimulation of tear secretion and a slight improvement of physiological corneal staining. Besides, all the doses of up to 10% Artemia salina did not produce undesirable side effects on the ocular surface. Therefore, these eye drops are presented as a possible new treatment for dry eye due to their secretagogue properties and ocular surface regeneration.","Carpena-Torres, Carlos; Pintor, Jesús; Huete-Toral, Fernando; Rodriguez-Pomar, Candela; Martínez-Águila, Alejandro; Carracedo, Gonzalo",Current eye research,618,28

METHODS In a prospective study, 25 consecutive patients (15 men; mean age 74±4 years) undergoing protected CAS were enrolled and underwent high-definition (homoaxial resolution 10 µm) OCT image acquisition before stent deployment, immediately after stent placement, and following postdilation of the stent (3 scans/patient). Pullbacks were started during a nonocclusive flush, mechanically injecting 24 mL of 50% diluted contrast at 6 mL/s to displace blood from the artery. Two independent physicians judged the quality of images on a predefined 1-10 scale. The proportions of specific agreement and kappa values (κ) were calculated. RESULTS No procedural or in-hospital neurological complications occurred (any stroke/death 0%). The technical success of OCT pullbacks was 97.3% (73/75). The total amount of contrast was 86±18 mL/patient. No significant alteration in glomerular filtration rate or any other significant adverse event occurred. The images obtained were of high quality (mean value 8.1 out of 10), with good inter- and intraobserver agreement (κ = 0.81-0.87 and κ = 0.95, respectively). OCT images revealed innovative features such as rupture of the fibrous cap, plaque prolapse, and stent malapposition in a high percentage of the patients (range 24%-100%). CONCLUSION Intravascular OCT during a nonocclusive flush appears to be feasible and safe in carotid arteries. Since some original and unexpected information after CAS has been made available for the first time at such a high definition, future studies with OCT should focus on the interaction between carotid plaque and stent design, which might revolutionize our understanding of the mechanisms of carotid stenting, as well as influence our clinical policies.","Setacci, Carlo; de Donato, Gianmarco; Setacci, Francesco; Galzerano, Giuseppe; Sirignano, Pasqualino; Cappelli, Alessandro; Palasciano, Giancarlo",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,618,16

In order to understand the chemical behavior of the ISM and specific cases like the missing sulfur reservoir, a detailed chemical molecular composition in the ISM must be mapped out. Aims Our goal is to investigate the rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide, CH3CH2SCH3, which ms to be a potential candidate for observation in the ISM since the simpler analogs, CH3SH and CH3CH2SH, have already been detected. Rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide has been observed before, but its experimental rotational parameters are not precise enough to allow its detection in the ISM. Methods The rotational spectrum of ethyl methyl sulfide in the frequency range 72-116.5 GHz was measured using a broadband millimeter-wave spectrometer based on radio astronomy receivers with fast Fourier transform backends. The spectral searches and identification of the vibrational excited states of ethyl methyl sulfide was supported by high-level ab initio calculations on the harmonic and anharmonic force fields. Results The rotational spectra for the trans and gauche conformers of ethyl methyl sulfide was analyzed, and a total of 172 and 259 rotational transitions were observed for each one, respectively. The observation of A - E internal rotation splittings allowed the experimental determination of the V 3 hindered internal rotation barrier height for both trans and gauche species. In addition, the vibrational excited states, resulting from the lowest frequency vibrational mode ν 30 were identified for both conformers.

Here, we show that the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) induces the formation of autophagosomes. Induction was dependent on Atg5, involved processing of LC3 to LC3II, and led to a redistribution of LC3 from the cytosol to punctate vesicles indicative of authentic autophagosomes. Furthermore, FMDV yields were reduced in cells lacking Atg5, suggesting that autophagy may facilitate FMDV infection. However, induction of autophagosomes by FMDV appeared to differ from starvation, as the generation of LC3 punctae was not inhibited by wortmannin, implying that FMDV-induced autophagosome formation does not require the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity of vps34. Unlike other picornaviruses, for which there is strong evidence that autophagosome formation is linked to expression of viral nonstructural proteins, FMDV induced autophagosomes very early during infection. Furthermore, autophagosomes could be triggered by either UV-inactivated virus or empty FMDV capsids, suggesting that autophagosome formation was activated during cell entry. Unlike other picornaviruses, FMDV-induced autophagosomes did not colocalize with the viral 3A or 3D protein. In contrast, ∼50% of the autophagosomes induced by FMDV colocalized with VP1. LC3 and VP1 also colocalized with the cellular adaptor protein p62, which normally targets ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes. These results suggest that FMDV induces autophagosomes during cell entry to facilitate infection, but not to provide membranes for replication.","Berryman, Stephen; Brooks, Elizabeth; Burman, Alison; Hawes, Philippa; Roberts, Rebecca; Netherton, Christopher; Monaghan, Paul; Whelband, Matthew; Cottam, Eleanor; Elazar, Zvulun; Jackson, Terry; Wileman, Thomas",Journal of virology,618,20

In this review, we describe virological, clinical, epidemiological features and interim travel advice and guidelines regarding MERS-CoV. We compare and contrast these with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). RECENT FINDINGS MERS-CoV is a novel β CoV that causes a spectrum of clinical illness from asymptomatic to the rapidly fatal disease mainly in those with comorbid conditions. Epidemiological and genomic studies show zoonotic transmission to humans from camels and possibly bats. In contrast to the SARS-CoV pandemic, very limited global spread of fatal MERS-CoV has occurred outside the Arabian Peninsula. Although mainly currently restricted to Middle Eastern countries, MERS-CoV was reported from at least 10 other countries in Europe, Asia and the United States. All primary cases have been linked to travel to the Middle East. Nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred because of poor infection control measures. Specific molecular diagnostic tests are available. Currently, there are no specific drugs for prevention or treatment for MERS-CoV and vaccine development is in the early stages. Advice and guidance for travelers to the Middle East are updated regularly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). SUMMARY Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV threatens global health security. All physicians and travelers to the Middle East should be aware of the new threat caused by MERS-CoV and follow CDC and WHO guidelines.

There were fears that health services would not be able to care for high numbers of COVID-19 patients. AIM To describe and review the emergency response of a public primary and community health-care organisation in Stockholm, Sweden, to the demand for care for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during March-July 2020, and summarise preparations for the months to follow. METHODS This was a rapid implementation action research case study, which also draws on one author's experience as Chief Executive Officer and other members' experience in an emergency management group. RESULTS Sweden experienced similar mortality per million population to the UK, despite the different public health strategy used to address the COVID-19 outbreak. The Stockholm-integrated public primary and community health-care service, serving a population of 2.3 million, made many changes quickly. One change included coordinating non-acute private health-care services, following the local government emergency directive to do so. DISCUSSION It is possible that the fast and effective response by management and services in primary and community health care reduced infection and hospital demand, which contributed to a lower mortality than otherwise expected. The actions and preparations described for Stockholm's response may provide ideas for other health-care systems. The partnership research approach between the Karolinska Medical University and the Region Stockholm health-care system used in this project shows that rapid research methods have advantages for both partners in an emergency situation.","Ohrling, Mikael; Øvretveit, John; Lockowandt, Ulf; Brommels, Mats; Sparring, Vibeke",Journal of primary health care,618,1

Polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV S1 protein was generated in a rabbit immunized with the purified S1 protein. The reactivity of the antibody to the SARS-CoV S1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. ELISA indicated that the antibody against SARS-CoV S1 protein had no cross reaction with S1 proteins of transmissible gastroenteritis virus, a porcine coronavirus, and infectious bronchitis virus, an avian coronavirus. The SARS-CoV S1 protein and its antibody are valuable reagents for related studies.","Wang, Chao; Ren, Xiaofeng",Hybridoma,618,33

METHODS As part of a larger, chronic disease-focused, and ongoing longitudinal study designed to explore Ontario adults' health and wellness-related behaviors during the pandemic, participants completed an online survey that included demographic information and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI consists of 19 items, one of which is open-ended, designed to assess an individual's quantity, quality, and patterns of sleep on seven domains (ie, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction over the last month). Summative content analysis was used to analyze responses to the open-ended question regarding participants' sleep disturbances. RESULTS This study included 2192 individuals, 85% of whom slept 6+ hours/night. The mean global PSQI score was 7.57, out of a possible 21 (SD = 4.09). The self-reported sleep disturbances of largest concern were: (1) general fear/anxiety/worry (n = 203); (2) children (n = 167); (3) mind wandering/overthinking (n = 118); (4) pain/injury (n = 78); (5) partner (n = 78); and (6) fear/anxiety/stress related to COVID-19 (n = 74). CONCLUSION The global PSQI score was indicative of poor sleep quality, and Ontario adults experienced a number of sleep disturbances during early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings are noteworthy as sleep is a crucial component in positive health and wellbeing.","Shillington, Katie J; Vanderloo, Leigh M; Burke, Shauna M; Ng, Victor; Tucker, Patricia; Irwin, Jennifer D",Sleep medicine,618,8

The aims of this study were to evaluate the neutralizing antibody response of a cohort of healthy children <18 months old to RSV infection. During the RSV season, 89 healthy children <18 months old were enrolled and followed up weekly for 12 weeks. At each visit, a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for RSV detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During the study period, 2 blood samples were drawn and they were used to determine RSV geometric mean neutralizing antibody titres (GMT) against RSV. A total of 35 (39.3%) children had RSV detected during the study period. Among RSV-positive patients, children ≥7 months showed a significantly higher increase in antibody response (p<0.001). A significantly higher number of patients with a ≥4 -fold increase in GMT were ≥7 months old (p = 0.02) and presented lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) during the study period (p = 0.01). Viral shedding was longer among children aged ≥7 months (p = 0.06), those with viral load ≥10(6) copies/mL (p = 0.03), and those with LRTIs during the study period (p = 0.03), but it was not associated with the immune response (p = 0.41). In conclusion, natural RSV infection seems to evoke a low immune response in younger children. To be effective in this infant population, which is at highest risk of developing severe LRTIs, vaccines must be able to induce in the first months of life a stronger immune response than that produced by the natural infection.","Esposito, Susanna; Scarselli, Elisa; Lelii, Mara; Scala, Alessia; Vitelli, Alessandra; Capone, Stefania; Fornili, Marco; Biganzoli, Elia; Orenti, Annalisa; Nicosia, Alfredo; Cortese, Riccardo; Principi, Nicola",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,618,7

MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with adrenal metastases who underwent percutaneous image-guided adrenal ablation during the years 2003-2012 were identified. There were 32 patients with 37 adrenal tumors identified. Technical success, safety, local control, and survival were analyzed according to standard criteria. RESULTS In 32 patients (25 men and 7 women; mean age, 66 y; age range, 44-88 y) with 37 adrenal tumors, 35 ablation procedures were performed. One patient with an 8.2-cm tumor underwent planned cryoablation debulking fully anticipating untreated margins owing to close proximity of the pancreas (ie, the intent was to diminish tumor burden rather than a curative intervention). Of the 36 patients treated with curative intent, technical success was achieved in 35 (97%) tumors. Follow-up imaging was performed on 34 of 37 tumors (excluding patients with intentional debulking [n = 1], technical failure [n = 1], and absence of follow-up [n = 1]). Local recurrence developed in 3 (8.8%) of 34 tumors. Local tumor control was achieved in 31 lesions at a mean of 22.7 months of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival and overall survival at 36 months were 88% and 52%, respectively, with a median survival of 34.5 months. A Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 grade 3 or 4 complication was observed in three (8.6%) ablation procedures.

Whether similar benefits may be realized by patients with early PD, however, is currently unclear, especially given the potential risks of the procedure. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the relative efficacy and safety of DBS in comparison to best medical therapy (BMT) in the treatment of PD. It also aimed to compare the efficacy of DBS between patients with early and advanced PD. A systematic search was performed in Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DBS to BMT in PD patients were included. Outcome measures were impairment/disability using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), quality of life (QoL) using the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), levodopa equivalent dose (LED) reduction, and rates of serious adverse events (SAE). Eight eligible RCTs (n = 1,189) were included in the meta-analysis, two of which recruited early PD patients. Regarding efficacy outcomes, there were significant improvements in UPDRS, PDQ-39, and LED scores in favour of DBS (P < 0.00001). There was a significantly greater reduction of LED in patients with early PD (P < 0.00001), but no other differences between early and advanced PD patients were found. The risk of a patient experiencing an SAE was significantly higher in the DBS group (P = 0.005), as was the total number of SAEs (P < 0.00188). Overall, DBS was superior to BMT at improving impairment/disability, QoL, and reducing medication doses, but these benefits need to be weighed against the higher risk of SAEs. There was insufficient evidence to determine the impact of the PD stage on the efficacy of DBS.","Bratsos, Sosipatros; Karponis, Dimitrios; Saleh, Sohag N",Cureus,618,1

The diagnose was made on the basis of the symptoms, which were described by the patient, and confirmed by an antibody test in August 2020. Aim: Due to the public interest in knowing more about the cluster of symptoms and their implications for nursing, the patient and the author of this paper decided to present this case study to the professional audience. Methods: For the anamnesis, the patient's COVID-19 diary and an essay by her about her experiences with the National Health Service (NHS) were analysed and completed by information collected during a structured interview. Results: It became apparent that the nursing diagnoses ""Acute pain"" and ""Chronic pain"" stand at the forefront. These nursing diagnoses have not been discussed in the context of COVID-19 yet. Conclusions: This leads to the conclusion that nursing diagnoses, which are orientated towards an alleged lung disease, might not be complete when it comes to the complex disease process of COVID-19.

However, online health information is unregulated and highly variable. We aimed to assess the readability, understandability, and quality of online information available for ""chest pain in children."" This analysis was performed in January 2020, by inputting the search term ""chest pain in children"" into Google. The 180 search results were evaluated/categorized. The readability was assessed using the Flesch reading ease score, the Gunning FOG readability score, the Flesch-Kincaid grade level, the Coleman-Liau score, the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook readability score, the Fry readability score, and the automated readability index (ARI). The quality was assessed through the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria. The understandability was evaluated by the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) for this study. Sixty-five websites were analyzed (academic and hospital websites (n = 30), physicians and health information websites (n = 35)). Among all websites, the average reading grade level was 9.99. There was no statistical difference between the two groups for the average readability level (p: 0.645). The mean PEMAT score for all websites was 65.09%.

Although the role of robotics in hernia surgery is rapidly expanding, the benefits of a robotic approach for abdominal wall reconstruction have not been established well. We aimed to compare the impact of the application of robotics to the TAR procedure on the perioperative outcomes when compared to the open TAR repairs. METHODS Case-matched comparison of patients undergoing robotic TAR (R-TAR) at two specialized hernia centers to a matched historic cohort of open TAR (O-TAR) patients was performed. Outcome measures included patient demographics, operative details, postoperative complications, and length of hospitalization. RESULTS 38 consecutive patients undergoing R-TAR were compared to 76 matched O-TAR. Patient demographics were similar between the groups, but ASA III status was more prevalent in the O-TAR group. The average operative time was significantly longer in the R-TAR group (299 ± 95 vs.. 211 ± 63 min, p < 0.001) and blood loss was significantly lower for the R-TAR group (49 ± 60 vs. 139 ± 149 mL, p < 0.001). Wound morbidity was minimal in the R-TAR, but the rate of surgical site events and surgical site infection was not different between groups. Systemic complications were significantly less frequent in the R-TAR group (0 vs. 17.1%, p = 0.026). The length of hospitalization was significantly reduced in the R-TAR group (1.3 ± 1.3 vs. 6.0 ± 3.4 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In our early experience, robotic TAR was associated with longer operative times. However, we found that the use of robotics was associated with decreased intraoperative blood loss, fewer systemic complications, shorter hospitalizations, and eliminated readmissions. While long-term outcomes and patient selection criteria for robotic TAR repair are under investigations, we advocate selective use of robotics for TAR reconstructions in patients undergoing AWR.","Martin-Del-Campo, Luis A; Weltz, Adam S; Belyansky, Igor; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,618,6

We compared the prevalence of thought patterns between two independent real-world, experience-sampling cohorts, collected before and during lockdown.

During lockdown, when people were alone, social thinking was reduced, but on the rare occasions when social interactions were possible, we observed a greater increase in social thinking than prelockdown. Furthermore, lockdown was associated with a reduction in future-directed problem solving, but this thought pattern was reinstated when individuals engaged in work. Therefore, our study suggests that the lockdown led to significant changes in ongoing thought patterns in daily life and that these changes were associated with changes to our daily routine that occurred during lockdown.","Mckeown, Brontë; Poerio, Giulia L; Strawson, Will H; Martinon, Léa M; Riby, Leigh M; Jefferies, Elizabeth; McCall, Cade; Smallwood, Jonathan",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,618,16

An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90).

METHODS Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on the prolactin (PRL) and MAPK14 expressions of pituitary gland in C57BL/6 mice and human prolactinoma specimen. In the present study, the role of MAPK14 in prolactinoma was determined using estradiol-induced mice and dopamine D2 receptor knockout (DRD2-/-) mice models in C57BL/6 wild-type (WT), MAPK14-/- and DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice. GH3 cells were transfected with different sets of MAPK14 small interfering RNA, which to study MAPK14 and PRL expression in GH3 cells. RESULTS Immunofluorescence analysis showed that PRL and MAPK14 expression were colocalized and increased in the pituitary gland of mice and human prolactinoma specimen compared with the control specimen. It was shown that PRL and MAPK14 expression was colocalized and increased significantly in the pituitary gland of estradiol-injected prolactinoma mice compared with the control mice. Knockout of MAPK14 significantly inhibited tumor overgrowth, and PRL expression was decreased in estradiol-induced mice. Furthermore, MAPK14 knockout of DRD2-/-MAPK14+/- mice significantly reduced the overgrowth of pituitary gland and PRL production and secretion compared with DRD2-/- mice. MAPK14 knockout using siRNA inhibited PRL production in GH3 cells. CONCLUSION These results suggest that MAPK14 serves a promoting role in the formation of prolactinoma, and highlights the potential of MAPK14 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of prolactinoma.","Ding, Qiao-Yan; Zhang, Yu; Ma, Li; Chen, Yong-Gang; Wu, Jin-Hu; Zhang, Hong-Feng; Wang, Xiong",BMC endocrine disorders,618,22

Despite the widespread impact of this virus, no vaccine is currently available. For over 50 years, live attenuated vaccines (LAV) have been shown to protect against other childhood viral infections, offering the advantage of presenting all viral proteins to the immune system for stimulation of both B and T cell responses and memory. The RSV LAV candidate described here, rgRSV-L(G1857A)-G(L208A), contains two modifications: an attenuating mutation in the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding site of the viral mRNA cap methyltransferase (MTase) within the large (L) polymerase protein and a mutation in the attachment (G) glycoprotein that inhibits its cleavage during production in Vero cells, resulting in virus with a ""non-cleaved G"" (ncG). RSV virions containing the ncG have an increased ability to infect primary well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures which model the in vivo site of immunization, the ciliated airway epithelium. This RSV LAV candidate is produced efficiently in Vero cells, is highly attenuated in HBE cultures, efficiently induces neutralizing antibodies that are long-lasting, and provides protection against an RSV challenge in the cotton rat, without causing enhanced disease. Similar results were obtained in a rhesus macaque.Importance Globally, RSV is a major cause of death in children under one year of age, yet no vaccine is available. We have generated a novel RSV live attenuated vaccine candidate containing mutations in the L and G proteins. The L polymerase mutation does not inhibit virus yield in Vero cells, the cell type required for vaccine production, but greatly reduces virus spread in HBE cultures, a logical in vitro predictor of in vivo attenuation. The G attachment protein mutation reduces its cleavage in Vero cells, thereby increasing vaccine virus yield, making vaccine production more economical. In cotton rats, this RSV vaccine candidate is highly attenuated at a dose of 105 PFU and completely protective following immunization with 500 PFU, 200-fold less than the dose usually used in such studies. It also induced long-lasting antibodies in cotton rats and protected a rhesus macaque from RSV challenge. This mutant virus is an excellent RSV live attenuated vaccine candidate.","Jenkins, Tiffany; Wang, Rongzhang; Harder, Olivia; Xue, Miaoge; Chen, Phylip; Corry, Jacqueline; Walker, Christopher; Teng, Michael; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio; Niewiesk, Stefan; Li, Jianrong; Peeples, Mark E",Journal of virology,618,16

Dose escalation may be effective for reestablishing clinical response in Crohn's disease (CD). AIMS To perform a systematic review assessing the efficacy of escalated maintenance anti-TNF therapy in CD. METHODS EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases were searched for English language publications through to April 25, 2021. Full-text articles evaluating escalated maintenance treatment (infliximab or adalimumab) in adult CD patients were included. RESULTS A total of 4733 records were identified, and 68 articles met eligibility criteria. Rates of clinical response (33%-100%) and remission (15%-83%) after empiric dose escalation for loss of response to standard anti-TNF therapy were high but varied across studies. Dose intensification strategies (doubling the dose versus shortening the therapeutic interval) were similarly efficacious. Dose-escalated patients tended to have higher serum drug levels compared to those on standard dosing. An exposure-response relationship following dose escalation was found in a number of observational studies. Randomised controlled trials comparing therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to empiric treatment intensification have failed to reach their primary end-points. Strategies including Bayesian dashboard-dosing and early treatment escalation targeting biomarker normalisation were found to be associated with improved long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Empiric escalation of maintenance anti-TNF therapy can recapture clinical response in a majority of patients with secondary loss of response to standard maintenance doses. Proactive optimisation of maintenance dosing might prolong time to loss of response in some patients.","Mattoo, Vandita Y; Basnayake, Chamara; Connell, William R; Ding, Nik; Kamm, Michael A; Lust, Mark; Niewiadomski, Ola; Thompson, Alexander; Wright, Emily K",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,618,13

The NZWR has dual ophthalmic arteries (OA): the external OA (EOA) arises from the external carotid artery and the internal OA (IOA) from the internal carotid artery. We describe the technique that we have refined for OA catheterization in rabbits, and describe the angioanatomical variations in the OA supply to the NZWR eye and implications for IAC delivery, which were identified as part of a larger project exploring IAC effects in a rabbit retinoblastoma model. METHODS We developed techniques to perform angiography of the external and internal carotid arteries and superselective angiography of the EOA and IOA in NZWR using transfemoral access and a microwire/microcatheter system. EOA and IOA supply to the eye was determined angiographically and recorded before selective OA catheterization and angiography. RESULTS 114 rabbits underwent carotid angiographic evaluation and OA catheterization (161 total eyes evaluated, 112 right, 49 left). Most eyes had a single dominant arterial supply; either IOA or EOA. EOA was dominant in 73% (118/161), and IOA was dominant in 17% (27/161). Co-dominant supply was seen in 10% (16/161). Of the rabbits with bilateral OA catheterization, 25/47 (53%) had bilateral dominant EOA. CONCLUSION Successful catheterization of the OA in the NZWR can be readily accomplished with nuanced technique. The external OA is the dominant arterial supply in the majority of NZWR eyes. These findings allow for successful reproduction of OA catheterization studies of IAC for retinoblastoma in NZWR.","Froehler, Michael T; Feldman, Michael J; Poitras, Bryan; Daniels, Anthony B",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,618,1

Here, we report the experiences of 60 consecutive liver donors undergoing pure laparoscopic donor hepatectomy (PLDH), with most undergoing right hepatectomy. None of the 60 donors who underwent PLDH had intraoperative complications and none required transfusions, reoperation, or conversion to open hepatectomy. Forty-five donors who underwent PLDRH between November 2015 and December 2016 were compared with 42 who underwent conventional donor right hepatectomy (CDRH) between May 2013 and February 2014. The total operation time was longer (330.7 vs 280.0 minutes; P < .001) and the percentage with multiple bile duct openings was higher (53.3% vs 26.2%; P = .010) in the PLDRH group. However, the length of postoperative hospital stay (8.4 vs 8.2 days; P = .495) and rate of complications (11.9% vs 8.9%; P = .733) and re-hospitalizations (4.8% vs 4.4%; P = 1.000) were similar in both groups.

The flexible design of LHCII underlies a photoprotective mechanism whereby this complex switches to a dissipative state in response to high light stress, allowing the rapid dissipation of excess excitation energy (non-photochemical quenching, NPQ). In this work, we locked single LHCII trimers in a quenched conformation after immobilization of the complexes in polyacrylamide gels to impede protein interactions. A comparison of their pigment excited-state dynamics with quenched LHCII aggregates in buffer revealed the presence of a new spectral band at 515 nm arising after chlorophyll excitation. This is suggested to be the signature of a carotenoid excited state, linked to the quenching of chlorophyll singlet excited states. Our data highlight the marked sensitivity of pigment excited-state dynamics in LHCII to structural changes induced by the environment.","Saccon, Francesco; Durchan, Milan; Bína, David; Duffy, Christopher D P; Ruban, Alexander V; Polívka, Tomáš",iScience,618,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS For this retrospective HIPAA-compliant study, institutional review board approval was obtained and the requirement for informed consent was waived. Restrictive GBCA guidelines were adopted in May 2007. The guidelines (a) require a recent serum creatinine level measurement in any patient who is aged 60 years or older and/or at risk for renal disease, (b) limit the maximal weight-based GBCA dose administered to any patient with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) lower than 60 mL/min/m(2) to 20 mL, and (c) prohibit the administration of any GBCA in patients who have an eGFR lower than 30 mL/min/m(2) and/or are undergoing chronic dialysis treatment (except in emergency situations). The electronic medical records were searched for all contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations performed during the post-guidelines adoption period between January 2008 and March 2010 and the pre-guidelines adoption and transitional period between January 2002 and December 2007. Separate pathology records were searched for biopsy-confirmed cases of NSF during the same study periods. The incidences of NSF during the pre-guidelines adoption and transitional period and post-guidelines adoption period were compared by using the paired Z test. RESULTS A total of 52,954 contrast-enhanced MR examinations were performed during the post-guidelines adoption period. Of these 52,954 examinations, 46,464 (88%) were performed in adult patients with an eGFR of 60 mL/min/m(2) or higher or presumed normal renal function and 6454 (12%) were performed in patients with an eGFR of 30-59 mL/min/m(2). Thirty-six patients with an eGFR lower than 30 mL/min/m(2) underwent contrast-enhanced MR imaging for emergent indications. Review of the pathology records for January 2008 to September 2010 revealed no new cases of NSF resulting from GBCA exposure. CONCLUSION After restrictive guidelines regarding GBCA administration were instituted, no new cases of NSF were identified among 52,954 contrast-enhanced MR examinations, including those performed in patients with an eGFR lower than 60 mL/min/m(2).","Wang, Yingbing; Alkasab, Tarik K; Narin, Ozden; Nazarian, Rosalynn M; Kaewlai, Rathachai; Kay, Jonathan; Abujudeh, Hani H",Radiology,618,1

Skeletal fragility secondary to diabetes increases the risk of fractures and is underestimated by currently available diagnostic tools like fracture risk assessment (FRAX) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In this narrative review we describe the relationship and pathophysiology of skeletal fragility and fractures in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), effect of glucose lowering medications on bone metabolism and the approach to diagnosing and managing osteoporosis and bone fragility in people with diabetes (PWD). METHODS A literature search was conducted on PubMed for articles in English that focused on T2DM and osteoporosis or bone/skeletal fragility. Articles considered to be of direct clinical relevance to physicians practicing diabetes were included. RESULTS T2DM is associated with skeletal fragility secondary to compromised bone remodeling and bone turnover. Long duration, poor glycemic control, presence of chronic complications, impaired muscle function, and anti-diabetic medications like thiazolidinediones (TZD) are risk factors for fractures among PWD. Conventional diagnostic tools like DXA and FRAX tool underestimate fracture risk in diabetes. Presence of diabetes does not alter response to anti-osteoporotic treatment in post-menopausal women. CONCLUSION Estimation of fragility fracture risk should be included in standard of care for T2DM along with screening for traditional complications. Physicians should proactively screen for and manage osteoporosis in people with diabetes. It is important to consider effects on bone health when selecting glucose lowering agents in people at risk for fragility fractures.","Farooqui, Khalid J; Mithal, Ambrish; Kerwen, Ann Kwee; Chandran, Manju",Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,618,12

Zinc and Zn + Mn amino acid complex supplements were tested to alleviate the effects of an IBV challenge using relatively resistant and susceptible MHC congenic chicken lines. Prior to the challenge with IBV, the amino acid-bound supplements induced better weight gain in the IBV-resistant chicken line (331/B2) compared to the birds fed with the sulfate-delivered supplements. No body weight differences were detected between IBV-challenged and unchallenged 331/B2 birds supplemented with Zn in amino acid complex.

However, the suggestion was based on excellent outcomes of high-volume or aortic centers. How about the real results in most places around the world? The purpose of this study was intended to compared in-hospital mortality, major complications, and aortic remodeling between TAR and/or stent graft implantation in a medical center of northern Taiwan. METHODS Between January 2008 and August 2017, 156 patients with acute type I aortic dissection underwent surgery at our institution, including proximal aortic replacement only (Group I, n = 72), concomitant TAR (Group II, n = 23), concomitant TAR extended with stent grafting (Group III, n = 45), and proximal aortic replacement with descending aortic stent grafting (Group IV, n = 16). RESULTS No significant differences were found in underlying disease and preoperative presentations, including operative risk among four groups. Overall in-hospital mortality was 22.4% (13 patients in Group I, 9 in Group II, 12 in Group III, and 1 in Group IV). New-onset stroke occurred in 15 patients postoperatively (3 patients [5.2%] in Group I, 3 [21.4%] in Group II, and 9 [26.5%] in Group III after excluding 36 patients with documented preoperative cerebrovascular accident or cerebral malperfusion). Root reconstruction and TAR were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. TAR was significantly associated with surgery-related stroke. Compared to those in Group I, true lumen expansion and false lumen shrinkage during 1-year aortic remodeling were significantly higher in Groups III and IV. Both TAR and descending aorta stent grafting were significantly associated with decreased risk of patent false lumen. CONCLUSIONS Proximal aortic replacement remains the preferred surgical strategy for acute type I aortic dissection, with lower mortality and neurological complications. Proximal descending aorta stent grafting may benefit aortic remodeling, even without TAR.","Hsu, Chiao-Po; Huang, Chun-Yang; Wu, Fei-Yi",PloS one,618,1

Applying the algorithm to simulated networks and empirical networks constructed from social network data of five US universities, we show that the algorithm is more effective than other existing local algorithms for a given immunization coverage, with a reduced final epidemic ratio, lower peak prevalence and fewer nodes that need to be visited before identifying the target nodes. The effectiveness stems from the breaking up of community networks by successful searches on target nodes with more weak ties. The effectiveness remains robust even when errors exist in the structure of the networks.","Gong, Kai; Tang, Ming; Hui, Pak Ming; Zhang, Hai Feng; Younghae, Do; Lai, Ying-Cheng",PloS one,618,16

This large and rapidly growing field may overwhelm the synthesizing abilities of both researchers and policy-makers. To provide a sinopsis, prevent errors, and detect cognitive gaps that may require interdisciplinary research methods, the literature on COVID-19 is summarized, twice. The overall purpose of this study is to generate a dialogue meant to explain the genesis of and/or find remedies for omissions and contradictions. The first review starts in Biology and ends in Policy. Policy is chosen as a destination because it is the setting where cognitive integration must occur. The second review follows the opposite path: it begins with stated policies on COVID-19 and then their assumptions and disciplinary relationships are identified. The purpose of this interdisciplinary method on methods is to yield a relational and explanatory view of the field -one strategy likely to be incomplete but usable when large bodies of literature need to be rapidly summarized. These reviews identify nine inter-related problems, research needs, or omissions, namely: [1] nation-wide, geo-referenced, epidemiological data collection systems (open to and monitored by the public); [2]metrics meant to detect non-symptomatic cases -e.g., test positivity-; [3]cost-benefit oriented methods, which should demonstrate they detect silent viral spreaders even with limited testing; [4] new personalized tests that inform on biological functions and disease correlates, such as cell-mediated immunity, co-morbidities, and immuno-suppression; [5] factors that influence vaccine effectiveness, [6]economic predictions that consider the long-term consequences likely to follow epidemics that growth exponentially; [7] the errors induced by self-limiting and/or implausible paradigms, such as binary and reductionist approaches; [8] new governance models that emphasize problem-solving skills, social participation, and the use of scientific knowledge; and [9] new educational programs that utilize visual aids and audience-specific communication strategies. The analysis indicates that, to optimally address these problems, disciplinary and social integration is needed. By asking what is/are the potential cause(s) and consequence(s) of each issue, this methodology generates visualizations that reveal possible relationships as well as omissions and contradictions.

We modify our adaptive modelling approach to investigate the effects of immune system structure and immunological mixing events on the disease profile of the bat colony and subsequently on the dynamics of rabies viruses in bats. Our theoretical framework, which is based on individual (intra-host) models of the response of the host to a viral challenge and virus-specific disease mechanisms, integrates the individual components to provide information about the disease structure and the demographic composition of the bat colony. We focus on the changes in dynamics at the population level due to two processes: (1) immunological diversity in a biological process, reproduction, and (2) immunological diversity in a physical-physiological process, migration. The results suggest that immunotypic mixing plays a critical role in the disease progression within populations and it is an important factor in determining the persistence of rabies in exposed bat colonies.","Dimitrov, Dobromir T; Hallam, Thomas G",Journal of biological dynamics,618,1

Methods We systematically searched databases including PubMed, SCOPUS, and ScienceDirect for relevant articles. Criteria from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute was used for a quality assessment of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed to analyze changes in outcomes for meniscal repair. Results Nineteen studies, 12 level III and 7 level IV, were included in this systematic review, with a total of 1086 patients. Conversion to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) following partial meniscectomy ranged from 11% to 54%, 31% to 35% for nonoperative, conservative treatment, and 0% to 1% for meniscal repair. Studies comparing repair with either meniscectomy or conservative treatment found greater improvement and slower progression of Kellgren-Lawrence grade with meniscal repair. A meta-analysis of the studies included in the systematic review using forest plots showed repair to have the greatest mean difference for functional outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee and Lysholm Activity Scale) and the lowest change in follow-up joint space. Conclusions In patients who experience meniscal root tears, meniscal repair may provide the greatest improvement in function and lowest risk of conversion to TKA when compared with partial meniscectomy or conservative methods. Partial meniscectomy appears to provide no benefit over conservative treatment, placing patients at a high risk of requiring TKA in the near future. However, future high-quality studies-both comparative studies and randomized trials-are needed to draw further conclusions and better impact treatment decision-making.

Since the very high number of disposable masks being used globally on a daily basis to face the Covid19 pandemic is posing new environmental risks, mainly connected to improper disposal, any possible improvements in the management of this waste stream is very important. In this work their potential use as sound porous absorber is discussed. Surgical face masks are mainly made of polypropylene fibers which show good acoustical properties. Their porous structure was studied through the measurement of some non-acoustic properties: bulk density, fiber diameter, porosity, flow resistivity and tortuosity. Moreover, the sound absorption performance of samples, made of scrapped face masks, with different thicknesses was evaluated using an impedance tube according to ISO 10534-2. The results obtained from the sound absorption spectra and two single indexes, Noise Reduction Coefficient and Sound Absorption Average showed a high sound absorption value over a frequency range of interest. Finally, the sound absorption spectra obtained for surgical face masks were compared with those obtained for fibrous materials currently used in building sector, suggesting that this fibrous waste could act as a possible substitute to traditional ones.","Maderuelo-Sanz, Rubén; Acedo-Fuentes, Patricia; García-Cobos, Francisco José; Sánchez-Delgado, Francisco José; Mota-López, María Isabel; Meneses-Rodríguez, Juan Miguel",The Science of the total environment,618,28

Concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO in urban agglomerations respectively decreased by 18%-45% (30%-62%), 17%-53% (22%-39%), 47%-64% (14%-41%), 9%-34% (0%-53%) and 16%-52% (23%-56%) during Lockdown (Post-lockdown) period relative to Pre-lockdown period. PM2.5 pollution events occurred during Lockdown in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebe (BTH) and Middle and South Liaoning (MSL), and daily O3 concentration rose to grade Ⅱ standard in Post-lockdown period. Distinct from the nationwide slump of NO2 during Lockdown period, a rebound (∼40%) in Post-lockdown period was observed in Cheng-Yu (CY), Yangtze River Middle-Reach (YRMR), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD). With slightly higher wind speed compared with 2019, the reduction of PM2.5 (51%-62%) in Post-lockdown period is more than 2019 (15%-46%) in HC (Harbin-Changchun), MSL, BTH, CP (Central Plain) and SP (Shandong-Peninsula), suggesting lockdown measures are effective to PM2.5 alleviation. Although O3 concentrations generally increased during the lockdown, its increment rate declined compared with 2019 under similar sunlight duration and temperature. Additionally, unlike HC, MSL and BTH, which suffered from additional (> 30%) air masses from surrounding areas after the lockdown, the polluted air masses reaching YRD and PRD mostly originated from the long-distance transport, highlighting the importance of joint regional governance.","Fan, Linping; Fu, Shuang; Wang, Xin; Fu, Qingyan; Jia, Haohao; Xu, Hao; Qin, Guimei; Hu, Xue; Cheng, Jinping",Journal of environmental sciences,618,16

Coxsackievirus A24 (CV-A24) was not originally associated with human disease, but in 1970 a pathogenic ""variant"" (CV-A24v) emerged, which is now the main cause of AHC. Initially, this variant circulated only in Southeast Asia, but it later spread worldwide, accounting for numerous AHC outbreaks and two pandemics. While both CV-A24 variant and nonvariant strains still circulate in humans, only variant strains cause AHC for reasons that are yet unknown. Since receptors are important determinants of viral tropism, we set out to map the CV-A24 receptor repertoire and establish whether changes in receptor preference have led to the increased pathogenicity and rapid spread of CV-A24v. Here, we identify ICAM-1 as an essential receptor for both AHC-causing and non-AHC strains. We provide a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a virus-ICAM-1 complex, which revealed critical ICAM-1-binding residues. These data could help identify a possible conserved mode of receptor engagement among ICAM-1-binding enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Moreover, we identify a single capsid substitution that has been adopted by all pandemic CV-A24v strains and we reveal that this adaptation enhances the capacity of CV-A24v to bind sialic acid. Our data elucidate the CV-A24v receptor repertoire and point to a role of enhanced receptor engagement in the adaptation to the eye, possibly enabling pandemic spread.","Baggen, Jim; Hurdiss, Daniel L; Zocher, Georg; Mistry, Nitesh; Roberts, Richard W; Slager, Jasper J; Guo, Hongbo; van Vliet, Arno L W; Wahedi, Maryam; Benschop, Kimberley; Duizer, Erwin; de Haan, Cornelis A M; de Vries, Erik; Casasnovas, José M; de Groot, Raoul J; Arnberg, Niklas; Stehle, Thilo; Ranson, Neil A; Thibaut, Hendrik Jan; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,618,1

Conflicting results are reported to date. Using conventional PCR (cPCR) to amplify the VP2 gene, shedding of the CPV variants (CPV-2a, 2b, 2c) by healthy cats in multi-cat environments was reportedly common in Europe but rare in Australia. The aim of this study was to determine whether low-level faecal CPV shedding occurs in multi-cat environments in Australia and Italy using a TaqMan real-time PCR to detect Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 (CPV and feline parvovirus, FPV) DNA, and minor-groove binder probe real-time PCR assay to differentiate FPV and CPV types and to characterize CPV variants. In total, 741 non-diarrhoeic faecal samples from shelters in Australia (n = 263) and from shelters or cat colonies in Italy (n = 478) were tested. Overall, Carnivore protoparvovirus 1 DNA was detected in 49 of 741 (6.61 %) samples. Differentiation was possible for 31 positive samples. FPV was most common among positive samples (28/31, 90.3 %). CPV was detected in 4/31 samples (12.9 %) including CPV-2a in one sample, CPV-2b in another and co-infections of FPV/CPV-2b and CPV-2a/CPV-2b in the remaining two samples. A high rate of subclinical FPV infection was detected in one shelter during an outbreak of feline panleukopenia, during which 21 of 22 asymptomatic cats (95.5 %) sampled were shedding FPV.

The use of Onyx for the treatment of S-AVFs is not well established at this time. We discuss three cases of traumatic S-AVFs treated successfully with Onyx embolization alone or in association with coils. METHODS The database of patients treated at the Baptist Cardiac and Vascular Institute, Miami, Florida, was reviewed. All patients with traumatic S-AVFs treated with Onyx were included. RESULTS Two men and one woman with progressive enlarging pulsatile mass with bruit or tinnitus had angiographic evidence of S-AVF and were treated. In two patients the S-AVFs were secondary to hair transplantation. They were treated with Onyx-18 embolization as the single treatment modality. One patient with S-AVF resulting from temporomandibular joint arthroscopy was treated with coils and subsequent Onyx-34 embolization. In one patient, transarterial microcatheterization and injection of Onyx-18 was performed. In another patient, the intra-arterial approach was prevented by arterial vessel tortuosity. Therefore, access to the fistula was obtained through direct puncture of a large frontal vein; contrast injection confirmed the positioning of the needle within the draining vein of the AVF and Onyx-18 was then injected while the outflow vein was compressed. In the third patient in this series, coils were deployed to allow safer and more controlled injection of Onyx-34. No procedure related complications were noted. Post-embolization angiography demonstrated successful and complete occlusion of the AVF immediately after treatment. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Our experience in this small series indicates that endovascular treatment of S-AVFs with Onyx is rapid, safe, and highly effective.","Dabus, Guilherme; Pizzolato, Raffaella; Lin, Eugene; Kreusch, Andreas; Linfante, Italo",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,618,1

This second (of two) articles summarizes current knowledge gaps, and outlines the clinical and research priorities for POTS. POTS is a complex, multi-system, chronic disorder of the autonomic nervous system characterized by orthostatic intolerance and orthostatic tachycardia without hypotension. Patients often experience a host of other related disabling symptoms. The functional and economic impacts of this disorder are significant. The pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Beyond the significant gaps in understanding the disorder itself, there is a paucity of evidence to guide treatment which can contribute to suboptimal care for this patient population. The vast majority of physicians have minimal to no familiarity or training in the assessment and management of POTS. Funding for POTS research remains very low relative to the size of the patient population and impact of the syndrome. In addition to efforts to improve awareness and physician education, an investment in research infrastructure including the development of standardized disease-specific evaluation tools and outcome measures is needed to facilitate effective collaborative research. A national POTS research consortium could facilitate well-controlled multidisciplinary clinical research studies and therapeutic trials. These priorities will require a substantial increase in the number of research investigators and the amount of research funding in this area.","Raj, Satish R; Bourne, Kate M; Stiles, Lauren E; Miglis, Mitchell G; Cortez, Melissa M; Miller, Amanda J; Freeman, Roy; Biaggioni, Italo; Rowe, Peter C; Sheldon, Robert S; Shibao, Cyndya A; Diedrich, Andre; Systrom, David M; Cook, Glen A; Doherty, Taylor A; Abdallah, Hasan I; Grubb, Blair P; Fedorowski, Artur; Stewart, Julian M; Arnold, Amy C; Pace, Laura A; Axelsson, Jonas; Boris, Jeffrey R; Moak, Jeffrey P; Goodman, Brent P; Chémali, Kamal R; Chung, Tae H; Goldstein, David S; Darbari, Anil; Vernino, Steven",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,618,1

OBJECTIVES The aim of the current study is to examine whether communities reporting an increased risk for developing mental health issues showed differential patterns of legal cannabis use as the pandemic began. A secondary goal is to examine the feasibility of using anonymized location data to uncover community consumption patterns of potential concern. METHODS Anonymized location data from approximately 10% of devices in the United States provided a count of the number of visitors to 3,335 cannabis retail locations (medical and recreational) each day from December 1st 2019 through April 2020. Visitor counts were merged with the average number of mentally unhealthy days (aMUDs) reported in the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) county the retailer was located along with FIPS county population and poverty rate estimates. A Poisson spline regression predicting visitors by day, aMUDs, as well as their interaction was performed, entering population and poverty rate as covariates. RESULTS As the pandemic began communities reporting a greater aMUDs showed greater visitation to cannabis retailers. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic may have led to increased legal cannabis use in at risk communities.

High absolute risk (AR) of relevant toxicities has been observed with this treatment. This meta-analysis aimed to improve the precision of the estimated AR of selected adverse events (AEs) associated with this new agent. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature search was conducted in August 2019 to identify trials analyzing the anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity profile of alpelisib. Heterogeneity was assessed by using I 2 statistics. Data were analyzed using random effect meta-analyses for AR. Eleven trials and 511 patients were included. RESULTS There was no evidence of heterogeneity between studies regarding the AR of most AEs except for all-grade weight loss and grade 3-4 stomatitis. The number of serious AEs was clearly reported in only one study, of which the most common was hyperglycemia; the most common all-grade AEs were hyperglycemia (59%), diarrhea (56%), nausea (44%), and rash (38%). Grade 3/4 hyperglycemia and rash occurred in 28% and 10% of patients, respectively. No treatment-associated deaths were observed, and 18% of patients had to stop treatment due to toxicities. CONCLUSIONS Alpelisib is associated with clinically relevant AEs that can lead to treatment discontinuation. The most common AE was hyperglycemia.

We examined the integrated relationships of local (nasopharyngeal) and systemic (serum) responses with bronchiolitis morbidities. METHODS In a multicenter prospective cohort study of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we applied a network analysis approach to identify distinct networks (modules)-clusters of densely interconnected metabolites-of the nasopharyngeal and serum metabolome. We examined their individual and integrated relationships with acute severity (defined by positive pressure ventilation [PPV] use) and asthma development by age 5 years. RESULTS In 140 infants, we identified 285 nasopharyngeal and 639 serum metabolites. Network analysis revealed 7 nasopharyngeal and 8 serum modules. At the individual module-level, nasopharyngeal-amino acid, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and carnitine modules were associated with higher risk of PPV use (r>0.20; P<0.001), while serum-carnitine, amino acid and glycerophosphorylcholine (GPC)/glycerophosphorylethanolamine (GPE) modules were associated with lower risk (all r<- 0.20; P<0.05). The integrated analysis for PPV use revealed consistent findings-e.g., nasopharyngeal-TCA (adjOR 2.87, 95%CI 1.68-12.2) and serum-GPC/GPE (adjOR 0.54, 95%CI 0.38-0.80) modules-and an additional module-serum-glucose-alanine cycle module (adjOR 0.69, 95%CI 0.56-0.86). With asthma risk, there were no individual associations but there were integrated associations (e.g., nasopharyngeal-carnitine module; adjOR 1.48, 95%CI 1.11-1.99). CONCLUSION In infants with bronchiolitis, we found integrated relationships of local and systemic metabolome networks with acute and chronic morbidity. Our findings advance research into the complex interplay among respiratory viruses, local and systemic response, and disease pathobiology in infants with bronchiolitis.","Fujiogi, Michimasa; Camargo, Carlos A; Raita, Yoshihiko; Zhu, Zhaozong; Celedón, Juan C; Mansbach, Jonathan M; Spergel, Jonathan M; Hasegawa, Kohei",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,618,32

However, it is worth noting that the reference test is a postnatal examination. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of time between prenatal MRI (pMRI) and postnatal examinations on the consistency of diagnoses. MATERIAL AND METHODS The prospective observational study was carried out between 2014 and 2017 at the Department of Obstetrics and Perinatology of Krakow University Hospital. In total, 60 patients with fetuses suspected of central nervous system (CNS) defects were included in the study group. PMRI examinations were conducted in the third trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS The median gestational age of pMRI was 35 weeks and median of the time interval between carrying out pre- and postnatal test was 34.5 days. In the group of nonconcordant diagnoses, the interval was longer. The analysis did not show a statistically significant relationship between consistency of diagnoses and timing of pMRI. The median time of pregnancy at which pMRI was performed was similar in both groups. A prolongation of the interval between examinations reduced the probability of consistency of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS The number of inaccurate results increased with the prolongation of the interval between pre- and postnatal tests. KEY MESSAGE Prolongation of the interval between pre- and postnatal increases number of inaccurate results.","Nowak, Magdalena; Herman-Sucharska, Izabela; Radon-Pokracka, Malgorzata; Micek, Agnieszka; Horbaczewska, Anna; Huras, Hubert",European journal of paediatric neurology : EJPN : official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society,618,8
158084,158084,158084,Deaths From COVID-19.,16.979506,4.896638,2020-12-17,"BACKGROUND People with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are stigmatized, partly since ""non-alcoholic"" is in the name, but also because of obesity, which is a common condition in this group. Stigma is pervasive in social media and can contribute to poorer health outcomes. We examine how stigma and negative feelings concerning NAFLD/NASH and obesity manifest on Twitter. METHODS Using a self-developed search terms index, we collected NAFLD/NASH tweets from May-October 2019 (Phase I). Because stigmatizing NAFLD/NASH tweets were limited, Phase II focused on obesity (November-December 2019). Via sentiment analysis, >5,000 tweets were annotated as positive, neutral, or negative and used to train machine learning based Natural Language Processing software, applied to 193,747 randomly sampled tweets. All tweets collected were analyzed. RESULTS In Phase I, 16,835 tweets for NAFLD and 2,376 for NASH were retrieved. Of the annotated NAFLD/NASH tweets, 97/1,130 (8.6%) and 63/535 (11.8%), respectively, related to obesity and 13/1,130 (1.2%) and 5/535 (0.9%), to stigma; they primarily focused on scientific discourse and general information. Of the 193,747 non-annotated obesity tweets (Phase II), the algorithm classified 40.0% as related to obesity, of which 85.2% were negative, 1.0% positive, and 13.7% neutral. CONCLUSIONS NAFLD/NASH tweets mostly indicated an unmet information need and showed no clear signs of stigma. However, the negative content of obesity tweets was recurrent. As obesity-related stigma is associated with reduced care engagement and lifestyle modification, the main NAFLD/NASH treatment, stigma reducing interventions in social media should be included in the liver health agenda.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Kakalou, Christine; Palayew, Adam; Karamanidou, Christina; Maramis, Christos; Natsiavas, Pantelis; Picchio, Camila A; Villota-Rivas, Marcela; Zelber-Sagi, Shira; Carrieri, Patrizia",Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,618,7

The objective of this study was to understand national changes to pediatric liver transplantation during COVID-19. METHODS Using SRTR data, we compared waitlist additions, removals, and liver transplantations for pre-COVID-19 (March-November 2016-2019), early COVID-19 (March-May 2020), and late COVID-19 (June-November 2020). RESULTS Waitlist additions decreased by 25% during early COVID-19 (41.3/month vs. 55.4/month, p < .001) with black candidates most affected (p = .04). Children spent longer on the waitlist during early COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 (140 vs. 96 days, p < .001). There was a 38% decrease in liver transplantations during early COVID-19 (IRR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.78), recovering to pre-pandemic rates during late COVID-19 (IRR 1.03, NS), and no change in percentage of living and deceased donors. White children had a 30% decrease in overall liver transplantation but no change in living donor liver transplantation (IRR 0.7, 95% CI 0.50-0.95; IRR 0.96, NS), while non-white children had a 44% decrease in overall liver transplantation (IRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.77) and 81% decrease in living donor liver transplantation (IRR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02-0.76). CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic decreased access to pediatric liver transplantation, particularly in its early stage. There were no regional differences in liver transplantation during COVID-19 despite the increased national sharing of organs. While pediatric liver transplantation has resumed pre-pandemic levels, ongoing racial disparities must be addressed.","Kemme, Sarah; Yoeli, Dor; Sundaram, Shikha S; Adams, Megan A; Feldman, Amy G",Pediatric transplantation,618,1

The use of UV irradiation to reduce bioburden of used respirators attracts attention, making proper testing protocols of uttermost importance. Currently artificial saliva is used but its comparison to human saliva from the UV disinfection perspective is lacking. Here we characterize UV spectra of human and artificial saliva, both fresh and after settling, to test for possible interference for UV-based disinfection. ASTM 2720 artificial saliva recipe (with either porcine or bovine mucin) showed many discrepancies from average (N = 18) human saliva, with different mucins demonstrating very different UV absorbance spectra, resulting in very different UV transmittance at different wavelength. Reducing porcine mucin concentration from 3 to 1.7 g/L brought UVA254 in the artificial saliva to that of average human saliva (although not for other wavelengths), allowing 254 nm disinfection experiments. Phosphate saline and modified artificial saliva were spiked with 8.6 log CFU/ml B. subtilis spores (ATCC 6633) and irradiated at dose of up to 100 mJ/cm2, resulting in 5.9 log inactivation for a saline suspension, and 2.8 and 1.1 log inactivation for ASTM-no mucin and ASTM-1.7 g/L porcine mucin 2 μL dried droplets, respectively. UVC irradiation of spores dried in human saliva resulted in 2.3 and 1.5 log inactivation, depending on the size of the droplets (2 vs 10 μL, respectively) dried on a glass surface. Our results suggest that in the presence of the current standard dried artificial saliva it is unlikely that UVC can achieve 6 log inactivation of B. subtilis spores using a realistic UV dose (e.g. less than 2 J/cm2) and the ATSM saliva recipe should be revised for UV decontamination studies.","Barancheshme, Fateme; Philibert, Julie; Noam-Amar, Natali; Gerchman, Yoram; Barbeau, Benoit","Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Over a 28-month period, totally thoracoscopic (TT) anatomic segmentectomies, i.e. using only endoscopic instrumentation and video-display without utility incision, were attempted on 50 patients (25 males and 25 females), aged 18-81 years (mean: 57 years). The indication was a clinical N0 non-small cell lung carcinoma in 25 cases, a solitary metastasis in nine cases and a benign lesion in 16 cases. The following segmentectomies were performed: right apicosuperior (9) right superior (6), right basilar (7), lingula sparing left upper lobectomy (7), left apicosuperior (4), lingula (4), left superior (6) and left basilar (7). It was associated with a radical lymphadenectomy in 20 cases. There was one conversion to thoracotomy. The mean operative time was 188±54 min, the mean intraoperative blood loss was 91±82 ml (range: 0-450 ml). There were four minor postoperative complications (11.7%).

METHODS This is a retrospective review of all patients who had a MAT or conventional TIPS procedure over a 6-year period at our institute. The primary patency rate, fluoroscopy time, technical success, major procedure-related complications, and mortality data were compared between two treatment groups. RESULTS We included 49 patients with MAT-TIPS, and 63 with conventional TIPS, with an average follow-up of 21.43 months. The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 82.9 and 66.7 % in the conventional TIPS group, and 81.0 and 76.5 % in the MAT-TIPS group (p = 1.000, and 0.529), respectively. There was no significant difference in technical success rate, post-procedure portosystemic pressure gradient, fluoroscopy time, and peri-procedural mortality rate between treatment groups. Major procedural-related complications were seen more frequently among MAT-TIPS patients (p = 0.012). In the MAT-TIPS group, 5 (10.2 %) patients developed post-procedure minilaparotomy, wound-related complications, and 5 (10.2 %) developed bacterial peritonitis; whereas, none of patients with conventional TIPS had either of these complications (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION While both MAT-TIPS and conventional TIPS had similar shunt primary patency rate and technical success rate, the MAT approach was associated with a significantly higher rate of minilaparotomy-related wound complications or infectious complications. These complications maybe prevented by a change in post-procedure monitoring and therapy.","Jalaeian, Hamed; Talaie, Reza; D'Souza, Donna; Taleb, Shayandokht; Noorbaloochi, Siamak; Flanagan, Siobhan; Hunter, David; Golzarian, Jafar",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,618,1

This is a major impediment to deployment in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, several of them use viral vectors or mRNA. In contrast to protein subunit vaccines, there is limited manufacturing expertise for these nucleic acid-based modalities, especially in the developing world. Neutralizing antibodies, the clearest known correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2, are primarily directed against the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, suggesting that a suitable RBD construct might serve as a more accessible vaccine ingredient. We describe a monomeric, glycan engineered RBD protein fragment that is expressed at a purified yield of 214 mg/L in unoptimized, mammalian cell culture and, in contrast to a stabilized spike ectodomain, is tolerant of exposure to temperatures as high as 100 °C when lyophilized, up to 70 °C in solution and stable for over four weeks at 37 °C. In prime:boost guinea pig immunizations, when formulated with the MF59-like adjuvant AddaVax™, the RBD derivative elicited neutralizing antibodies with an endpoint geometric mean titer of ~415 against replicative virus, comparing favourably with several vaccine formulations currently in the clinic.

DESIGN Case reports. SETTING University hospital. PATIENTS Patient 1 is an 83-year-old woman. Patient 2 is a 75-year-old woman. Both were admitted to the hospital for massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which required multiple blood transfusions. Extensive workup revealed multiple diverticula in the small and large intestines without identification of any source of active bleeding in either patient. INTERVENTION Laparoscopic exploration of the abdominal cavity was performed. The terminal ileum at the ileocecal valve was identified and, 5 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve, the small bowel was transected. The distal end staple line was secured in end-to-side fashion to the proximal end, and the proximal end was brought out as an end ileostomy. Patients were then observed for bleeding into the ostomy bag or in the rectum. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Localization of the source of bleeding as upper or lower, occurrence of surgical complications, and clinical outcome. RESULTS No intraoperative complications occurred in either patient. Patient 1 had significant bleeding into her ileostomy bag on postoperative day 1. She was taken back to the operating room for empirical small bowel resection. She was discharged, had no further bleeding, and underwent closure of the ileostomy 2 months later. The postoperative course of patient 2 was complicated by a small parastomal abscess that resolved with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics. Patient 2 returned on postoperative day 22 with bleeding in the rectum. She was taken to the operating room for laparoscopic total colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis and ileostomy closure. Both patients recovered uneventfully and had no recurrent bleeding. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with these 2 patients suggests that in cases in which the risk of blind resection appears ill-advised, laparoscopic compartmentalization of the small bowel from the colon via end ileostomy may be safely performed.","Patel, Tanvi; Bickenbach, Kai; Semrad, Carol; Alverdy, John",Archives of surgery,618,16

The aim of this study was to survey expert providers regarding how chairwork is best provided in internet-delivered psychotherapy. Method: Forty one experts were recruited from a range of therapeutic backgrounds including cognitive behaviour therapy, compassion focused therapy, emotion focused therapy, psychodrama, schema therapy, and voice dialogue. Participants completed a brief questionnaire survey exploring the delivery of tele-chairwork. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (i) divided opinion; (ii) convergence between therapy and home; (iii) disconnection and depth; (iv) practical impediments and benefits; and (v) revising and re-visioning chairwork. Overall, results indicate that chairwork can be successfully incorporated into tele-therapy, but requires adaption and special considerations.

Materials & Methods: Patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or previously diagnosed with PCa were prospectively enrolled in this phase II trial. A combined uPAR PET, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) was performed and standardized uptake value (SUV) from primary tumor, as delineated by mpMRI, was measured by two independent readers. Correlation between SUV and Gleason score obtained by biopsy was assessed. Results: A total of 27 patients had histologically verified PCa visible on mpMRI and constituted the study population. There was a positive correlation between SUVmax and Gleason score (Spearman's rho= 0.55; P = 0.003). Receiver operating characteristics analysis showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.67-1.00) in discriminating Gleason score ≥3+4 from ≤3+3. A cut-off for tumor SUVmax could be established with a sensitivity of 96% (79-99%) and specificity of 75% (30-95%) in detecting Gleason Scores ≥3+4. For discriminating Gleason score ≥ 4+3 vs. ≤ 3+4, a cut-off could be established for detecting Gleason score ≥ 4+3 with a sensitivity of 93% (69-99%) and specificity of 62% (36-82%). Conclusion: SUV measurements from uPAR PET in primary tumors as delineated by mpMRI showed a significant correlation with Gleason score, and tumor SUVmax was able to discriminate between low-risk and intermediate risk Gleason score profiles with high diagnostic accuracy. Consequently, uPAR PET/MRI could be a promising method for non-invasive evaluation of PCa, which may in the future potentially reduce the need for repeated biopsies, e.g. in active surveillance.","Fosbøl, Marie Øbro; Kurbegovic, Sorel; Johannesen, Helle Hjorth; Røder, Martin Andreas; Hansen, Adam Espe; Mortensen, Jann; Loft, Annika; Petersen, Peter Meidahl; Madsen, Jacob; Brasso, Klaus; Kjaer, Andreas","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",618,5

HCoV strain OC43 (HCoV-OC43) can infect and persist in human neural cells and activate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, suggesting that it could be involved in neurological disease of unknown etiology in humans. Moreover, we have shown that HCoV-OC43 is neurovirulent in susceptible mice, causing encephalitis, and that a viral mutant with a single point mutation in the viral surface spike (S) protein induces a paralytic disease that involves glutamate excitotoxicity in susceptible mice. Herein, we show that glutamate recycling via the glial transporter 1 protein transporter and glutamine synthetase are central to the dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and development of motor dysfunctions and paralytic disease in HCoV-OC43-infected mice. Moreover, memantine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist widely used in the treatment of neurological diseases in humans, improved clinical scores related to paralytic disease and motor disabilities by partially restoring the physiological neurofilament phosphorylation state in virus-infected mice. Interestingly, memantine attenuated mortality rates and body weight loss and reduced HCoV-OC43 replication in the central nervous system in a dose-dependent manner. This novel action of memantine on viral replication strongly suggests that it could be used as an antiviral agent to directly limit viral replication while improving neurological symptoms in various neurological diseases with a viral involvement. Mutations in the surface spike (S) protein of human respiratory coronavirus OC43 appear after persistent infection of human cells of the central nervous system, a possible viral adaptation to this environment. Furthermore, a single amino acid change in the viral S protein modulated virus-induced neuropathology in mice from an encephalitis to a neuropathology characterized by flaccid paralysis, which involves glutamate excitotoxicity. We now show that memantine, a drug that is used for alleviating symptoms associated with neuropathology, such as Alzheimer's disease, can partially restore the physiological state of infected mice by limiting both neurodegeneration and viral replication. This suggests that memantine could be used as an antiviral agent while improving neurological symptoms in various neurological diseases with a viral involvement.","Brison, Elodie; Jacomy, Hélène; Desforges, Marc; Talbot, Pierre J",Journal of virology,618,24

On one occasion, Ray observed a common Indian house crow (Corvus splendens) with uncommon white patches on its plumage, quite unlike the characteristic black body and gray neck of most house crows. The white patches distinguished the crow from hundreds of other members of its species thriving in the area. This crow's atypical plumage was due to a congenital genetic condition called leucism, a partial or complete loss of coloration. The incidence of leucism in wild bird populations scarcely exceeds 1%. Observing an abnormally colored bird provides insight into intraspecific phenotypic variability as well as how variations persist in nature. Long-term observations are needed to better understand the ecology of such rare leucistic birds.","Ray, Puja",Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,618,16

Lockdowns caused by novel coronavirus provide an unprecedented opportunity to deepen our understanding to the possible mechanism of the covariation between human economical activities and air pollutant events. In this paper, satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Nighttime light (NTL) data were used as agencies for air pollution and economic activities respectively. The results show that NTL in Feb. 2020 is lower than the same month of previous year in most of the eight cities of Guangdong Province, Northern China. That indicates lower NTL may due to less activities of social activities, tourism and industrial production because of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, AOD also sharply decreases in Feb. 2020. And, both trends of NTL and AOD turned over as soon as March 2020. The correlations between AOD and NTL of these eight cities are quite different from each other, somehow them are more correspondingly close to 1 during COVID-19 from Dec. 2019 to Feb. 2020. That may suggest solid covariation between AOD and NTL, and may indicate human economic activities may be one of the reasons leading to air pollution. © 2021 IEEE.","Li, Z.","2nd International Conference on Computing and Data Science, CDS 2021",618,1

However, plasma-derived drugs suffer many problems, including low potency, impurities, constraints on supply, and batch-to-batch variation. In this study, we demonstrated proofs-of-concept for a technology that uses microfluidics and molecular genomics to capture diverse mammalian antibody repertoires as multivalent recombinant drugs. These “recombinant hyperimmune” drugs comprised thousands to tens of thousands of antibodies and were derived from convalescent human donors, or vaccinated human donors or immunized mice. Here we used our technology to build a highly potent recombinant hyperimmune for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) in less than three months. We also validated a recombinant hyperimmune for Zika virus disease that abrogates antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) through Fc engineering. For patients with primary immune deficiency (PID), we built high potency polyvalent recombinant hyperimmunes against pathogens that commonly cause serious lung infections. Finally, to address the limitations of rabbit-derived anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), we generated a recombinant human version and demonstrated in vivo function against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Recombinant hyperimmunes are a novel class of drugs that could be used to target a wide variety of other clinical applications, including cancer and autoimmunity.","Keating, Sheila M.; Mizrahi, Rena A.; Adams, Matthew S.; Asensio, Michael A.; Benzie, Emily; Carter, Kyle P.; Chiang, Yao; Edgar, Robert C.; Gautam, Bishal K.; Gras, Ashley; Leong, Jackson; Leong, Renee; Lim, Yoong Wearn; Manickam, Vishal A.; Medina-Cucurella, Angelica V.; Niedecken, Ariel R.; Saini, Jasmeen; Simons, Jan Fredrik; Spindler, Matthew J.; Stadtmiller, Kacy; Tinsley, Brendan; Wagner, Ellen K.; Wayham, Nicholas; Tracy, LaRee; Lundberg, Carina Vingsbo; Büscher, Dirk; Terencio, Jose Vicente; Roalfe, Lucy; Pearce, Emma; Richardson, Hayley; Goldblatt, David; Ramjag, Anushka T.; Carrington, Christine V.F.; Simmons, Graham; Muench, Marcus O.; Chamow, Steven M.; Monroe, Bryan; Olson, Charles; Oguin, Thomas H.; Lynch, Heather; Jeanfreau, Robert; Meyer, Everett H.; Adler, Adam S.; Johnson, David S.",bioRxiv,618,22

Consequently, the University Medical Center Freiburg was one of the first hospitals in Germany to treat Covid19 patients. Objectives: To assess the proportion and characteristics of health care workers (HCW) that have been infected during that first wave SARS-CoV-2 serum IgG and IgM antibodies were measured. Methods: HCW (n=902, mean age: 40.7 years) participated in this study, and filled out an epidemiological questionnaire. Serum samples were analysed for SARS-Cov-2 IgG/IgM antibodies via rapid diagnostic test (RT) and via ELISA. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.2. An exposure prevention score was developed to quantify the adherence to preventive measures in everyday life. Results: 902 HCW were tested by RT, and 499 by ELISA. In total, 11.5% of recruited HCW were antibody-positive in the RT, 12.2% in the ELISA. 87.5% of RT positives, 98% of ELISA-positives reported symptoms, compared to 74.6% and 78% of negatives, respectively. Symptoms such as cough (57%/46%), loss of smell and taste (34%/5.2%), fatigue (68%/45%), fever (48%/24%), body aches (45%/22%), and headaches (58%/46%) were reported by significantly more RT positives compared to negatives. The respective differences were even more pronounced (p<0.001) among ELISA-positives compared to negatives with >50% of those positive reported impaired smell or taste compared to less than 7% among the group of ELISA-negatives (p<0.00001). In logistic regression models, shift work and belonging to the lowest quartile of the exposure prevention score were significantly associated with seropositivity in both tests. Exposure towards children was inversely associated with seropositivity, however, in the finally adjusted model only significant for those that were RT-positive, but not ELISA-positive, reflecting the lower specificity of the former. Conclusion: The endemic infection rate in HCW was high. HCW adhering to preventive measures in everyday life had lower infection rates.

Impairments in reward learning and feedback sensitivity are suggested to be an intermediate phenotype in depression aetiology therefore we hypothesised that similar impairments are present in healthy adults with a history of ELS. We recruited 64 adults with high levels of ELS and no diagnosis of a current mental health disorder and 65 controls. Participants completed the probabilistic reversal learning task and probabilistic reward task followed by depression, anhedonia, social status, and stress scales. Participants with high levels of ELS showed decreased positive feedback sensitivity in the probabilistic reversal learning task compared to controls. High ELS participants also trended towards possessing a decreased model-free learning rate. This was coupled with a decreased learning ability in the acquisition phase of block 1 following the practice session. Neither group showed a reward induced response bias in the probabilistic reward task however high ELS participants exhibited decreased stimuli discrimination. Due to the PRT not meeting its primary endpoint a separate cohort of control participants were tested in a modified PRT where they showed a response bias. This indicates the PRT can be successfully carried out online. Overall, these data suggest that healthy participants without a mental health diagnosis and high levels of ELS show deficits in positive feedback sensitivity and reward learning in the probabilistic reversal learning task that are distinct from depressed patients. These deficits may be relevant to increased depression vulnerability.","Wilkinson, Matthew P; Slaney, Chloe L; Mellor, Jack R; Robinson, Emma S J",bioRxiv,618,1

We investigated whether the inflammatory biomarker suPAR can aid in identifying patients at high risk for postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality. Methods: In this prospective observational study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03851965), peripheral venous blood was collected from consecutive adult patients scheduled for major non-cardiac surgery with expected duration [≥]2 hours under general anesthesia. Patients fulfilling the following inclusion criteria were included: age [≥]18 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to IV. Plasma suPAR levels were determined using the suPARnostic quick triage lateral flow assay. The primary endpoint was post-operative complications defined as presence of any complication and/or admission to intensive care unit and/or mortality within the first 90 postoperative days. Results: Preoperative suPAR had an OR of 1.50 (95%CI 1.24-1.82) for every ng/ml increase (AUC 0.82, 95%CI: 0.72-0.91). When including age, sex, ASA score, CRP, and grouped suPAR in multivariate analysis, patients with suPAR between 5.5 and 10 ng/ml had an OR of 12.7 (CI: 3.6-45.5) and patients with suPAR>10 ng/ml had an OR of 20.7 (CI: 4.5-95.4) compared to patients with suPAR[≤]5.5 ng/ml, respectively. ROC analysis including age, sex, CRP levels, and ASA score and had an AUC of 0.69 (95%CI: 0.58-0.80). When suPAR was added to this Model, the AUC increased to 0.84 (0.74-0.93) (p=0.009). Conclusions: Preoperative suPAR provided strong and independent predictive value on postoperative complications in high-risk patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery.","Chalkias, A.; Laou, E.; Kolonia, K.; Ragias, D.; Angelopoulou, Z.; Mitsiouli, E.; Kallemose, T.; Smith-Hansen, L.; Eugen-Olsen, J.; Arnaoutoglou, E.",,618,1

However, many students cannot consciously control their learning behaviors when they are in class at home, and some negative learning behaviors such as sleeping on the table or wandering have appeared. These negative learning behaviors greatly affect the effectiveness of learning. In order to deal with these problems, a online teaching system based on human action recognition is developed to assist teachers in real-time capturing the class status of classmates and improve the efficiency of home-based online teaching. Here, the system uses the OpenPose human body gesture recognition algorithm to obtain the key points of the student's body in class in front of the camera, and recognizes the student's class behavior through the analysis of the coordinates. The RTMP protocol is used to solve the problem of audio and video transmission during the live broadcast.

PRINCIPLE's first finding was that azithromycin and doxycycline were not effective. Aim To explore the extent to which azithromycin and doxycycline were being used in-pandemic, and the scope for trial findings impacting on practice. Design and Setting We compared crude rates of prescribing and respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 2020, the pandemic year, with 2019, using the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC). Methods We used a negative binomial model including age-band, gender, socioeconomic status, and NHS region to compare azithromycin and doxycycline lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and influenza-like-illness (ILI) in 2020 with 2019; reporting incident rate ratios (IRR) between years and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results Azithromycin prescriptions increased 7% in 2020 compared to 2019, whereas doxycycline decreased by 7%. Concurrently, LRTI and URTI incidence fell by over half (58.3% and 54.4% respectively) while ILI rose slightly (6.4%). The overall percentage of RTI prescribed azithromycin rose by 42.1% between 2019 and 2020, doxycycline increased by 33%. Our adjusted IRR showed azithromycin prescribing was 22% higher in 2020 (IRR=1.22, 95%CI:1.19-1.26, p<0.0001), for every unit rise in confirmed COVID there was an associated 3% rise in prescription (IRR=1.026, 95%CI 1.024-1.0285, p<0.0001); whereas these measures were static for doxycycline.

The classical SIR model implicitly requires an exponential distribution for the length of this period of time. We will show how a general distribution can be easily taken into account using the Transient Little Law and present numerical methods to solve the model in an efficient way. Our numerical experiments show that in the presence of a more realistic distribution, with lower variability than the exponential distribution, the size of peak of infected individuals on the graph will be higher and occur earlier. Conversely, a higher-variability distribution will lead to a lower peak that takes longer to dissipate. We also discuss some extensions to the basic model, to include variants like SEIRD and SIS.

Previous genetic studies imply causal effects of childhood BMI on depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but these observations might also reflect effects of demography and the family environment. We used within-family Mendelian randomization, which accounts for familial effects by controlling for parental genotype, to investigate the impact of BMI on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms at age 8. Methods: This study is based on the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). Participants were 26,370 8-year-old children (48.7% female) born 1999-2009, together with their parents. We applied multivariable regression, classic Mendelian randomization (classic MR), and within-family Mendelian randomization (within-family MR). We report estimates of the effects of the child's own BMI, mother's BMI, and father's BMI on the child's depressive, anxiety, and ADHD symptoms, reported by mothers when the child was aged 8. Results: In multivariable regression, higher BMI was marginally associated with more depressive and ADHD symptoms, and associated with fewer anxiety symptoms, in 8-year-old children. Classic MR models implied a causal effect of children's higher BMI on higher depressive and ADHD symptoms, and to a lesser degree, lower anxiety symptoms. In within-family MR models, there was less evidence that children's own BMI affected any of these symptoms. For example, a 5kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with 0.04 standard deviations (SD) higher depressive symptoms (95% CI -0.01 to 0.09) in multivariable regression, with corresponding effect estimates of 0.41 SD (95% CI 0.10 to 0.56) in classic MR and 0.08 SD (95% CI -0.25 to 0.42) in within-family MR. Within-family MR suggested that maternal but not paternal BMI was associated with children's depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The influence of childhood BMI on depressive, anxiety and ADHD symptoms may have been overstated by MR approaches that do not account for parental genotype. Factors correlated with maternal BMI may influence offspring symptoms of depression.","Hughes, A. M.; Morris, T. T.; Ayorech, Z.; Tesli, M.; Ask, H.; Reichborn-Kjennerud, T.; Andreassen, O.

An analysis of twenty-nine peer reviewed and published papers selected from five electronic databases was conducted to identify the key factors that influence rural school learners’ adoption patterns. The findings revealed the key factors as ICT infrastructure, technical support, access to resources, and social influence. Deductively, infrastructure was found to have a direct obstruction and negative consequences on the adoption of ICT technologies in learning. The findings are valuable for illustrating factors that affect the adoption of ICT technologies by rural learners in developing countries.

The aim is to foster decent work, particularly in the Latin American countries under study, where, as we know, the scourge of informality and vulnerability of the working classes is a structural feature that remains from colonial heritage till the early peripheral industrialization. Thus, the spirit of our study lies in the effort to understand the changes taking place in the field of labor relations at a time when global capitalism is at a crossroads in the face of the brutal impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Estanque, E.; Climent, V.

There is limited data on the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders, particularly in rural as compared to urban areas. Objective: To examine the association between stay-at-home order implementation and the incidence of COVID-19 in rural vs. urban counties. Design: Interrupted time series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model. Participants: 3,142 U.S. counties. Interventions: Stay-at-home orders. Main Measures: COVID-19 daily incidence (primary) and mobility (secondary and intermediate measure of stay-at-home effectiveness) Key Results: Stay-at-home orders were implemented later (median March 30 vs. March 28) and were shorter (median 35 vs. 54 days) in rural than urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6-6.9% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders. Compared to the baseline (pre-stay-at-home) period, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased under stay-at-home by IRR 1.60 (95% CI, 1.57-1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30-1.42) in urban counties. For each day under stay-at-home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95% CI 0.981-0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95% CI, 0.951-0.953) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. Each day after stay-at-home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.994-0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95% CI, 0.995-0.999) in urban counties compared to prior to stay-at-home. Conclusion: Stay-at-home orders decreased mobility and slowed the spread of COVID-19, but less effectively in rural than in urban counties. This necessitates a critical reevaluation of how stay-at-home orders are designed, communicated, and implemented in rural areas.","Jiang, D. H.; Roy, D. J.; Pollock, B. D.; Shah, N. D.; McCoy, R.

Such tools could be derived from neurophysiological measurements of disease. Methods and Analysis The New Therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease study (NTAD) aims to identify a biomarker set from magneto/electro-encephalographic that is sensitive to disease and progression over one year. The study will recruit 100 people with amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer's disease and 30 healthy controls aged between 50 and 85 years. Repeat measurements of the clinical, cognitive and imaging data (magnetoencephalography, electroencephalography and magnetic resonance imaging) of participants with Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment will be taken at baseline and at one year. To assess reliability of magneto/electro-encephalographic changes, a subset of 30 participants with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer's disease will undergo repeat magneto/electro-encephalographic two weeks after baseline. Clinical and cognitive assessment will be repeated at 2 years. Linear mixed models of baseline and longitudinal change in neurophysiology are the primary analyses of interest, supported by Bayesian inference. Additional outputs will include relative effect sizes for physiological markers, atrophy and cognitive change and the respective numbers needed to treat each arm of simulated clinical trials of a future disease modifying therapy. Ethics and dissemination The study has received a favourable opinion from the East of England Cambridge Central Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 18/EE/0042). Results will be disseminated through internal reports, peer-reviewed scientific journals, conference presentations, website publication, submission to regulatory authorities and other publications.

In Japan, the 2030 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) target is an emissions reduction of 26% compared to 2013. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has led to 43,341,451 confirmed cases and 1,157,509 confirmed deaths globally and affected 218 countries (as of 27 October 2020). In Japan, as of the same date, 96,948 infectious cases and 1724 deaths related to the new coronavirus had been recorded. These numbers continue to increase. In Japan, in March 2020, the number of international tourist arrivals decreased by about 93% compared to last year at the same period. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) reported several significant scenarios for the tourism industry. COVID-19 is the greatest shock to international tourism since 1950 and represents an abrupt end to the 10-year period of sustained growth that followed the 2009 financial crisis. It was thought that it would be possible to analyze the economic, environmental, and social impacts of rapid social changes. Thus, this study estimates changes in Japan's tourist consumption, the carbon footprint (CFP), and employment due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The calculations in this study adopt a lifecycle approach using input-output tables. Based on these observations, this study uses four scenarios (SR 1, no recovery until December;SR 2, recovery from October;SR 3, recovery from July or September;and SR 0, same growth rate as 2018-2019) for Japan to calculate the CFP and employment change using input-output table analysis based on tourist consumption, which is a tourism metric. According to our results (2019 vs. SR 1 and 3), the consumption loss is between 20,540 billion yen (-65.1%) and 12,704 billion yen (-39.1%), the CFP reduction is between 89,488 kt-CO2eq (-64.2%) and 54,030 kt-CO2eq (-37.5%), and the employment loss is between 2,677,000 people (-64.2%) and 1,678,000 people (-37.5%). As of November 2020, the tourism industry continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the post-COVID-19 society, it will be necessary to maintain the GHG emissions reductions achieved in this short period and realize economic recovery. This recovery must also be sustainable for tourism stakeholders and society.","Kitamura, Y.; Karkour, S.; Ichisugi, Y.; Itsubo, N.",Sustainability,618,27

It has been proven to be effective, however, has a bottleneck that the infected person has to be questioned about his recent trajectory before any quarantine action could be taken, while sometimes trajectory information might not be timely and accurately obtained. In this paper, we propose an epidemiological investigation method which resort to artificial intelligence for extracting people's preferences and social relationship from their historical trajectory patterns. Trajectory data used in our epidemiological investigation method may include time, location, Point-of-Interest (POI), as well as Behavior-of-Interest (BOI). All of these attributes in human's trajectory are embedded into different channels in the proposed model and then fed into a classifier or a clusterer for serving different purposes. In our experiments, we applied the proposed method on a synthetic data set to conduct a classification task, and on a real data set for a clustering task. Both tasks confirm that the proposed method is effective and thus could be used to guide the preventive measures. © 2021 IEEE.","Wu, S.

Electrohydrodynamic jet (EHDJ) printing, one of the emerging 3D printing techniques, is capable of fabricating 3D scaffolds with oriented fibers and customized microscale structures. However, most of the EHDJ-printed scaffolds lack of hierarchical structures such as nanotopographies present in native tissues. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combine EHDJ printing of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL)/gliadin composite inks to produce scaffolds with oriented microfibers. The nanoscale pores and flaws (fiber nanotopography) could be generated on the printed fibers by simply leaching the gliadin phase from the printed PCL/gliadin scaffolds. The density and size of nanotopographical features could be controlled by adjusting the gliadin ratio. Furthermore, by seeding mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) cells, it clearly manifested that such scaffolds are favorable to cell adhesion, migration and proliferation efficiently. Thus, the newly designed PCL scaffolds with both micro- and nano-scale topographies can be a promising 3D cell culture platform with improved cell-scaffold interactions.","Sun, Jie; Jing, Linzhi; Liu, Hang; Huang, Dejian",Procedia Manufacturing,618,25

Particular attention was paid to the implications of COVID-19 and associated challenges for parent?child contact and reunification. With respect to professional stresses, more than half of participants worried about their own personal safety and health amidst COVID-19, and more than three-quarters expressed concerns about the safety and well-being of child welfare-involved families. Participants, especially attorneys, expressed concerns about parent?child contact and disruptions to reunification. In-person parent?child visits had all but ceased during the early part of the pandemic, and participants identified barriers to effective virtual visits, including lack of foster parent oversight, technology issues, and children?s developmental stage and/or lack of engagement. Attorneys were especially critical of the cessation of in-person visits and viewed this as a serious threat to child-parent bonds and reunification.

Stimulating development and/or function of brown fat is highly anticipated as a novel strategy for the treatment of obesity and its complications including type 2 diabetes. Previously, we identified a transcription factor nuclear factor I-A (NFIA) as a crucial regulator of brown fat. NFIA binds to and activates the brown-fat-specific enhancers even before differentiation and later facilitates the binding of PPARgamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma—a master transcription factor of adipogenesis), to control the brown fat gene program. Here we show that the C-terminal 17 amino acid residues of NFIA (which we call pro#3 domain) are required for the transcriptional activity of NFIA. Full-length NFIA—but not deletion mutant lacking pro#3 domain—rescued impaired Pparg expression and adipogenesis in NFIA-knockout cells. However, the deletion mutant still binds to Myod1 enhancer to represses Myod1 expression via competition with KLF5 in terms of enhancer binding, leading to suppression of myogenic gene program. Therefore, the negative effect of NFIA on the myogenic gene program is, at least partly, independent of the positive effect on Pparg expression and its downstream adipogenic gene program. Overall, our results uncover multiple ways of action of NFIA to ensure optimal regulation of brown adipocyte differentiation. Disclosure: Y.

Aim To evaluate the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of the 10 commonly used medicinal plants to treat respiratory illnesses in a comprehensive manner. Materials & Methods The acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts from the 10 plants were evaluated for antiviral, antifungal and antibacterial activity. Additionally, the aqueous extracts were also evaluated for immunomodulatory properties. Results None of the extracts exhibited antiviral activity against the four influenza viruses, antifungal activity against Candida albicans or antibacterial activity against Gram negative bacilli. Eight acetone extracts, nine ethanol extracts and one aqueous extract (NSAq) exhibited antibacterial activity at concentrations below 1mg/ml against S. pyogenes and/or S. pneumoniae.All the aqueous extracts exhibited dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity against the innate immunity cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, and the Th1 cytokine, IFN-γ, but not against the Th2 cytokine, IL-4. Conclusions Overall the study elucidates that the acetone and ethanol extracts exhibit antibacterial activity, while the commonly consumed aqueous extracts ameliorate respiratory illnesses through immune modulation.","Kannian, Priya; Mohana, Sambasivam; Vishwarohini, Manivasagam; Saleem, Abdul Rahim Mohamed",bioRxiv,618,29

Efforts to ?flatten the curve? have resulted in the temporary closure of exercise facilities and gyms, suspension of sport activities, and advisories to avoid public recreational spaces. All of these changes have made traditional opportunities to be physically active difficult to access. These changes have also exacerbated existing disparities in access to social and environmental supports for physical activity, potentially contributing to a widening gap in physical activity participation among those at greatest risk for COVID-19. Physical activity can play a special role in reducing the inequitable consequences of COVID-19;however, expansion and better targeting of evidence-informed interventions are needed that address the unique barriers present in communities that have been economically and socially marginalized to achieve health equity in COVID-19 outcomes. This review highlights effective and feasible strategies that provide more equitable access to physical activity programs and spaces across the United States. With a renewed investment in physical activity, this behavior can play a crucial role in improving population health and reducing disparities during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Hasson, Rebecca Sallis James F.; Coleman, Nailah Kaushal Navin Nocera Vincenzo G.; Keith, NiCole",American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine,618,4

The niclosamide dry powder, suitable for inhalation, is being developed as a therapeutic agent against COVID-19 infection. Niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug, is an interesting drug candidate because it was approved over 60 years ago for use as an anthelmintic medication, but recent studies demonstrated its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral with a specific pharmacological effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the past, clinical trials for other indications were terminated prior to completion due to low and highly variable oral bioavailability. In order to quickly address the current pandemic, targeting niclosamide directly to the lungs is rational to address the COVID-19 main clinical complications. Thin-film freezing technology was used to develop a niclosamide inhalation powder composition that exhibited acceptable aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 86.0% and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 1.11 μm and 2.84, respectively. This formulation not only proved to be safe after an acute three-day, multi-dose pharmacokinetic study in rats as evidenced by histopathology analysis, but also was able to achieve lung concentrations above the required IC50 and IC90 levels for at least 24 h after a single administration in a Syrian hamster model. To conclude, we successfully developed a niclosamide dry powder inhalation formulation by thin-film freezing for further scale-up and clinical testing against the COVID-19 infection. This approach overcomes niclosamide’s limitation of poor oral bioavailability by targeting the drug directly to the primary site of infection, the lungs.","Jara, Miguel O.; Warnken, Zachary N.; Sahakijpijarn, Sawittree; Moon, Chaeho; Maier, Esther Y.; Christensen, Dale J.; Koleng, John J.; Peters, Jay I.; Hackman, Sarah D.; Williams, Robert O.",bioRxiv,618,1

Using this method, a joint analysis of the number of infected and deceased will be performed. The DTW distance makes it possible to compare time series of different lengths, which is important when analyzing data for European countries because the virus has not spread to individual countries at the same time. After measuring the similarities between the time series, a hierarchical grouping for countries will be performed, which will allow us to find interesting patterns in the data. Then, ARIMA(p,d,q) models will be used to describe the dynamics of virus distribution in different EU countries. With these models, it is possible to gain knowledge about the mechanisms of pandemic evolution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Landmesser, J.","29th Conference of the Section on Classification and Data Analysis of the Polish Statistical Association, SKAD 2020",618,16

Given the recent availability and novel mechanisms of COVID-19 vaccines, there is limited data on possible hypersensitivity reactions. Although it seems rare, the incidence of anaphylaxis for approved COVID-19 vaccines has been suggested as being higher when compared to previous vaccines. Adequate risk assessment, recognition, classification, and management of hypersensitivity reactions is crucial to ensure safe immunization and avoid misinformation and vaccine hesitancy. In this review, we present an overview of the types of hypersensitivity reactions that can potentially occur due to vaccination and the possible allergenic components of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as a suggestion for causality and risk assessment for the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 and AZD1222 vaccines.","Carvalho, J.

Although each of these threats has its own characteristics, its underlying network determines the spreading. To restrain the spreading, a widely used approach is the fragmentation of these networks through immunization, so that epidemics cannot spread. Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet. In all cases, we find that not only is the average infection probability significantly suppressed, but also for the most relevant case of a small and limited number of immunization units the infection probability can be reduced by up to 55%.","Schneider, Christian M.; Mihaljev, Tamara; Havlin, Shlomo; Herrmann, Hans J.",,618,1

For this purpose, we conducted a quantitative study using descriptive, correlation, and regression analyses applied to data collected from company decision-makers. Our results show that demand for products/services and cash flow in companies has decreased significantly, the workforce being affected by dismissals and temporary leaves/furloughing. Additionally, the average linear revenue of companies has been decreasing due to insufficient cash flow, higher absenteeism of workers, customers having been affected, and the demand going down. Therefore, employee dismissals, employee temporary leaves (furlough), and dismissal intentions have been positively correlated with insufficient cash flow in companies and an extremely low demand.","Elena-Sabina, Turnea Ștefan Andrei Neștian Tiță Silviu Mihail Vodă Ana Iolanda Guță Alexandra Luciana",Sustainability,618,2

At the beginning of the vaccine era, the initial epitope profile in naive individuals will be the first step to build an optimal host defense system towards vaccine-based population immunity. In this study, the high-resolution linear epitope profiles between Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine recipients and COVID-19 patients were delineated by using microarrays mapped with overlapping peptides of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The vaccine-induced antibodies targeting RBD had broader distribution across the RBD than that induced by the natural infection. The relatively lower neutralizing antibody titers observed in vaccine-induced sera could attribute to less efficient epitope selection and maturation of the vaccine-induced humoral immunity compared to the infection-induced. Furthermore, additional mutation panel assays showed that the vaccine-induced rich epitope variety targeting the RBD may aid antibodies to escape rapid viral evolution, which could grant an advantage to the vaccine immunity.","Nitahara, Y.; Nakagama, Y.; Kaku, N.; Candray, K.; Michimuko, Y.; Tshibangu-Kabamba, E.; Kaneko, A.; Yamamoto, H.; Mizobata, Y.; Kakeya, H.; Yasugi, M.; Kido, Y.",,618,24

While the scale of these manoeuvres is in some ways unprecedented, the toll that the virus and its primary means of mitigation - social distancing -extracts along racial lines is at once unequal and deeply familiar. In this Position Piece, I examine social distancing as de-densification within a larger history of family planning and raciali sed populatio n management in the context of ongoing fieldwork on the material and affective implications of contraceptive use in the American Midwest. In probing the grammar of social distancing -its distinctions between 'essential' and 'non-essential ' workers, services, and spaces and the ways in which such distinctions unequally distribute the labour of de-densification and its impacts on family planning - I elucidate how COVID-19 managements do not simply reveal existing racial disparities, but make them anew at a time when the fabrics of social reproduction are increasingly under strain. The dynamics of social distancing can thus be understood as continuous with ongoing attempts at racialised population management. Such an understanding opens a space for political action foreclosed by a narrow view of social distancing as crisis response.","Hodge, C. C.",Medicine Anthropology Theory,618,26

Those patients are often treated with commonly used antiviral and antihypertensive agents concomitantly, such as ritonavir-containing regimens and nifedipine. Since ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A, when nifedipine is combined with ritonavir-containing antiviral drugs, there is a potential risk of drug-drug interaction. This study aimed to provide guidance on nifedipine treatment during and after co-administration with ritonavir-containing regimens using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) analysis. Methods A PBPK/PD model was developed for nifedipine by the software of Simcyp, and the model was verified using published data. The effects of ritonavir on nifedipine exposures and systolic blood pressure were assessed for instant-release, sustained-release and controlled-release formulations. Moreover, various nifedipine regimens were investigated when co-administrated with and withdrawing ritonavir. Results PBPK/PD models for three formulations of nifedipine were successfully established. The model predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of nifedipine were comparable to the published data. Ratios of predicted versus observed AUCDDI/AUCNifedipine of nifedipine were within 0.70- to 1.83-fold. Model simulations showed that the inhibitory effect of ritonavir on CYP3A4 increased the Cmax of nifedipine by 9.82-34.35 times and the AUC by 44.94-50.77 times at steady state. Moreover, nifedipine dose reduced to 1/16 of the regular dose during ritonavir co-administration could lead to severe hypotension. Conclusions Ritonavir had a pronounced influence on the pharmacokinetics and antihypertensive effect of nifedipine. It is not recommended for patients to take nifedipine and ritonavir-containing regimens simultaneously.","Niu, W.-j.; Li, S.-z.; Jin, S.-s.; Lin, X.-y.; Zhang, M.-w.; Cai, W.-m.; Zhong, M.-k.; Xiang, X.-q.; Jiao, Z.",,618,1

Variation between production systems and reporting disparity have resulted in discordance in previous emissions estimates. To assess systems-wide GHG implications of meeting increasing edible oil demand, we performed a unified re-analysis of life cycle input data from diverse oil palm, soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower production systems, from a saturating search of published literature. The resulting dataset reflects almost 6,000 producers in 38 countries, and is representative of over 74% of global vegetable oil production. Determination of the carbon cost of agricultural land occupation revealed that carbon storage potential drives variation in production GHG emissions, and indicates that expansion of production in low carbon storage potential land, whilst reforesting areas of high carbon storage potential, could reduce net GHG emissions whilst boosting productivity. Nevertheless, there remains considerable scope to improve sustainability within current production systems.","Alcock, Thomas D; Salt, David E; Wilson, Paul; Ramsden, Stephen J",bioRxiv,618,11

The states, where the virus has spread and affected the whole world, make new regulations in the context of social policy and develop new models. In this case, it is seen that a link is established between politics and biological life. Depending on biological processes, governments focus on the needs of the era and social life. Thus, it is observed that a ""bio-political"" transformation is under construction. After the Covid 19 pandemic, all governments have imposed new social regulations so that they can implement education policies as an effective social government policy. In this regard, the statements that it would be the right decision to interrupt face-to-face education for a while in educational institutions came to the fore.

Thus the analysis of genomic mutations of these circulatory strains may give an insight into the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and evolution favoring the development of effective treatment and containment strategies. With this target, the current study traced the evolutionary route and mutational frequency of 198 Bangladesh originated SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences available in the GISAID platform over a period of 13 weeks as of 14 July 2020. The analyses were performed using MEGA 7, Swiss Model Repository, Virus Pathogen Resource and Jalview visualization. Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains in the country belong to B and/or L type among cluster A to Z and strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in Nonspecific protein 2 (NSP2), NSP3, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Helicase, Spike, ORF3a, and Nucleocapsid (N) protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations(UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, E (Envelope), NSP7a, ORF 6, and ORF 7b suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed an association with sex and age of the COVID-19 positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate drug/ vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.","Saha, Otun; Shatadru, Rokaiya Nurani; Rakhi, Nadira Naznin; Islam, Israt; Hossain, Md.

Some theories posit that humans learn these statistics by forming cognitive maps, or underlying representations of the latent space which links items in the sequence. Here, an item in the sequence is a node, and the probability of transitioning between two items is an edge. Sequences can then be generated from walks through the latent space, with different spaces giving rise to different sequence statistics. Individual or group differences in sequence learning can be modeled by changing the time scale over which estimates of transition probabilities are built, or in other words, by changing the amount of temporal discounting. Latent space models with temporal discounting bear a resemblance to models of navigation through Euclidean spaces. However, few explicit links have been made between predictions from Euclidean spatial navigation and neural activity during human sequence learning. Here, we use a combination of behavioral modeling and intracranial encephalography (iEEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity might support the formation of space-like cognitive maps through temporal discounting during sequence learning. Specifically, we acquire human reaction times from a sequential reaction time task, to which we fit a model that formulates the amount of temporal discounting as a single free parameter. From the parameter, we calculate each individual’s estimate of the latent space. We find that neural activity reflects these estimates mostly in the temporal lobe, including areas involved in spatial navigation. Similar to spatial navigation, we find that low dimensional representations of neural activity allow for easy separation of important features, such as modules, in the latent space. Lastly, we take advantage of the high temporal resolution of iEEG data to determine the time scale on which latent spaces are learned. We find that learning typically happens within the first 500 trials, and is modulated by the underlying latent space and the amount of temporal discounting characteristic of each participant. Ultimately, this work provides important links between behavioral models of sequence learning and neural activity during the same behavior, and contextualizes these results within a broader framework of domain general cognitive maps.","Stiso, Jennifer; Lynn, Christopher W.; Kahn, Ari E.; Rangarajan, Vinitha; Szymula, Karol P.; Archer, Ryan; Revell, Andrew; Stein, Joel M.; Litt, Brian; Davis, Kathryn A.; Lucas, Timothy H.; Bassett, Dani S.",bioRxiv,618,24

Instructional designers played a role in supporting instructors to make this transition. This support included professional learning opportunities in the form of workshops and coaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate instructional designers’ shifting thinking about the professional learning experiences they are providing and will provide for instructors in institutions of higher education during the pandemic and beyond. Six instructional designers from four universities participated in two focus groups for this study. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The instructional designers in this study viewed professional learning during the pandemic as a time to address what they saw as persistent problems with online learning. Moreover, they indicated a willingness to engage in extended faculty development to explore mutually identified challenges with online teaching and learning in their contexts.

It consists of compartments corresponding to susceptible, vaccinated susceptible, infectious, vaccinated infectious, active, and dead populations with various vaccine efficacies and vaccination deployment rates. Abstract We simulate different scenarios and initial conditions, and we find that the abundance and higher rate of deployment of low efficacy vaccines would lower the cumulative number of deaths in comparison to slower deployment of high efficacy vaccines. However, the latter can lower the number of active cases and achieve faster and higher herd immunity. We also forecast that, at the same daily deployment rate, the earlier introduction of vaccination schemes with lower efficacy would also lower the number of deaths with respect to a delayed introduction of high efficacy vaccines, which can however, still achieve lower numbers of infections and better herd immunity.","El Deeb, O.; Jalloul, M.",,618,1

Here two novel stereolithography-based three-dimensional (3D)-printed nasopharyngeal swabs are reported which are made using a biocompatible and sterilizable photoresist. Such swabs are readily manufactured on-site and on-demand to ensure availability, if supply chain shortages emerge. Additionally, the 3D-printed swabs easily adapt to current workflow and testing procedures in hospital clinical laboratories to allow for effortless scaling up of test kits. Finally, the 3D-printed nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrate concordant SARS-CoV-2 testing results between the 3D-printed swabs and the COPAN commercial swabs, and enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples obtained from autopsies.","Song, Jiaxi Korunes-Miller Jeremy Banerji Rohin Wu Yuanqiao Fazeli Shoreh Zheng Hanqiao Orr Beverley Morgan Elise Andry Christopher Henderson Joel Miller Nancy S.; White, Alice Grinstaff Mark W.",Global Challenges,618,5

These existing methods are costly, require extensive sample handling time, and have limited throughput. Here, we describe V-seq, an inexpensive, fast, and scalable method that performs targeted viral genome sequencing by multiplexing virus-specific primers at the cDNA synthesis step. We designed densely tiled reverse transcription (RT) primers across the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with a subset of hexamers at the 3’ end to minimize mis-priming from the abundant human rRNA repeats and human RNA PolII transcriptome. We found that overlapping RT primers do not interfere, but rather act in concert to improve viral genome coverage in samples with low viral load. We provide a path to optimize V-seq with SARS-CoV-2 as an example. We anticipate that V-seq can be applied to investigate genome evolution and track outbreaks of RNA viruses in a cost-effective manner. More broadly, the multiplexed RT approach by V-seq can be generalized to other applications of targeted RNA sequencing.","Guo, Longhua; Boocock, James; Tome, Jacob M.; Chandrasekaran, Sukantha; Hilt, Evann E.; Zhang, Yi; Sathe, Laila; Li, Xinmin; Luo, Chongyuan; Kosuri, Sriram; Shendure, Jay A.; Arboleda, Valerie A.; Flint, Jonathan; Eskin, Eleazar; Garner, Omai B.; Yang, Shangxin; Bloom, Joshua S.; Kruglyak, Leonid; Yin, Yi",bioRxiv,618,16

Design/methodology/approach: The case study method was used to analyse the disruptions faced by the agricultural food supply chain during the pandemic. The study applies a dynamic capability theory as a foundation to develop a contextualised resilience framework for agri-food supply chain to achieve operational excellence. The case has been analysed by using situation-actor-process (SAP) and learning-action-performance (LAP) framework. Findings: The SAP aspect of framework points that the flexibility amongst actors for a resilient agriculture supply chain worsened due to the lockdown measures post COVID-19. The LAP aspect of framework suggests how resilience can be built at the supply, demand and logistics end through various proactive and reactive practices such as collaboration, coordination, ICT and ground-level inputs. Lack of commitment and inadequate support from top management towards supply chain resilience are also observed as significant challenges to maintain operational excellence during the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: One of the major implications of the study is that a mix of capabilities rather than a single capability can be the most appropriate way for making the supply chain resilient to maintain operational excellence during the pandemic. However, the sources of disruptions need to be duly recognised to derive the best-contextualised resilience framework for agri-food supply chains. Originality/value: The development of a contextualised research framework as well as research propositions for analysing supply chain resilience are the major contribution of this study. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mishra, R.; Singh, R.

The empirical base for the study is comprised of “diaries of professionals” — 34 diaries which were kept by social science experts from March 25 to June 10 2020 (“first wave”), and then from the 20th to the 30th of September 2020 (“second wave”) — belonging to sociologists, philosophers, philologists, anthropologists, political scientists, historians, orientalists. Thus, a collection of thick descriptions was collected, representing a mix between a personal diary and research reflective autoethnography. Based on the review of the scientific discussion on the problem of trust, a significant conclusion is made about the contradictions between “trust” itself, which implies the possibility of choice and pertains mainly to interpersonal relations, and ‘confidence’ in social and state institutions, which implies much less agency of the subject of trust. It is concluded that the epidemic has greatly exacerbated the problem of lack of trust, noted in the context of the spread of “post-truth” and “fake news” at a global level, but especially noticeable in Russia, where this deficit significantly undermines the very possibility of basic solidarity. The authors of the diaries, as researchers, note that “comfortable” forms of a trust prevail in their social milieu, which creates some uncertain illusion of security. People tend to trust those who help maintain their identity and relieve fear, as well as their familiar “trusted” sources. However, many of them sense the diminished reliability of these “pillars of trust” in a new unpredictable situation. © 2021, Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

However, the existing PHS systems feeding on SM data have not been widely deployed in national surveillance systems, which appears to stem from the lack of practitioners' trust in SM data. More robust datasets over which machine learning (ML) models can be trained/tested reliably is a significant step toward overcoming this hurdle.

ARDS is mediated by increased amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to lung damage. ARDS remains an important unmet medical need. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have been suggested as a potential treatment for ARDS due to their significant immunomodulatory properties. While MSCs and their sEVs share immunomodulatory properties, sEVs have the added advantages of increased safety and improved tissue penetration. Methods, Results & Conclusion: In this study we compared the effect of two types of sEVs: sEVs isolated from naïve MSC (Exo MSC) or sEVs isolated from MSCs which were induced to secrete increased levels of neurotrophic and immunomodulatory factors (Exo MSC-NTF). Exo MSC or Exo MSC-NTF were administered intratracheally to mice following induction of ARDS using lipopolysaccharide. We found that the beneficial effect of Exo MSC-NTF was superior to Exo MSC in multiple parameters, including increase in blood oxygen saturation and reduction in lung pathology, neutrophil infiltration and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Specifically, Exo MSC-NTF significantly decreased interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) levels, while Exo MSC were not able to do so. To explore the differences between Exo MSC and Exo MSC-NTF we evaluated modifications in protein cargo. ELISA measurements revealed that amphiregulin (AREG) was 16-fold higher and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was greater than 3-fold higher in Exo MSC-NTF than in Exo MSC. Both AREG and LIF are reported to have beneficial effects in ARDS models, either through immunomodulation or cellular repair. The observed positive preclinical results suggest that intratracheal administration of Exo MSC-NTF may be suitable as a therapy for ARDS due to COVID-19 or other causes, and may be more effective at modifying ARDS physiological, pathological, and biochemical outcomes than sEVs isolated from naïve MSCs. Increased expression of LIF and AREG in Exo MSC-NTF may contribute to the effectiveness of this innovative treatment modality.","Kaspi, H.; Semo, J.; Abramov, N.; Dekel, C.; Lindborg, S.; Chang, S.; Kern, R.; Lebovits, C.; Aricha, R.",Cytotherapy,618,1

However, analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving CoronaVac-induced immunity is still limited. Here, we applied a systems biology approach to understand the mechanisms behind the adaptive immune response to CoronaVac in a cohort of 50 volunteers immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac. Vaccination with CoronaVac led to an integrated immune response that included several effector arms of the adaptive immune system including specific IgM/IgG, humoral response and other immune response, as well as the innate immune system as shown by complement activation. Metabolites associated with immunity were also identified implicating the role of metabolites in the humoral response, complement activation and other immune response. Networks associated with the TCA cycle and amino acids metabolic pathways, such as phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, we constructed a multifactorial response network (MRN) to analyze the underlying interactions and compared the signatures affected by CoronaVac immunization and SARS-CoV-2 infection to further identify immune signatures and related metabolic pathways altered by CoronaVac immunization. These results suggest that protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved via multiple mechanisms and highlights the utility of a systems biology approach in defining molecular correlates of protection to vaccination.","Wang, Y.; Wang, X.; Luu, L.

Higher values of HF components and RMSSD were obtained for a less physical demanding gameplay session, whereas the predominance of LF components was observed for the game session with high level of difficulty. These findings suggested that this serious game had an important impact on both physical and cognitive stimulation, and therefore its implementation in home-based assisted environments can help increase weekly performance of physical activity, enhance balance and limbs mobility, help to reduce anxiety levels, and maintain high levels of HRV. © 2021 IEEE.","Rodrigues, M.

Understanding risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 related LRTD in pts with cancer is imperative for the development of preventive measures. Methods: We examined all patients aged 18 years or older with cancer and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection reported between March 16, 2020 and February 6, 2021 in the international CCC19 registry. We examined frequency of LRTD (pneumonia, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure), demographic and clinicopathologic factors associated with LRTD, and 30-day and overall mortality in pts with and without LRTD. Results: Of 7,289 pts with a median follow-up time of 42 (21-90) days, 2187 (30%) developed LRTD. Pts of older age (65 yrs or older), male sex, pre-existing comorbidities, baseline immunosuppressants, baseline corticosteroids, and ECOG performance status of 2 or more had substantially higher rates of LRTD compared to those without these risk factors (Table). We did not observe differences in LRTD rates between pts of different racial/ethnic groups, smoking history, hypertension, obesity, cancer status, timing or type of anti-cancer therapy. LRTD was more likely in pts with thoracic malignancy (39%), hematological malignancy (39%) compared to those with other solid tumors (27%). The majority of pts (86%) had symptomatic presentation;however, 8% of pts with asymptomatic presentation developed LRTD. 30-day and overall mortality rates were significantly higher in pts with LRTD than those without LRTD (31% vs. 4% and 38% vs. 6%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: COVID-19 related LRTD rate is high and associated with worse mortality rates in pts with cancer. The majority of risk factors associated with LRTD demonstrate underlying immunodeficiency or lung structural damage as a driving force in this population. Identifying pts at high-risk for developing LRTD can help guide clinical management, improve pt outcomes, increase the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy, and direct future clinical trial designs for vaccine or antiviral agents.

We aim to quantify the surgical backlog during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Brazilian public health system and determine the relationship between state-level policy response and the degree of state-level delays in public surgical care. Methods Monthly estimates of surgical procedures performed per state from January 2016 to December 2020 were obtained from Brazil's Unified Health System Informatics Department. Forecasting models using historical surgical volume data before March 2020 (first reported COVID-19 case) were constructed to predict expected monthly operations from March through December 2020. Total, emergency, and elective surgical monthly backlogs were calculated by comparing reported volume to forecasted volume. Linear mixed effects models were used to model the relationship between public surgical delivery and two measures of health policy response: the COVID-19 Stringency Index (SI) and the Containment & Health Index (CHI) by state. Findings Between March and December 2020, the total surgical backlog included 1,119,433 (95% Confidence Interval 762,663–1,523,995) total operations, 161,321 (95%CI 37,468–395,478) emergent operations, and 928,758 (95%CI 675,202–1,208,769) elective operations. Increased SI and CHI scores were associated with reductions in emergent surgical delays but increases in elective surgical backlogs. The maximum government stringency (score = 100) reduced emergency delays to nearly zero but tripled the elective surgical backlog. Interpretation Strong health policy efforts to contain COVID-19 ensure minimal reductions in delivery of emergent surgery, but dramatically increase elective backlogs. Additional coordinated government efforts will be necessary to specifically address the increased elective backlogs that accompany stringent responses.","Truche, Paul Campos Letícia Nunes Marrazzo Enzzo Barrozo Rangel Ayla Gerk Bernardino Ramon Bowder Alexis N.; Buda, Alexandra M.; Faria, Isabella Pompermaier Laura Rice Henry E.; Watters, David Dantas Fernanda Lage Lima Mooney David P.; Botelho, Fabio Ferreira Rodrigo Vaz Alonso Nivaldo",The Lancet Regional Health - Americas,618,24

We perform and analyze 1 million realizations for each different initial condition considering equal and unequal mass three-body systems to provide high accuracy statistics. We measure 4 quantities characterizing the statistical distribution of ergodic disintegrations: escape probability of each body, the characteristic exponent for escapes by a narrow margin, predicted absorptivity as a function of binary energy and binary angular momentum, and, finally, the lifetime distribution. The escape probabilities are shown to be in agreement down to the 1% level with the emissivity-blind, flux-based theoretical prediction. This represents a leap in accuracy compared to previous three-body statistical theories. The characteristic exponent at the threshold for marginally unbound escapes is an emissivity-independent flux-based prediction, and the measured values are found to agree well with the prediction.

However, the molecular mechanisms that trigger a transition from a benign chronic infection into pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we investigated the role of the cellular stress response in provoking a chronic-to-acute transition in viral replication in a model of mumps virus infection. Using a combination of cell biology, whole-cell proteomics and cryo-electron tomography we show that stress induces phosphorylation of the disordered viral Phosphoprotein, which we suggest facilitates partitioning of the viral polymerase into preformed viral condensates, constituting the core components of the viral replication machinery. This occurs concomitantly with a conformational change in the viral nucleocapsids that exposes the viral genome and can further facilitate its replication. These changes in the viral condensate upon exogenous stress, accompanied by down-regulation of the host antiviral response, provide an environment that supports up-regulation of viral replication and virion release. Thus, we elucidate molecular and structural mechanisms of a stress-mediated switch that disrupts the equilibrium between the virome and the host in chronic infection.","Zhang, Xiaojie; Sridharan, Sindhuja; Zagoriy, Ievgeniia; Eugster Oegema, Christina; Ching, Cyan; Pflaesterer, Tim; Fung, Herman K.

The structure of interest lies in the formulation of the underlying partition, which defines the process, in which, in addition to a finite memory o associated with the process, a parameter G is introduced, allowing an extra dependence on the past complementing the dependence given by the usual memory o. We show, by simulations, how algorithms designed for the classic version of the PMM can have difficulties in recovering the structure investigated here. This specific structure is efficient for modeling a complete genome sequence, coming from the newly decoded Coronavirus Covid-19 in humans [see Wu et al., Nature 579, 265–269 (2020)]. The sequence profile is represented by 13 units (parts of the state space’s partition), for each of the 13 units, their respective transition probabilities are computed for any element of the genetic alphabet. Also, the structure proposed here allows us to develop a comparison study with other genomic sequences of Coronavirus, collected in the last 25 years, through which we conclude that Covid-19 is shown next to SARS-like Coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) from bats specimens in Zhoushan [see Hu et al., Emerg Microb Infect 7, 1–10 (2018)].","García, Jesús Enrique González-López Verónica Andrea Tasca Gustavo Henrique",4open,618,16

In recent decade, SWFs as state-run investment vehicles have proved to be the fastest growing group of institutional investors and have noticeably strengthened their role in the global financial system. According to the latest estimates, their cumulative AUM reached 9.1 billion US dollars as of December 2020. There are persuasive evidences that top-10 SWFs from Norway, China, Singapore, Persian Gulf and some other nations have evolved into full-fledged market-driven investors with an active portfolio management strategy. The fact that they continue to contribute the lion’s share (around 2/3) into the integral figures of SWFs’ performance as a group explains why the pandemic failed to undermine their progress. Also, it should be taken in mind that, in contrast to GFC of 2008–2009, the recent coronacrisis was featured by a seemingly surprising gap between the deep recession in real sector businesses and eventual growth of basic indexes of capital markets. Generally, this turned good for the financial market community, including many SWFs. For instance, the world’s largest Norwegian GPFG, despite an urgent sellout of some of its assets in order to help the national government in financing somewhat undermined state budget in the situation of deep slump at world oil market, reported, by the end of the year, the 10.9% operational profit and 8.2% increment of AUM (in terms of local currency). In the upcoming years, we may see the state funds vehicles to increasing change the whole landscape of the global investment playfield. It is highly likely that the post-COVID turbulent environment will increasingly push the SWFs not only to seek for viable alternatives to the increasingly fading traditional fixed-income instruments but to fundamentally change the mandates and the modes of operation. The traditional stabilization and saving state investment funds will step down in favor of a subgroup of the so called strategic SWFs, such as Singaporean Temasek, Chinese CIC, Saudi PIF, Indian NIIF, Malaysian Khazanah, Turkish TVF, Bahraini Mubadala, and Russian RDIF. Basically, they are charged to operate as the catalysts of national economic and social development. It may be expected that in the near future this category of state investors will see a growing number of newcomers. © 2021, Russian Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.","Chebanov, S.

In the first year, students had the options of attending live lectures by the course instructor and viewing online modules pre-recorded by the instructor, with the lectures and modules covering identical content; in addition, all students had a mandatory weekly application session. Utilizing pre-course and post-course tests as an instrument with which to measure learning during the course, we observed significantly increased learning (0.7 standard deviations) with attendance of traditional lectures and decreased learning with use of online modules, even after adjustment for grade point average. In the second year, the course had the same curriculum, but students were randomized to either live lectures or online modules for the first half of the course, crossing over to the other modality during the second half. With randomization, no difference in learning was observed between the two groups. Furthermore, we found that students self-reported greater engagement when viewing online modules than when attending lectures in person. These findings suggest some aspects of the lecture experience can be shifted to online modules in STEM courses without impacts on student learning so as to use classroom time more fully for application-based active learning interventions.","Musunuru, Kiran; Machanda, Zarin P.; Qiao, Lyon; Anderson, William J.",bioRxiv,618,1

Prior work validated the first two tenets, and the final four are new. We followed all six tenets to create a new robotic platform, HuggieBot 2.0, that has a soft, warm, inflated body (HuggieChest) and uses visual and haptic sensing to deliver closed-loop hugging. We first verified the outward appeal of this platform in comparison to the previous PR2-based HuggieBot 1.0 via an online video-watching study involving 117 users. We then conducted an in-person experiment in which 32 users each exchanged eight hugs with HuggieBot 2.0, experiencing all combinations of visual hug initiation, haptic sizing, and haptic releasing. The results show that adding haptic reactivity definitively improves user perception a hugging robot, largely verifying our four new tenets and illuminating several interesting opportunities for further improvement.","Block, Alexis E.; Christen, Sammy; Gassert, Roger; Hilliges, Otmar; Kuchenbecker, Katherine J.",,618,32

In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by Hurricane Maria, the largest natural disaster to ever affect the island. Several studies have estimated the excess morbidity and mortality following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, yet no study has comprehensively examined the underlying health system weaknesses contributing to the deleterious health outcomes. Methods: A qualitative case study was conducted to assess the ability of the UPR health system to provide patient care in response to Hurricane Maria. An established five key resilience framework and inductive analysis was used to identify factors that affected health system resilience. Thirteen Emergency Medicine Physicians, Family Medicine Physicians, and Hospital Administrators in a University of Puerto Rico (UPR) Community Hospital were interviewed as part of our study. Results: Of the five key resiliency components, three domains were notably weak with respect to UPR's resiliency. Prior to the Hurricane, key personnel at the UPR hospital were unaware of the limited capacity of back-up generators at hospitals and were ill-prepared to transfer ICU patients to appropriate hospitals. Post Hurricane, the hospital faced self-regulation challenges when triaging the provision of Hurricane-related emergency services with delivering core health services, in particular for patients with chronic conditions. Finally, during and after the Hurricane, integration of patient care coordination between the UPR hospital ambulances, neighboring hospitals, and national and state government was suboptimal. The two remaining resiliency factors, addressing diverse needs and system adaptiveness in a time of crisis, were seen as strengths. Conclusions: Hurricane Maria exposed weaknesses in the Puerto Rican health system, notably the lack of awareness about the limited capacity of backup generators, poor patient care coordination, and interruption of medical care for patients with chronic conditions. As in other countries, the current COVID epidemic is taxing the capacity of the Puerto Rico health system, which could increase the likelihood of another health system collapse should another hurricane hit the island. Therefore, a resilience framework is a useful tool to help health systems identify areas of improvement in preparation for possible natural disasters.","Rios, C. C.; Ling, E.

The pandemic forced the cancellation of all campus activities, both extra-curricular and program-focused, such as student teaching experiences and nursing clinical rotations. Additionally, instructors were forced to rethink content delivery as coursework was quickly moved online and administered remotely via virtual platforms. Students were impacted as university level programs underwent a major paradigm shift within a matter of days or weeks. This study examined perspectives of undergraduate and graduate students regarding their experiences with rapid conversion from on-ground, in-person courses to remote instruction during the spring 2020 semester. The researchers employed a QUAN-QUAL descriptive mixed methods design. Using questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, the researchers examined general perspectives on in-person learning before the pandemic;initial perceptions about remote learning;and perceptions of the students about effort, engagement, needs, and ethical behavior as they engaged in totally remote learning. Results, analyzed using SPSS (QUAN) and inter-coder agreement (QUAL), indicated that initially students were engaged and satisfied with their in-person instruction, but became less satisfied and engaged during remote instruction. Undergraduate students experienced feelings of increased frustration, decreased accountability and engagement during remote learning, and turned to collaboration to earn points as they finished the semester.","Parker, S.

When health practitioners endorse such attitudes they pose a serious risk to not only their patients but the whole community. This requires a robust response from health practitioner regulators, disciplinary tribunals and courts.

Since the early days of helical single-slice and then multislice CT, CT angiography (CTA) has been one of the most technically demanding applications, both in terms of scanning technique and contrast medium (CM) injection protocol, due to the need to acquire a large amount of high-resolution data over a limited period corresponding to the peak contrast enhancement of the arterial system. Iodine concentration is one of the main determinants of arterial enhancement in CTA, and current low-osmolar and iso-osmolar nonionic CM for intravascular administration still come in a handful of molecules, but a relatively wide range of different iodine concentrations. This gives the opportunity to optimize CTA protocols as a function of several factors such as patient characteristics, CT technology, and CM features in an attempt to maximize the diagnostic yield of CTA examinations while considering patient safety and avoiding unnecessary extra costs. Our aim is to provide an up-to-date overview of the existing evidence on how changing iodine concentration can have an impact on CTA performance, especially with the use of state-of-the-art CT and power injector technology, in the perspective of improving patient care while minimizing overall exposure to iodinated CM and ionizing radiation.","Faggioni, Lorenzo; Gabelloni, Michela",Investigative radiology,618,31

Although scores estimating success and efficiency in CTO PCI have been developed, there is currently no available score for estimation of the risk for periprocedural complications. We sought to develop a scoring tool for prediction of periprocedural complications during CTO PCI. METHODS AND RESULTS We analyzed data from 1569 CTO PCIs in the Prospective Global Registry for the Study of Chronic Total Occlusion Intervention (PROGRESS CTO) using a derivation and validation sampling ratio of 2:1. Variables independently associated with periprocedural complications in multivariable analysis in the derivation set were assigned points based on their respective odds ratios. Forty-four (2.8%) patients experienced complications. Three factors were independent predictors of complications and were included in the score: patient age >65 years, +3 points (odds ratio, OR=4.85, CI 1.82-16.77); lesion length ≥23 mm, +2 points (OR=3.22, CI 1.08-13.89); and use of the retrograde approach +1 point (OR=2.41, CI 1.04-6.05). The resulting score showed good calibration and discriminatory capacity in the derivation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 6.271, P=0.281, receiver-operating characteristic [ROC] area=0.758) and validation (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 4.551, P=0.473, ROC area=0.793) sets. Score values of 0 to 2, 3 to 4, and ≥5 were defined as low, intermediate, and high risk of complications (derivation cohort 0.4%, 1.8%, 6.5%, P<0.001; validation cohort 0.0%, 2.5%, 6.8%, P<0.001).

We aimed to study the molecular epidemiology of a major care home outbreak in Denmark. Methods After a staff member had been tested positive on 16 November 2020, a bundle approach programme was initiated including frequent surveillance screenings of residents and staff, isolation and cohorting procedures. This approach also involved limiting the number of visitors and enhancing the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning. Naso/oropharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction. Available positive samples were sequenced and phylogenetic relationships between the outbreak and local circulating strains were reconstructed. Results In all, 50% (56/114) of residents and 26% (49/190) of staff members became infected during the 46-day outbreak period. Altogether 16% of the infected residents died within 30 days after becoming infected. A total of 44% (46/105) of the samples with SARS-CoV-2 were sequenced. and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a dominant outbreak lineage belonging to Global Lineage B.1.1.29 containing the mutation I233V in the S gene. The outbreak lineage was detected in the community 28 days before its introduction into the care home. Conclusions Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to care homes is associated with severe outbreaks. Initiation of a bundle approach infection control programme in addition to measures ensuring enhanced herd immunity were successful in controlling the outbreak.

METHODS Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to collect the active components and corresponding targets of Qixuekang. Disease targets, related to COVID-19 during the recovery period, were collected from the GeneCards database. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was built by using the String database, and analyzing and using Cytoscape 3.7.0 software to screen out hub genes. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were analyzed by R 3.6.1 software. RESULTS 34 active components of Qixuekang were screened out, and 161 common targets of drug and disease were identified. GO enrichment suggested 141 biologic processes, mainly involving nuclear receptor activity, transcription factor activity, and direct ligand regulated sequence-specific DNA binding. KEGG pathway enrichment suggests 96 signaling pathways, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signal pathway, and C-type lectin receptor signal pathway.

Paired serum samples obtained were tested for antibodies to BCV, using antibody-detection ELISA. Information was collected on weight gain, clinical signs, and treatments for enteric and respiratory tract disease during the study period. RESULTS Number of samples positive for bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV) or bovine enteric coro navirus (BECV) was 37/224 (17%) and 48/223 (22%), respectively. Some cattle (25/46, 45%) shed BECV and BRCV. There were 25/29 (86%) cattle positive for BECV that shed BRCV, but only 1/27 (4%) cattle negative to BECV shed BRCV. Twenty-seven of 48 (56%) paired nasal swab specimens and fecal samples positive for BECV were positive for BRCV.

In this communication, we demonstrate that, during a mixed infection with two different MHVs, the leader RNA sequences from one virus could be detected on the mRNAs of the coinfecting virus at a high frequency, as if the leader sequence and mRNAs were joined together from two randomly segregating RNA segments. This finding demonstrates that MHV mRNA transcription utilizes independently transcribed leader RNA species that possess the trans-acting property.

In 1996, the Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre (TSRCC) initiated a Rapid Response Radiotherapy Program (RRRP) to provide timely palliative RT for symptom relief of patients with terminal cancer. PURPOSE This study reviews the clinical activity of the RRRP over the past 8 years to evaluate if we are meeting the objectives of the program. MATERIALS AND METHODS From the TSRCC oncology patient information system (OPIS) database, we retrieved the number of patients referred to the RRRP, their demographics, diagnosis and treatment for the calendar years 1996 to 2003 inclusive. We calculated the time interval between referral to consultation, consultation to simulation and the percentage of cases who started RT on their initial consultation for all new cases referred to the RRRP. RESULTS From 1996 to 2003, the number of cases seen in consultation increased from just over 200 cases annually in the first 2 years to about 500 cases per year in the last 4 years, for a total of 3,290. There were 1,792 (54%) men and 1,498 (46%) women; median age was 69 years (range, 21-95 years). Breast, lung, genitourinary and gastrointestinal primaries accounted for over 80% of all referrals. The majority was referred for palliative treatment of symptomatic bone (70%) or brain (14%) metastases. The dose fractionation for bone metastases was a single 8-Gy fraction in 45%, 20 Gy in five fractions in 42%, 30 Gy in ten fractions in 4% and other dose fractionations in 9%. Nearly 90% were seen within 2 weeks of referral (38% within 1 week). Eighty-five percent were simulated on the day of their initial consultation. Sixty percent started their RT treatment on the day of their consultation visit. The overall median interval from referral to treatment was 8 days. CONCLUSION Over the past 8 years, the annual number of new cases referred to the RRRP has doubled. The overall median interval from referral to consultation was 8 days. Sixty percent were simulated, planned and started treatment on the day of their initial consultation. We therefore are meeting our goal of providing rapid access to palliative RT for symptomatic cancer patients.","Danjoux, C; Chow, E; Drossos, A; Holden, L; Hayter, C; Tsao, M; Barnes, T; Sinclair, E; Farhadian, M",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,618,24

This transcriptional start is dependent on the leader sequence of the virus strains. To study the mechanism of coronavirus transcriptional regulation, we have cloned and sequenced the region of the viral genome corresponding to the 5' unique coding region of mRNA 2 of the JHM strain of MHV. In addition to the open reading frame (ORF) predicted to encode the viral nonstructural protein p30, a second complete ORF, with the potential to encode a 439-amino-acid polypeptide, was discovered. The transcriptional initiation sites of both mRNA 2a (formerly called mRNA 2) and mRNA 2b were determined by primer extension studies and RNA sequencing. The data indicated that transcription of mRNA 2a initiated at a site, UCUAUAC, that resembled the consensus intergenic sequence. In contrast, the start signal of the optional mRNA 2b, UAAUAAAC, deviated from the consensus sequence. mRNA 2b is a functional mRNA, as shown by in vitro translation studies of mRNA and ORF 2b and by the detection of an additional viral structural protein, gp65, in the JHM strain that synthesized this mRNA. Although the A59 strain of MHV was found to retain ORF 2b, it lacked the correct transcriptional and translational start signals for this gene. This study has therefore identified an optional gene product for murine coronaviruses and provided insights into the mechanism of regulation of MHV RNA transcription.","Shieh, C K; Lee, H J; Yokomori, K; La Monica, N; Makino, S; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,618,16

All the efforts taken globally to curtail the novel COVID-19; the outbreak is still on a rise owing to the community spread pattern of this infection. COVID-19 is a zoonotic infection that, like other coronavirus infections, is believed to have been originated in bats and pangolins, and later transmitted to humans. Once in the human body, this coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is abundantly present in nasopharyngeal and salivary secretions of affected patients and its spread is predominantly thought to be respiratory droplet in nature. Dental professionals may soon encounter patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and will have to act carefully not only to provide care but at the same time prevent spread of infection. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the epidemiology, symptoms and routes of spread of the novel COVID-19 infection. In addition to this, specific recommendations for dental practice are prescribed for patient screening, infection control strategies, and patient management protocol.","Jadhav, Rajashree Dhananjay; Gachake, Arti Rajaram; Swami, Vasanthi V; Jadhav, Abhishek Dhananjay",Dental research journal,618,16

These viruses show marked species specificity in receptor utilization, as HCV-229E can utilize human but not porcine APN, while TGEV can utilize porcine but not human APN. To determine whether feline APN could serve as a receptor for two feline coronaviruses in serogroup I, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FeCV), we cloned the cDNA encoding feline APN (fAPN) by PCR from cDNA isolated from a feline cell line and stably expressed it in FIPV- and FeCV-resistant mouse and hamster cells. The predicted amino acid sequence of fAPN shows 78 and 77% identity with human and porcine APN, respectively. When inoculated with either of two biologically different strains of FIPV or with FeCV, fAPN-transfected mouse and hamster cells became infected and viral antigens developed in the cytoplasm. Infectious FIPV was released from hamster cells stably transfected with fAPN. The fAPN-transfected mouse and hamster cells were challenged with other coronaviruses in serogroup I including canine coronavirus, porcine coronavirus TGEV, and human coronavirus HCV-229E. In addition to serving as a receptor for the feline coronaviruses, fAPN also served as a functional receptor for each of these serogroup I coronaviruses as shown by development of viral antigens in the cytoplasm of infected mouse or hamster cells stably transfected with fAPN. In contrast, fAPN did not serve as a functional receptor for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59), which is in serogroup II and utilizes mouse biliary glycoprotein receptors unrelated to APN. Thus, fAPN serves as a receptor for a much broader range of group I coronaviruses than human and porcine APNs. The human, porcine, and canine coronaviruses in serogroup I that are able to use fAPN as a receptor have previously been shown to infect cats without causing disease. Therefore, host factors in addition to receptor specificity apparently affect the virulence and transmissibility of nonfeline serogroup I coronaviruses in the cat.","Tresnan, D B; Levis, R; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,618,16

SUBJECTS AND METHOD The study is based on a non-clinical sample. The ad hoc questionnaire measures people's readiness to search for, publish and distribute humorous material during lockdown. It investigates the intentions behind sending content via social media (WhatsApp or similar) and the emotions experienced on receiving such content. RESULTS The responses have been analyzed quantitatively, and using Excel's IF function they have been analyzed qualitatively. In the present sample of 106 Italian respondents, searching for content was less common than publishing it (yes 44.34%, no 54.72%). Positive emotions were more frequently the motivation (total 61.32%). A high percentage sent amusing content via social media or SMS (79%). Responses demonstrating a desire to lessen the situation's negative impact or a desire for cohesion were common. Receiving material was similarly associated with positive emotions and a sense of being close to others. CONCLUSIONS humorous material appears to have served as a means of transmitting positive emotions, distancing oneself from negative events and finding cohesion.","Amici, Patrizia",Psychiatria Danubina,618,22

P1 expressed in transgenic plants (P1 plants) can be used in trans to support replication of A1MV RNAs 2 and 3, and P2 expressed in transgenic plants (P2 plants) can be used in trans to support replication of A1MV RNAs 1 and 3. Wild-type RNA 1 was able to coreplicate with RNAs 2 and 3 in P1 plants, but this ability was abolished by frameshifts or deletions in the P1 gene of RNA 1. Similarly, wild-type RNA 2 coreplicated with RNAs 1 and 3 in P2 plants, but frameshifts or deletions in the P2 gene of RNA 2 interfered with this replication. Apparently, the P1 and P2 genes are required in cis for the accumulation of RNAs 1 and 2, respectively. Point mutations in the GDD motif of the P2 gene in RNA 2 interfered with accumulation of RNA 2 in P2 plants, indicating that replication of RNA 2 is linked to its translation into a functional protein. Plants transformed with both the P1 and P2 genes (P12 plants) accumulate replicase activity that is able to replicate RNA 3 in trans. An analysis of the time course of the accumulation of RNAs 1, 2, and 3 in protoplasts of P12 plants supported the conclusion that translation and replication are tightly coupled for A1MV RNAs 1 and 2 but not for RNA 3.","van Rossum, C M; Garcia, M L; Bol, J F",Journal of virology,618,2

We have isolated and characterized five haemagglutination-defective (HAD) mutants. In contrast to the parental virus, the mutants were unable to bind to porcine submandibulary mucin, a substrate rich in sialic acid. Each of the mutants was found to contain a single point mutation in the S protein (Cys155Phe, Met195Val, Arg196Ser, Asp208Asn or Leu209Pro), indicating that these amino acids are affecting the sialic acid binding site. In four of the HAD mutants a nearby antigenic site is affected in addition to the sialic acid binding site, as indicated by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. The parental virus was found to have an increased resistance to the detergent octylglucoside compared to the HAD mutants. This effect depended on cellular sialoglycoconjugates bound to the virion. If the binding of sialylated macromolecules was prevented by neuraminidase treatment, the parental virus was as sensitive to octylglucoside as were the HAD mutants. We discuss the possibility that the sialic acid binding activity helps TGEV to resist detergent-like substances encountered during the gastrointestinal passage and thus facilitates the infection of the intestinal epithelium. An alternative function of the sialic acid binding activity - accessory binding to intestinal tissues - is also discussed.","Krempl, C; Ballesteros, M L; Zimmer, G; Enjuanes, L; Klenk, H D; Herrler, G",The Journal of general virology,618,1

In addition, the status of Chagas disease awareness among physicians in areas with a potential risk for the disease was determined. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to analyze three triatomine species within the United States known to harbor Trypanosoma cruzi and that exhibit qualities of domesticity. An analysis of the minimum temperature threshold for increased triatomine activity delineates the current population at increased risk, and by incorporating temperature predictions for 2030, the population at risk under a future climate scenario was also delineated. Considering both environmental and social factors, a vignette-based physician survey, based on the results of the GIS analysis, was used to gauge the level of awareness of Chagas disease within the delineated higher risk range. The current area at increased risk for Chagas disease includes much of the southern United States, and the higher risk range is expected to expand into the central United States based upon the 1 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) increase in temperature predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by the year 2030. Survey results indicate a limited consideration of Chagas disease during differential diagnosis, illustrating that the low number of Chagas disease cases discovered in the United States may be attributable to a lack of disease awareness as opposed to a lack of disease threat. This study combines GIS and survey analyses to evaluate the role that temperature variability and disease awareness among physicians play in the potential emergence of Chagas disease in the United States. This approach indicates that there is a potential for Chagas disease to emerge in the United States.","Click Lambert, Rebecca; Kolivras, Korine N; Resler, Lynn M; Brewster, Carlyle C; Paulson, Sally L",Geospatial health,618,16

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Track and Trace Service has plans for a nationwide app that notifies the need for self-isolation to those in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19. To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)-the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation-related or not to COVID-19. Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. 26.1% of all CIE participants were included in the analysis (N = 12,434, 43.0% male, mean age 55.2). 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. Out of those who responded 'no', 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. In univariate analysis, worsening mood, fear and anxiety in relation to changes in government rules around lockdown were associated with lower willingness to participate. Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]; OR for 3-4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64-0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585-0.908]). In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing over an appropriate age range is 60%-close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. Difficulty comprehending government advice and uncertainty of diagnosis, based on a public health policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown, therefore reduce willingness to adopt a government contact-tracing app to a level below the threshold for effectiveness as a tool to suppress an epidemic.","Bachtiger, Patrik; Adamson, Alexander; Quint, Jennifer K; Peters, Nicholas S",NPJ Digit Med,618,1

Theoretical Perspectives: To address this gap in the field, I examine affordances from the lenses of diaspora literacy, transnational literacy, and racial literacy, which hold promise for understanding how to foreground race in the literacies of predominantly English-speaking Black immigrant youth I demonstrate how each of these lenses, as applied to the literacies of the invisible population of Black youth, allows for partial understandings regarding these students' enactment of literacies based on their Englishes and semiotic resources In turn, I illustrate how these lenses can work together to clarify the role of race in Black immigrant literacies Implications: Based on these discussions, I present the framework of Black immigrant literacies to assist researchers, practitioners, and parents who wish to better understand and support Black immigrant youth I invite researchers who work with populations that include Black immigrant youth to consider how race, when central to research and teaching surrounding the literacies and Englishes of these youth, can provide opportunities for them to thrive beyond the perceptions of them as ""academic prodigies"" while also facilitating relationships with their Black American peers I invite teachers to consider ways of viewing Black immigrant literacies that foster a sense of community between these youth and their Black American peers as well as ways of engaging their literacies in classrooms that allow them to demonstrate how they function as language architects beyond performance on literacy assessments I invite parents to provide spaces beyond school contexts where Black immigrant youth can use their literacies for social adjustment Through this essay, it is expected that the dominant population can gain further insights into the nuances that exist within the Black population and be cognizant of these nuances when engaging with Black immigrant youth","Smith, Patriann",Teachers College Record,618,16

During the 1st lockdown, practiced in most of the countries, routine dental procedures were suspended. Even after the lockdown was eased, visiting crowded dental clinics was still considered health-threatening, especially among populations at high risk of developing a severe reaction to COVID-19. Regretfully, in most cases, temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and bruxism were not included under the definition of emergency, leaving many patients without the possibility of consulting their dentists. A literature search, performed about 10 months after the declaration of the pandemic, found only a few studies dealing with TMD and bruxism during COVID-19. Most of the studies indicate adverse effects on subjects' psycho-emotional status (stress, anxiety, depression), which in turn lead to the intensification of subjects' TMD and bruxism symptoms, and increased orofacial pain. Unlike other oral pathologies, which require manual interventions, chronic orofacial pain can be addressed, at least at its initial stage, through teledentistry and/or consultation.

Thus, we conducted the current study examining the feasibility, social validity, and preliminary impacts of a virtual summer learning program. Ninety-one preschoolers and their caregivers participated in a 4-week program involving one weekly teacher-caregiver meeting, two weekly Watch Together home learning activities, two weekly Play Together home learning activities, one or two weekly Read Together home learning activities, and one or two weekly teacher-child video chat lessons. Recruitment and participation indicated high levels of interest. Caregivers reported high levels of satisfaction with the program and teachers reported moderate to high levels of child engagement during video chat lessons. Children showed significant gains on emotion knowledge, patterning, and alphabet knowledge. Practice or Policy: This study demonstrates the promise of a virtual kindergarten readiness program and suggests that the combination of educational media and video chat instruction may be effective for promoting children's skills. A virtual intervention could be beneficial in other contexts, such as in rural areas where it would be challenging for families to participate in an in-person program or for immunocompromised or seriously ill children who are unable to attend in person.

Noise in COVID-19 era operating rooms was significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 era data (73.8 vs 70.2 decibels, P = .04). Implementation of this headset strategy significantly improved communication. Respondents with headsets were less likely to encounter communication problems (31% vs 93%, P < .001). Intraoperative measures to protect surgical team members during aerosolizing surgeries may impair communication. Linking team members via a conference call is a solution to improve communication.","Levin, Marc; Zhou, Kelvin; Sommer, Ethan C; McHugh, Tobial; Sommer, Doron D",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,618,1

We aimed to examine the extent of trainees' involvement in and comfort with telemedicine practices in Canada with the use of a web-based self-administered survey. Eighty-six trainees from 12 training programs completed the survey (65% response rate). Results showed that before COVID-19, 39 trainees (45%) had telemedicine exposure, compared with 67 (78%) after COVID-19 (P < 0.001). However, only 44 trainees (51%) reported being comfortable or very comfortable with the use of telemedicine. Of the 67 trainees who were involved in telemedicine, 4 (6%) had full supervision during virtual visits, 13 (19%) had partial supervision, and 50 (75%) had minimal or no supervision. Importantly, 67 trainees (78%) expressed the need for telemedicine-specific training and 64 (74%) were willing to have their virtual visits recorded for the purpose of evaluation and feedback. Furthermore, 47 (55%) felt strongly or very strongly positive about incorporating telemedicine into their future practice. The main perceived barriers to telemedicine use were concerns about patients' engagement, fear of weakening the patient-physician relationship, and unfamiliarity with telemedicine technology. These barriers, together with training in virtual physical examination skills and medicolegal aspects of telemedicine, are addressed in several established internal medicine telemedicine curricula that could be adapted by cardiology programs. In conclusion, while the degree of telemedicine involvement since COVID-19 was high, the trainees' comfort level with telemedicine practice remains suboptimal likely due to lack of training and inadequate staff supervision. Therefore, a cardiology telemedicine curriculum is needed to ensure that trainees are equipped to embrace telemedicine in cardiovascular clinical care.","Almufleh, Aws; Lee, Christopher; Tsang, Michael Yc; Gin, Kenneth; Tsang, Teresa S M; Nair, Parvathy",Can J Cardiol,618,16

However, the cellular mechanism underlying intestinal regeneration remains unclear. Using lineage tracing, we show that cells marked by an Msi1 reporter (Msi1+) are right above Lgr5high cells in intestinal crypts and exhibit DNA damage resistance. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that the Msi1+ cells are heterogeneous with the majority being intestinal stem cells (ISCs). The DNA damage-resistant subpopulation of Msi1+ cells is characterized by low-to-negative Lgr5 expression and is more rapidly cycling than Lgr5high radiosensitive crypt base columnar stem cells (CBCs). This enables an efficient repopulation of the intestinal epithelium at early stage when Lgr5high cells are not emerging. Furthermore, relative to CBCs, Msi1+ cells preferentially produce Paneth cells during homeostasis and upon radiation repair. Together, we demonstrate that the DNA damage-resistant Msi1+ cells are cycling ISCs that maintain and regenerate the intestinal epithelium.","Sheng, Xiaole; Lin, Ziguang; Lv, Cong; Shao, Chunlei; Bi, Xueyun; Deng, Min; Xu, Jiuzhi; Guerrero-Juarez, Christian F; Li, Mengzhen; Wu, Xi; Zhao, Ran; Yang, Xu; Li, Guilin; Liu, Xiaowei; Wang, Qingyu; Nie, Qing; Cui, Wei; Gao, Shan; Zhang, Hongquan; Liu, Zhihua; Cong, Yingzi; Plikus, Maksim V; Lengner, Christopher J; Andersen, Bogi; Ren, Fazheng; Yu, Zhengquan",Cell Rep,618,1

We aimed to assess the characteristics of HA-CDI acquired during and before the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods We conducted a retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital, in which since March 2020 exclusively COVID-19 patients are hospitalized. We compared HA-CDI adult patients hospitalized in March 2020-February 2021 with those hospitalized during the same period in 2017-2018.Results We found 51 cases during 2020-2021 (COVID-19 group), incidence 5.6/1000 adult discharge and 99 cases during 2017-2018 (pre-COVID-19 group), incidence 6.1/1000 adult discharge (p=0.6). The patients in COVID-19 group compared to pre-COVID-19 group were older (median age 66 vs 62 years), with similar rate of comorbidities, but with higher rate of cardiovascular diseases (62.7% vs 42.4%) and less immunosuppression (21.6% vs 55.6%), they had a higher proton pump inhibitors use (94.1% vs 32.3%), and a longer hospitalization (median 19 vs 14 days).Eighty-five (85.9%) patients in pre-COVID-19 group versus 44 (86.3%) patients in COVID-19 group received antimicrobial treatment - mainly cephalosporins (34,1%), quinolones (22,3%) and glycopeptides (21,1%) in pre-COVID-19 group and mainly cephalosporins and macrolides (63,6% each) in COVID-19 group. We found four HA-CDI-related deaths in pre-COVID-19 group and none in the COVID-19 group.Conclusions The HA-CDI incidence in COVID-19 group did not change versus the same period of time during 2017-2018. The antibiotic use was the most important factor associated with HA-CDI. We identified a high use of broad-spectrum antibiotics despite the lack of empirical antimicrobial recommendations in COVID-19.What is important: Information on healthcare-acquired C.difficile in COVID-19 patients is limited, but not only C.difficile infection remains a worrying issue, but is also an emerging topic. We found that antibiotic use seems to be the most important factor associated with CDI and our data emphasize the need for rational use of antibiotics and for ongoing attention regarding CDI in COVID-19 patients.","Manea, Eliza; Jipa, Raluca; Milea, Alexandru; Roman, Antonia; Neagu, Georgiana; Hristea, Adriana",Rom. j. intern. med,618,27

Economics significantly shapes the way we behave and think as educators and learners and so there is increasing interest in using economic ways of thinking and approaches to examine and understand how choices are made, the influence of constraints and boundaries in educational decision making, and how costs are felt. Thus, in this article, we provide a brief historical overview of modern economics, to illustrate how the core concepts of economics-scarcity (and desirability), rationality, and optimization-developed over time. We explain the important concept of bounded rationality, which explains how individual, meso-factors and contextual factors influence decision making. We then consider the opportunities that these concepts afford for health professions education and research. We conclude by proposing that embracing economic thinking opens up new questions and new ways of approaching old questions which can add knowledge about how choice is enacted in contemporary health professions education.","Cleland, J A; Foo, J; Ilic, D; Maloney, S; You, Y",Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract,618,26

Therefore, despite the unprecedented rally to reach a vaccine that can offer widespread immunization, it is equally important to reach effective prevention and treatment regimens for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Contributing to this effort, we have curated and analyzed multi-source and multi-omics publicly available data from patients, cell lines and databases in order to fuel a multiplex computational drug repurposing approach. We devised a network-based integration of multi-omic data to prioritize the most important genes related to COVID-19 and subsequently re-rank the identified candidate drugs. Our approach resulted in a highly informed integrated drug shortlist by combining structural diversity filtering along with experts' curation and drug-target mapping on the depicted molecular pathways. In addition to the recently proposed drugs that are already generating promising results such as dexamethasone and remdesivir, our list includes inhibitors of Src tyrosine kinase (bosutinib, dasatinib, cytarabine and saracatinib), which appear to be involved in multiple COVID-19 pathophysiological mechanisms. In addition, we highlight specific immunomodulators and anti-inflammatory drugs like dactolisib and methotrexate and inhibitors of histone deacetylase like hydroquinone and vorinostat with potential beneficial effects in their mechanisms of action.

This tradeoff is unethical. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes both chickenpox and shingles. After people recover from chickenpox, VZV remains in their nerve cells. If their immune systems become unable to suppress the virus, they develop shingles. According to the Exogenous Boosting Hypothesis (EBH), a person's ability to keep VZV suppressed can be 'boosted' through exposure to active chickenpox infections. We argue that even if this hypothesis were true, immunization policies that discourage routine childhood varicella vaccination in order to prevent shingles for other people are unethical. Such policies harm children and treat them as mere means for the benefit of others, and are inconsistent with how parents should treat their children and physicians should treat their patients.

However, the accuracy of these methods for the quantitation of active virus rather than non-infectious RNA fragments that can persist for extended periods of time has been unclear. This issue is particularly relevant for congregate care patients who are unable to return to their home residence until fully negative by NAATs. We tested paired samples from individual patients for the presence of virus at both early and later stages of disease. Culture of nasopharyngeal swab samples for 10 days in Vero E6 cells revealed active virus in only 4 out of 14 (28.6%) patients. The ability to isolate viral plaque-forming units (PFU) correlated with viral RNA loads of >6.79 log genomic copies/ml and only occurred in samples collected from patients early after symptom onset and before development of antibody. Culture in Vero E6 cells lacking the STAT1-dependent interferon signaling pathway increased the numbers of viral PFU detected but did not affect the incidence of positive cultures. We conclude that culturable virus is correlated with SARS-CoV-2 NAATs detection only during early symptom onset and with high viral titers/low antibody titers in non-immunosuppressed patients.","Singh, Amit K; Stellrecht, Kathleen A; Arunachalam, Thilaka; Barman, Tarani K; Robek, Michael D; Waxman, Michael J; Elmendorf, Sarah L; Metzger, Dennis W",J Clin Virol,618,1

Advances in anaesthesia and minimally invasive surgery have led to day case treatment being adopted by some centres. The objective of this study is to describe our day case pathway and peri- and postoperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single centre, retrospective case series review of a prospectively collected database from October 2014 to August 2019 performed in a tertiary centre for upper gastrointestinal surgery. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, indications, complications, length of stay and readmission. RESULTS: A total of 362 patients underwent laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery with or without hiatus hernia repair of up to 10cm, with day case rates of 59%. Unplanned admission following day surgery was 5.1% (13/225) and 30-day readmission was 2.2% (8/362); 90.6% of patients remained in hospital for less than 24 hours. There was one intraoperative complication and one patient required revisional surgery within 30 days. The rate of all postoperative complications was 1.38% (5/362) with one postoperative mortality. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of larger hernias is unusual, as most studies limit size to 5cm or less. Our results show the safety and feasibility of the procedure even when applied to hiatus hernias up to 10cm. Success was multifactorial and based on standardisation of procedures and support from dedicated specialist nursing staff. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery can be performed safely as a day case procedure even in larger hiatus hernias, with a dedicated care pathway and specialist nurse practitioners to support it.","Mayo, D; Darbyshire, A; Mercer, S; Carter, N; Toh, S; Somers, S; Wainwright, D; Fajksova, V; Knight, B",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,618,16

The protease furin is also involved in mediating SARS-CoV-2 and other viral infections, although its association with early IFN response has not been evaluated yet. In order to assess the in vivo relationship between ACE2 and furin expression and the IFN response in nasopharyngeal cells, we first examined ACE2 and furin levels and their correlation with the well-known marker of IFNs' activation, ISG15, in children (n = 59) and adults (n = 48), during respiratory diseases not caused by SARS-CoV-2. A strong positive correlation was found between ACE2 expression, but not of furin, and ISG15 in all patients analyzed. In addition, type I and III IFN stimulation experiments were performed to examine the IFN-mediated activation of ACE2 isoforms (full-length and truncated) and furin in epithelial cell lines. Following all the IFNs treatments, only the truncated ACE2 levels, were upregulated significantly in the A549 and Calu3 cells, in particular by type I IFNs. If confirmed in vivo following IFNs' activation, the induction of the truncated ACE2 isoform only would not enhance the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract.","Scagnolari, Carolina; Bitossi, Camilla; Viscido, Agnese; Frasca, Federica; Oliveto, Giuseppe; Scordio, Mirko; Petrarca, Laura; Mancino, Enrica; Nenna, Raffaella; Riva, Elisabetta; De Vito, Corrado; Midulla, Fabio; Antonelli, Guido; Pierangeli, Alessandra",Cytokine,618,16

This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,618,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only a few studies address the potential direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on mental health. METHODS: A total of 321 maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients were selected using random sampling from the hemodialysis center of the second people's Hospital of Yibin. They completed Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, Zung's self-rating depression scale (SDS) for depression, and the activity of daily living scale (ADL) for the ability of living. Demographic data and laboratory tests were used to analyze the risk factors. RESULTS: The proportions of the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were between 34.89% and 30.02%, respectively, among the MHD patients. The SAS and SDS scores of the 321 patients were 45.42(± 10.99) and 45.23(± 11.59), respectively. The results show that monthly income, medical insurance, vascular access, the duration of dialysis, complication, hemoglobin (HGB), immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and blood phosphorus (P) are factors that influence anxiety among patients (p < 0.05 for all). Vascular access, monthly income, medical insurance, complication, CRP, Alb, are factors that influence depression among patients (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that during the pandemic period, the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among MHD patients increased. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with it. We should, therefore, pay more attention to the patients' psychology, start targeted intervention to alleviate the patients' anxiety and further improve their quality of life.","Hao, Wen; Tang, Qianrong; Huang, Xiaoqin; Ao, Lina; Wang, Jing; Xie, Deqiong",Int Urol Nephrol,618,24

We conducted the third serosurvey during Dec 2020 and Jan 2021, to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among general population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in India. METHODS: We conducted the serosurvey in the same 70 districts selected for the first and second serosurveys. From each district, we enrolled at least 400 individuals aged &#8805; 10 years from general population and 100 HCWs from sub-district level health facilities. Sera from general population were tested for presence of IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid (N) and spike protein (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, whereas sera from HCWs were tested for anti-S1-RBD. We estimated weighted seroprevalence adjusted for assay characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 28,598 sera from general population, 4585 (16%) had IgG antibodies against N, 6647 (23.2%) against S1-RBD and 7436 (26%) against either. The weighted and assay characteristic adjusted seroprevalence against either of the antibodies was 24.1 (95%CI: 23.0%-25.3%). Among 7385 HCWs, the seroprevalence of anti-S1-RBD IgG antibodies was 25.6% (95% CI: 23.5%-27.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one in four individuals aged > = 10 years from general population as well as HCWs in India were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 by December 2020.","Murhekar, Manoj V; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Thangaraj, Jeromie Wesley Vivian; Saravanakumar, V; Kumar, Muthusamy Santhosh; Selvaraju, Sriram; Rade, Kiran; Girish Kumar, C P; Sabarinathan, R; Turuk, Alka; Asthana, Smita; Balachandar, Rakesh; Bangar, Sampada Dipak; Bansal, Avi Kumar; Chopra, Vishal; Das, Dasarathi; Deb, Alok Kumar; Devi, Kangjam Rekha; Dhikav, Vikas; Dwivedi, Gaurav Raj; Muhammad Salim Khan, S; Sunil Kumar, M; Laxmaiah, Avula; Madhukar, Major; Mahapatra, Amarendra; Rangaraju, Chethana; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Yadav, Rajiv; Andhalkar, Rushikesh; Arunraj, K; Bharadwaj, Dinesh Kumar; Bharti, Pravin; Bhattacharya, Debdutta; Bhat, Jyothi; Chahal, Ashrafjit S; Chakraborty, Debjit; Chaudhury, Anshuman; Deval, Hirawati; Dhatrak, Sarang; Dayal, Rakesh; Elantamilan, D; Giridharan, Prathiksha; Haq, Inaamul; Hudda, Ramesh Kumar; Jagjeevan, Babu; Kalliath, Arshad; Kanungo, Srikanta; Krishnan, Nivethitha N; Kshatri, Jaya Singh; Kumar, Alok",Int. j. infect. dis,618,13

Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to assured national or international online resources and specific patient groups. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined. IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic. Patients established on denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide should continue planned therapy. In the event of supply issues with teriparatide or abaloparatide, pausing this treatment in the short term is likely to be relatively harmless, whereas delaying denosumab may cause an immediate increased risk of fracture.

METHODS: An online national survey of adolescents and young adults (n = 4,351) aged 13-24 years was conducted in May 2020. Multivariable logistic regression assessed relationships among COVID-19-related symptoms, testing, and diagnosis and cigarettes only, e-cigarettes only and dual use, sociodemographic factors, obesity, and complying with shelter-in-place. RESULTS: COVID-19 diagnosis was five times more likely among ever-users of e-cigarettes only (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.82-13.96), seven times more likely among ever-dual-users (95% CI: 1.98-24.55), and 6.8 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 2.40-19.55). Testing was nine times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 5.43-15.47) and 2.6 times more likely among past 30-day e-cigarette only users (95% CI: 1.33-4.87). Symptoms were 4.7 times more likely among past 30-day dual-users (95% CI: 3.07-7.16). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with youth use of e-cigarettes only and dual use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes, suggesting the need for screening and education.","Gaiha, Shivani Mathur; Cheng, Jing; Halpern-Felsher, Bonnie",J Adolesc Health,618,24

Based on this approach, we introduce a toolbox (JuSpace) allowing for cross-modal correlation of MRI-based measures with nuclear imaging derived estimates covering various neurotransmitter systems including dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and GABAergic (gamma-aminobutric acid) neurotransmission. We apply JuSpace to two datasets covering Parkinson's disease patients (PD) and risperidone-induced changes in rsfMRI and cerebral blood flow (CBF). Consistently with the predominant neurodegeneration of dopaminergic and serotonergic system in PD, we find significant spatial associations between rsfMRI activity alterations in PD and dopaminergic (D2) and serotonergic systems (5-HT1b). Risperidone induced CBF alterations were correlated with its main targets in serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. JuSpace provides a biologically meaningful framework for linking neuroimaging to underlying neurotransmitter information.","Dukart, Juergen; Holiga, Stefan; Rullmann, Michael; Lanzenberger, Rupert; Hawkins, Peter C T; Mehta, Mitul A; Hesse, Swen; Barthel, Henryk; Sabri, Osama; Jech, Robert; Eickhoff, Simon B",Hum. brain mapp,618,22

A two-phase evaluation from Hong Kong,17.151443,5.022009,2021,"CONTEXT: Advance care planning (ACP) conversations represent an important physician skill, a need further highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Most resident ACP training occurs in inpatient, settings, often featuring goals of care (GOC) conversations during a crisis. Outpatient clinics are valuable but underutilized settings to provide skills training for residents, yet little research has been done in these spaces. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 1) create an ACP curriculum harnessing the principles of a community of practice in a virtual format, and 2) obtain residents' perspectives regarding their skills and confidence in having early GOC conversations in the outpatient setting. METHODS: We interviewed 48 internal medicine residents using questionnaires, reflective narratives, and transcripts of debriefing conversations. We created a virtual curriculum during the ambulatory week which included didactics, virtual role plays, ACP phone conversations with five patients, and group debriefings. Quantitative data were analyzed for changes in resident confidence. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis, guided by instructor field notes. RESULTS: Residents reported decreased confidence in navigating advance directive conversations following training [Z=2.24, P=0.03, râ¯=â¯0.33]. Resident reflections indicated that they felt more practiced at inpatient late GOC conversation skills, and that these skills were not fully transferable to the outpatient early GOC setting. Residents also endorsed the ambulatory environment as the best space for ACP conversations. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the feasibility of a virtual format for ACP curriculum. The virtual community of practice created space for a metacognitive unmasking of prior resident unconscious incompetence. Also, inpatient, crisis-oriented late GOC conversation skills may translate poorly to the outpatient setting requiring early and ongoing GOC skills. Residents need more training to navigate ACP conversations in ambulatory environments.","Mills, Sarah; Cioletti, Anne; Gingell, Gareth; Ramani, Subha",J. pain symptom manage,618,27

All educational sectors are influenced by the robust implementation of online learning. Students all over the world are also challenged to be adaptive and be resilient with the fast changes of ways to learn. In responding to the sudden shift to online learning, most of students demonstrate tedious works to complete all online tasks and assignments set by lecturers. Consequently, students become more responsive to do the online tasks rather than obtain life-skill competence such as communicative skills. This research aims to investigate quality of online learning and online apps used in the online learning that support development of learners’ communicative competence. The data of this research are from 30 BINUS University students’ responses on the survey conducted during implementation of learning from home. The respondents are involved in English subject online classroom. The data analysis were employed qualitative approach to describe the main focus of the research. The results of data indicate the quality of online learning applied during COVID-19 breakout desired improvements in terms of content development, teaching and learning instruction, and learning evaluation system to accomodate the acquisition of communicative competence.

This disease knowledge is critical for many health-related and biomedical tasks, including consumer health question answering, medical language inference and disease name recognition. While pre-trained language models like BERT have shown success in capturing syntactic, semantic, and world knowledge from text, we find they can be further complemented by specific information like knowledge of symptoms, diagnoses, treatments, and other disease aspects. Hence, we integrate BERT with disease knowledge for improving these important tasks. Specifically, we propose a new disease knowledge infusion training procedure and evaluate it on a suite of BERT models including BERT, BioBERT, SciBERT, ClinicalBERT, BlueBERT, and ALBERT. Experiments over the three tasks show that these models can be enhanced in nearly all cases, demonstrating the viability of disease knowledge infusion. For example, accuracy of BioBERT on consumer health question answering is improved from 68.29% to 72.09%, while new SOTA results are observed in two datasets.

Thrombotic events occur in a significant number of patients with COVID-19, especially in critically ill patients. This apparent novel form of coagulopathy is termed COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and endothelial derived von Willebrand factor (vWF) may play an important role in its pathogenesis. CONTENT: vWF is a multimeric glycoprotein molecule that is involved in inflammation, primary and secondary hemostasis. Studies have shown that patients with COVID-19 have significantly elevated levels of vWF antigen and activity, likely contributing to an increased risk of thrombosis seen in CAC. The high levels of both vWF antigen and activity have been clinically correlated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, the severity of a COVID-19 infection appears to reduce molecules that regulate vWF level and activity such as ADAMT-13 and high density lipoproteins (HDL). Finally, studies have suggested that patients with blood group O (a blood group with lower than baseline levels of vWF) have a lower risk of infection and disease severity compared to other blood groups; however, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of vWF. SUMMARY: CAC is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction with the release of pro-thrombotic factors, such as vWF, needs further examination as a possible important component in the pathogenesis CAC.","Mei, Zhen W; van Wijk, Xander M R; Pham, Huy P; Marin, Maximo J",,618,16

However, extended postdischarge VTE prophylaxis and VTE prophylaxis for nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 are not routinely recommended due to uncertain benefit in these populations. SUMMARY: Here we report development of a pulmonary embolism (PE) in a young patient without other VTE risk factors who was treated for COVID-19 in an emergency department (ED) and discharged home without VTE prophylaxis, which was consistent with current recommendations. The patient presented to the ED 12 days later with complaints of chest pain for 1 day and was found to have a PE within the segmental and subsegmental branches of the left lower lobe. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that nonhospitalized patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk for VTE than patients with other medical illnesses and warrants further research into the risk of VTE in outpatients with COVID-19.","Uppuluri, Ellen M; Shapiro, Nancy L",Am J Health Syst Pharm,618,1

RESULTS: We found that impaired left-ventricular and right-ventricular function as well as tricuspid regurgitation > grade 1 were significantly associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, elevated levels of myocardial distress markers (troponin-I and NT pro-BNP) were associated with poor prognosis in this patient collective. CONCLUSION: Impaired cardiac function is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 positive patients. Consequently, treatment of these patients should include careful guideline-conform cardiovascular evaluation and treatment.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with paroxysmal or early-persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing CB ablation as the index procedure, assisted by HDM, were retrospectively included in this study. A total of 68 patients (52 males; mean age: 60 ± 12 years, 58 paroxysmal AF) were included, and a total of 272 veins were mapped. Fourth-generation cryoballoon with the new spiral mapping catheter (SMC) was used in 35 patients (51%). Time to PVI was determined in 102/132 (77%) and in 112/140 (80%) veins during second-generation cryoballoon/third-generation cryoballoon (CB2G/CB3G) and CB4G ablation, respectively (P = 0.66). There was a statistically significant difference in terms of discrepancy rate between the SMC and the mini-basket catheter in PV detection after CB4G and CB2G/CB3G ablation(1.4% vs. 7.6%; P = 0.01). A total of 57 patients (84%) remained free of symptomatic AF during a mean follow-up of 9.8 ± 4.6 months.

The initial step of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in its spike protein to ACE2 receptor in host cell membrane. The evolving of SARS-CoV-2 constantly generates new mutations across its genome including RBD. Besides the well-known single mutation in RBD, the recent new mutation strains with RBD ""double mutation"" is causing new outbreaks globally, as represented by the delta strain containing RBD L452R/T478K. Although it is considered that the increased transmissibility of the double mutated strains could be attributed to the alteration of mutated RBD to ACE2 receptor, the molecular details remains to be unclear. Using the methods of molecular dynamics simulation, superimposed structural comparison, free binding energy estimation and antibody escaping, we investigated the relationship between ACE2 receptor and the RBD double mutant L452R/T478K (delta), L452R/E484Q (kappa) and E484K/N501Y (beta, gamma). The results demonstrated that each of the three RBD double mutants altered RBD structure, led to enhanced binding affinity of mutated RBD to ACE2 receptor, leading to increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cells.","Sinha, Siddharth; Tam, Benjamin; Wang, San Ming",,618,18

Commonly, sepsis may progress to septic shock and have a high risk of complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction (SIMD), liver dysfunction, cerebral dysfunction, and skeletal muscle atrophy, predominantly contributing to high mortality. Additionally, viral sepsis may be critical for the pathogenesis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may represent as an effective therapeutic target for sepsis therapies. The role of RAS involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis has been spotlighted and some preclinical and clinical trials studies targeted at RAS for sepsis treatment have shown promising results.

The severity of COVID-19 is related, in a large measure, to the extent of pulmonary involvement. The role of chest CT imaging in the management of patients with COVID-19 has evolved since the onset of the pandemic. Specifically, the description of CT scan findings, use of chest CT imaging in various acute and subacute settings, and its usefulness in predicting chronic disease have been defined better. We performed a review of published data on CT scans in patients with COVID-19. A summary of the range of imaging findings, from typical to less common abnormalities, is provided. Familiarity with these findings may facilitate the diagnosis and management of this disease. A comparison of sensitivity and specificity of chest CT imaging with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing highlights the potential role of CT imaging in difficult-to-diagnose cases of COVID-19. The usefulness of CT imaging to assess prognosis, to guide management, and to identify acute pulmonary complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted. Beyond the acute stage, it is important for clinicians to recognize pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, progressive fibrotic lung disease, and vascular changes that may be responsible for persistent respiratory symptoms. A large collection of multi-institutional images were included to elucidate the CT scan findings described.","Machnicki, Stephen; Patel, Dhara; Singh, Anup; Talwar, Arunabh; Mina, Bushra; Oks, Margarita; Makkar, Priyanka; Naidich, David; Mehta, Atul; Hill, Nicholas; Brown, Kevin; Raoof, Suhail",Chest,618,7

For nonlive vaccines, a more favorable safety profile of biologic agents compared to conventional systemic agents is described as the humoral response to vaccines is in general well-preserved. Treatment with cyclosporine and methotrexate is associated with lower antibody titers to vaccines, and thus these agents are better discontinued during vaccination.

Yet reducing sepsis mortality by lowering circulating levels of TNF lost favour when positive endpoints in earlier simplistic models could not be reproduced in well-conducted human trials. Newer information with anti-TNF biologicals has encouraged reintroducing this concept for treating COVID-19. Viral models have had encouraging outcomes, as have the effects of anti-TNF biologicals on community-acquired COVID-19 during their long-term use to treat chronic inflammatory states. The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL-7R&#945;, the receptor for IL-7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. Lymphoid germinal centres required for antibody-based immunity can be harmed by TNF, and restored by reducing TNF. Thus the IL-7- enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti-TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection. This implies dexamethasone could prove to be synergistic with rIL-7, currently being trialed as a COVID-19 therapeutic. The principles behind these COVID-19 therapies are consistent with the observed chronic hypoxia through reduced mitochondrial function, and also the increased severity of this disease in ApoE4-positive individuals. Many of the debilitating persistent aspects of this disease are predictably susceptible to treatment with perispinal etanercept, since they have cerebral origins.","Clark, Ian A",Rev Med Virol,618,1

AREAS COVERED: We compare the first regulatory approvals for remdesivir, through emergency pathways available to three of the main regulators in the world, the U.S., Japan, and the EU. We look at the data supporting the decisions and how authorities exchanged information and collaborated to speed up approvals. Based only on topline data available as of 29 April 2020, regulators granted approvals to remdesivir based on very limited but robust data and waiting for more safety and efficacy data. This included the Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. on 1 May, the Special Approval for Emergency in Japan on 7 May, and Compassionate Use (3 April) followed by a Conditional Marketing Authorization in Europe (Opinion 25th June, Decision (3 July)). EXPERT OPINION: While the regulatory approvals were clearly based on evidence, regulators used agile methods to speed up approval, and make the first antiviral with reliable data available to patients in their constituencies in a very short time frame. More data and wider patient access are still necessary for this product, and more treatments are needed for patients affected by COVID-19.","Saint-Raymond, A; Sato, J; Kishioka, Y; Teixeira, T; Hasslboeck, C; Kweder, S L",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,618,1

Unlike the previous two coronavirus outbreaks, COVID-19 has caused several thousand deaths for respiratory and multiple organ failure. As specifically concerns this latest infectious pathology, laboratory medicine can provide a substantial contribution to diagnosing an acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through molecular testing, establishing the presence and extent of an immune response against the virus, mostly through serological testing. However, it can also help to predict the risk of unfavorable disease progression by measuring some conventional laboratory tests and, last but not least, can provide reliable therapeutic guidance. This article is hence aimed at offering recent updates on the important role and value of laboratory investigations in COVID-19, also providing information on some hot topics such as virus RNA detection in different biological samples, causes of recurrent positivity of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), potential strategies for enhancing the throughput of molecular testing (i.e., pre-test probability assessment, sample pooling, use of rapid tests), as well as pragmatic indications for enhancing the quality and value of serological testing and laboratory-based monitoring.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Henry, Brandon M; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Mattiuzzi, Camilla",Acta Biomed,618,16

Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","Harling, Guy; Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier; Tlouyamma, Joseph; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Kabudula, Chodziwadziwa Whiteson; Mahlako, Ruth; Singh, Urisha; Ohene-Kwofie, Daniel; Buckland, Rose; Ndagurwa, Pedzisai; Gareta, Dickman; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Wong, Emily B; Kahn, Kathleen; Siedner, Mark J; Maimela, Eric; Tollman, Stephen; Collinson, Mark; Herbst, Kobus",JMIR Public Health Surveill,618,17

Here, we tested whether high-dose vitamin C infusion was effective for severe COVID-19. METHODS: This randomized, controlled, clinical trial was performed at 3 hospitals in Hubei, China. Patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ICU were randomly assigned in as 1:1 ratio to either the high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) or the placebo. HDIVC group received 12 g of vitamin C/50 ml every 12 h for 7 days at a rate of 12 ml/hour, and the placebo group received bacteriostatic water for injection in the same way within 48 h of arrival to ICU. The primary outcome was invasive mechanical ventilation-free days in 28 days (IMVFD28). Secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, organ failure (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score), and inflammation progression (interleukin-6). RESULTS: Only 56 critical COVID-19 patients were ultimately recruited due to the early control of the outbreak. There was no difference in IMVFD28 between two groups (26.0 [9.0-28.0] in HDIVC vs 22.0 [8.50-28.0] in control, p = 0.57). HDIVC failed to reduce 28-day mortality (P = 0.27). During the 7-day treatment period, patients in the HDIVC group had a steady rise in the PaO2/FiO2 (day 7: 229 vs. 151 mmHg, 95% CI 33 to 122, P = 0.01), which was not observed in the control group. IL-6 in the HDIVC group was lower than that in the control group (19.42 vs. 158.00; 95% CI -301.72 to -29.79; P = 0.04) on day 7. CONCLUSION: This pilot trial showed that HDIVC failed to improve IMVFD28, but might show a potential signal of benefit in oxygenation for critically ill patients with COVID-19 improving PaO2/FiO2 even though.","Zhang, Jing; Rao, Xin; Li, Yiming; Zhu, Yuan; Liu, Fang; Guo, Guangling; Luo, Guoshi; Meng, Zhongji; De Backer, Daniel; Xiang, Hui; Peng, Zhiyong",Ann Intensive Care,618,16

As a result, laboratories have had to invest in multiple COVID-19 assays performed on different testing instruments. Comparing the results achieved by testing positive samples between in-use assays can provide insights into which platforms may be interchangeable for testing in times of supply chain emergencies. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal and nasal swab specimens collected in viral transport media that tested positive on the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay were tested on the ePlex® SARS-CoV-2 and BD SARS-CoV-2 Reagents for BD Max&#8482; assays. Positive percent agreement was calculated using the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay as the reference method. RESULTS: We tested 78 positive swabs, resulting in a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 92% [CI 84-97%] for the BD SARS-CoV-2 assay and 58% [CI 47-70%] for the ePlex® assay. Following development of a new workflow for the ePlex®, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in 7 additional samples, resulting in a new PPA of 68% [CI 56-78].

Despite this lengthy interval, implementation of specific quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 tests in the US has been slow, and testing is still not widely available. Metagenomic sequencing offers the promise of unbiased detection of emerging pathogens, without requiring prior knowledge of the identity of the responsible agent or its genomic sequence. METHODS: To evaluate metagenomic approaches in the context of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, laboratory-confirmed positive and negative samples from Seattle, WA were evaluated by metagenomic sequencing, with comparison to a 2019 reference genomic database created before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Within 36 h our results showed clear identification of a novel human Betacoronavirus, closely related to known Betacoronaviruses of bats, in laboratory-proven cases of SARS-CoV-2. A subset of samples also showed superinfection or colonization with human parainfluenza virus 3 or Moraxella species, highlighting the need to test directly for SARS-CoV-2 as opposed to ruling out an infection using a viral respiratory panel. Samples negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were also negative by metagenomic analysis, and positive for Rhinovirus A and C. Unlike targeted SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR testing, metagenomic analysis of these SARS-CoV-2 negative samples identified candidate etiological agents for the patients' respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate the value of metagenomic analysis in the monitoring and response to this and future viral pandemics.","Peddu, Vikas; Shean, Ryan C; Xie, Hong; Shrestha, Lasata; Perchetti, Garrett A; Minot, Samuel S; Roychoudhury, Pavitra; Huang, Meei-Li; Nalla, Arun; Reddy, Shriya B; Phung, Quynh; Reinhardt, Adam; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",Clin Chem,618,16

We have used a bioinformatic approach to aid in designing an epitope peptide-based vaccine against the spike protein of the virus. Five antigenic B cell epitopes with viable antigenicity and a total of 27 discontinuous B cell epitopes were mapped out structurally in the spike protein for antibody recognition. We identified eight CD8+ T cell 9-mers and 12 CD4+ T cell 14-15-mer as promising candidate epitopes putatively restricted by a large number of MHC I and II alleles, respectively. We used this information to construct an in silico chimeric peptide vaccine whose translational rate was highly expressed when cloned in pET28a (+) vector. With our In silico test, the vaccine construct was predicted to elicit high antigenicity and cell-mediated immunity when given as a homologous prime-boost, triggering of toll-like receptor 5 by the adjuvant linker. The vaccine was also characterized by an increase in IgM and IgG and an array of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. Upon in silico challenge with SARS-CoV-2, there was a decrease in antigen levels using our immune simulations.

The disruption of immune homeostasis can lead to acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, as cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic diseases and cancer. The knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of these pathological conditions is important to find effective therapies. Granzyme B (GrB) is a serine protease produced by a variety of immune, non-immune and tumor cells. Apoptotic intracellular and multiple extracellular functions of GrB have been recently identified. Its capability of cleaving extracellular matrix (ECM) components, cytokines, cell receptors and clotting proteins, revealed GrB as a potential multifunctional pro-inflammatory molecule with the capability of contributing to the pathogenesis of different inflammatory conditions, including inflammaging, acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Here we give an overview of recent data concerning GrB activity on multiple targets, potentially allowing this enzyme to regulate a wide range of crucial biological processes that play a role in the development, progression and/or severity of inflammatory diseases. We focus our attention on the promotion by GrB of perforin-dependent and perforin-independent (anoikis) apoptosis, inflammation derived by the activation of some cytokines belonging to the IL-1 cytokine family, ECM remodeling, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrosis. A greater comprehension of the pathophysiological consequences of GrB-mediated multiple activities may favor the design of new therapies aim to inhibit different inflammatory pathological conditions such as inflammaging and age-related diseases, EMT and organ fibrosis.","Velotti, Francesca; Barchetta, Ilaria; Cimini, Flavia Agata; Cavallo, Maria Gisella",Front Immunol,618,2

The identification of novel spike gene mutations appearing in minks has raised major concerns about potential immune evasion and challenges for the global vaccine strategy. One genetic variant, known as ""cluster-five"", arose among farmed minks in Denmark and resulted in a complete shutdown of the world's largest mink production. However, the functional properties of this new variant are not established. Here we present functional data on the cluster-five variant, which contains a mutation resulting in a Y453F residue change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Using an ELISA-based ACE-2/RBD inhibition assay, we show that the Y453F variant does not decrease established humoral immunity from previously infected individuals nor affect the neutralizing antibody response in a vaccine mouse model based on the original Wuhan strain RBD or spike as antigens. However, biolayer interferometry analysis demonstrates that it binds the human ACE-2 receptor with a four-fold higher affinity compared to the original strain suggesting an enhanced transmission capacity and a possible challenge for viral control. These results also indicate that the rise in frequency of the cluster-five variant in mink farms might be a result of the fitness advantage conferred by the receptor adaptation rather than evading immune responses.","Bayarri-Olmos, Rafael; Rosbjerg, Anne; Johnsen, Laust Bruun; Helgstrand, Charlotte; Bak-Thomsen, Theresa; Garred, Peter; Skjoedt, Mikkel-Ole",J Biol Chem,618,22

In fighting against COVID-19, effective diagnosis of infected patient is critical for preventing the spread of diseases. Due to limited availability of test kits, the need for auxiliary diagnostic approach has increased. Recent research has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient, such as CT and X-ray, contains salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could be used as an alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster imaging time, wide availability, low cost, and portability gains much attention and becomes very promising. In order to reduce intra- and inter-observer variability, during radiological assessment, computer-aided diagnostic tools have been used in order to supplement medical decision making and subsequent management. Computational methods with high accuracy and robustness are required for rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist in the interpretation of the collected data. METHOD: In this study, we design a novel multi-feature convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for multi-class improved classification of COVID-19 from CXR images. CXR images are enhanced using a local phase-based image enhancement method. The enhanced images, together with the original CXR data, are used as an input to our proposed CNN architecture. Using ablation studies, we show the effectiveness of the enhanced images in improving the diagnostic accuracy. We provide quantitative evaluation on two datasets and qualitative results for visual inspection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on data consisting of 8851 normal (healthy), 6045 pneumonia, and 3323 COVID-19 CXR scans. RESULTS: In Dataset-1, our model achieves 95.57% average accuracy for a three classes classification, 99% precision, recall, and F1-scores for COVID-19 cases. For Dataset-2, we have obtained 94.44% average accuracy, and 95% precision, recall, and F1-scores for detection of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed multi-feature-guided CNN achieves improved results compared to single-feature CNN proving the importance of the local phase-based CXR image enhancement. Future work will involve further evaluation of the proposed method on a larger-size COVID-19 dataset as they become available.","Qi, Xiao; Brown, Lloyd G; Foran, David J; Nosher, John; Hacihaliloglu, Ilker",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,618,20

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS: We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS: Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION: The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide. Both female and male welfare support workers are at elevated risk of suicide compared with other occupations. Further research is required to understand the drivers of the elevated risk in this group.","Maheen, Humaira; Dimov, Stefanie; Spittal, Matthew J; King, Tania L",Occup. environ. med,618,16

Onsets, peaks, and inflexion points are some of them. An onset is the moment when the epidemic starts. A ""peak"" indicates a moment at which the incorporated values, both before and after, are lower: a maximum. The inflexion points identify moments in which the rate of growth of the incorporation of new cases changes intensity. In this study, after interpreting the concept of elasticity of a random variable in an innovative way, we propose using it as a new simpler tool for anticipating epidemic remission change-points. In particular, we propose that the ""remission point of change"" will occur just at the instant when the speed in the accumulation of new cases is lower than the average speed of accumulation of cases up to that moment. This gives stability and robustness to the estimation in the event of possible remission variations. This descriptive measure, which is very easy to calculate and interpret, is revealed as informative and adequate, has the advantage of being distribution-free and can be estimated in real time, while the data is being collected. We use the 2014-2016 Western Africa Ebola virus epidemic to demonstrate this new approach.

This project aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of TeleNP in a pediatric clinical population and disseminate clinical decision-making procedures to guide best practices for pediatric TeleNP. METHOD: This project conducted during the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic reflects the largest clinical cohort to date of TeleNP in a pediatric population (N = 129). Data were gathered retrospectively from patients who were rescheduled from in-person assessment to TeleNP between March to June 2020. RESULTS: TeleNP was an accessible option for most patients and families, with no differences in demographic variables in patient appointment attendance, whether testing was conducted, and whether the patient was referred for face-to-face follow-up. Patients using laptops/desktops were more likely to undergo remote test administration in comparison with patients using phones/tablets (&#967;2 = 23.83, p < .002). Sixty-three percent of the sample were referred for a face-to-face follow-up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: TeleNP is feasible in a pediatric clinical population ranging to begin the process of differential diagnosis and treatment planning. Pediatric TeleNP may be most efficacious as a screening procedure due to limited measures suited for remote administration and behavioral challenges interfering with testing requiring in-person follow-up. TeleNP screening as standard practice for patients who do not require a full, traditional neuropsychological battery may provide a more efficient care model, with more patients able to be seen using shorter batteries with less wait time.","Ransom, Danielle M; Butt, Sakina M; DiVirgilio, Emily K; Cederberg, Charles D; Srnka, Kyle D; Hess, Colleen T; Sy, Megan C; Katzenstein, Jennifer M",Arch Clin Neuropsychol,618,5

We aimed to determine internal medicine (IM) and paediatric (PD) residents' responses and the impact on the residents following patient deaths, and to compare any differences between IM and PD residents. We also aimed to determine whether sufficient resources and measures were in place to support residents through their grief process. METHODS: This is a single-centre, cross-sectional study involving residents from IM and PD programmes from an academic tertiary hospital in Singapore. The residents completed a questionnaire regarding their responses and emotions after experiencing patient deaths. RESULTS: A total of 122 residents (85 IM and 37 PD, equally distributed between year 1 to year 4 of residency training) participated, with 100% response rate. Only half (57%) felt they would be comfortable treating a dying patient and 66.4% reported feeling sad following their patient's death. Most (79.5%) were not aware of support resources that were available and 82% agreed that formal bereavement training should be included in the residency curriculum. PD residents had more negative symptoms than IM residents, with poor concentration (PD 35.1% vs IM 16.5%, p=0.02) and lethargy (PD 35.1% vs IM 9.4%, p<0.01) being the most common.

We sought to examine colchicine's effects on circulating inflammatory and metabolic molecules in adults with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: Blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention during a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which 40 adults with obesity and MetS were randomized to colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice-daily for 3 months. Serum samples were analyzed for 1305 circulating factors using the SomaScan Platform. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) for multiple testing. RESULTS: At baseline, age (48.0 ± 13.8 vs. 44.7 ± 10.3 years) and BMI (39.8 ± 6.4 vs. 41.8 ± 8.2 kg/m2) were not different between groups. After controlling for the FDR, 34 molecules were significantly changed by colchicine. Colchicine decreased concentrations of multiple inflammatory molecules, including C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and resistin, in addition to vascular-related proteins (e.g., oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, phosphodiesterase 5A). Conversely, relative to placebo, colchicine significantly increased concentrations of eight molecules including secreted factors associated with metabolism and anti-thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with obesity, colchicine significantly affected concentrations of proteins involved in the innate immune system, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, uncovering new mechanisms behind its cardiometabolic effects. Further research is warranted to investigate whether colchicine's IL-6 suppressive effects may be beneficial in COVID-19.","Demidowich, Andrew P; Levine, Jordan A; Apps, Richard; Cheung, Foo K; Chen, Jinguo; Fantoni, Giovanna; Patel, Tushar P; Yanovski, Jack A",Int J Obes (Lond),618,33

Some of the studies on aspects of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and innate immunity have produced seemingly contradictory claims. In this situation, a comprehensive comparative analysis of a large number of related datasets from several studies could bring more clarity, which is imperative for therapy development. Methods: We therefore performed a comprehensive comparative study, analyzing RNA-Seq data of infections with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, including data from different types of cells as well as COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we investigated viral entry routes and innate immune responses. Results and Conclusion: First, our analyses support the existence of cell entry mechanisms for SARS and SARS-CoV-2 other than the ACE2 route with evidence of inefficient infection of cells without expression of ACE2; expression of TMPRSS2/TPMRSS4 is unnecessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection with evidence of efficient infection of A549 cells transduced with a vector expressing human ACE2. Second, we find that innate immune responses in terms of interferons and interferon simulated genes are strong in relevant cells, for example Calu3 cells, but vary markedly with cell type, virus dose, and virus type.","Cao, Yingying; Xu, Xintian; Kitanovski, Simo; Song, Lina; Wang, Jun; Hao, Pei; Hoffmann, Daniel",Front Immunol,618,16

METHODS AND RESULTS: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and medRxiv for publications before July 13, 2020. Cohort studies and case-control studies that contain information on the association of antihypertensive agents including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), ß-blockers, and diuretics with the risk and severity of COVID-19 were selected. The random or fixed-effects models were used to pool the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the outcomes. The literature search yielded 53 studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria, which comprised 39 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies. These studies included a total of 2,100,587 participants. We observed no association between prior usage of antihypertensive medications including ACEIs/ARBs, CCBs, ß-blockers, or diuretics and the risk and severity of COVID-19. Additionally, when only hypertensive patients were included, the severity and mortality were lower with prior usage of ACEIs/ARBs (overall OR of 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-0.99, p < 0.05 and overall OR of 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.91, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, usage of antihypertensive drugs is not associated with the risk and severity of COVID-19. Based on the current available literature, it is not recommended to abstain from the usage of these drugs in COVID-19 patients.

Building a health-care cost model, this study aimed to estimate the total costs of COVID-19. Information on risk of hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and risk of ventilation were based on published data. Average cost per patient and in total were calculated based on risks of admission to ICU, risk of invasive mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay when hospitalized and published costs associated with hospitalization. The total direct costs of secondary care during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe were estimated at EUR 13.9 billon, whereof 76% accounted for treating people with overweight and obesity. The average cost per hospital admission increased with BMI, from EUR 15831 for BMI <25 kg/m2 to EUR 30982 for BMI &#8805;40 kg/m2 .

METHODS: The study was carried out in the form of an observational cross-sectional type using a questionnaire sent by mail to a cohort of patients affected by AA during the pandemic from March 2020 to October 2020. RESULTS: During the pandemic, AA relapse was reported in 42.5% of the participants who also declared COVID-19 infection, confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab or hematological analysis. The relapse was reported about 2 months later COVID-19 infection (median of 2.14 months) and 74.0% of these participants continue to experience AA symptoms when the survey was proposed.

While general guidance has been issued for the responsible conduct of research in these challenging circumstances, the contours of the dueling COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS pandemics raise some critical ethical issues for HIV prevention research. In this paper, we use the recently updated HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) Ethics Guidance Document (EGD) to situate and analyze key ethical challenges related to the conduct of HIV prevention research during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as identify potential areas for refinement of the guidance document based on this unprecedented state of affairs. MAIN BODY: Necessary actions taken for HIV prevention research studies due to the COVID-19 pandemic involve an array of ethical issues including those related to: (1) risk mitigation; (2) behavior change; (3) compounding vulnerability; (4) community engagement; (5) trial reopening; and 6) shifting research priorities. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the dueling HIV and COVID-19 global pandemics, research teams and sponsors must be nimble in responding to the rapidly changing environment by being sensitive to the associated ethical issues. The HTPN EGD provides a rich set of tools to help identify, analyze and address many of these issues. At the same time, future refinements of the HPTN EGD and other research ethics guidance could be strengthened by providing explicit advice regarding the ethical issues associated with disrupted research and the reopening of studies. In addition, additional consideration should be given to appropriately balancing domains of risk (e.g., physical versus social), addressing the vulnerability of research staff and community partners, and responding to un-anticipatable ancillary care needs of participants and communities. Appropriately addressing these issues will necessitate conceptual work, which would benefit from the careful documentation of the actual ethical issues encountered in research, the strategies implemented to overcome them, and their success in doing so. Throughout all of these efforts, it is critical to remember that the HIV pandemic not be forgotten in the rush to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rennie, Stuart; Chege, Wairimu; Schrumpf, Leah A; Luna, Florencia; Klitzman, Robert; Moseki, Ernest; Brown, Brandon; Wakefield, Steven; Sugarman, Jeremy",BMC Med Ethics,618,16

Herein we tested the effects of an indoor exercise, Qigong, on neurocognitive functioning as well as its potential neuro-immune pathway. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week randomized active-controlled trial with two study arms in cognitively healthy older people. We applied Wu Xing Ping Heng Gong (Qigong), which was designed by an experienced Daoist Qigong master, to the experimental group, whereas we applied the physical stretching exercise to the control group. The Qigong exercise consisted of a range of movements involving the stretching of arms and legs, the turning of the torso, and relaxing, which would follow the fundamental principles of Daoism and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., Qi). We measured aging-sensitive neurocognitive abilities, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and brain structural volumes in the experimental (Qigong, n = 22) and control groups (stretching, n = 26) before and after the 12-week training. RESULTS: We observed that Qigong caused significant improvement in processing speed (t (46) = 2.03, p = 0.048) and sustained attention (t (46) = -2.34, p = 0.023), increased hippocampal volume (t (41) = 3.94, p < 0.001), and reduced peripheral IL-6 levels (t (46) = -3.17, p = 0.003). Moreover, following Qigong training, greater reduction of peripheral IL-6 levels was associated with a greater increase of processing speed performance (bootstrapping CI: [0.16, 3.30]) and a more significant training-induced effect of hippocampal volume on the improvement in sustained attention (bootstrapping CI: [-0.35, -0.004]). CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings offer significant insight into the mechanistic role of peripheral IL-6-and its intricate interplay with neural processes-in the beneficial neurocognitive effects of Qigong. The findings have profound implications for early identification and intervention of older individuals vulnerable to cognitive decline, focusing on the neuro-immune pathway. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04641429).","Qi, Di; Wong, Nichol M L; Shao, Robin; Man, Idy S C; Wong, Clive H Y; Yuen, Lai Ping; Chan, Chetwyn C H; Lee, Tatia M C",Brain behav. immun,618,9

METHODS: In this retrospective cross-sectional study, 2988 (82%) of 3620 healthcare workers in a university hospital participated. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antibody was investigated using serum from healthcare workers who underwent COVID-19 antibody testing. The antibody test results of the participants were evaluated based on their work campus, their profession and their workplace. The statistical significance level was p < 0.05 in all analyses. RESULTS: Of the participants in this study, 108 (3.6%) were antibody positive, and 2880 (96.4%) were negative. Antibody positivity rates were greater in nurses compared with other healthcare workers (p < 0.001). Regarding workplace, antibody positivity was greater in those working in intensive care compared to those working in other locations (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at the highest risk of being infected with COVID-19. Those who have a higher risk of infection among healthcare workers and those working in high-risk areas should be vaccinated early and use personal protective equipment during the pandemic.

Methods: This study included 1,087 COVID-19 patients confirmed by laboratory tests in many hospitals in Sichuan Province and Hubei Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. The patients were divided into a drinking group and a nondrinking group. For better baseline feature comparability between the two groups. we used propensity score matching (PSM) to generate a new cohort with a ratio of 1 : 2 (drinking group, n = 167;nondrinking group, n = 334) to compare the clinical symptoms, complications, complications, ICU admission and in-hospital death between the drinking group and the nondrinking group and to analyze the factors affecting ICU admission and the prognosis of in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. Results: The incidence of wheezing symptoms in the nondrinking group was higher than that in the drinking group (11.2% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.044) after PSM (12.3% vs. 6.6%, P = 0.032), and them was no difference in the incidence of other symptoms between the two groups. The incidence of stroke was lower in the drinking group than in the nondrinking group (0.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.025) after PSM (0.0% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.025). The multivariate analysis showed that drinking was not associated with ICU admission (OR = 1.240, 95% CI 0.322-4.772, P = 0.755) or in-hospital mortality outcomes (OR = 2.582, 95% CI 0.689-9.670, P = 0.159). Conclusions: Drinking is not associated with patient ICU admission or hospital mortality. However, COVID-19 patients who drink alcohol have fewer wheezing symptoms and fewer stroke complications.","Lv, L.; Zhou, Y. W.; Yao, R.",Signa Vitae,618,23

However, the design of the RPN involves the selection of the number, scale, and aspect ratios of anchor boxes, which will affect the applicability and convenience of the model. Furthermore, these anchor boxes require complicated calculations, such as calculating their intersection-over-union (IoU) with ground truth bounding boxes.Due to the problems related to anchor boxes, we propose a simple yet effective anchor-free tracker (named Siamese corner networks, SiamCorners), which is end-to-end trained offline on large-scale image pairs. Specifically, we introduce a modified corner pooling layer to convert the bounding box estimate of the target into a pair of corner predictions (the bottom-right and the top-left corners). By tracking a target as a pair of corners, we avoid the need to design the anchor boxes. This will make the entire tracking algorithm more flexible and simple than anchorbased trackers. In our network design, we further introduce a layer-wise feature aggregation strategy that enables the corner pooling module to predict multiple corners for a tracking target in deep networks. We then introduce a new penalty term that is used to select an optimal tracking box in these candidate corners. Finally, SiamCorners achieves experimental results that are comparable to the state-of-art tracker while maintaining a high running speed. In particular, SiamCorners achieves a 53.7% AUC on NFS30 and a 61.4% AUC on UAV123, while still running at 42 frames per second (FPS).","Yang, Kai; He, Zhenyu; Pei, Wenjie; Zhou, Zikun; Li, Xin; Yuan, Di; Zhang, Haijun",,618,16

We found that obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are positively associated with the three outcomes in a synergistic manner. The municipal poverty level is also positively associated with hospitalization and death. CONCLUSIONS: Mexico's response to COVID-19 is complicated by a synergistic double challenge: raging NCDs and extreme social inequity.

The impetus for the development of digital ITDR becomes more prominent considering the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, compared with dispute resolution mechanisms in many other domains, the ITDR process particularly lends itself to digital facilitation. However, data from peer review reports under Action 14 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project shows that the international practice of the digital ITDR still remains at a rudimentary stage. This underdevelopment can largely be attributed to a decentralized approach to the ITDR development at the international level. In this regard, it is proposed that the OECD can play a greater role in leading and coordinating the development of digital ITDR at the global level.

High-quality data on management of these patients are scarce, and further investigation will provide valuable information in the context of the pandemic. A group of experts identify a set of pragmatic recommendations for the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and shock in resource-limited environments. We define shock as life-threatening circulatory failure that results in inadequate tissue perfusion and cellular dysoxia/hypoxia, and suggest that it can be operationalized via clinical observations. We suggest a thorough evaluation for other potential causes of shock and suggest against indiscriminate testing for coinfections. We suggest the use of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) as a simple bedside prognostic score for COVID-19 patients and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) to evaluate the etiology of shock. Regarding fluid therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with shock in low-middle–income countries, we favor balanced crystalloids and recommend using a conservative fluid strategy for resuscitation. Where available and not prohibited by cost, we recommend using norepinephrine, given its safety profile. We favor avoiding the routine use of central venous or arterial catheters, where availability and costs are strong considerations. We also recommend using low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory shock. In addressing targets of resuscitation, we recommend the use of simple bedside parameters such as capillary refill time and suggest that POCUS be used to assess the need for further fluid resuscitation, if available","Brotherton, B.

We tested the Elisée 350 (ResMedBella Vista, Australia) ventilator paired with two Newlife Intensity 10 (Airsep, Ball Ground, Georgia) OCs and evaluated the delivered FiO2 across a range of minute volumes and combinations of ventilator settings. METHODS: The ventilators were attached to a test lung, OC flow was adjusted with a Certifier FA ventilator test systems from 2 to 10 L/min and injected into the oxygen inlet port of the Elisée 350. The FiO2 was measured by the analyzer integrated in the ventilator, controlled by the ventilator test system. Several combinations of ventilator settings were evaluated to determine the factors affecting the delivered FiO2. RESULTS: The Elisée 350 ventilator is a turbine ventilator able to deliver high FiO2 when functioning with two OCs. However, modifications of the ventilator settings such as an increase in minute ventilation affect delivered FiO2 even if oxygen flow is constant on the OC. CONCLUSION: The ability of two OCs to deliver high FiO2 when used with a turbine ventilator makes this method of oxygen delivery a viable alternative to cylinders to ventilate patients requiring an FiO2 of &#8805;80% in austere place or during disaster response.

Under the current extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which social distancing is key to limiting the spread of the virus, the model used to provide care to transplant recipients has undergone a very rapid transformation. In the spirit of medical distancing, we have been using the donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) test for screening for rejection. METHODS: This article describes our experience with this approach between March 15th and May 20th, 2020. RESULTS: This test was obtained for-cause in 23 patients and for monitoring in 9 patients. Normal results aided in forgoing biopsy in 63% of the patients for whom the test was obtained in the outpatient setting. The test is neither 100% sensitive nor specific for rejection; however, when used in combination with the available clinical information, it can be used for determining whether bringing in a transplant recipient into a medical facility is necessary. CONCLUSIONS: In the event COVID-19 becomes a long-term challenge for our community, noninvasive biomarkers such as the dd-cfDNA may become more relevant than ever in enhancing our ability to care for our transplant patients while maximizing the distancing measures.","Garg, Neetika; Hidalgo, Luis G; Aziz, Fahad; Parajuli, Sandesh; Mohamed, Maha; Mandelbrot, Didier A; Djamali, Arjang",Transplant Proc,618,16

How to best restrict travel, however, is unclear. Most studies and policies simply constrain the distance r individuals may travel from their home or neighbourhood. However, the epidemic risk is related not only to distance travelled, but also to frequency of contacts, which is proxied by the frequency f with which individuals revisit locations over a given reference period. Inspired by recent literature that uncovers a clear universality pattern on how r and f interact in routine human mobility, this paper addresses the following question: does this universal relation between r and f carry over to epidemic spreading, so that the risk associated with human movement can be modeled by a single, unifying variable r * f? To answer this question, we use two large-scale datasets of individual human mobility to simulate disease spread. Results show that a universal relation between r and f indeed exists in the context of epidemic spread: in both of the datasets, the final size and the spatial distribution of the infected population depends on the product r * f more directly than on the individual values of r and f. The important implication here is that restricting r (where you can go), but not f (how frequently), could be unproductive: high frequency trips to nearby locations can be as dangerous for disease spread as low frequency trips to distant locations. This counter-intuitive discovery could explain the modest effectiveness of distance-based travel restrictions and could inform future policies on COVID-19 and other epidemics.","Heine, Cate; O'Keeffe, Kevin P.; Santi, Paolo; Yan, Li; Ratti, Carlo",,618,1

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

However, since mid-April 2020, clusters of pediatric cases of severe systemic hyperinflammation and shock epidemiologically linked with COVID-19 have been reported. This condition was named as SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and showed similarities to Kawasaki disease. Here, we present a narrative review of cases reported in literature and we discuss the clinical acute and follow-up management of these patients. Patients with SARS-Cov-2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome frequently presented with persistent fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, polymorphic rash, conjunctivitis, and mucosal changes. Elevated inflammatory markers and evidence of cytokine storm were frequently observed. A subset of these patients also presented with hypotension and shock (20-100%) from either acute myocardial dysfunction or systemic hyperinflammation/vasodilation. Coronary artery dilation or aneurysms have been described in 6-24%, and arrhythmias in 7-60%. Cardiac support, immunomodulation, and anticoagulation are the key aspects for the management of the acute phase. Long-term structured follow-up of these patients is required due to the unclear prognosis and risk of progression of cardiac manifestations.Conclusion: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a novel syndrome related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence is still scarce but rapidly emerging in the literature. Cardiac manifestations are frequent, including myocardial and coronary involvement, and need to be carefully identified and monitored over time.

Attempts were made to reduce footfall within all institutions and within the study unit;this led to alterations in fracture clinic provision. An alternative method was developed whereby most of the initial contacts were in person and much of the follow-up was done remotely. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient satisfaction and views on this alteration in service. Methods The first 299 patients who had fracture clinic appointments delivered by telephone consultation at this institution during the pandemic in early 2020 were retrospectively identified and sent a postal survey. Satisfaction levels were assessed through a degree of agreement with statements (nine items), yes/no answers (four questions), and space for comments. Results One hundred and thirty-one survey responses were included (44% response rate). The majority of patients (82%) were satisfied overall with the care they received. Although 78% of patients stated that they preferred a telephone consultation to attend a face-to-face hospital appointment during the pandemic, only 22% stated they would have preferred this in normal (pre-COVID-19) times. Interestingly 62% of patients stated they would be happy for further fracture clinic appointments to be carried out in the same way. Discussion Most of the remote consultations were in follow-up rather than new patients. Patients were adaptable to this alternative method of care delivery. There could be a role for its integration into the options for fracture clinic delivery in the future.","Graham, S.; Lostis, E.; Pearce, O.; Kelly, M.",Cureus,618,16

This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the effects of medical face masks on performance and cardiorespiratory parameters in athletes. METHODS: In a randomized, cross-over design, 16 well-trained athletes (age 27 ± 7 years, peak oxygen consumption 56.2 ± 5.6 ml kg-1 min-1, maximum performance 5.1 ± 0.5 Watt kg-1) underwent three stepwise incremental exercise tests to exhaustion without mask (NM), with surgical mask (SM) and FFP2 mask (FFP2). Cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses were monitored by spiroergometry and blood lactate (BLa) testing throughout the tests. RESULTS: There was a large effect of masks on performance with a significant reduction of maximum performance with SM (355 ± 41 Watt) and FFP2 (364 ± 43 Watt) compared to NM (377 ± 40 Watt), respectively (p < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.50). A large interaction effect with a reduction of both oxygen consumption (p < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.34) and minute ventilation (p < 0.001; Î·p2 = 0.39) was observed. At the termination of the test with SM 11 of 16 subjects reported acute dyspnea from the suction of the wet and deformed mask. No difference in performance was observed at the individual anaerobic threshold (p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: Both SM and to a lesser extent FFP2 were associated with reduced maximum performance, minute ventilation, and oxygen consumption. For strenuous anaerobic exercise, an FFP2 mask may be preferred over an SM.","Egger, Florian; Blumenauer, Dominic; Fischer, Patrick; Venhorst, Andreas; Kulenthiran, Saarraaken; Bewarder, Yvonne; Zimmer, Angela; Böhm, Michael; Meyer, Tim; Mahfoud, Felix",Clin. res. cardiol,618,22

METHODS: FFRCT-analysis was performed from standard acquired coronary CTA data sets. The per-patient minimum distal FFRCT-value (d-FFRCT) in coronary vessels (diameter â©¾1.8 mm) was registered. The threshold for categorizing FFRCT-analysis as abnormal was a d-FFRCT â©½0.75. Total plaque volume and volumes of calcified plaque, non-calcified plaque, and low-density non-calcified plaque (LD-NCP) were assessed by quantitative plaque analysis. RESULTS: Overall, 76 patients; age, mean (SD): 56 (11) years; males, n (%): 49(65), were studied. A total of 57% of patients had plaques. The d-FFRCT was â©½0.75 in 12 (16%) patients. The d-FFRCT, median (IQR), was 0.84 (0.79-0.87). Median (range) d-FFRCT in patients with d-FFRCT â©½0.75 was 0.70 (0.6-0.74). Patients with d-FFRCTâ©½0.75 versus d-FFRCT >0.75 had numerically higher plaque volumes for all plaques components, although only significant for the LD-NCP component. CONCLUSION: Every sixth asymptomatic patient with a new diagnosis of T2DM has hemodynamic significant CAD as evaluated by FFRCT. Flow impairment by FFRCT was associated with coronary plaque characteristics.","Mrgan, Monija; Nørgaard, Bjarne Linde; Dey, Damini; Gram, Jørgen; Olsen, Michael Hecht; Gram, Jeppe; Sand, Niels Peter Rønnow",Diab Vasc Dis Res,618,16

In order to rapidly share learning to inform future practice, we undertook a thematic review of ED operational experience within England during the pandemic thus far. METHODS: A rapid phenomenological approach using semistructured telephone interviews with ED clinical leads from across England was undertaken between 16 and 22 April 2020. Participants were recruited through purposeful sampling with sample size determined by data saturation. Departments from a wide range of geographic distribution and COVID-19 experience were included. Themes were identified and included if they met one of three criteria: demonstrating a consistency of experience between EDs, demonstrating a conflict of approach between emergency departments or encapsulating a unique solution to a common barrier. RESULTS: Seven clinical leads from type 1 EDs were interviewed. Thematic redundancy was achieved by the sixth interview, and one further interview was performed to confirm. Themes emerged in five categories: departmental reconfiguration, clinical pathways, governance and communication, workforce and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: This paper summarises learning and innovation from a cross-section of EDs during the first UK wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Common themes centred around the importance of flexibility when reacting to an ever-changing clinical challenge, clear leadership and robust methods of communication. Additionally, experience in managing winter pressures helped inform operational decisions, and ED staff demonstrated incredible resilience in demanding working conditions. Subsequent surges of COVID-19 infections may occur within a more challenging context with no guarantee that there will be an associated reduction in A&E attendance or cessation of elective activity. Future operational planning must therefore take this into consideration.","Walton, Henry; Navaratnam, Annakan Victor; Ormond, Martyn; Gandhi, Vanita; Mann, Clifford",Emerg Med J,618,17

Identifying high mortality risk individuals infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through a prediction instrument that uses simple clinical and analytical parameters at admission can help clinicians to focus on treatment efforts in this group of patients. METHODS: Data was obtained retrospectively from the electronic medical record of all COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the Albacete University Hospital Complex until July 2020. Patients were split into two: a generating and a validating cohort. Clinical, demographical and laboratory variables were included. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to select variables associated with in-hospital mortality in the generating cohort. A numerical and subsequently a categorical score according to mortality were constructed (A: mortality from 0% to 5%; B: from 5% to 15%; C: from 15% to 30%; D: from 30% to 50%; E: greater than 50%). These scores were validated with the validation cohort. RESULTS: Variables independently related to mortality during hospitalization were age, diabetes mellitus, confusion, SaFiO2, heart rate and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at admission. The numerical score defined ranges from 0 to 13 points. Scores included are: age &#8805;71 years (3 points), diabetes mellitus (1 point), confusion (2 points), onco-hematologic disease (1 point), SaFiO2 &#8804; 419 (3 points), heart rate &#8805; 100 bpm (1 point) and LDH &#8805; 390 IU/L (2 points). The area under the curve (AUC) for the numerical and categorical scores from the generating cohort were 0.8625 and 0.848, respectively. In the validating cohort, AUCs were 0.8505 for the numerical score and 0.8313 for the categorical score. CONCLUSIONS: Data analysis found a correlation between clinical admission parameters and in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients.

As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, hospitals rapidly adapted prone positioning for acutely ill patients into a new process: awake self-prone positioning. Could a large health care system safely and rapidly implement awake self-prone positioning in COVID-19 units to prevent respiratory failure from progressing among a surge of inpatients? REVIEW OF EVIDENCE: The team extensively reviewed the literature. Using evidence from 22 case reports, peer-reviewed standards, and studies, they developed an awake self-prone positioning guideline. IMPLEMENTATION: The guideline was implemented in April 2020 in critical care and COVID-19 units. Multimodal education included a concise guideline and real-time support from intensive care unit nurses, clinical nurse specialists, and nursing professional development specialists. EVALUATION: Awake self-prone positioning was a new procedure, and relevant data were obtained from the electronic medical record. From March 18 to August 5, 2020, 1000 COVID-19-related admissions occurred; 272 patients had a high-flow nasal cannula, 111 (41%) of whom had documentation of awake self-prone positioning. SUSTAINABILITY: This guideline is now an established part of COVID-19 care and has been integrated into practice in units caring for patients with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Nurses adapted quickly to using awake self-prone positioning as a plan of care for hypoxic patients. This practice may help hospitals adjust care delivery for these patients and effectively maintain patients in non-intensive care units. (Critical Care Nurse.

Digital research tools, such as online platforms, mobile apps, and text messaging, have the potential to address barriers to research by facilitating remote participation. However, there has been limited research on leveraging these technologies to engage people with psychosis and their families in research. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the uptake of digital tools to engage patients with provisional psychosis and their families in research and their preferences for different research administration methods. METHODS: This study used Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)-a secure web-based platform with built-in tools for data collection and storage-to send web-based consent forms and surveys on service engagement via text message or email to patients and families referred to early psychosis intervention services; potential participants were also approached or reminded about the study in person. We calculated completion rates and timing using remote and in-person methods and compensation preferences. RESULTS: A total of 447 patients with provisional psychosis and 187 of their family members agreed to receive the web-based consent form, and approximately half of the patients (216/447, 48.3%) and family members (109/187, 58.3%) consented to participate in the survey. Most patients (182/229, 79.5%) and family members (75/116, 64.7%) who completed the consent form did so remotely, with more family members (41/116, 35.3%) than patients (47/229, 20.5%) completing it in person. Of those who consented, 77.3% (167/216) of patients and 72.5% (79/109) of family members completed the survey, and most did the survey remotely. Almost all patients (418/462, 90.5%) and family members (174/190, 91.6%) requested to receive the consent form and survey by email, and only 4.1% (19/462) and 3.2% (6/190), respectively, preferred text message.

Along with small size vanadium complexes a vanadium-containing derivative of the peptide-like inhibitor N3 (N-[(5-methylisoxazol-3-yl)carbonyl]alanyl-l-valyl-N1-((1R,2Z)-4-(benzyloxy)-4-oxo-1-{[(3R)-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl] methyl }but-2-enyl)-l-leucinamide) was designed from the crystal structure with PDB entry code 6LU7. On theoretical grounds our consensus docking studies evaluated the binding affinities at the hitherto known binding site of Mpro for binding vanadium complexes. The site is an evolutionarily fold unit which is structurally conserved among proteins belonging to the same enzyme class (EC 3). The highly conserved sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 protease Mpro has a Cys-His dyad at the catalytic site that are characteristic of metal-dependent or metal-inhibited hydrolases. Therefore, Mpro was superimposed to the human protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (hPTP1B) which is a key regulator at an early stage in the signalling cascade of the insulin hormone for glucose uptake into cells. Comparatively, the vanadium-ligand binding site of hPTP1B is located in a larger groove on the surface of Mpro. Vanadium constitutes a well-known phosphate analogue. Hence, its study offers possibilities to design promising vanadium-containing binders to SARS-CoV-2. Given the favourable physicochemical properties of vanadium nuclei, such organic vanadium complexes could become drugs not only for pharmacotherapy but also diagnostic tools for early infection detection in patients. This work presents the in silico design of a potential lead vanadium compound. It was tested along with 20 other vanadium-containing complexes from the literature in a virtual screening test by docking against the inhibition of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.","Scior, Thomas; Abdallah, Hassan H; Fatimah Zaharah Mustafa, Siti; Antonio Guevara-García, José; Rehder, Dieter",Inorganica Chim Acta,618,1

This prospective randomized study analyzed the clinical records of 124 children with Rachs-1 left to right lesions subjected to cardiac surgery. They comprised 64 patients in RAP group and 60 patients in the conventional priming group. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data of the studied patients were reported. The outcome measures included hematocrit value, blood gases, lung mechanics parameters, transfusion needs, ICU stay, postoperative complications and mortality. Preoperatively, there were no significant differences between the studied groups regarding the demographic data, underlying lesions, laboratory data, blood gases and pulmonary mechanics parameters. Intraoperatively, RAP group patients had significantly lower amount of blood loss, less frequent need to packed RBCs transfusion and better hematocrit values when compared with the control group. Postoperatively, RAP group patients had significantly higher Hct % at ICU arrival, significantly better pulmonary mechanics parameters and significantly shorter duration on mechanical ventilation. Retrograde autologous priming in children older than 12 months subjected to cardiac surgery for Rachs-1 left to right lesions is associated with less transfusion needs and better pulmonary mechanics.","Singab, Hamdy; Gamal, Mohamed A; Refaey, Reda; Al-Taher, Waleed",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,618,15

This article reviews inactivation data of coronaviruses on surfaces and in liquids from published studies and develops secondary models to predict coronaviruses inactivation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A total of 102 D-values (time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for SARS-CoV-2, were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global dataset of D-values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera.Importance: The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential to investigate the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. Having a calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.","Guillier, Laurent; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Chaix, Estelle; Thébault, Anne; Pavio, Nicole; Le Poder, Sophie; Batéjat, Christophe; Biot, Fabrice; Koch, Lionel; Schaffner, Don; Sanaa, Moez",,618,16

METHODS: We retrospectively matched (1:2) critical COVID-19 patients with one or more MDR GNB from any clinical specimen (cases), with those with no MDR GNB isolates (controls). RESULTS: Seventy-eight cases were identified (4.5 per 1000 intensive care unit (ICU) days, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.6-5.7). Of 98 MDR GNB isolates, the most frequent species were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (24, 24.5%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (23, 23.5%). Two (8.7%) K. pneumoniae, and six (85.7%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were carbapenem resistant. A total of 24 (24.5%) isolates were not considered to be associated with active infection. Those with active infection received appropriate antimicrobial agents within a median of one day. The case group had significantly longer median central venous line days, mechanical ventilation days, and hospital length of stay (P<0.001 for each). All-cause mortality at 28 days was not significantly different between the two groups (P=0.19). Mechanical ventilation days (adjusted odds ratio 1.062, 95% CI 1.012-1.114; P=0.015), but not receipt of corticosteroids or tocilizumab, was independently associated with the isolation of MDR GNB. There was no association between MDR GNB and 28-day all-cause mortality (adjusted odds ratio 2.426, 95% CI 0.833-7.069; P= 0.104). CONCLUSION: In critically ill COVID-19 patients, prevention of MDR GNB colonization and infections requires minimizing the use of invasive devices, and to remove them as soon as their presence is no longer necessary.","Baiou, A; Elbuzidi, A A; Bakdach, D; Zaqout, A; Alarbi, K M; Bintaher, A A; Ali, M M B; Elarabi, A M; Ali, G A M; Daghfal, J; Almaslamani, M A; Ibrahim, A S S; Alkhal, A; Omrani, A S",J Hosp Infect,618,9

Given the significance of occupational-exposure-related infections and deaths, this study aims to assess the roles and tasks of occupational physicians (OPs) in countering the spread of the infection. Indeed, despite the OP's centrality in risk management in the workplace, its activity in the current epidemic context has rarely been mentioned. Materials and Methods: Three different databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase) were questioned using the main keywords ""COVID-19"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" that were crossed, according to different needs, with the terms ""occupational medicine"", ""occupational physician"", ""workplace"", and ""risk assessment"" using, when possible, the MeSH database research. Additionally, a systematic research of the regulatory changes of workplaces health surveillance was performed on reference sites of international, European, and Italian authorities. Results: Fundamental tasks and duties of OPs in the current COVID-19 outbreak are highlighted by examining their clinical activity and technical action. A risk assessment and management workflow is proposed, and medico-legal implications in case of infection at work are also discussed in the light of recent regulatory changes that clearly attribute to OPs an important role in safeguarding public health. Conclusion: The proposed approach can provide new instruments to contrast the spread of the infection as part of a comprehensive system response to the current pandemic, for which OPs are called to assume full responsibility.","Spagnolo, Lorenzo; Vimercati, Luigi; Caputi, Antonio; Benevento, Marcello; De Maria, Luigi; Ferorelli, Davide; Solarino, Biagio",Medicina (Kaunas),618,16

Objective: We aim to explore the clinical and immunological features of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among COVID-19 patients. Design and Methods: In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 306 hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients (including 129 diabetic and 177 non-diabetic patients) were analyzed. The serum concentrations of laboratory parameters including cytokines and numbers of immune cells were measured and compared between diabetic and non-diabetic groups. Results: Compared with non-diabetic group, diabetic cases more frequently had lymphopenia and hyperglycemia, with higher levels of urea nitrogen, myoglobin, D-dimer and ferritin. Diabetic cases indicated the obviously elevated mortality and the higher levels of cytokines IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;, as well as the distinctly reduced Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios compared with non-diabetic cases. The longitudinal assays showed that compared to that at week 1, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly elevated at week 2 after admission in non-survivors of diabetic cases, whereas there were greatly reductions from week 1 to week 2 in survivors of diabetic cases. Compared with survival diabetic patients, non-survival diabetic cases displayed distinct higher serum concentrations of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, and lower Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios at week 2. Samples from a subset of participants were evaluated by flow cytometry for the immune cells. The counts of peripheral total T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells were markedly lower in diabetic cases than in non-diabetic cases. The non-survivors showed the markedly declined counts of CD8+ T cells and NK cells than survivors. Conclusion: The elevated cytokines, imbalance of Th1/Th2 cytokines ratios and reduced of peripheral numbers of CD8+ T cells and NK cells might contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of high mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","Han, Meifang; Ma, Ke; Wang, Xiaojing; Yan, Weiming; Wang, Hongwu; You, Jie; Wang, Qiuxia; Chen, Huilong; Guo, Wei; Chen, Tao; Ning, Qin; Luo, Xiaoping",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),618,16

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we included all consecutive patients who presented to the ER between March 13 and 23 for suspected COVID-19 and underwent CT and RT-PCR within 3 days. Using a structured report, radiologists prospectively classified CTs in highly suggestive, suggestive, and non-suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Ground-glass, consolidation, and visual extension of parenchymal changes were collected. Three different RT-PCR-based reference standard definitions were used. Oxygen saturation level, CRP, LDH, and blood cell counts were collected and compared between CT/RT-PCR classes. RESULTS: The study included 696 patients (41.4% women; age 59 ± 15.8 years): 423/454 (93%) patients with highly suggestive CT, 97/127 (76%) with suggestive CT, and 31/115 (27%) with non-suggestive CT had positive RT-PCR. CT sensitivity ranged from 73 to 77% and from 90 to 94% for high and low positivity threshold, respectively. Specificity ranged from 79 to 84% for high positivity threshold and was about 58% for low positivity threshold. PPV remained &#8805; 90% in all cases. Ground-glass was more frequent in patients with positive RT-PCR in all CT classes. Blood tests were significantly associated with RT-PCR and CT classes. Leukocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets decreased, CRP and LDH increased from non-suggestive to suggestive CT classes. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak peak (in a high-prevalence setting), CT presented high PPV and may be considered a good reference to recognize COVID-19 patients while waiting for RT-PCR confirmation. KEY POINTS: â¢ During the epidemic peak, CT showed high positive predictive value and sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia when compared with RT-PCR. â¢ Blood tests were significantly associated with RT-PCR and CT classes.","Besutti, Giulia; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo; Iotti, Valentina; Spaggiari, Lucia; Bonacini, Riccardo; Nitrosi, Andrea; Ottone, Marta; Bonelli, Efrem; Fasano, Tommaso; Canovi, Simone; Colla, Rossana; Massari, Marco; Lattuada, Ivana Maria; Trabucco, Laura; Pattacini, Pierpaolo",Eur Radiol,618,4

Emergency nurses constitute the first line of treatment in healthcare facilities when catastrophic events bring disaster victims in need of medical attention. Therefore, these nurses must be well educated and trained efficiently to be able to deal with disastrous situations properly. This study aimed to distinguish the most important elements of education and training for preparing emergency nurses to face disasters in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), specifically, the city of Taif. Methods: This study employed a tool to measure nurses’ most important training and education needs that was created by the authors based on a literature review and was approved by an expert panel in disaster nursing. Questionnaires were distributed to emergency nurses in four hospitals run by the Ministry of Health in Taif city. Survey responses were received from 210 participants, and the data were analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA). A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the differences between groups according to their experiences. Results: The following three factors were extracted from the data after redundant items were loaded and excluded: incident management systems (IMSs), disaster triage, and disaster drills. Nurses with less than three years of experience have a significant need to learn about these elements in order to be able to cope with disasters. Conclusion: Understanding different types of disasters and how to deal with these catastrophic events is crucial. Significant differences existed between ED nurses in their understanding of the basic elements of disaster management based on their level of experience in an ED. Therefore, disaster education must be included in nursing curricula, and more training courses, mock drills, and simulations must be conducted in hospitals for nurses, especially nurses with less experience, so they can learn to manage their responsibilities during disasters.","Brinjee, Duaa Abdulellah Al Thobaity Almalki Mohammed Alahmari Waleed",Risk Management and Healthcare Policy,618,1

The first known Italian SARS-CoV-2 positive case was reported on 21 February. In some countries, cases of suspected ""COVID-19-like pneumonia"" had been reported earlier than those officially accepted by health authorities. This has led many investigators to check preserved biological or environmental samples to see whether the virus was detectable on dates prior to those officially stated. With regard to Italy, the results of a microbiological screening in sewage samples collected between the end of February and the beginning of April 2020 from wastewaters in Milan (Northern Italy) and Rome (Central Italy) showed presence of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we evaluated, by means of a standardized diagnostic method, the SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence amongst patients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) in an academic hospital located in Central Italy during the period of 1 November 2019-1 March 2020. Overall, the number of emergency room (ER) visits during the investigated period was 13,843. Of these, 1208 had an influenza-like syndrome, but only 166 matched the definition of SARI as stated in the study protocol. A total of 52 SARI cases were laboratory confirmed as influenza: 26 as a type B virus, 25 as a type A, and 1 as both viruses. Although about 17% of the total sample had laboratory or radiological data compatible with COVID-19, all the nasopharyngeal swabs stored underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and tested negative. Based on our result, it is confirmed that the COVID-19 pandemic spread did not start prior to the ""official"" onset in central Italy. Routine monitoring of SARI causative agents at the local level is critical for reporting epidemiologic and etiologic trends that may differ from one country to another and also among different influenza seasons. This has a practical impact on prevention and control strategies.","Capalbo, Carlo; Bertamino, Enrico; Zerbetto, Alessandro; Santino, Iolanda; Petrucca, Andrea; Mancini, Rita; Bonfini, Rita; Alfonsi, Valeria; Ferracuti, Stefano; Marchetti, Paolo; Simmaco, Maurizio; Orsi, Giovanni Battista; Napoli, Christian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,13

Depending on the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, the NLRP3 inflammasome can play a crucial role during innate immunity activation. To date, studies describing the NLRP3 response during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients are lacking. We prospectively monitored caspase-1 activation levels in peripheral myeloid cells from healthy donors and patients with mild to critical COVID-19. The caspase-1 activation potential in response to NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation was opposed between nonclassical monocytes and CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. Unexpectedly, the CD66b+CD16dim granulocytes had decreased nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential associated with an increased percentage of NLRP3 inflammasome impaired immature neutrophils and a loss of eosinophils in the blood. In patients who recovered from COVID-19, nigericin-triggered caspase-1 activation potential in CD66b+CD16dim cells was restored and the proportion of immature neutrophils was similar to control. Here, we reveal that NLRP3 inflammasome activation potential differs among myeloid cells and could be used as a biomarker of a COVID-19 patient's evolution. This assay could be a useful tool to predict patient outcome.

To this end we assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among retired blood donors and combined it with national COVID-19 survey data to provide reliable population-based IFR estimates for this age group. METHODS: We identified 60,926 retired blood donors age 70 years or older in the rosters of three region-wide Danish blood banks and invited them to fill in a questionnaire on COVID-19 related symptoms and behaviours. Among 24,861 (40.8%) responders, we invited a random sample of 3,200 individuals for blood testing. Overall, 1,201 (37.5%) individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Wantai) and compared to 1,110 active blood donors age 17-69 years. Seroprevalence 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for assay sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: Among retired (age 70 years or older) and active (age 17-69 years) blood donors, adjusted seroprevalences were 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3%-2.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3%-3.8%), respectively. Using available population data on COVID-19 related fatalities, IFRs for patients age 70 years or older and for 17-69 years were estimated at 5.4% (95% CI: 2.7%-6.4%) and 0.083% (95% CI: 0.054%-0.18%), respectively. Only 52.4% of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive retired blood donors reported having been sick since the start of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IFR in the age group above 69 years is estimated to be 65 times as high as the IFR for people age 18-69 years.","Pedersen, Ole Birger; Nissen, Janna; Dinh, Khoa Manh; Schwinn, Michael; Kaspersen, Kathrine Agergård; Boldsen, Jens Kjærgaard; Didriksen, Maria; Dowsett, Joseph; Sørensen, Erik; Thørner, Lise Wegner; Larsen, Margit Anita Hørup; Grum-Schwensen, Birgitte; Sækmose, Susanne; Paulsen, Isabella Worlewenut; Frisk, Nanna Lond Skov; Brodersen, Thorsten; Vestergaard, Lasse Skafte; Rostgaard, Klaus; Mølbak, Kåre; Skov, Robert Leo; Erikstrup, Christian; Ullum, Henrik; Hjalgrim, Henrik",Clin. infect. dis,618,33

However, manual quantitative analysis by radiologists is a time-consuming task, while qualitative evaluation may be fast but highly subjective. This study aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods to quantify disease severity and predict COVID-19 patient outcome. METHODS: We develop an AI-based framework that employs deep neural networks to efficiently segment lung lobes and pulmonary opacities. The volume ratio of pulmonary opacities inside each lung lobe gives the severity scores of the lobes, which are then used to predict ICU admission and mortality with three different machine learning methods. The developed methods were evaluated on datasets from two hospitals (site A: Firoozgar Hospital, Iran, 105 patients; site B: Massachusetts General Hospital, USA, 88 patients). RESULTS: AI-based severity scores are strongly associated with those evaluated by radiologists (Spearman's rank correlation 0.837, [Formula: see text]). Using AI-based scores produced significantly higher ([Formula: see text]) area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. The developed AI method achieved the best performance of AUC = 0.813 (95% CI [0.729, 0.886]) in predicting ICU admission and AUC = 0.741 (95% CI [0.640, 0.837]) in mortality estimation on the two datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate severity scores can be obtained using the developed AI methods over chest CT images. The computed severity scores achieved better performance than radiologists in predicting COVID-19 patient outcome by consistently quantifying image features. Such developed techniques of severity assessment may be extended to other lung diseases beyond the current pandemic.","Fang, Xi; Kruger, Uwe; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Chao, Hanqing; Zhang, Jiajin; Digumarthy, Subba R; Arru, Chiara D; Kalra, Mannudeep K; Yan, Pingkun",Int. j. comput. assist. radiol. surg.

Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection nor any approved drug for the treatment. The development of a new drug is time-consuming and cannot be relied on as a solution in combatting the immediate global challenge. In such a situation, the drug repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of COVID-19 treatment by existing drugs, which are approved for other indications. Here, we review the potential use of rapamycin, an mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) inhibitor that can be repurposed at low dosages for the treatment of COVID-19. Rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis, delays aging, reduces obesity in animal models, and inhibits activities or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6 and, IL-10. Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication. Therefore, by drug repurposing, low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential treatment of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Husain, Amjad; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Chem Biol Interact,618,1

The demand for on-demand ride services, such as taxis and ridehailing has been specifically impacted, given both restrictions in service operations and user's concerns about virus transmission in shared vehicles. During the pandemic, demand for these modes have decreased by as much as 80%. This study examines intentions to use on-demand ride services in a period of drastic changes in lifestyles and daily routines coupled with unprecedented mobility reductions. Specifically, we examine the determinants for the shift of intentions to use these on-demand modes of travel in the early stages of the pandemic. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to 700 respondents from contiguous United States, ordinal regression modeling is applied to analyze the shift in consideration. The results indicate that political orientation and health-related experiences during the pandemic are significant sources of variation for individual changes in intentions to use ridehailing. Additionally, characteristics such as age and income result in consideration shifts that contradict the typical ridership profiles found in the ridehailing literature. Specifically, on-demand ride consideration decreases as a function of age and income. Moreover, transit-users are more willing to consider on-demand rides than private vehicle users, suggesting that shared vehicle modes have a similar risk-profile. We discuss the role of on-demand ride services in the pandemic era, and the need to investigate political orientation and evolving pandemic experiences to pinpoint their role in future mobility systems.","Said, Maher; Soria, Jason; Stathopoulos, Amanda",,618,26

Virus-infected cells secrete various lipid-bound vesicles, including endosome pathway-derived exosomes and microvesicles/microparticles that are released from the plasma membrane. They are released via a direct outward budding and fission of plasma membrane blebs into the extracellular space to either facilitate virus propagation or regulate the immune responses. Moreover, EVs generated by virus-infected cells can incorporate virulence factors including viral protein and viral genetic material, and thus can resemble noninfectious viruses. Interactions of EVs with recipient cells have been shown to activate signaling pathways that may contribute to a sustained cellular response towards viral infections. EVs, by utilizing a complex set of cargos, can play a regulatory role in viral infection, both by facilitating and suppressing the infection.

Due to increasing COVID-19 cases, there is a dearth of testing kits. Therefore, there is a severe need for an automatic recognition system as a solution to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. This work offers a decision support system based on the X-ray image to diagnose the presence of the COVID-19 virus. A deep learning-based computer-aided decision support system will be capable to differentiate between COVID-19 and pneumonia. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients through chest radiography (or chest X-ray, CXR) images. However, due to the usage of CNN, there are some limitations with these decision support systems. These systems suffer with the problem of view-invariance and loss of information due to down-sampling. In this paper, the capsule network (CapsNet)-based system named visual geometry group capsule network (VGG-CapsNet) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is proposed. Due to the usage of capsule network (CapsNet), the authors have succeeded in removing the drawbacks found in the CNN-based decision support system for the detection of COVID-19. Through simulation results, it is found that VGG-CapsNet has performed better than the CNN-CapsNet model for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed VGG-CapsNet-based system has shown 97% accuracy for COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 classification, and 92% accuracy for COVID-19 versus normal versus viral pneumonia classification.

Germany is currently facing the so-called third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is exacerbated by emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutants with increased virus transmission and severe courses of disease. Rising numbers of SARS-CoV­2 infections translate into an increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care, which interacts with limited structural and personnel resources for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Therefore, prioritization and triage for critically ill patients with allocation of intensive care capacities becomes necessary, as with all situations with higher strain on capacities. Both strategies are meaningful forms of organization and are not to be equated with a collapse of medical care. Cardiovascular comorbidities and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are of particular importance for disease severity and the clinical course. In addition to the medical care of patients with SARS-CoV­2 infections due to the pandemic, other patients with acute sometimes life-threatening diseases must also continue to receive high-quality treatment. This article provides a current overview of proposed restructuring measures in German hospitals as well as the accompanying triage and prioritization algorithms.

Nurses involved in the care of infected (COVID-19) patients, may feel more discomfort physically and experience greater psychological morbidities. Aims and Objectives: The main aim of the study is to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and stress among nurses in a designated COVID-19 hospital and variables that influence these psychological problems. Methodology: Nurses working in the designated tertiary care hospital were invited to participate in an online cross-sectional survey (dated, September 5-15, 2020). A self-administered questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experiences, perceived threat regarding COVID-19, and two scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Perceived Stress Scale-10) for the assessment of anxiety and stress was applied to nurses. Chi-square test and multiple regression analysis were used to investigate the predictors (risk and protective) of psychological morbidities in nurses. Results: On analysis of 209 participants, it was revealed that 65 (31.1%) participants have anxiety symptoms and 35.40% have moderate to the high level of stress. Being proud of working in this profession was the only protective factor from such psychological morbidities. The identified risk factors for greater anxiety symptoms and moderate-to-high-level stress were, working experience of &gt;10 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36), direct involvement in the care of suspected/diagnosed patients (OR = 3.4), feeling worried about being quarantined/isolated (OR = 1.69,) and high risk of being infected at the job (OR = 2.3 for anxiety and OR = 2.1 for moderate-to-high stress).

N-player linear quadratic differential game theory is used to describe the system under study. N-player differential game theory can not be used directly in actual scenerie, since the robot cannot know humans' control objectives in advance. In order to let the robot know humans' control objectives, the paper presents an online estimation method to identify unknown humans' control objectives based on the recursive least squares algorithm. The Nash equilibrium solution of human-robot-human interaction is obtained by solving the coupled Riccati equation. Adaptive optimal control can be achieved during the human-robot-human physical interaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by rigorous theoretical analysis and simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed controller can achieve adaptive optimal control during the interaction between the robot and two humans. Compared with the LQR controller, the proposed controller has more superior performance.","Zou, Rui; Liu, Yubin; Zhao, Jie; Cai, Hegao",,618,1

METHODS: The study population included 60 noncritically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 16 March and 11 May 2020. Electrographic changes, evaluated from ECGs acquired at admission and at 7 days after starting COVID-19 therapy, were analysed. We also compared 45 patients without CV involvement with 15 patients with new onset of cardiac adverse events during hospitalization. RESULTS: ECGs under treatment showed a lower heart rate (HR) (69.45â±â8.06 vs 80.1â±â25.1 beats/min, Pâ=â0,001) and a longer QRS (102.46â±â15.08 vs 96.75â±â17.14, Pâ=â0.000) and QT corrected (QTc) interval (452.15â±â37.55 vs 419.9â±â33.41, Pâ=â0,000) duration than ECGs before therapy.

Clinicians require an understanding of this phenomenon and various risk stratification approaches for recognizing these subjects. METHODS: We examined all Covid-19 patients sent initially to a ward who subsequently required care in the ICU. We examined the timing transfer and attempted to develop a risk score based on baseline variables to predict progressive disease. We evaluated the utility of the CURB-65 score at identifying the need for ICU transfer. RESULTS: The cohort included 245 subjects (mean age 59.0 ± 14.2 years, 61.2% male) and 20% were eventually sent to the ICU. The median time to transfer was 2.5 days. Approximately 1/3rd of patients were not moved until day 4 or later and the main reason for transfer (79.2%) was worsening respiratory failure. A baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of &#8804;0.8 103/ml and a serum ferritin &#8805;1000 ng/ml were independently associated with ICU transfer. Co-morbid illnesses did not correlate with eventual ICU care. Neither a risk score based on a low ALC and/or high ferritin nor the CURB-65 score performed well at predicting need for transfer. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 patients admitted to general wards face a significant risk for deterioration necessitating ICU admission and respiratory failure can occur late in this disease. Neither baseline clinical factors nor the CURB-65 score perform well as screening tests to categorize these subjects as likely to progress to ICU care.","Hashmi, Muhammad Daniyal; Alnababteh, Muhtadi; Vedantam, Karthik; Alunikummannil, Jojo; Oweis, Emil S; Shorr, Andrew F",Respir Med,618,16

We hypothesize a consequence of COVID-19 is reduced operative volume across the country. We aim to examine changes in volume of common gastrointestinal operations during COVID-19, including elective, urgent/emergent, and cancer operations. We also evaluate if hospitals with more COVID-19 admissions were most impacted. METHODS: The Vizient database was used to determine monthly operative volume from November 2019 to June 2020 for elective operations (hiatal hernia repairs, bariatric surgery), urgent operations (cholecystectomies, appendectomies, inguinal hernia repairs), and cancer operations (colectomies, gastrectomies, esophagectomies). COVID-19 admissions per hospital were also determined. November 2019-January 2020 was defined as ""pre-COVID."" The monthly reduction in volume from pre-COVID was calculated for each operation. The top quartile (25%) of hospitals with the most COVID admissions were also evaluated separately from hospitals with fewer COVID cases. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance. RESULTS: Data from 559 hospitals were analyzed. The volumes of all operations evaluated were significantly reduced during the pandemic except gastrectomies and esophagectomies for cancer. The greatest reduction in all operations was in April. In April, the volume of bariatric surgery reduced by 98% (P < 0.001), hiatal hernia repairs by 96% (P < 0.001), urgent cholecystectomies by 42% (P < 0.001), urgent inguinal hernia repairs by 40% (P < 0.001), urgent appendectomies by 24% (P < 0.001), and colectomies for cancer by 39% (P < 0.001). Hospitals with the most COVID-19 admissions had greater reductions in all operations than hospitals with fewer COVID cases. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus pandemic led to a significant reduction in volume of all gastrointestinal operations evaluated except gastrectomies and esophagectomies. While elective, non-cancer operations were most affected, urgent and some cancer operations also declined significantly. As COVID-19 continues to surge, Americans may suffer continued limited access to surgical care and a significant operative backlog may be forthcoming.","Purdy, Amanda C; Smith, Brian R; Hohmann, Samuel F; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surg. endosc,618,29

This poses a serious challenge to clinical diagnosis, laboratory testing, and infection control programs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion Respiratory Assays (RA) compared to the GenMark ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) and to assess the ability of the Panther Fusion to perform parallel testing of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses from a single sample. STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was carried out using 375 clinical nasopharyngeal specimens. Assay performance was assessed by overall, positive, and negative percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Overall agreement between the Fusion RA and ePlex RPP was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), positive percent agreement was 97.2 % (95 % CI 93.0-99.2), negative percent agreement was 97.3 % (95 % CI 96.3-98.0), and the kappa coefficient was 0.85 (95 % CI 0.81-0.89). Forty additional viruses in 30 specimens were detected by Fusion that were not detected by ePlex. The maximum specimen throughput for parallel testing of the Fusion Respiratory Assays with SARS-CoV-2 was 275 samples in 20.7 h for Fusion SARS-CoV-2 and 350 samples in 20.0 h for Aptima Transcription Mediated Amplification SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Fusion RA demonstrated substantial agreement compared to the ePlex RPP. However, the Fusion detected respiratory viruses not identified by ePlex, consistent with higher clinical sensitivity. Workflows for parallel testing of respiratory pathogens and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate that the Panther Fusion instrument provides a flexible, moderate to high throughput testing option for pandemic and seasonal respiratory viruses.","Stevens, Bryan A; Hogan, Catherine A; Mfuh, Kenji O; Khan, Ghazala; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Garamani, Natasha; Zehnder, James; Kurzer, Jason; Pinsky, Benjamin A",J Clin Virol,618,16

Scientific communities across the globe responded rapidly and have been working relentlessly to develop drugs and vaccines, which may require considerable time. In this uncertainty, repurposing the existing antiviral drugs could be the best strategy to speed up the discovery of effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, drug repurposing may leave some vital information on druggable targets that could be capitalized in target-based drug discovery. Information on possible drug targets and the progress on therapeutic and vaccine development also needs to be updated. In this review, we revisited the druggable targets that may hold promise in the development of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent.

To identify maternal and neonatal risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy and to describe outcome a matched case–control study was done. Materials and methods: In this study, COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive women who delivered from May 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020, were included. Cases were classified according to their severity and investigations. Controls were selected from COVID-19 negative women in a 1:1 ratio who delivered in the study period. Data were collected, analyzed in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. Results: Of the total 181 COVID-19 cases delivered during the study period, there were 97.23% mild, 2.76% moderate, and 0.55% severe cases. A total of 178 (98.34%) were diagnosed in the third trimester. More COVID-19 cases were from urban areas. Mean gestational age in the mild category was 38.1 weeks and the moderate/severe category was 37.5 weeks. Around 154 (85.08%) were asymptomatic. Cases had more medical and pregnancy morbidity than controls, which was statistically significant. About 52.49% of cases and 33% of controls had cesarean. Length of hospital stay was more in cases. Mean birth weight was 2.7 ± 0.59 kg in cases and 2.5 ± 0.56 kg in control. There were 7 stillbirths in each group.

Such skills are achieved through supervised examination of patients often supported by simulator-based learning. The emergence of COVID-19 has disrupted and continues to hinder hands-on on-site medical training on a global scale. Project description: An effective virtual auscultation course was established in times of contact restrictions due to COVID-19 at the Medical Faculty of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. The interactive case-based webinar was designed to improve listening techniques, description and interpretation of auscultation findings in an off-site context. Clinical cases with pre-recorded auscultation sounds and additional case-based diagnostics were presented. The course focused on common heart murmurs including aortic and mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation as well as congenital heart defects (ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus). Results: The course was well received by the students and assessed as being useful and instructive. Assessment of learning effects, such as detection of pathological findings before and after training, is ongoing as part of a subsequent trial. Conclusion: Virtual interactive learning using a sound simulation lesson with clinical case presentations via video chat can well be used as a supplement to practical auscultation training. This learning format could also play a useful role in the curriculum of medical studies once contact restrictions are revoked.","Rüllmann, Nils; Lee, Unaa; Klein, Kathrin; Malzkorn, Bastian; Mayatepek, Ertan; Schneider, Matthias; Döing, Carsten",GMS J Med Educ,618,8

In the study we analysed the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We carried out real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We used Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two specimens. RESULTS: This study showed a lower cycle threshold (CT ) mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (mean 27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (mean 28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) specimen although the difference is statistically non-significant (p>0.05). Bland-Altman analysis produced relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these two clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and S gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples.

However, it is uncertain whether institutions can dictate such policies based on infection rates found in the general population. Therefore, the main aims of the study were to determine (1) what proportion of preoperative patients tested positive, (2) what percentage was asymptomatic, and (3) whether variations throughout time in numbers of positive patients reflected changes observed in our state.Methods: All COVID-19 preoperative screening tests (nasopharyngeal-swab RT-PCR testing) performed in our hospital between 04/13/2020 and 08/27/2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The unit of analysis was number of patients who tested negative/positive. Medical records of positive patients were reviewed to determine the presence of COVID-19 symptoms. A curve was created showing our number of positive patients per week and another one presenting the number of positive patients per day in Florida, both figures were compared.Results: A total of 7,213 patients from all specialties were preoperatively tested, out of which 85 were positive for an overall infection rate of 1.2%. In 18% (15/85) of positive patients, it was not possible to determine symptomatology. Among remaining patients, 49% (34/70) were asymptomatic while 51% (36/70) were symptomatic for COVID-19. Peak of positive cases occurred in mid-July in both curves, and the upward and downward tendencies in positive numbers mirrored each other.Conclusion: COVID-19 infection rate among our preoperative patients was very low. Nearly 50% of positive patients were asymptomatic.

SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus causante de COVID-19, es un agente patógeno de origen zoonótico. El objetivo de este artículo es destacar la importancia de estar alerta ante las zoonosis, con especial referencia a COVID-19. Primero, se describe de forma general la cronología de la pandemia de COVID-19, luego se describen en detalle las características de los coronavirus, profundizando en aquellas propias de SARS- CoV-2. Posteriormente, se destaca el concepto de Salud Única como un enfoque apropiado para enfrentar esta zoonosis y otras relacionadas. Además, se destaca la importancia de identificar inequívocamente al reservorio y al intermediario de SARS-CoV-2 como parte del conocimiento necesario para desarrollar tratamientos y una vacuna para COVID-19 y enfermedades relacionadas. Se concluye que es importante que el enfoque de Salud Única sea conocido, difundido e integrado por todos los centros de salud y los profesionales sanitarios ya que, ante la gravedad de zoonosis como COVID-19, no debemos olvidar que la salud humana está vinculada con la salud animal, y estas dos, con la salud ambiental.

For this reason, the understanding of sociodemographic variables in the context of physical activity levels are important for the field of public health in order to assist in relevant public health decisions. Our main aim was to characterize sociodemographic variables and physical activity levels and their association with COVID-19 aspects. We applied an online Google survey with closed questions in Brazilian people of different age and regions, both sexes and physical activity levels (n = 1.726). Our main results were that participants who had symptoms of COVID-19 had the highest percentage of level 1 of physical activity (the lowest level according to the classification used) and those who showed no symptoms had the highest percentage of levels 2 and 3 of physical activity; that is, close to the light/moderate levels of physical activity. This cross-sectional study in the Brazilian population provided important sociodemographic data and COVID-19 aspects regarding the level of physical activity. It is possible to assume that the regular practice of physical activity could positively impact health status and quality of life and be a tool in the field of public health to cope (from a physical and mental point of view) with disease scenarios that require quarantine.","Vancini, Rodrigo L; Camargo-Neto, Luiz; de Lira, Claudio A B; Andrade, Marília S; Viana, Ricardo B; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T; Knechtle, Beat; Gentil, Paulo; Piacezzi, Luiz H V; Lopes, Maria C B Teixeira; Batista, Ruth E Assayag; Vancini-Campanharo, Cássia R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,5

Administrators are currently faced with decisions about whether to open during the pandemic and what modifications of their normal operations might be necessary to protect students, faculty and staff. There is little information, however, on what measures are likely to be most effective and whether existing interventions could contain the spread of an outbreak on campus. We develop a full-scale stochastic agent-based model to determine whether in-person instruction could safely continue during the pandemic and evaluate the necessity of various interventions. Simulation results indicate that large scale randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are important components of a successful strategy for containing campus outbreaks. High test specificity is critical for keeping the size of the quarantine population manageable. Moving the largest classes online is also crucial for controlling both the size of outbreaks and the number of students in quarantine. Increased residential exposure can significantly impact the size of an outbreak, but it is likely more important to control non-residential social exposure among students. Finally, necessarily high quarantine rates even in controlled outbreaks imply significant absenteeism, indicating a need to plan for remote instruction of quarantined students.","Gressman, Philip T.; Peck, Jennifer R.",,618,16

There were no marked changes in mean levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, or loneliness between 2019 and 2020, or over the course of the Spring 2020 term. Students in both the 2019 and 2020 cohort who indicated psychosocial vulnerability at the initial assessment showed worse psychosocial functioning throughout the entire Spring term relative to other students. However, rates of distress increased faster in 2020 than in 2019 for these individuals. Across individuals, homogeneity of variance tests and multi-level models revealed significant heterogeneity, suggesting the need to examine not just means but the variations in individuals' experiences. Thematic analysis of interviews characterizes these varied experiences, describing the contexts for students' challenges and strategies. This analysis highlights the interweaving of psychosocial and academic distress: Challenges such as isolation from peers, lack of interactivity with instructors, and difficulty adjusting to family needs had both an emotional and academic toll. Strategies for adjusting to this new context included initiating remote study and hangout sessions with peers, as well as self-learning. In these and other strategies, students used technologies in different ways and for different purposes than they had previously. Supporting qualitative insight about adaptive responses were quantitative findings that students who used more problem-focused forms of coping reported fewer mental health symptoms over the course of the pandemic, even though they perceived their stress as more severe. These findings underline the need for interventions oriented towards problem-focused coping and suggest opportunities for peer role modeling.","Morris, Margaret E; Kuehn, Kevin S; Brown, Jennifer; Nurius, Paula S; Zhang, Han; Sefidgar, Yasaman S; Xu, Xuhai; Riskin, Eve A; Dey, Anind K; Consolvo, Sunny; Mankoff, Jennifer C",PLoS One,618,20

Targeting sedentary behavior is a simple strategy that may help counter physical and mental health concerns associated with COVID-19-related social restrictions. Of course, traditional strategies such as achieving optimal exercise and physical activity levels are also important and should be recommended. However, even under normal circumstances, the difficulty in promoting lasting exercise habits at multiple levels (e.g. individual, environment, policy) are well documented, and chances of maintaining or improving these factors is now even lower. Thus, relative to other lifestyle behaviors - sedentary behavior may be more amenable to change. Moreover, reducing sedentary behavior may be less susceptible to influence from factors associated with health disparities such as age, race, and socio-economic status compared to exercise or physical activity.

Patient contacts were limited to a minimum. Visitors were either not allowed for a certain period or limited for the rest of the time. The hospital staff began to wear masks and gloves continuously. Clinical examinations and routine wound controls were also performed under intensified hygiene standards. These circumstances result in a limitation of direct physical interactions between the nursing staff, the physicians and the patients. We analyzed to what extent the intensification of hygiene measures affects the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) after neurosurgical procedures. The rate of SSI during the 6-month interval after the beginning of COVID-19 measures was compared with the SSI rate before. The numbers of the period before COVID-19 were analyzed as mean values resulting from the analysis of two separate time periods each consisting of 6 months. The spectrum of surgical procedures was compared. Patient-related risk factors for SSIs were noted. Microorganisms were analyzed. We focused on SSIs occurring at a maximum of 60 days after the primary surgery. Overall, in the two respective 6-month periods before COVID-19, a mean of 1379 patients was surgically treated in our institution. After the beginning of COVID-19 (starting from 04/2020) our surgical numbers dropped by 101, resulting in a total number of 1278 patients being operated after 03/2020 until 09/2020. The SSI rate was 3.6% (03/2019-09/2019, 50 SSIs) and 2.2% (09/2019-03/2020, 29 SSIs), resulting in a mean of 2.9% before COVID-19 began. After the beginning of COVID-19 hygiene measures, this rate dropped to 1.4% (16 SSIs) resembling a significant reduction (p=0.003). Risk factors for the development of SSI were present in 81.3% of all patients. Pre- and post-COVID-19 patient groups had similar baseline characteristics. The same holds true when comparing the percentage of cranial and spinal procedures pre- and post-COVID-19 (p=0.91). Comparing the numbers (p=0.28) and the species (p=0.85) of microorganisms (MO) causing SSI, we found a similar distribution. Despite equal demographics and characteristics of SSI, the rate of SSI dropped substantially. This argues for an effective reduction of postoperative SSI resulting from the implementation of strict hygiene measures being established after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore advocate continuing with strict and intensive hygiene measures in the future.","Chacón-Quesada, T; Rohde, V; von der Brelie, C",Neurosurg. rev,618,16

This work demonstrates the utility of parsimonious models for early-time data and provides an accessible framework for generating policy-relevant insights into its course. We show how these models can be connected to each other and to time series data for a particular region. Capable of measuring and forecasting the impacts of social distancing, these models highlight the dangers of relaxing nonpharmaceutical public health interventions in the absence of a vaccine or antiviral therapies.","Bertozzi, Andrea L; Franco, Elisa; Mohler, George; Short, Martin B; Sledge, Daniel",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,618,24

In this article a new prediction tool is presented in combination of Turkish experience during pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laboratory and clinical data of 397 over 798 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Gülhane Training and Research Hospital electronic medical record system were included into this retrospective cohort study between the dates of 23 March to 18 May 2020. Patient demographics, peripheral venous blood parameters, symptoms at admission, in hospital mortality data were collected. Non-survivor and survivor patients were compared to find out a prediction scoring model for mortality. RESULTS: There was 34 [8.56% (95% CI:0.06-0.11)] mortality during study period. Mean age of patients was 57.1±16.7 years. Older age, comorbid diseases, symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, fatigue and gastrointestinal and WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio of patients in non-survivors were significantly higher. Univariate analysis demonstrated that OR for prognostic nutritional index (PNI) tertile 1 was 18.57 (95% CI: 4.39-78.65, p<0.05) compared to tertile 2. Performance statistics of prediction scoring method showed 98% positive predictive value for criteria 1. CONCLUSIONS: It is crucial to constitute prognostic clinical and laboratory parameters for faster delineation of patients who are prone to worse prognosis. Suggested prediction scoring method may guide healthcare professional to discriminate severe COVID-19 patients and provide prompt intensive therapies which is highly important due to rapid progression leading to mortality.","Doganci, S; Ince, M E; Ors, N; Yildirim, A K; Sir, E; Karabacak, K; Eksert, S; Ozgurtas, T; Tasci, C; Dogan, D; Ozkan, G; Cosar, A; Gulcelik, M A; Aydin, K; Yildirim, V; Erdol, C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,618,1

We calculate the annualized volatility per sector, screen the contents of the reports for stated effects of the pandemic on profits, and analyze stock price reactions in four different phases of the pandemic. The results show that stock markets have reacted with an increased price volatility. Manufacturers of fertilizers and agrochemicals as well as food distributors show particularly high volatilities in their stock prices. Low price volatility was observed in the stocks of food retailers. This pattern is also reflected in the profits of companies published in financial reports.

In this study, we aimed to investigate if these specific VCs in chest CT correlate with clinical severity of the disease. METHODS: CT images of 102 patients who underwent low-dose noncontrast chest CT due to COVID-19 between 11 March 2020 and 11 April 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of VCs in CT images. VCs in chest CT of patients with COVID-19 were defined using the following descriptors: decreased lumen caliber, vascular wall irregularity, angulation in the course of the vessel, vascular disruption, and/or interruption. The relationship of these VCs with disease symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath), comorbid conditions (diabetes, hypertension, asthma), smoking habit, disease-specific laboratory changes (white blood cell-lymphocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], ferritin, procalcitonin), lung parenchymal infiltration pattern (ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation) and its distribution (peripheral, central, mixed, upper lobes, lower lobes, right middle lobe) on CT were investigated by comparison of these variables between patients with and without VCs in chest CT. RESULTS: VCs were observed in 18 out of 102 patients (18%) with typical parenchymal involvement for COVID-19. There was no significant difference in terms of age and sex. We found an irregularity in the wall of the vascular structures in the distal branches and decreased lumen caliber of the vessels related to ground-glass opacities in 15 patients, concentric luminal narrowing in annular form in 4 patients, angulation/traction or springiness in the vascular structures towards the active lesions in 3 patients, and interruptions along the vascular course in 1 patient. VCs were significantly correlated with fever (12/18, 66.7%) and shortness of breath (7/18, 39%). These changes were significantly more remarkable in common disease involving both upper and lower lobes (10/18, 56%). In these cases, there was a substantial increase in CRP (15/18, 83%; mean, 5.7±6.3 mg/dL) and LDH (8/18, 44%) values compared to those who did not have any VCs. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that specific VCs observed in chest CT may predict the disease severity in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. These changes may be related to respiratory distress in the disease.","Tekcan Sanli, Deniz Esin; Yildirim, Düzgün",Diagn. interv. radiol,618,24

There are currently 876 randomized clinical trials (phase 2 and 3) of treatments for COVID-19 registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Covariate adjustment is a statistical analysis method with potential to improve precision and reduce the required sample size for a substantial number of these trials. Though covariate adjustment is recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, it is underutilized, especially for the types of outcomes (binary, ordinal, and time-to-event) that are common in COVID-19 trials. To demonstrate the potential value added by covariate adjustment in this context, we simulated two-arm, randomized trials comparing a hypothetical COVID-19 treatment versus standard of care, where the primary outcome is binary, ordinal, or time-to-event. Our simulated distributions are derived from two sources: longitudinal data on over 500 patients hospitalized at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention preliminary description of 2449 cases. In simulated trials with sample sizes ranging from 100 to 1000 participants, we found substantial precision gains from using covariate adjustment-equivalent to 4-18% reductions in the required sample size to achieve a desired power. This was the case for a variety of estimands (targets of inference). From these simulations, we conclude that covariate adjustment is a low-risk, high-reward approach to streamlining COVID-19 treatment trials.

The novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has since caused a pandemic. Both viral and host factors determine the extent and severity of virus-induced lung damage. The host's response to viral infection is necessary for viral clearance but may be deleterious and contribute to severe disease phenotypes. Similarly, tissue repair mechanisms are required for recovery from infection across the spectrum of disease severity; however, dysregulated repair responses may lead to chronic lung dysfunction. Understanding of the mechanisms of immunopathology and tissue repair following viral lower respiratory tract infection may broaden treatment options. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis, the contribution of the host response to severe clinical phenotypes and highlight early and late epithelial repair mechanisms following influenza virus infection, each of which has been well characterized. Although we are still learning about SARS-CoV-2 and its disease manifestations in humans, throughout the Review we discuss what is known about SARS-CoV-2 in the context of this broad knowledge of influenza virus, highlighting the similarities and differences between the respiratory viruses.","Flerlage, Tim; Boyd, David F; Meliopoulos, Victoria; Thomas, Paul G; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey",Nat Rev Microbiol,618,1

Patients' outcomes are partly explained by patient-level risk factors, but it is hypothesised that organisational-level factors account for the persistence of unwarranted variation in outcomes. The mixed-methods REducing unwarranted variation in the Delivery of high qUality hip fraCture services in England and Wales (REDUCE) study, aims to determine key organisational factors to target to improve patient care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Quantitative analysis will assess the outcomes of patients treated at 172 hospitals in England and Wales (2016-2019) using National Hip Fracture Database data combined with English Hospital Episodes Statistics; Patient Episode Database for Wales; Civil Registration (deaths) and multiple organisational-level audits to characterise each service provider. Statistical analyses will identify which organisational factors explain variation in patient outcomes, and typify care pathways with high-quality consistent patient outcomes. Documentary analysis of 20 anonymised British Orthopaedic Association hospital-initiated peer-review reports, and qualitative interviews with staff from four diverse UK hospitals providing hip fracture care, will identify barriers and facilitators to care delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a major challenge to the resilience of services and interviews will explore strategies used to adapt and innovate. This system-wide understanding will inform the development, in partnership with key national stakeholders, of an 'Implementation Toolkit' to inform and improve commissioning and delivery of hip fracture services. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved: quantitative study by London, City and East Research Ethics Committee (20/LO/0101); and qualitative study by Faculty of Health Sciences University of Bristol Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 108284), National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority (20/HRA/71) and each NHS Trust provided Research and Development approval.

By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse and economic fallout, COVID-19 has led to increase in risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma and stress, which eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. There is limited data on association of pandemics and suicides. Cases of suicides have been rising since COVID-19 first emerged in China. The association between suicides and pandemics can possibly be explained through various models like Durkheim's theory, Joiner's interpersonal theory, social stress theory, biological theories, etc. The frontline workers, elderly, migrants, homeless, socio-economically impoverished classes as well as those with pre-existing mental disorders, substance abuse and family history of suicides are at higher risk. Suicides are preventable and need early detection, awareness and socio-culturally tailored interventions. This narrative review draws global perspectives on the association of suicidality and pandemics, the theories and risk factors related to same based on the available evidence. It also hypothesizes neuroimmunity and immune based risk factors as possible links between the psychosocial vulnerabilities and suicide during outbreaks like COVID-19.

Meteorological factors are determinant factors for the seasonality of most viruses. Our aim is to identify the dominant meteorological factors and to model their effects on common respiratory viruses in different regions of China.Methods: We analyzed monthly respiratory virus data from 81 sentinel hospitals in 22 provinces in mainland China from 2009 to 2013. Meteorological data of the same period were collected. Geographical detector was used to quantify the explanatory power of each meteorological factor and their interaction effects on respiratory viruses.Findings: Altogether, seven viruses from 28369 hospitalized ALRI patients were tested. Overall, 10387 cases(36.6%) were positive for at least one virus, among them were RSV (32%), FLU(20.8%), PIV(17%), ADV(11.6%), hBoV(8.8%), hCoV(5%), and hMPV(4.8%). RSV and FLU had annual peak in the north and semi-annual peak in the south. PIV and hBoV had higher positive rates in spring-summer. ADV and hCoV exhibited no clear annual seasonality, hMPV had annual peak in winter-spring. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, vapor pressure and rainfall had most explanatory power on most viruses, relative humidity was only dominant for most viruses in the north. Hours of sunlight had significant explanations for RSV and FLU in the north, but for most viruses in the south. Wind speed had dominant explanatory power for hCoV. Besides, the interacted explanations of any two of the paired factors got enhanced.Conclusions: Our results described the different explanation power of different meteorological variables on different viruses in different major climate regions of China. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity of most viruses was also detected in this study. These findings may be helpful to guide government planning and facilitate the development of future vaccine strategies.","Xu, Bing; Wang, Jinfeng; Li, Zhongjie; Xu, Chengdong; Liao, Yilan; Hu, Maogui; Yang, Jing; Lai, Shengjie; Wang, Liping; Yang, Weizhong",,618,16

Notes from Underground,17.400778,4.9296603,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, American Society for Testing and Materials level 3 and level 2 medical face masks (MFMs) have been used for most health care workers and even for the first responders owing to a shortage of N95 respirators. However, the MFMs lack effective peripheral seal, leading to concerns about their adequacy to block aerosol exposure for proper protection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the peripheral seal of level 3 and level 2 MFMs with a 3-dimensional (3D-) printed custom frame. METHODS: Level 3 and level 2 MFMs were tested on 10 participants with and without a 3D-printed custom frame; the efficiency of mask peripheral seal was determined by means of quantitative fit testing using a PortaCount Fit Tester based on ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter protocol. RESULTS: The 3D-printed custom frame significantly improved the peripheral seal of both level 3 and level 2 MFMs compared with the masks alone (P < .001). In addition, both level 3 and level 2 MFMs with the 3D-printed custom frame met the quantitative fit testing standard specified for N95 respirators. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The 3D-printed custom frame over level 3 and level 2 MFMs can offer enhanced peripheral reduction of aerosols when using collapsible masks. With the shortage of N95 respirators, using the 3D-printed custom frame over a level 3 or level 2 MFM is considered a practical alternative to dental professionals.","Ahmed, Abu; Zhong, Zhe; Suprono, Montry; Savignano, Roberto; Riter, Holli; Oyoyo, Udochukwu; Wilson, Alisa; Reece, Rebecca; Kim, Jessica; Cho, Eun-Hwi; Handysides, Robert; Richardson, Paul; Caruso, Joseph; Li, Yiming",J Am Dent Assoc,618,24

Notes from Underground,17.322117,4.786817,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the isolated prevalence of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 on the ocular surface without systemic infection in hospitalized asymptomatic patients and to determine the risk for ophthalmologists and medical staff to be infected by prescreened asymptomatic patients in a tertiary eye care center. METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, bilateral swaps of the conjunctiva in the lower fornices as well as nasopharyngeal swaps were collected in 1145 hospitalized asymptomatic patients of a tertiary eye care center. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed for each swap to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Demographic data and potential risk factors for an isolated infection of the ocular surface were noted. RESULTS: Two thousand two hundred eighty-eight (99.9%) of all 2290 tested eyes had negative results in the RT-PCR analysis of the conjunctival swabs. One patient had bilateral false-positive results in the conjunctival swabs. None of the 1145 patients had any positive RT-PCR-confirmed result in the nasopharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The risk for an isolated conjunctival viral activity in patients with a negative nasopharyngeal swab-based RT-PCR seems to be absent or extremely low, suggesting no need to perform additional conjunctival swabs in patients with negative nasopharyngeal swabs. Furthermore, the risk of a work-related SARS-CoV-2 infection due to direct contact with preselected asymptomatic patients in an eye care center is very low, especially when additional hygiene standards and safe distances are respected carefully. This might reassure medical staff and reduce the fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Rokohl, Alexander C; Grajewski, Rafael S; Wawer Matos, Philomena A; Koch, Hannah-Leah; Dewald, Felix; Klein, Florian; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Lehmann, Clara; Cursiefen, Claus; Heindl, Ludwig M",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,618,31

For staff, we address self-monitoring for symptoms, PPE in different clinical scenarios, and reducing staff exposures to SARS-CoV-2. For visitors/support persons, we address limiting them in labor and delivery, the postpartum units, and the NICU to promote staff and patient safety. We describe management of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and their newborns in both the well-baby nursery and in the neonatal ICU. Notably, in the well-baby nursery we do not separate SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers from their newborns, but emphasize maternal mask use and social distancing by placing newborns in isolates and asking mothers to remain 6 feet away unless feeding or changing their newborn. We also encourage direct breastfeeding and do not advocate early bathing. Newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers are considered persons under investigation (PUIs) until 14 days of life, the duration of the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2.

This study examines its prevalence and correlates among HCWs in Karnataka State, India. HCWs who attended a workshop to improve mental health well-being during COVID-19 completed an anonymous online questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions. Participants with depression additionally had family distress and hardly ever exercised. To conclude, mental health issues are common among HCWs in India.

The rehabilitation needs of people infected are receiving growing attention, as evidenced by the increasing number of publications, including those addressing the chronic consequences of infection. OBJECTIVES: This rapid living systematic review reports the evidence published in November and December 2020 and summarises the entire body of literature on rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients published in 2020. METHODS: This update was performed using the methodology reported by the second edition conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER Action. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases. Papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarised descriptively. RESULTS: The search retrieved 4441 studies. After the removal of duplicates and the screening for title and abstract, we retained 105 studies. Of these, we included 54 in the qualitative synthesis of this update. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence Table, most studies (64.8%) fall within the category of Level 4 evidence. Up to 40.7% of papers included COVID-19 patients in the post-acute phase. In 2020, our rapid living systematic review included 230 studies; most of these (73.9%) were Level 4 studies, 25.7% were Level 3, and only one study was Level 2. The evidence level improved over time. While most studies (44.8%) included patients with acute COVID-19, we observed a gradual increase in the number of reports about chronic symptoms and the long-term consequences of the infection. CONCLUSIONS: The update of the rapid living systematic review by Cochrane Rehabilitation Field demonstrates an increase in the level of evidence of studies addressing the rehabilitation needs associated with COVID-19 infection. Although most studies are still case reports/series, there is a trend towards conducting prospective investigations of the early natural history of the disease (first months post- onset). High-quality-level studies on the efficacy of rehabilitation, and long-term monitoring of the disease and its sequelae are yet to emerge.","DE Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Negrini, Francesco; Patrini, Michele; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Ceravolo, Maria Gabriella",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

Although randomized ``geo experiments'' are frequently employed for this evaluation, obtaining reliable estimates of iROAS can be challenging as oftentimes only a small number of highly heterogeneous units are used. Moreover, advertisers frequently impose budget constraints on their ad spends, which further complicates causal inference by introducing interference between the experimental units. In this paper, we formulate a novel statistical framework for inferring the iROAS of online advertising from randomized paired geo experiment which further motivates and provides new insights into Rosenbaum's arguments on instrumental variables, and we propose and develop a robust, distribution-free and interpretable estimator ``Trimmed Match'', as well as a data-driven choice of the tuning parameter which may be of independent interest. We investigate the sensitivity of Trimmed Match to some violations of its assumptions and show that it can be more efficient than some alternative estimators based on simulated data.

In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, patients from units with a long waiting list must be redistributed, at least within the country. In the future, in the event of a second wave of the pandemic, an effective program to manage each unit's resources should be developed to prevent total collapse.","de la Portilla de Juan, Fernando; Reyes Díaz, María Luisa; Ramallo Solía, Irene",Cir Esp (Engl Ed),618,24

Methods: This retrospective study compared current and past visits to the emergency services of a large metropolitan university-affiliated medical center in Tel-Aviv, Israel. Data on EUP-related and regular early pregnancy care-related presentations to the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and compared to a historical control group admitted during 2018-2019. The primary outcome was the rate of ruptured EUP. Secondary outcomes included the rate of EUPs requiring surgery, symptoms, blood products, blood loss, embryonic heart rate, ß-HCG levels, and intensive care unit transfer. Findings: During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a 28.3% reduction in women seeking early pregnancy and emergent gynecological medical care. ED visits due to suspected EUP were similar: After exclusion, the study group comprised of 100 women and the combined control group from previous years included 208 women with confirmed EUP. Baseline maternal characteristics were similar between the groups. The rate of ruptured EUP's was significantly more common during the COVID-19 pandemic than in previous years [odds ratio (OR) 2â¢403 (1â¢272-4â¢539), p = 0â¢006]. Moreover, during the pandemic patients admitted due to EUP were significantly more symptomatic [OR 1â¢815 (1â¢072-3â¢074), p = 0â¢017] and had more blood loss demonstrated as substantial hemoglobin decline [OR 2â¢441 (1â¢07-5â¢565), p = 0â¢028] as well as hemoperitoneum during surgery [OR 2â¢672 (1â¢095-6â¢52), p = 0â¢035] The number of women receiving blood products was higher in the study group yet not reaching statistical significance [7% vs 3â¢4%, OR 2â¢161 (0â¢737-6â¢339) p = 0â¢128]. The overall rate of surgically treated EUP was similar between the groups [OR 1â¢070 (0â¢660-1â¢734), p = 0â¢439] and there was no significant difference in non-surgical management. Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has a toll on early pregnancy emergent care due to EUP with a significantly higher risk of tubal rupture and morbidity. Physicians should expect delayed presentation of symptomatic EUP and act accordingly.

The aim of this multi-centric, retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on surgical activity for thyroid disease among the Italian Units of Endocrine Surgery. Three phases of the pandemic were identified based on the epidemiological situation and the public measures adopted from the Italian Government (1st phase: from 9th March to 3rd May 2020; 2nd phase: from 4th May to 14th June; 3rd phase: from 15th June to 31st). The patients operated upon during these phases were compared to those who underwent surgery during the same period of the previous year. Overall, 3892 patients from 28 Italian endocrine surgical units were included in the study, 1478 (38%) operated upon during COVID-19 pandemic, and 2414 (62%) during the corresponding period of 2019. The decrease in the number of operations was by 64.8%, 44.7% and 5.1% during the three phases of COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 2019, respectively. During the first and the second phases, the surgical activity was dedicated mainly to oncological patients. No differences in post-operative complications were noted between the two periods. Oncological activity for thyroid cancer was adequately maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Medas, Fabio; Ansaldo, Gian Luca; Avenia, Nicola; Basili, Giancarlo; Boniardi, Marco; Bononi, Marco; Bove, Aldo; Carcoforo, Paolo; Casaril, Andrea; Cavallaro, Giuseppe; Chiofalo, Maria Grazia; Conzo, Giovanni; De Pasquale, Loredana; Del Rio, Paolo; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Dobrinja, Chiara; Docimo, Giovanni; Graceffa, Giuseppa; Iacobone, Maurizio; Innaro, Nadia; Lombardi, Celestino Pio; Palestini, Nicola; Pedicini, Francesco; Perigli, Giuliano; Pezzolla, Angela; Scerrino, Gregorio; Spiezia, Stefano; Testini, Mario; Calò, Pietro Giorgio",Updates surg.

The issue was further compounded by some DGH’s, who stopped offering the calprotectin test due to COVID-19 infection risk to the staff. Although home based calprotectin kits are also available, families using them have reported their use cumbersome and difficult to process tests at home. In addition, calprotectin results from other laboratories may be difficult to access. These limitations led to the development of a new regional service, in which samples taken at home are posted to the hub hospital laboratory (where the IBD clinic is based) for Calprotectin testing. AimTo study the benefits of offering a service for posting faecal samples for calprotectin testing to a hub laboratory.MethodsChildren (0–18 years) with IBD in the Wessex region, UK needing a calprotectin test were given postal faecal calprotectin packs (PFCP), either by hand in clinic or posted to their home. Each PFCP contained a labelled specimen bottle with immunology request form, bio-packaging box, sealable return bag (UN3373 compliant) with attached freepost label and instruction sheet. A Calprotectin cut off level of &lt;200 was used as normal.Results63 patients (M=34, 54% & F=29, 46%) were given PFCP between 27th July & 5th of Nov 2020 with 52.4% posted PFCP and 47.6% given PFCP by hand in the paediatric GI clinic. The patients resided at a mean distance of 41.6 miles (1 SD = 24.1 miles) as the crow flies from the hospital. A mean of 25 days (1SD = 10 days) were taken from posting/handing of PFCP to the lab test result being obtained.The PFCP was returned by 50 patients (79.4% compliance) with a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease 34.9%, UC 28.6%, IBDU 7.9%, oral ulcers 4.8% and 23.8% of patients referred for endoscopy with IBD like symptoms. 30% of the patients with IBD (15/50) posting the PFCP had an abnormal test result. This led to a change in management in 40% of the patients. In the patient group referred with suspected IBD only 1/15 patients had an abnormal calprotectin test. 70% of patients with a normal test were able to be reassured without further investigation. ConclusionThis is the first reported series, offering to a large region a robust method for samples to be taken at home and posted to a central hub laboratory for calprotectin testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Test results were readily available, being performed in the same hospital site as the IBD clinic. Compliance with the new PFCP remains high with 80% using the new PFCP service, with value in early identification of patients who may not have much in terms of symptoms and avoidance of endoscopy in others with a normal calprotectin.","Barnes, Claire Roberts Chris Ward Jo Coelho Tracy Batra Akshay Beattie Robert Mark Eren Efrem Afzal Nadeem",Frontline Gastroenterology,618,20

METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional, anonymous survey of adult HCWs. Data collection was performed in May and June 2020, while governmental restrictions were in place. The participants completed the forms including six separate parts: personal and occupational information, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient's Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and COVID-like symptoms and Coronavirus RT-PCR status. RESULTS: Among the 372 HCW participants, 245 (66%) were women and mean age was 34.5 ± 7.1 years (age range 23 to 58). The mean scores of all questionnaires except ISI were significantly higher in the HCWs with positive Coronavirus RT-PCR than another group (PSQI, 9 ± 3.4 vs. 6.9 ± 3.1; GAD-7, 9.8 ± 3.6 vs. 7.9 ± 5.3; PHQ-9, 12.8 ± 6.1 vs. 9.5 ± 6.4, P < 0.05; and ISI, 13.8 ± 5.3 vs. 12.3 ± 6 P = 0.163). Positive association between COVID-like symptoms and sleep and mood disturbances was found in the group without a positive test result. Analysis of questionnaires showed higher scores in the group directly involved except for ISI (P < 0.001 and P = 0.053 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the HCWs in this sample experienced a high rate of sleep and mood disturbances. There was also a strong association between sleep and mood disturbances and COVID-like symptoms in the group without a positive RT-PCR result. With all this considered, effective psychological support for HCWs during crisis seems to be necessary.","Amra, Babak; Salmasi, Mehrzad; Soltaninejad, Forogh; Sami, Ramin; Nickpour, Mina; Mansourian, Marjan; Ghasemi, Khojasteh; Morin, Charles M",Sleep breath,618,1

Due to ongoing metabolic abnormalities, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) appears to be a potential risk factor for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and developing related complications. This is because of the interplay of chronically active inflammatory pathways in NAFLD- and COVID-19-associated acute cytokine storm. The risk of severe disease could also be attributed to compromised liver function as a result of NAFLD. We systematically reviewed current literature to ascertain the relationship between NAFLD and severe COVID-19, independent of obesity, which is considered the major factor risk factor for both NAFLD and COVID-19.

PLpro acts as a protease and processes the large coronavirus polyprotein for virus replication. PLpro also functions as both a deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating (deISG) enzyme and removes ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins. Both DUB and deISG activities are implicated in suppressing innate immune responses; however, the precise role of each activity in this process is still unclear due in part to the difficulties in separating each activity. In this study, we determine the first structure of MERS PLpro in complex with the full-length human ISG15 to a resolution of 2.3 Å. This structure and available structures of MERS PLpro-Ub complexes were used as molecular guides to design PLpro mutants that lack either or both DUB/deISG activities. We tested 13 different PLpro mutants for protease, DUB, and deISG activitites using fluorescence-based assays. Results show that we can selectively modulate DUB activity at amino acid positions 1649 and 1653 while mutation of Val1691 or His1652 of PLpro to a positive charged residue completely impairs both DUB/deISG activities. These mutant enzymes will provide new functional tools for delineating the importance of DUB versus deISG activity in virus-infected cells and may serve as potential candidates for attenuating the MERS virus in vivo for modified vaccine design efforts.","Clasman, Jozlyn R.; Everett, Renata K.; Srinivasan, Karthik; Mesecar, Andrew D.",Antiviral Res.,618,1

Most of the industries within the catchment area of river Damodar have been closed; as a result, significant changes have been reflected throughout the stretch of river Damodar. The main objective of the study is to analyze the impact of lockdown on the water quality of river Damodar. A total of 55 samples was collected from eleven different confluence sites of nallas with the main river channel during and pre-lockdown period.

COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","Valenti, Vitor E; Menezes, Pedro de Lemos; Abreu, Ana Carolina Gonçalves de; Vieira, Gustavo Nakamura Alves; Garner, David M",J.

Mortalities, shortages in health care system capacity, and lack of experience in similar circumstances required innovation in the way health care is delivered. Health care systems changed operating schedules, staff work pattern, and how patients are cared for. The effects of these changes reached patients, staff and training in different ways. METHODS: We searched the Pubmed and EMBASE for articles related to COVID-19. We also searched local emails and information provided to staff during the pandemic RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic affected organizations, patients, and staff. The organizations and staff had to adapt to the times to provide a safe and appropriate service to our patients.

CONCLUSIONS: Conspiracy beliefs may be situated on a spectrum of mistrust-related phenomena, which extends from healthy scepticism to persecutory delusions. They can be conceptualised as unfounded and fixed beliefs held with strong conviction about harm inflicted by powerful groups on the community or another group of people, usually with preserved insight that these beliefs differ from those that most people have and with reasons for having such beliefs not necessarily being implausible.

Although it is known that the risk of severe disease is increased in certain human populations, including the elderly, it remains unclear why others who consume contaminated food develop listeriosis. Here, we used a murine model to discover that pulmonary coinfections can impair the host's ability to adequately control and eradicate systemic Lm that cross from the intestines to the bloodstream. We found that the resistance of mice to oral Lm infection was dramatically reduced by coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), a bacterium that colonizes the respiratory tract and can also cause severe infections in the elderly. Exposure to Spn or microbial products, including a recombinant Lm protein (L1S) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), rendered otherwise resistant hosts susceptible to severe systemic Lm infection. In addition, we show that this increase in susceptibility was dependent on an increase in the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) from Ncr1+ cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Lastly, the ability of Ncr1+ cell derived IL-10 to increase disease susceptibility correlated with a dampening of both myeloid cell accumulation and myeloid cell phagocytic capacity in infected tissues. These data suggest that efforts to minimize inflammation in response to an insult at the respiratory mucosa render the host more susceptible to infections by Lm and possibly other pathogens that access the oral mucosa.","Bortell, Nikki; Aguilera, Elizabeth R; Lenz, Laurel L",PLoS Pathog,618,1

This virus can spread by close contact, which includes large droplet spray and inhalation of microscopic droplets, and by indirect contact via contaminated objects. While in most countries, supermarkets have remained open, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities have ordered many other shops, restaurants, bars, music theaters and indoor sports centers to be closed. As part of COVID-19 (semi)lock-down exit strategies, many government authorities are now (May-June 2020) allowing a gradual re-opening, where sometimes indoor sport centers are last in line to be permitted to re-open. This technical note discusses the challenges in safely re-opening these facilities and the measures already suggested by others to partly tackle these challenges. It also elaborates three potential additional measures and based on these additional measures, it suggests the concept of a certificate of equivalence that could allow indoor sports centers with such a certificate to re-open safely and more rapidly. It also attempts to stimulate increased preparedness of indoor sports centers that should allow them to remain open safely during potential next waves of SARS-CoV-2 as well as future pandemics.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS: The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS: During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged &lt;5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing.

To illustrate the feasibility of using Swarm Learning to develop disease classifiers using distributed data, we chose four use cases of heterogeneous diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, leukaemia and lung pathologies). With more than 16,400 blood transcriptomes derived from 127 clinical studies with non-uniform distributions of cases and controls and substantial study biases, as well as more than 95,000 chest X-ray images, we show that Swarm Learning classifiers outperform those developed at individual sites. In addition, Swarm Learning completely fulfils local confidentiality regulations by design.

First, we leverage mixture models to develop an accurate, comprehensive, yet impractical simulation system. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to retrieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. Then, with the obtained query data, sequence mixup is proposed to improve query efficiency, increase knowledge diversity, and boost distillation model accuracy. Finally, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences for practical use.

Some previous evidence has suggested COVID-19-associated strokes are more severe with worse outcomes for patients, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings. The aim of this study was to determine the association between COVID-19 and mortality for patients with ischaemic stroke in a large multicentre study. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic medical records of inpatients from 50 healthcare organizations, predominately from the USA. Patients with ischaemic stroke within 30 days of COVID-19 were identified. COVID-19 was determined from diagnosis codes or a positive test result identified with CO-VID-19-specific laboratory codes between January 20, 2020, and October 1, 2020. Historical controls with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 were identified in the period January 20, 2019, to October 1, 2019. 1:1 propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts with and without CO-VID-19 on characteristics including age, sex, race and comorbidities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause 60-day mortality by COVID-19 status were produced. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 954 inpatients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19. During the same time period in 2019, there were 48,363 inpatients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19 (historical controls). Compared to patients with ischaemic stroke without COVID-19, patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 had a lower mean age, had a lower prevalence of white patients, a higher prevalence of black or African American patients and a higher prevalence of hypertension, previous cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, neoplasms, and mental disorders due to known physiological conditions. After propensity score matching, there were 952 cases and 952 historical controls; cases and historical controls were better balanced on all included characteristics (all p > 0.05). After propensity score matching, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed the survival probability was significantly lower in ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 (78.3% vs. 91.0%, log-rank test p < 0.0001). The odds of 60-day mortality were significantly higher for patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 compared to the propensity score-matched historical controls (odds ratio: 2.51 [95% confidence interval 1.88-3.34]). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Ischaemic stroke patients with COVID-19 had significantly higher 60-day all-cause mortality compared to propensity score-matched historical controls (ischaemic stroke patients without COVID-19).","Harrison, Stephanie L; Fazio-Eynullayeva, Elnara; Lane, Deirdre A; Underhill, Paula; Lip, Gregory Y H",Cerebrovasc Dis,618,30

The interaction of IRF5 and metabolic genes had a functional consequence, since Irf5-/- AMs but not bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were characterized by a quiescent metabolic phenotype at baseline and had reduced ability to utilize oxidative phosphorylation after TLR3 activation ex vivo. In a murine model of influenza infection, IRF5 deficiency had no effect on viral load in comparison to WT controls, but controlled metabolic responses to viral infection since IRF5 deficiency led to reduced expression of Sirt6 and Hk2. Together, our data indicate that IRF5 is a key component of AM metabolic responses following influenza infection and TLR3 activation.","Albers, Gesa J; Iwasaki, Jua; McErlean, Peter; Ogger, Patricia P; Ghai, Poonam; Khoyratty, Tariq E; Udalova, Irina A; Lloyd, Clare M; Byrne, Adam J",Clin. exp. immunol,618,10

Here, analysis of publicly accessible transcriptomes was used to expand our understanding of crustacean ALPs. Specifically, transcriptome mining was used to investigate the phylogenetic/structural conservation, tissue localization, and putative functions of ALPs in decapod species. Transcripts encoding putative ALP precursors were identified from one or more members of the Penaeoidea (penaeid shrimp), Sergestoidea (sergestid shrimps), Caridea (caridean shrimp), Astacidea (clawed lobsters and freshwater crayfish), Achelata (spiny/slipper lobsters), and Brachyura (true crabs), suggesting a broad, and perhaps ubiquitous, conservation of ALPs in decapods. Comparison of the predicted mature structures of decapod ALPs revealed high levels of amino acid conservation, including eight identically conserved cysteine residues that presumably allow for the formation of four identically positioned disulfide bridges. All decapod ALPs are predicted to have amidated carboxyl-terminals. Two isoforms of ALP appear to be present in most decapod species, one 44 amino acids long and the other 42 amino acids in length, both likely generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. In carideans, a gene or terminal exon duplication appears to have occurred, with alternative splicing producing four ALPs, two 44 and two 42 amino acid isoforms. The identification of ALP precursor-encoding transcripts in nervous system-specific transcriptomes (e.g., Homarus americanus brain, eyestalk ganglia, and cardiac ganglion assemblies, finding confirmed using RT-PCR) suggests that members of this peptide family may serve as locally-released and/or hormonally-delivered neuromodulators in decapods. Their detection in testis- and hepatopancreas-specific transcriptomes suggests that members of the ALP family may also play roles in male reproduction and innate immunity/detoxification.","Christie, Andrew E; Rivera, Cindy D; Call, Catherine M; Dickinson, Patsy S; Stemmler, Elizabeth A; Joe Hull, J",Gen Comp Endocrinol,618,29

Fifty-three participants (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P < 0.05) but these values did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered participants by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), MMP-7, and HGF identified by our analysis were significantly higher in the ICU group (P < 0.05), inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P < 0.05), and were confirmed in a separate validation cohort (n = 53).CONCLUSIONSubjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function.

Our results suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are essential for controlling COVID-19 infection.

Our results show innate immune system including phagocytes contribute severely to the elimination of COVID-19 in both mouse model and human.

We report a case of 33-year-old African American woman with COVID-19 who developed acute malignant middle cerebral artery infarction due to thromboembolic occlusion of the left terminal internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery stem. Mechanical thrombectomy was challenging and ultimately unsuccessful resulting in limited reperfusion of <67% of the affected vascular territory, and thrombectomized clot was over 50 mm in length, at least three times the average clot length. The final stroke size was estimated at 224 cubic centimeters. On admission her D-dimer level was 94,589 ng/mL (normal 0-500 ng/ml). Throughout the hospitalization D-dimer decreased but never reached normal values while fibrinogen trended upward. Hypercoagulability panel was remarkable for mildly elevated anticardiolipin IgM of 16.3 MPL/mL (normal: 0-11.0 MPL/mL). With respect to remaining stroke workup, there was no evidence of clinically significant stenosis or dissection in the proximal internal carotid artery or significant cardioembolic source including cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, cardiac thrombus, cardiac tumor, valvular abnormality, aortic arch atheroma, or patent foramen ovale. She developed malignant cytotoxic cerebral edema and succumbed to complications. This case underscores the importance of recognizing hypercoagulability as a cause of severe stroke and poor outcome in young patients with COVID-19 and highlights the need for further studies to define correlation between markers of coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 infection and outcome post stroke.","Pisano, Thomas John; Hakkinen, Ian; Rybinnik, Igor",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,618,16

Methods: We describe a patient who developed new-onset central hypocortisolism in the convalescent phase of mild COVID-19, which has not been previously reported. Results: A 47-year-old man with recent COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection developed new-onset persistent dyspepsia and eosinophilia for which multiple investigations were normal. He was eventually diagnosed with central hypocortisolism, as evidenced by 8 AM cortisol level of 19 nmol/L (normal, 133-537 nmol/L) and adrenocorticotropic hormone of 7.1 ng/mL (normal, 10.0-60.0 ng/mL). He was started on hydrocortisone, which led to resolution of both dyspepsia and eosinophilia. At the same time, an interesting thyroid function trend was observed-an initial increase in both free thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone was followed by temporary central hypothyroidism before subsequent spontaneous recovery. On follow-up 3 weeks later, the patient remained hypocortisolemic. Conclusion: COVID-19 may be associated with the delayed onset of central hypocortisolism in its convalescent phase. Although various mechanisms are possible, hypothalamic-pituitary activation during systemic illness, followed by a rebound decrease in activity after recovery, is consistent with the clinical course and thyroid function trend in this patient. It is essential that physicians consider endocrinopathies in the differential diagnosis of such cases, given the risk of life-threatening adrenal crises and their possible contribution to persistent symptoms following recovery from COVID-19.","Chua, Marvin Wei Jie; Chua, Melvin Peng Wei",,618,6

We aimed to summarize the characteristics of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the pandemic and explore the risk factors of disease progression. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis, searching three databases for studies published between January 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. We used random-effects models to calculate the 95% confidence intervals of pooled estimated prevalence and the odds ratio between the severe and nonsevere cases. RESULTS: Ninety studies involving 16,526 COVID-19 patients were included. Hypertension (19.1%) and diabetes (9.5%) were the most common comorbidities. The most prevalent clinical symptoms were fever (78.4%), cough (58.5%), and fatigue (26.4%). Increased serum ferritin (74.2%), high C-reactive protein (73.3%), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (72.2%) were the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities. Most patients had bilateral lung involvement (82.2%) and showed peripheral (66.9%) and subpleural (62.1%) distribution, with multifocal involvement (73.1%). And the most common CT features were vascular enlargement (64.3%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (60.7%), and thickened interlobular septa (55.1%). Respiratory failure was the most common complication (30.7%) and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 4.2%. Moreover, male, history of smoking, and comorbidities might influence the prognosis. Most clinical symptoms such as fever, high fever, cough, sputum production, fatigue, shortness of breath, dyspnoea, and abdominal pain were linked to the severity of disease. Some specific laboratory indicators implied the deterioration of disease, such as leucocytosis, lymphopenia, platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and D-dimer. Besides, the risk of bilateral pneumonia, consolidation, pleural effusion, and enlarged mediastinal nodes was higher in severe cases. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 patients have fever and cough with lymphopenia and increased inflammatory indices, and the main CT feature is GGO involved bilateral lung. Patients with comorbidities and worse clinical symptoms, laboratory characteristics, and CT findings tend to have poor disease progression.","Xie, Jingyuan; Wang, Qin; Xu, Yangyang; Zhang, Tianli; Chen, Lu; Zuo, Xueying; Liu, Jiaxin; Huang, Litang; Zhan, Ping; Lv, Tangfeng; Song, Yong",Ann Palliat Med,618,16

Some of them are enclosed in bacteriocytes to assure their maternal transmission over generations. All of them show an increased level of genetic drift due to the small population size and the continuous population bottlenecking at each generation, processes that have shaped their genome, proteome, and morphology. Depending on the nature of the relationship, the degree of genome plasticity varies, i.e., obligate nutritional mutualistic symbionts have extremely small genomes lacking mobile elements, bacteriophages, or recombination machinery. Under these conditions, endosymbionts face high mutational pressures that may drive to extinction or symbiont replacement. How do then they survive for such long evolutionary time, and why do they show a genome stasis? In this chapter, after a brief introduction to the problem, we will focus on the genome changes suffered by these endosymbionts, and on the mutational robustness mechanisms, including the moonlighting chaperone GroEL that could explain their long prevalence from an evolutionary perspective by comparing them with free-living bacteria.","Sabater-Muñoz, Beatriz; Toft, Christina",Results Probl Cell Differ,618,1

We argue that this narrative masks important details about the local conditions where mining companies operate. The issues at the company-community interface are typically invisible to distant audiences. While travel restrictions are necessary to limit community-spread, these constraints push interfaces in mining communities further into the unknown. The effects of the global pandemic will be far reaching.

The COVID-19 virus has devastated the world in the last eighteen months by infecting more than 182 million people and causing over 3.9 million deaths. The overarching aim is to predict the diagnosis of the COVID-19 virus from chest radiographs, through the development of explainable vision transformer deep learning techniques, leading to population screening in a more rapid, accurate and transparent way. In this competition, there are 5381 three-dimensional (3D) datasets in total, including 1552 for training, 374 for evaluation and 3455 for testing. While most of the data volumes are in axial view, there are a number of subjects' data are in coronal or sagittal views with 1 or 2 slices are in axial view. Hence, while 3D data based classification is investigated, in this competition, 2D images remains the main focus. Two deep learning methods are studied, which are vision transformer (ViT) based on attention models and DenseNet that is built upon conventional convolutional neural network (CNN). Initial evaluation results based on validation datasets whereby the ground truth is known indicate that ViT performs better than DenseNet with F1 scores being 0.76 and 0.72 respectively.

Some centers have reported very high rates of thrombosis despite anticoagulant prophylaxis. The electronic health record (EHR) of a New Orleans-based health system was searched for all patients with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were either admitted to hospital or treated and discharged from an emergency department between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2020. From this cohort, patients with confirmed VTE (either during or after their hospital encounter) were identified by administrative query of the EHR.: Between 1 March 2020 and 1 May 2020, 6153 patients with COVID-19 were identified; 2748 of these patients were admitted, while 3405 received care exclusively through the emergency department. In total, 637 patients required mechanical ventilation and 206 required renal replacement therapy. Within the hospitalized cohort, the overall mortality rate was 24.5% and VTE occurred in 86 patients (3.1%). In the 637 patients who required mechanical ventilation at some point during their hospital stay, 45 developed VTE (7.2%). After a median follow-up of 14.6 days, VTE had been diagnosed in 3 of the 2075 admitted who were discharged alive (0.14%). Among 6153 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized or treated in emergency departments, we did not find evidence of unusually high VTE risk. Pending further evidence from prospective, controlled trials, our findings support a traditional approach to primary VTE prevention in patients with COVID-19.","Hill, Jason B; Garcia, David; Crowther, Mark; Savage, Bryan; Peress, Shira; Chang, Kevin; Deitelzweig, Steven",Blood Adv,618,1

Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common severe complications. There is growing evidence regarding the imaging findings of COVID-19 in chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT); however, their availability to clinical staff in this pandemic outbreak might be compromised. At this moment, the role of lung ultrasound (LUS) has yet to be explored. The purpose of this case report is to describe the natural course of the disease in mild infection managed at home. CASE REPORT: We report a 35-year-old man with recently diagnosed COVID-19 infection. Clinical examination was unremarkable. The diagnosis of mild disease was made clinically which was later reaffirmed by LUS after identifying a bilateral small pleural effusion and a thickened pleural line. During follow up, subpleural consolidations appeared before symptoms slightly aggravated (cough, tiredness and fever). The patient's condition improved after adjustment of therapy at home. CONCLUSION: LUS is an excellent tool in the characterisation of COVID-19 infection and is more available than CT or X-ray. We emphasise the utility and the opportunity that LUS presents in some clinical scenarios, like this COVID-19 pandemic, and how it may serve as a monitoring and therapy guide.","Tung-Chen, Yale",Clin Med (Lond),618,24

METHODS This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in São Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.","Cruz, Pedro Alexandre da; Crema-Cruz, Leandra Cristina; Campos, Fabrício Souza",Rev.

The Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 protein (ACE2) utilized by the SARS-CoV as a receptor was found to facilitate the infection of SARS-CoV-2, initiated by the binding of the spike protein to human ACE2. Methods: Using homology modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods, we report here the detailed structure and dynamics of the ACE2 in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Results: The predicted model is highly consistent with the experimentally determined structures, validating the homology modeling results. Besides the binding interface reported in the crystal structures, novel binding poses are revealed from all-atom MD simulations. The simulation data are used to identify critical residues at the complex interface and provide more details about the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2. Conclusion: Simulations reveal that RBD binds to both open and closed state of ACE2. Two human ACE2 mutants and rat ACE2 are modeled to study the mutation effects on RBD binding to ACE2. The simulations show that the N-terminal helix and the K353 are very important for the tight binding of the complex, the mutants are found to alter the binding modes of the CoV2-RBD to ACE2.","Lupala, C.

Separate nylon swab stick was used for taking the samples from NP-OP and the floor of the oral cavity. The data were analyzed for sensitivity, specificity, concordance of COVID-19 status, and limits of agreement for cycle threshold (ct) values by either method. Forty-nine suspects (61.3%) were males, the mean age was 36.4 years. To determine the diagnostic test performance of the saliva, RT-PCR results of the NP-OP samples were used as the reference standard. Out of 80 suspects, 41 showed positivity by NP-OP swabs and 12 by salivary samples. The salivary samples showed significantly lesser positivity rate. The sensitivity and specificity of salivary samples against conventional reference standards are 24.4%, 94.9% respectively. Concordance of these two types of samples in terms of agreement kappa statistics is estimated as K = 0.252 (0.09-0.42). Median ct values of both the E and ORF1ab gene for the salivary samples were higher compared to the corresponding NP-OP sample. This study showed lesser sensitivity with salivary swab samples as compared to conventional NP-OP sampling for RT-PCR, COVID-19 detection. Hence, we are of opinion that more studies are required to establish the utility of salivary sampling in COVID-19 diagnostics.","Bidkar, Vijay; Mishra, Meena; Gade, Neeta; Selvaraj, Kalaiselvi",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,618,29

Many physicians replaced face-to-face consultations with teleconsultations for the very first time. This study aimed to understand telemedicine uses by physicians during the lockdown period and explain the changes in their teleconsultation practices after the reopening of an outpatient department. Methods: A mixed-method analysis was used. First, a quantitative study was conducted with a retrospective analysis of the ratio of all teleconsultations and physical consultations between January 1 and July 31, 2020. Second, semidirective interviews were undertaken with physicians to better understand the dynamics of teleconsultation use. Results: In total, 28 physicians practiced 603 teleconsultations over the study period. The rate of teleconsultations was 0.2% before the lockdown (January 1 to March 15, 2020), reaching 19.5% during the lockdown (April 2020), and decreasing to 8.4% at the reopening of the physical outpatient facilities. Based on the dynamics of their teleconsultation uses, four medical departments were selected for the qualitative study component (neurology, urology, pneumology, and anesthesiology). From the semistructured interviews, the main uses of telemedicine were for patients living with ""chronic but under control"" conditions that received follow-ups. Physicians also identified practices to improve patient empowerment and nurse autonomy. The results of the anesthesiology department showed that teleconsultations must be more codified to meet the same standards of quality as face-to-face consultations.

Comprehensive assessment of the multifaceted antiviral Ab response is critical for diagnosis, differentiation of severity, and characterization of long-term immunity, especially as COVID-19 vaccines become available. Severe disease is associated with early, massive plasmablast responses. We developed a multiplex immunoassay from serum/plasma of acutely infected and convalescent COVID-19 patients and prepandemic and postpandemic healthy adults. We measured IgA, IgG, and/or IgM against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N), spike domain 1 (S1), S1-receptor binding domain (RBD) and S1-N-terminal domain. For diagnosis, the combined [IgA + IgG + IgM] or IgG levels measured for N, S1, and S1-RBD yielded area under the curve values &#8805;0.90. Virus-specific Ig levels were higher in patients with severe/critical compared with mild/moderate infections. A strong prozone effect was observed in sera from severe/critical patients-a possible source of underestimated Ab concentrations in previous studies. Mild/moderate patients displayed a slower rise and lower peak in anti-N and anti-S1 IgG levels compared with severe/critical patients, but anti-RBD IgG and neutralization responses reached similar levels at 2-4 mo after symptom onset. Measurement of the Ab responses in sera from 18 COVID-19-vaccinated patients revealed specific responses for the S1-RBD Ag and none against the N protein. This highly sensitive, SARS-CoV-2-specific, multiplex immunoassay measures the magnitude, complexity, and kinetics of the Ab response and can distinguish serum Ab responses from natural SARS-CoV-2 infections (mild or severe) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.","Haddad, Natalie S; Nguyen, Doan C; Kuruvilla, Merin E; Morrison-Porter, Andrea; Anam, Fabliha; Cashman, Kevin S; Ramonell, Richard P; Kyu, Shuya; Saini, Ankur Singh; Cabrera-Mora, Monica; Derrico, Andrew; Alter, David; Roback, John D; Horwath, Michael; O039,; Keefe, James B; Wu, Henry M; Wong, An-Kwok Ian; Dretler, Alexandra W; Gripaldo, Ria; Lane, Andrea N; Wu, Hao; Chu, Helen Y; Lee, Saeyun; Hernandez, Mindy; Engineer, Vanessa; Varghese, John; Patel, Rahul; Jalal, Anum; French, Victoria; Guysenov, Ilya; Lane, Christopher E; Mengistsu, Tesfaye; Normile, Katherine Elizabeth; Mnzava, Onike; Le, Sang; Sanz, Ignacio; Daiss, John L; Lee, F Eun-Hyung",Immunohorizons,618,16

We examined ipRGC-driven pupil responses in civilian TBI and control participants using two pupillography protocols that assessed transient and adaptive properties: (1) a one second (s) long wavelength ""red"" stimulus (651 nm, 133 cd/m2) and 10 increasing intensities of 1 s short wavelength ""blue"" stimuli (456 nm, 0.167 to 167 cd/m2) with a 60 s interstimulus interval, and (2) two minutes of 0.1 Hz red stimuli (33 cd/m2), followed by two minutes of 0.1 Hz blue stimuli (16 cd/m2). For Protocol 1, constriction amplitude and the 6 s post illumination pupil response (PIPR) were calculated. For Protocol 2, amplitudes and peak velocities of pupil constriction and redilation were calculated. For Protocol 1, constriction amplitude and the 6 s PIPR were not significantly different between TBI patients and control subjects for red or blue stimuli. For Protocol 2, pupil constriction amplitude attenuated over time for red stimuli and potentiated over time for blue stimuli across all subjects. Constriction and redilation velocities were similar between groups. Pupil constriction amplitude was significantly less in TBI patients compared to control subjects for red and blue stimuli, which can be attributed to age-related differences in baseline pupil size. While TBI, in addition to age, may have contributed to decreased baseline pupil diameter and constriction amplitude, responses to blue stimulation suggest no selective damage to ipRGCs.","Mostafa, Jakaria; Porter, Jason; Queener, Hope M; Ostrin, Lisa A",Vision Res,618,22
303896,303896,303896,Priority research themes in the fight against the COVID-19 with particular reference to Cameroon,17.163017,5.088944,2020,"BACKGROUND: The large airway epithelial barrier provides one of the first lines of defense against respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Substantial inter-individual variability in individual disease courses is hypothesized to be partially mediated by the differential regulation of the genes that interact with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or are involved in the subsequent host response. Here, we comprehensively investigated non-genetic and genetic factors influencing COVID-19-relevant bronchial epithelial gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing data from bronchial epithelial brushings obtained from uninfected individuals. We related ACE2 gene expression to host and environmental factors in the SPIROMICS cohort of smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and replicated these associations in two asthma cohorts, SARP and MAST. To identify airway biology beyond ACE2 binding that may contribute to increased susceptibility, we used gene set enrichment analyses to determine if gene expression changes indicative of a suppressed airway immune response observed early in SARS-CoV-2 infection are also observed in association with host factors. To identify host genetic variants affecting COVID-19 susceptibility in SPIROMICS, we performed expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping and investigated the phenotypic associations of the eQTL variants. RESULTS: We found that ACE2 expression was higher in relation to active smoking, obesity, and hypertension that are known risk factors of COVID-19 severity, while an association with interferon-related inflammation was driven by the truncated, non-binding ACE2 isoform. We discovered that expression patterns of a suppressed airway immune response to early SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to other viruses, are similar to patterns associated with obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, which may thus contribute to a COVID-19-susceptible airway environment. eQTL mapping identified regulatory variants for genes implicated in COVID-19, some of which had pheWAS evidence for their potential role in respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence that clinically relevant variation in the expression of COVID-19-related genes is associated with host factors, environmental exposures, and likely host genetic variation.","Kasela, Silva; Ortega, Victor E; Martorella, Molly; Garudadri, Suresh; Nguyen, Jenna; Ampleford, Elizabeth; Pasanen, Anu; Nerella, Srilaxmi; Buschur, Kristina L; Barjaktarevic, Igor Z; Barr, R Graham; Bleecker, Eugene R; Bowler, Russell P; Comellas, Alejandro P; Cooper, Christopher B; Couper, David J; Criner, Gerard J; Curtis, Jeffrey L; Han, MeiLan K; Hansel, Nadia N; Hoffman, Eric A; Kaner, Robert J; Krishnan, Jerry A; Martinez, Fernando J; McDonald, Merry-Lynn N; Meyers, Deborah A; Paine, Robert; Peters, Stephen P; Castro, Mario; Denlinger, Loren C; Erzurum, Serpil C; Fahy, John V; Israel, Elliot; Jarjour, Nizar N; Levy, Bruce D; Li, Xingnan; Moore, Wendy C; Wenzel, Sally E; Zein, Joe; Langelier, Charles; Woodruff, Prescott G; Lappalainen, Tuuli; Christenson, Stephanie A",Genome Med,618,16

Computed tomography (CT) is the prime imaging modality for diagnosis of lung infections in COVID-19 patients. Data-driven and Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered solutions for automatic processing of CT images predominantly rely on large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. Owing to privacy and data availability issues, open-access and publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets are difficult to obtain, thus limiting the development of AI-enabled automatic diagnostic solutions. To tackle this problem, large CT image datasets encompassing diverse patterns of lung infections are in high demand. DATA DESCRIPTION: In the present study, we provide an open-source repository containing 1000+ CT images of COVID-19 lung infections established by a team of board-certified radiologists. CT images were acquired from two main general university hospitals in Mashhad, Iran from March 2020 until January 2021. COVID-19 infections were ratified with matching tests including Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and accompanying clinical symptoms. All data are 16-bit grayscale images composed of 512 × 512 pixels and are stored in DICOM standard. Patient privacy is preserved by removing all patient-specific information from image headers. Subsequently, all images corresponding to each patient are compressed and stored in RAR format.","Shakouri, Shokouh; Bakhshali, Mohammad Amin; Layegh, Parvaneh; Kiani, Behzad; Masoumi, Farid; Ataei Nakhaei, Saeedeh; Mostafavi, Sayyed Mostafa",BMC Res Notes,618,0

As coronaviruses cause severe economic losses in the pork industry and swine are key intermediate hosts of human disease outbreaks, we synthetically resurrected a recombinant virus (rSADS-CoV) as well as a derivative encoding tomato red fluorescent protein (tRFP) in place of ORF3. rSADS-CoV replicated efficiently in a variety of continuous animal and primate cell lines, including human liver and rectal carcinoma cell lines. Of concern, rSADS-CoV also replicated efficiently in several different primary human lung cell types, as well as primary human intestinal cells. rSADS-CoV did not use human coronavirus ACE-2, DPP4, or CD13 receptors for docking and entry. Contemporary human donor sera neutralized the group I human coronavirus NL63, but not rSADS-CoV, suggesting limited human group I coronavirus cross protective herd immunity. Importantly, remdesivir, a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog that is effective against other group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, efficiently blocked rSADS-CoV replication in vitro. rSADS-CoV demonstrated little, if any, replicative capacity in either immune-competent or immunodeficient mice, indicating a critical need for improved animal models.

We propose a general probabilistic multi-view forecasting framework CAMul, that can learn representations and uncertainty from diverse data sources. It integrates the knowledge and uncertainty from each data view in a dynamic context-specific manner assigning more importance to useful views to model a well-calibrated forecast distribution.

Our aim was to evaluate the risk of VTE in individuals with severe AATD compared with control subjects from the general population. METHODS: Individuals with severe AATD (n=1577) were recruited from the Swedish national AATD register. Control subjects (n=5969) were selected from the OLIN (Obstructive lung disease in Northern Sweden) studies, that include a random general population sample. Longitudinal data on VTE and diagnoses were obtained from the Swedish National Patient Registry. Associations were analyzed using multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS: At inclusion, 46% of the AATD individuals and 53% of the controls were never-smokers. COPD was present in 46% of the AATD individuals compared with 4% of the controls. During a median follow-up of 18 years, 116 (7%) of the AATD individuals and 89 (1%) of the control subjects developed VTE, unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 6.5 (95% CI, 4.9-8.6). Risk factors for incident VTE were male gender, age, COPD, cancer and liver disease. Adjusting for these factors, the AATD individuals had a significantly higher risk of incident VTE, adjusted HR 4.2 (95% CI 2.9-6.2) as compared with the controls. CONCLUSION: Subjects with severe AATD have considerably increased risk of developing VTE compared with the general population, even after accounting for risk factors. This calls for optimized risk factor management and clinical follow-up of this patient group.","Basil, Nawfal; Ekström, Magnus; Piitulainen, Eeva; Lindberg, Anne; Rönmark, Eva; Jehpsson, Lars; Tanash, Hanan",J. thromb. haemost,618,20

The question is: ""Are ICU (intensive care unit) patients' outcomes related to the degree to which the patients' nurses practice the art of nursing unique to critical care?"" When nurses address patients' basic human needs as opposed to tending solely to tasks, it likely affects the patients' vital signs, need for analgesia or sedation, adverse effects of stress, and short- and long-term outcomes. These factors are often collected in studies of the critically ill. The level of practice reflecting the art of critical care nursing can be an unrecognized confounding variable influencing results. The call for action is ""create a tool to measure and study the effect of the art of nursing unique to the ICU on patient outcomes."" The current COVID crisis has created tremendous visibility and awareness illuminating the role of the nurses and other health care providers. It is quite fitting, as this is also the year of the nurse and the midwife, that we celebrate and articulate much of what is unique to the art of our practice.","Harvey, Maurene A",Dimens Crit Care Nurs,618,24

The parent model detected the presence of high levels of disorder at the outer shell in viruses, for which vaccines are not available. Another model found correlations between inner shell disorder and viral virulence. A third model was able to positively correlate the levels of respiratory transmission of coronaviruses (CoVs). These models are linked together by the fact that they have uncovered two novel immune evading strategies employed by the various viruses. The first involve the use of highly disordered ""shape-shifting"" outer shell to prevent antibodies from binding tightly to the virus thus leading to vaccine failure. The second usually involves a more disordered inner shell that provides for more efficient binding in the rapid replication of viral particles before any host immune response. This ""Trojan horse"" immune evasion often backfires on the virus, when the viral load becomes too great at a vital organ, which leads to death of the host. Just as such virulence entails the viral load to exceed at a vital organ, a minimal viral load in the saliva/mucus is necessary for respiratory transmission to be feasible. As for the SARS-CoV-2, no high levels of disorder can be detected at the outer shell membrane (M) protein, but some evidence of correlation between virulence and inner shell (nucleocapsid, N) disorder has been observed. This suggests that not only the development of vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike HIV, HSV and HCV, is feasible but its attenuated vaccine strain can either be found in nature or generated by genetically modifying N.","Goh, Gerard Kian-Meng; Dunker, A Keith; Foster, James A; Uversky, Vladimir N",Pac Symp Biocomput,618,10

We report our experience in carrying out neurosurgical services at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, during the time of the pandemic. METHODS: To collect information on the effect of the pandemic in Indonesia and Yogyakarta, we gathered data from the Indonesian Ministry of Health's online database for the national data and local government records for the local data (including records of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Division of Neurosurgery). RESULTS: Compared with other countries, Indonesia has not been severely hit by the impact of COVID-19. To increase our understanding of the natural history of the pandemic, we divided the period into 4 phases: phase 1 (when there were confirmed cases in Indonesia but no cases in Yogyakarta), phase 2 (when the first case in Yogyakarta was detected), phase 3 (when the cumulative cases surpass their peak), and phase 4 (when the pandemic ends). At the time of this writing, we were still in phase 2 and in this phase, we experienced a decrease in the number of emergency surgical procedures, from an average of 4 to 2.4 per week. Moreover, the number of elective operations dropped from an average of 12 to 9 per week. CONCLUSIONS: A pandemic, such as COVID-19, reduces both inpatient and outpatient neurosurgical activities.

Yet, the pandemic policy development for rural contexts remains poorly defined. This article draws on reflections of the rural PHC response during the COVID-19 pandemic around three elements: risk, resilience, and response. Rural communities have nuanced risks related to their mobility and interaction patterns coupled with heightened population needs, socio-economic disadvantage, and access and health service infrastructure challenges. This requires specific risk assessment and communication which addresses the local context. Pandemic resilience relies on qualified and stable PHC teams using flexible responses and resources to enable streams of pandemic-related healthcare alongside ongoing primary healthcare. This depends on problem solving within limited resources and using networks and collaborations to enable healthcare for populations spread over large geographic catchments. PHC teams must secure systems for patient retrieval and managing equipment and resources including providing for situations where supply chains may fail and staff need rest. Response consists of rural PHC teams adopting new preventative clinics, screening and ambulatory models to protect health workers from exposure whilst maximizing population screening and continuity of healthcare for vulnerable groups. Innovative models that emerge during pandemics, including telehealth clinics, may bear specific evaluation for informing ongoing rural health system capabilities and patient access. It is imperative that mainstream pandemic policies recognize the nuance of rural settings and address resourcing and support strategies to each level of rural risk, resilience, and response for a strong health system ready for surge events.","O’sullivan, Belinda; Leader, Joelena; Couch, Danielle; Purnell, James",Risk Manage.

One-hundred and forty-six undergraduate students completed a survey shortly after their university transitioned from conducting course in-person to fully online. Questions assessed students' perceptions of their changes in affect, attention, and time perception relative to the time before the announcement of SARS-CoV-2 prevention measures. Students reported significant increases in school-related anxiety and nonproductive attention-related behaviors (e.g., mindless tech use), while reporting significant decreases in motivation, productive attention-related behaviors (e.g., ability to focus), and their ability to keep track of time. We also examined relations between students' pre-pandemic-intervention traits (i.e., in attention failures, self-control, and stress) and pandemic-related change responses, and found (among other correlations) that prepandemic reports of poorer attentional and self-control were correlated with perceived decreases in abilities to track time.

While it was initially considered primarily a respiratory illness, rapidly accumulating data suggests that COVID-19 results in a unique, profoundly prothrombotic milieu leading to both arterial and venous thrombosis. Consistently, elevated D-dimer level has emerged as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes, including death. Several other laboratory markers and blood counts have also been associated with poor prognosis, possibly due to their connection to thrombosis. At present, the pathophysiology underlying the hypercoagulable state is poorly understood. However, a growing body of data suggests that the initial events occur in the lung. A severe inflammatory response, originating in the alveoli, triggers a dysfunctional cascade of inflammatory thrombosis in the pulmonary vasculature, leading to a state of local coagulopathy. This is followed, in patients with more severe disease, by a generalized hypercoagulable state that results in macro- and microvascular thrombosis. Of concern, is the observation that anticoagulation may be inadequate in many circumstances, highlighting the need for alternative or additional therapies. Numerous ongoing studies investigating the pathophysiology of the COVID-19 associated coagulopathy may provide mechanistic insights that can direct appropriate interventional strategies.","Abou-Ismail, Mouhamed Yazan; Diamond, Akiva; Kapoor, Sargam; Arafah, Yasmin; Nayak, Lalitha",Thromb Res,618,16

Remdesivir (RDV) is clinically used drug which targets RdRp, however its mechanism of action remains elusive. This study aims to find out the binding dynamics of active Remdesivir-triphosphate (RDV-TP) to RdRp by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. We built a homology model of RdRp along with RNA and manganese ion using RdRp hepatitis C virus and recent SARS-CoV-2 structures. We determined that the model was stable during the 500 ns MD simulations. We then employed the model to study the binding of RDV-TP to RdRp during three independent 500 ns MD simulations. It was revealed that the interactions of protein and template-primer RNA were dominated by salt bridge interactions with phosphate groups of RNA, while interactions with base pairs of template-primer RNA were minimal. The binding of RDV-TP showed that the position of phosphate groups was at the entry of the NTP channel and it was stabilized by the interactions with K551, R553, and K621, while the adenosine group on RDV-TP was pairing with U2 of the template strand. The manganese ion was located close to D618, D760, and D761, and helps in stabilization of the phosphate groups of RDV-TP. Further we identified three hits from the natural product database that pose similar to RDV-TP while having lower binding energies than that of RDV-TP, and that SN00359915 had binding free energy about three times lower than that of RDV-TP.","Arba, Muhammad; Wahyudi, Setyanto Tri; Brunt, Dylan J; Paradis, Nicholas; Wu, Chun",Comput Biol Med,618,16

While the development of vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are ongoing, government authorities in China have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions as primary barriers to curb the spread of the deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although the decline of COVID-19 cases coincided with the implementation of such interventions, we searched for evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of these interventions, since artifactual factors, such as the environment, the pathogen itself, and the phases of epidemic, may also alter the patterns of case development. METHODS: We surveyed common viral respiratory infections that have a similar pattern of transmission, tropism, and clinical manifestation, as COVID-19 under a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the current pandemic season. We then compared this data with historical data from previous seasons without such interventions. RESULTS: Our survey showed that the rates of common respiratory infections, such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infections, decreased dramatically from 13.7% (95% CI, 10.82-16.58) and 4.64% (95% CI, 2.88-7.64) in previous years to 0.73% (95% CI, 0.02-1.44) and 0.0%, respectively, in the current season. CONCLUSIONS: Our surveillance provides compelling evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions are cost-effective ways to curb the spread of contagious agents, and may represent the only practical approach to limit the evolving epidemic until specific vaccines and pharmaceutical treatments are available.","Yang, Qi; Xiao, Xia; Gu, Xinxia; Liang, Dong; Cao, Ting; Mou, Jun; Huang, Chunxu; Chen, Lei; Liu, Jie",Int J Infect Dis,618,26

Currently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS-CoV-2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.","Lopes, Elisson N; Fonseca, Vagner; Frias, Diego; Tosta, Stephane; Salgado, Álvaro; Assunção Vialle, Ricardo; Paulo Eduardo, Toscano S; Barreto, Fernanda K; Ariston de Azevedo, Vasco; Guarino, Michele; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Junior Alcantara, Luiz C; Giovanetti, Marta",J. med. virol,618,20

Their mean age was 36 years. Overall, 2.2% of the male staff were infected, while 9.3% of the female staff were infected. Among the clinicians, 4.7% were infected; among the nurses, 4.1% were infected. Regarding acquisition, 61.3% of infections (n = 125) were community-acquired and 25.5% (n = 52) were hospital-acquired; no source was identified in 13.2% of cases (n = 27). There was a significant difference between hospital-acquired and community-acquired COVID-19 according to the different HCW categories (p < 0.001), sex (p = 0.041), and being at risk of COVID-19 exposure in the hospital (p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in relation to nationality (p = 0498), age (p = 0.119), or the presence of co-morbidities (p = 0.326). Seventy-eight percent (n = 160) had no chronic diseases and 44% presented with fever and an acute respiratory infection (n = 90); all made an uneventful full recovery. The peak of infection acquisition was after the Eid Al Fitr festival. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs are at an increased risk of COVID-19 in the workplace. The strengthening of infection control measures to prevent exposures from infected patients and colleagues and to reduce the spread of COVID-19 is a necessity.","Al Maskari, Zaina; Al Blushi, Ahlam; Khamis, Faryal; Al Tai, Amal; Al Salmi, Issa; Al Harthi, Hasina; Al Saadi, Muzna; Al Mughairy, Ameera; Gutierrez, Ricky; Al Blushi, Zakariya",Int J Infect Dis,618,0

At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. Methods: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV­2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV­2. Results: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV­2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (nâ¯= 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (nâ¯= 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. Conclusion: The cohort of SARS-CoV­2 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV­2 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.","Klein, A; Edler, C; Fitzek, A; Fröb, D; Heinemann, A; Meißner, K; Mushumba, H; Püschel, K; Schröder, A S; Sperhake, J P; Ishorst-Witte, F; Aepfelbacher, M; Heinrich, F",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),618,9

They are in excellent agreement with the simulations of a kinematic model accounting for stochastic and microhydrodynamic properties and in particular the flagella chirality. Theoretical analysis reveals the scaling laws behind the average rheotactic velocity at moderate shear rates using a chirality parameter and explains the reorientation dynamics leading to a saturation at large shear rates from the marginal stability of a fixed point.

The impact hits the most on microentrepreneurs since they are not able to operate their businesses, of which the margins of profit and resources are relatively small. The purpose of this research was to explore the challenges faced by microentrepreneurs during MCO and their coping strategies used to overcome these challenges. This study utilized the qualitative case study approach and collected interview data among the identified microentrepreneurs that met the criterion sampling. The findings uncover that these microentrepreneurs typically faced challenges related to restricted cash flows, lack of customers and supplies shortage issues which impacted their income and business operations during MCO. These challenges were addressed using coping strategies, namely having the ability to control stress, developing a strong spiritual relationship with God, applying problem solving thinking skills, utilizing social capital (offline and online), and optimizing digital marketing. It is recommended that government agencies, NGOs, and social movement bodies contribute to microentrepreneurs by organising and engaging in digital empowerment programs to enable rural entrepreneurs to leverage on their access to digital commerce, internet marketing and alike.","Tajudin, P.

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is a rare complication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection that may appear at any stage of the disease. In this case, AIDP represents a late presentation of HIV infection. METHODS: Descriptive study. Patient data were collected from their medical records and by health assessment interviews. RESULTS: We report a case of a 52-year-old male with acute lower limb weakness. Given the suggestive clinical presentation of AIDP and a positive HIV test, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered along with antiretroviral therapy. Progressive weakness to the upper limbs, autonomic dysfunction, and pain was observed. The second regimen of IVIG plus corticosteroids was administered. Muscle strength improved after three weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for HIV in a patient with AIDP may provide a better outcome because of the early start of ART with good central nervous system penetration in HIV-infected patients.","Lopes, Mariana; Marques, Patrícia; Silva, Bruno; Cruz, Gonçalo; Serra, José Eduardo; Ferreira, Eugenia; Alves, Helena; da Cunha, José Saraiva",BMC Neurol,618,13

There is a huge pressure on the hospital services and in particular, on the Intensive Care Units (ICU). Describing the need for critical care as well as the chance of being discharged from hospital according to patient characteristics, is essential for a more efficient hospital management. The objective of this study is to describe the probabilities of admission to the ICU and the probabilities of hospital discharge among positive COVID-19 patients according to demographics and comorbidities recorded at hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of all patients with COVID-19 found in the Electronic Medical Records of Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital in Kuwait was conducted. The study included 3995 individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic) of all ages who tested positive from February 24th to May 27th, 2020, out of which 315 were treated in the ICU and 3619 were discharged including those who were transferred to a different healthcare unit without having previously entered the ICU. A competing risk analysis considering two events, namely, ICU admission and hospital discharge using flexible hazard models was performed to describe the association between event-specific probabilities and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Results showed that being male, increasing age and comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and weakened immune system increased the risk of ICU admission within 10 days of entering the hospital. CKD and weakened immune system decreased the probabilities of discharge in both females and males however, the age-related pattern differed by gender. Diabetes, which was the most prevalent comorbid condition, had only a moderate impact on both probabilities (18% overall) in contrast to CKD which had the largest effect, but presented only in 7% of those admitted to ICU and in 1% of those who got discharged. For instance, within 5 days a 50-year-old male had 19% (95% C.I.: [15,23]) probability of entering the ICU if he had none of these comorbidities, yet this risk jumped to 31% (95% C.I.: [20,46]) if he had also CKD, and to 27% in the presence of asthma/COPD (95% C.I.: [19,36]) or of weakened immune system (95% C.I.: [16,42]). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful insight in describing the probabilities of ICU admission and hospital discharge according to age, gender, and comorbidities among confirmed COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. A web-tool is also provided to allow the user to estimate these probabilities for any combination of these covariates. These probabilities enable deeper understanding of the hospital demand according to patient characteristics which is essential to hospital management and useful for developing a vaccination strategy.","Kipourou, Dimitra-Kleio; Leyrat, Clémence; Alsheridah, Nourah; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad H; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Sabah, Salman; Rachet, Bernard; Belot, Aurélien",BMC Public Health,618,16

However, multicentric studies providing a population-based perspective are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicentric study at five hospitals in Northern Portugal, representing 45.1% of all hospitalised patients in this region, between 1 March and 30 June 2020. RESULTS: Among 1261 hospitalised COVID-19 patients, 457 (36.2%) presented neurological manifestations, corresponding to a rate of 357 per 1000 in the North Region. Patients with neurologic manifestations were younger (68.0 vs. 71.2 years, p = 0.002), and the most frequent neurological symptoms were headache (13.4%), delirium (10.1%), and impairment of consciousness (9.7%). Acute well-defined central nervous system (CNS) involvement was found in 19.1% of patients, corresponding to a rate of 217 per 1000 hospitalised patients in the whole region. Assuming that all patients with severe neurological events were hospitalised, we extrapolated our results to all COVID-19 patients in the region, estimating that 116 will have a severe neurological event, corresponding to a rate of nine per 1000 (95% CI = 7-11). Overall case fatality in patients presenting neurological manifestations was 19.8%, increasing to 32.6% among those with acute well-defined CNS involvement. CONCLUSIONS: We characterised the population of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in Northern Portugal and found that neurological symptoms are common and associated with a high degree of disability at discharge. CNS involvement with criteria for in-hospital admission was observed in a significant proportion of patients.

RESULTS: Of 14 healthcare providers, 8 (57%) were women and professions were as follows: 11 (79%) medical doctors, 1 (7%) social worker, 1 (7%) physician assistant and 1 (7%) nurse practitioner. Two aspects of quality emerged: satisfaction and value. Themes within the domain of satisfaction included: responsiveness of the ethics consultant, willingness to consult, institutional role of the ethics service and identifying areas for improvement. When describing value, respondents spoke of the intrapersonal and interpersonal worth of consultation. CONCLUSION: Participants were generally satisfied with ethics consultation services, similar to opinions of those found in pre-COVID-19 survey studies. Our qualitative approach allowed for a richer exploration of the value of ethics consultation during the pandemic and has implications for ethics consultation services more broadly. Ethics consultation-emphasising both the process and outcome-created valuable moral spaces, promoting thoughtful and ethical responses to dilemmas in patient care. Future assessments should incorporate patient and family/surrogate perspectives and explore the domain of education as an additional quality measure.","Kana, Lulia; Shuman, Andrew; De Vries, Raymond; Firn, Janice",J. med. ethics,618,21

METHODS: To be included in this retrospective case series, patients must have had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), fever, ferritin levels >1,000 ng/ml with 1 additional laboratory marker of hyperinflammation, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was defined as requiring 15 liters of supplemental oxygen via a nonrebreather mask combined with 6-liter nasal cannula or use of &#8805;95% oxygen by high-flow nasal cannula. We excluded patients in whom there was suspicion of bacterial infection or who were receiving immunosuppressants. Subcutaneous anakinra was initiated at 100 mg every 6 hours and gradually tapered off completely. The primary outcome was the prevention of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients who met the criteria, 11 patients received anakinra for a maximum of 19 days. Seven of the patients who started anakinra treatment &#8804;36 hours after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure did not require mechanical ventilation, and all were discharged home. Four patients who started anakinra &#8805;4 days after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure required mechanical ventilation. Of those, 3 patients were extubated (2 discharged home and 1 remained hospitalized), and 1 died. All 3 patients who met the criteria but did not receive anakinra required mechanical ventilation. Two patients were extubated (1 discharged home and 1 remained hospitalized), and 1 remained on mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that anakinra could be beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients with evidence of cytokine storm syndrome when initiated early after onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Our patient selection and treatment approach should be considered for investigation in a clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of anakinra in treating patients with COVID-19 and symptoms of cytokine storm syndrome.","Navarro-Millán, Iris; Sattui, Sebastian E; Lakhanpal, Amit; Zisa, Diane; Siegel, Caroline H; Crow, Mary K",Arthritis rheumatol.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three months after the extraction of all mandibular premolars and first molars, two recipient sites were selected. The osteotomies were randomly prepared with either conventional drills (drill sites) or a piezoelectric device (piezoelectric sites). Implants were installed and a submerged healing was allowed. The animals were euthanized in groups of six after 4 and 8 weeks of healing. Biopsies were obtained for histological preparation. Coronal level of osseointegration (bone level) and bone-to-implant contact percentage (BIC%) were evaluated. RESULTS: After 4 weeks of healing, the bone level was 0.6 ± 0.9 mm for the piezoelectric sites and 1.6 ± 0.7 mm for the drill sites (p = 0.173). After 8 weeks, the respective measures were 0.9 ± 0.3 mm and 1.0 ± 1.1 mm (p = 0.917). After 4 weeks of healing, a new bone apposed onto the implant surface was found at fractions of 54.9 ± 6.7% and 55.1 ± 16.6% for the piezoelectric and the drill sites, respectively (p = 0.674). The respective total bone fractions, including new and old bone, was 64.0 ± 4.8% and 63.4 ± 20.4% (p = 0.917). After 8 weeks, a new bone increased to 67.4 ± 6.7% and 62.9 ± 12.5% for the piezoelectric and the drill sites, respectively (p = 0.463). The respective total bone fractions were 70.4 ± 5.5% and 67.8 ± 12.1% (p = 0.753). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a piezoelectric device for implant site preparation is a safe procedure that allows a proper integration since the early periods of healing similar to that observed using conventional drills.","Fujiwara, Shigeo; Kato, Shingo; Bengazi, Franco; Urbizo Velez, Joaquin; Tumedei, Margherita; Kotsu, Mitsuo; Botticelli, Daniele",,618,1

Our interdisciplinary team of applied Human Factors (HF), ethnography, and IPC experts assisted one Unit, normally serving general surgical and orthopedic patients, as it rapidly converted to deliver COVID-19-specific care. This paper describes the conversion experience of the Unit, and outlines broader lessons for other acute care teams faced with similar issues. METHODS: We deployed walkthroughs, simulations, and ethnography to identify important safety gaps in care delivery processes on the Unit. These interventions were undertaken using interdisciplinary theories of implementation that combined systems-level HF perspectives, ethnographic approaches, and individual-level IPC perspectives. Timely recommendations were developed and delivered to Unit staff for feedback and implementation. RESULTS: We describe three interventions on the Unit: 1) the de-cluttering and re-organization of personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) the reconfiguring of designated 'dirty' tray tables and supplies; and 3) the redesign of handling pathways for 'dirty' linens and laundry. Each of these interventions was implemented to varying degrees, but all contributed to discussions of safety and IPC implementation that extended beyond the Unit and into the operations of the broader hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging our team's interdisciplinary expertise and blended approaches to implementation, the interventions assisted in the Unit's rapid conversion towards providing COVID-19-specific care. The deployment and implementation of the interventions highlight the potential of collaboration between HF, ethnography, and IPC experts to support frontline healthcare delivery under pandemic conditions in an effort to minimize nosocomial transmission potential in the acute healthcare setting.","Fadaak, Raad; Davies, Jan M; Blaak, Marlot Johanna; Conly, John; Haslock, Joanne; Kenny, Ashley; Pinto, Nicole; Leslie, Myles",PLoS One,618,21

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the early indirect impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of reproductive, maternal, and newborn health services at government health facilities in South West Ethiopia, and its consequences. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study was employed. The collected data were entered into Microsoft excel 2010 and then exported to SPSS 25 and R3.5.0 software for analysis. Independent sample t-test and two-sample test of proportion were computed, and the results were presented in text, tables, and graphs. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: This study showed that there was a significant reduction in mean utilization of antenatal care (943.25 visits vs 694.75 visits), health facility birth (808.75 births vs 619 births), family planning (4744.5 visits vs 3991.25 visits), and newborn immunization (739.5 given vs 528.5 given) between March-June 2019 and March-June 2020. However, there were significant increases in proportion of teenage pregnancy (7.5% vs 13.1%), teenage abortion care user (21.3% vs 28.5%), institutional stillbirth (14% vs 21.8%) and neonatal death (33.1% vs 46.2%) during the same period. Conclusion and Recommendation: This study showed that utilization of reproductive, maternal, and newborn health-care services was affected by the pandemic with deterioration of maternal and perinatal outcomes. An increase in the proportion of teenage pregnancy who seeks abortion care and the rising cesarean section rate with no improvement in perinatal outcome is a great concern that needs further investigation. Further research is also needed to explore the main reason for an increase in teenage pregnancy, abortion care users, stillbirth, and neonatal death during COVID-19.","Kassie, A.; Wale, A.; Yismaw, W.",International Journal of Women&#039;s Health,618,2

Utilization of the internet has increased dramatically over the last 10 years and in 2016, we added an online seminar. With the emergence of COVID-19 and new rules regarding social distancing, we are currently relying exclusively on web-based orientation. Research suggests there are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of internet health resources in the general population. To our knowledge this has not been studied in regard to the bariatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who attended online (OS) and in-person seminars (IPS). Our primary endpoint was to compare the percentage of patients who underwent surgery. Secondary outcomes included differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the patients who attended the OS versus the IPS. RESULTS: Of the 1152 patients who attended a bariatric orientation, 71.2% scheduled an office visit. The IPS patients had a higher rate of office visits and shorter time between orientation and first visit. Of patients eligible for surgery, there was a higher percentage of Caucasians in the OS group while the IPS group had higher rates of Hispanic and African Americans. Patients from the OS group had higher rates of marriage and employment, and lower rates of medical co-morbidities. When controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment status and medical co-morbidities, there was no significant impact of type of orientation on progression to surgery. CONCLUSION: We found that there was no difference in progression to surgery between the two orientation groups. Importantly, however, we detected marked demographic and clinical differences between the two patient populations. There is an urgent need to address these disparities as we are now heavily relying on patient outreach and education via the internet.","Shapiro, Mia; Leenen, David; Ryder, Beth; Stafford, Todd; Roye, G Dean; Vithiananthan, Siva",Surg. endosc,618,15

It evaluates the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., race/ethnicity and wearing a face mask) and the relationship with mental distress among U.S. adults in March and April 2020, when the pandemic escalated across the country. METHODS: Participants consisted of a probability-based, nationally representative sample of U.S. residents aged &#8805;18 years who completed COVID-19-related surveys online in March and April (n=3,665). Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the probability of a person perceiving COVID-19-associated discrimination. Linear regression was used to analyze the association between discrimination and mental distress. Analyses were conducted in May 2020. RESULTS: Perception of COVID-19-associated discrimination increased from March (4%) to April (10%). Non-Hispanic Black (absolute risk from 0.09 to 0.15 across months) and Asians (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.17) were more likely to perceive discrimination than other racial/ethnic groups (absolute risk from 0.03 to 0.11). Individuals who wore face masks (absolute risk from 0.11 to 0.14) also perceived more discrimination than those who did not (absolute risk from 0.04 to 0.11). Perceiving discrimination was subsequently associated with increased mental distress (from 0.77 to 1.01 points on the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire score). CONCLUSIONS: Perception of COVID-19-associated discrimination was relatively low but increased with time. Perceived discrimination was associated with race/ethnicity and wearing face masks and may contribute to greater mental distress during early stages of the pandemic. The long-term implications of this novel form of discrimination should be monitored.","Liu, Ying; Finch, Brian Karl; Brenneke, Savannah G; Thomas, Kyla; Le, PhuongThao D",Am J Prev Med,618,30

Initially, COVID-19 was thought to only affect respiration. However, accumulating evidence shows a wide range of neurological symptoms are also associated with COVID-19, such as anosmia/ageusia, headaches, seizures, demyelination, mental confusion, delirium, and coma. Neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients may arise due to a cytokine storm and a heighten state of inflammation. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) is a central pathway involved with inflammation and is shown to be elevated in a dose-dependent matter in response to coronaviruses. NF-&#954;B has a role in cytokine storm syndrome, which is associated with greater severity in COVID-19-related symptoms. Therefore, therapeutics that reduce the NF-&#954;B pathway should be considered in the treatment of COVID-19. Neuro-COVID-19 units have been established across the world to examine the neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19.

We report two neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 during the second trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: Two pregnant women had symptomatic COVID-19 in the second trimester. Throat swabs at delivery for SARS-COV-2 RNA were negative for both women and their newborns. The first woman had positive serum IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-COV-2 before delivery. Her newborn had negative IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive on the 7th day after birth. The second woman had negative serum IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive before delivery. Her newborn had negative serum IgM antibody to SARS-COV-2 but IgG was positive at 48 h after birth. None of the neonates developed clinical symptoms of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: SARS-COV-2 is unlikely to be vertically transmitted in utero as evidenced by the specific antibodies in the serum of the two women and their newborns. The two women with SARS-COV-2 infection in the second trimester did not develop serious complications at delivery and outcomes of the neonates were good.","Tang, Jing-Yi; Song, Wen-Qi; Xu, Hao; Wang, Na",Infect Dis (Lond),618,2

Methods201 acute-phase nasopharyngeal samples from SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals were tested with two rRT-PCRs: 1) N2RP assay to confirm SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (CDC N2 target), and 2) the Spike SNP assay to detect mutations in the spike receptor binding domain. The assay was performed with probes to identify mutations associated with the following variants: alpha (501Y), beta/gamma (417variant/484K/501Y), delta (452R/478K), and lambda (452Q/490S). ResultsAll samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the N2RP assay (mean Ct, 20.8; SD 5.6); 198/201 (98.5%) tested positive in the Spike SNP assay. The most common genotype was 417variant/484K/501Y, detected in 102/198 samples (51.5%) and most consistent with P.1 lineage (gamma variant) in Paraguay. No mutations (K417 only) were found in 64/198 (32.3%); and K417/484K was identified in 22/198 (11.1%), consistent with P.2 (zeta). Seven samples (3.5%) tested positive for 452R without 478K, and one sample with genotype K417/501Y was confirmed as B.1.1.7 (alpha). Results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing in 181/181 samples (100%) with high-quality amplicon sequences, and variant calls were consistent with Nanopore sequencing in 29/29 samples. ConclusionsThe Spike SNP assay provides accurate detection of mutations associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants. This can be implemented in laboratories performing rRT-PCR to improve population-level surveillance for these mutations and inform the judicious use of scarce sequencing resources.","Martinez, Magaly; Nguyen, Phuong-Vi; Su, Maxwell; Cardozo, Fatima; Valenzuela, Adriana; Franco, Laura; Galeano, Maria Eugenia; Rojas, Leticia Elizabeth; Acosta, Chyntia Carolina Diaz; Fernandez, Jonas; Ortiz, Joel; Puerto, Florencia del; Mendoza, Laura; Nara, Eva; Rojas, Alejandra; Waggoner, Jesse",,618,24

We showed that proliferative CD8 effector T cells with declined immune functions and cytotoxicity accumulated in the critical stage. By contrast, the quantity of natural killer (NK) cells was significantly reduced, while they exhibited enhanced immune activities. Notably, a gradually attenuated responseto COVID-19 along with disease severity was observed in monocytes, in terms of cellular composition, transcriptional discrepancy and transcription factor regulatory network. Furthermore, we identified immune cell-type dependent cytokine signatures distinguishing the severity of COVID-19 patients. In addition, cell interactions between CD8 effector T/NK cells and monocytes mediated by inflammatory cytokines were enhanced in moderate and severe stages, but weakened in critical cases. Collectively, our work uncovers the cellular and molecular players underlying the disordered and heterogeneous immune responses associated with COVID-19 severity, which could provide valuable insights for the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients.","Xie, Xiaowei; Cheng, Xuelian; Wang, Gaoxiang; Zhang, Biao; Liu, Mengyao; Chen, Liting; Cheng, Hui; Hao, Sha; Zhou, Jianfeng; Zhu, Ping; Cheng, Tao","Sci.

METHODS: Data from STEMI patients presenting to Fuwai Hospital from January 23 to April 30, 2020 were compared with those during the equivalent period in 2019. The primary end-point was net adverse clinical events (NACE; a composite of death, non-fatal myocardial reinfarction, stroke, emergency revascularization, and bleeding over BARC type 3). The secondary outcome was a composite of recurrent ischaemia, cardiogenic shock, and exacerbated heart failure. RESULTS: The final analysis included 164 acute STEMI patients from 2020 and 240 from 2019. Eighteen patients (20.2% of those with indications) received fibrinolysis therapy in 2020 with a median door-to-needle time of 60.0 (43.5, 92.0) minutes. Patients in 2020 underwent primary PCI less frequently than their counterparts (14 [14.2%] vs. 144 [86.8%] in 2019, Pâ¯<â¯0.001), and had a longer median door-to-balloon time (175 [121,213] minutes vs. 115 [83, 160] minutes in 2019, Pâ¯=â¯0.009). Patients were more likely to undergo elective PCI (86 [52.4%] vs. 28 [11.6%] in 2019, Pâ¯<â¯0.001).

Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

Before COVID-19, millions of Americans lacked access to mental health resources, and now in the midst of a global pandemic, resources are more limited in times of greater need. In March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided funding for mental health reforms; yet many barriers remained to receiving sufficient care. In February 2021, the Society of Behavioral Medicine recommended federal legislators expand Community Behavioral Healthcare Centers, increase funding for Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers and School Based Health Centers, incentivize providers to accept Medicaid, and institute more statewide licensing flexibilities to expand the reach of mental health care. In March 2021, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law and provided an additional ~$4 billion in funding for community mental health services, implementing substance abuse prevention and treatment programs, increasing the behavioral health workforce, promoting behavioral telehealth within primary care, increasing school-based mental health services, implementing suicide prevention programs, and improving services for traumatized families. This significant investment in parents and children's mental health is a tremendous step in the right direction and provides reassurance that relief is underway.

Epidemiologic studies revealed that populations have different vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2. Severe outcomes of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with an increased risk of death are observed in patients with metabolic syndrome, as well as diabetic and heart conditions (frail population). Excessive proinflammatory cytokine storm could be the main cause of increased vulnerability in this frail population. In patients with diabetes and/or heart disease, a low inflammatory state is often associated with gut dysbiosis. The increase amount of microbial metabolites (i.e., trimethylamine N-oxide and lipopolysaccharide), which generate an inflammatory microenvironment, is probably associated with an improved risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Nutritional interventions aimed at restoring the gut microbial balance could represent preventive strategies to protect the frail population from COVID-19. This narrative review presents the possible molecular mechanisms by which intestinal dysbiosis that enhances the inflammatory state could promote the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This paper argues, drawing from international cooperation theory, that China and Africa can cooperate in implementing BRI despite the apparent conflict in their infrastructure connectivity aspirations. They can coordinate their policies for the purpose of mutual benefit through enhanced connectivity and trade between Africa and China on the one hand and deepened African regional integration and intra-African trade on the other. This could be achieved by using Africa’s regional programmes as building blocks for cooperation in BRI.

However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference. We anticipate that HVIDB will serve as a one-stop knowledge base to further guide hypothesis-driven experimental efforts to investigate human-virus relationships.","Yang, Xiaodi; Lian, Xianyi; Fu, Chen; Wuchty, Stefan; Yang, Shiping; Zhang, Ziding",Brief Bioinform,618,16

Here, the emerging porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) strain, isolated from Shanghai, China, broadly infects porcine, human and chicken cells in vitro. Previously studies by our group and others have confirmed that PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein performs an important role in antagonizing retinoic acid-induced gene I-like receptor (RLR) activation. However, the mechanism of PDCoV N protein suppressing porcine type I IFN production remains unclear, especially the downstream of porcine RLR signaling pathway. In the present study, porcine IRF7 (poIRF7) was identified as the interaction protein of PDCoV N protein through LC-MS/MS. The poIRF7 (268-487aa) was the key region of binding PDCoV N protein. Although IRF7 is a conserved functional protein in species, the PDCoV N protein has been confirmed to interact with only poIRF7 and significantly decrease poIRF7-induced type I IFN production, but not human or chicken IRF7. Furthermore, PDCoV N protein can promote poIRF7 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which directly increased the K6, K11, and K29-linked polyubiquitination of poIRF7. Lysine 359 of poIRF7 was a key site in PDCoV N protein inducing poIRF7 degradation. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism that PDCoV N protein could species-specifically interact with poIRF7 and then promote its degradation to suppress porcine type I IFN production. The novel findings provide a new insight into PDCoV and other zoonotic coronavirus evading the innate immune response of different species.","Ji, Likai; Wang, Na; Ma, Jingjiao; Cheng, Yuqiang; Wang, Hengan; Sun, Jianhe; Yan, Yaxian",Vet Microbiol,618,16

The general form of influence function differs from the commonly adapted exponential delaying function over time, and more importantly, in our model, we can learn the delayed influence of prior events, which is an aspect seemingly largely ignored in prior literature. Prior knowledge or assumptions on the influence function are incorporated into our framework by allowing general convex constraints on the parameters specifying the influence function.

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that both the central and peripheral nervous systems can be affected by SARS-CoV-2, including stroke. We present three cases of arterial ischemic strokes and one venous infarction from a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in the setting of COVID-19 infection who otherwise had low risk factors for stroke. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients presenting to a large tertiary care academic US hospital with stroke and who tested positive for COVID-19. Medical records were reviewed for demographics, imaging results and lab findings. RESULTS: There were 3 cases of arterial ischemic strokes and 1 case of venous stroke: 3 males and 1 female. The mean age was 55 (48-70) years. All arterial strokes presented with large vessel occlusions and had mechanical thrombectomy performed. Two cases presented with stroke despite being on full anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to recognize the neurological manifestations of COVID-19, especially ischemic stroke, either arterial or venous in nature. Hypercoagulability and the cytokine surge are perhaps the cause of ischemic stroke in these patients. Further studies are needed to understand the role of anticoagulation in these patients.","Kananeh, Mohammed F; Thomas, Tijo; Sharma, Kumud; Herpich, Franziska; Urtecho, Jacqueline; Athar, M Kamran; Jabbour, Pascal; Shah, Syed Omar",J Clin Neurosci,618,1

Our results show that immunological and microbiological responses are highly localized. Relative to diseased samples, apparently healthy portions of cMWS corals differed in immune activity and in the relative abundance of microbial taxa. Coral tissues with cMWS showed decreased tyrosinase-type catecholase and tyrosinase-type cresolase activity and increased laccase-type activity. Catecholase and cresolase activity were negatively correlated across all tissue types with microbiome richness. The localized effect of cMWS on coral microbiology and immunology is likely an important reason for the slow progression of the disease. This local confinement may facilitate interventions that focus on localized treatments on tissue types. This study provides an important baseline to understand the interplay between the microbiome and immune system and the mechanisms used by corals to manage chronic microbial perturbations associated with white syndrome.","Brown, Tanya; Sonett, Dylan; Zaneveld, Jesse R; Padilla-Gamiño, Jaqueline L",Mol. ecol,618,29

Here, we suggest a previously unidentified method for xenogenizing (turning self to non-self) tumors by using fusogenic exosomes to introduce fusogenic viral antigens (VSV-G) onto the tumor cell surface. We found that xenogenized tumor cells were readily recognized and engulfed by dendritic cells; thereby, tumor antigens were efficiently presented to T lymphocytes. Moreover, exosome-VSV-G itself acts as a TLR4 agonist and stimulates the maturation of dendritic cells, leading to CD8+ T cell cross-priming. The administration of these exosomes in multiple tumor mouse models xenogenized tumor cells, resulting in tumor growth inhibition. The combinatorial treatment with anti-PD-L1 exhibited complete tumor regression (30%) and better long-term overall survival. These results suggest that tumor xenogenization by fusogenic exosomes provides a previously unidentified novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.","Kim, Gi Beom; Nam, Gi-Hoon; Hong, Yeonsun; Woo, Jiwan; Cho, Yakdol; Kwon, Ick Chan; Yang, Yoosoo; Kim, In-San",Sci.

So far, there is scarce evidence for the current treatment options available for COVID-19. Vitamin C has previously been used for treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. We reviewed the feasibility of using vitamin C in the setting of COVID-19 in a series of patients. METHODS: We sequentially identified a series of patients who were requiring at least 30% of FiO2 or more who received IV vitamin C as part of the COVID-19 treatment and analyzed their demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared inflammatory markers pre and post treatment including D-dimer and ferritin. RESULTS: We identified a total of 17 patients who received IV vitamin C for COVID-19. The inpatient mortality rate in this series was 12% with 17.6% rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation. We noted a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, and a trend to decreasing FiO2 requirements, after vitamin C administration. CONCLUSION: The use of IV vitamin C in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease may be feasible.","Hiedra, Raul; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Elbashabsheh, Mohammad; Gul, Fahad; Wright, Robert Matthew; Albano, Jeri; Azmaiparashvili, Zurab; Patarroyo Aponte, Gabriel",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,618,24

Methods: We are reporting experience of 24 laparoscopic surgeries using a closed smoke evacuation/filtration system using a ultra low-particulate air (ULPA) filtration capability (ConMed AirSeal® System) at a single center between March 22, 2020, and May 30, 2020. All surgeries were either urgent or emergency in nature. Results: Totally, 17 males and 7 females who required urgent surgery. Most common indication for laparoscopic intervention was acute cholecystitis and complications related to acute cholecystitis. Owing to the closed smoke evacuation system, low intra-abdominal pressure was maintained during all surgeries. Of all procedures, only 0.8 time per procedure, the laparoscope taken out for cleaning. Mean time for completion of surgery was 58 minutes. Compliance of surgical staff was high due to the deemed safe smoke evacuation system. Mean of postoperative pain score was low. Mean hospital stay was 4.9 days. Conclusions: We propose to use a closed smoke evacuation/filtration system with ULPA filtration capability or similar devices in each minimally invasive surgery to reduce risks of transmission as minute as possible until we have enough knowledge about the pattern of disease transmission.","Vaishnav, Dhaivat; Patel, Bhavin","J. laparoendosc. adv. surg. tech., Part A",618,20

COVID-19 infected case records and meteorological data in four cities (Wuhan, Beijing, Urumqi and Dalian) in China were collected. Then, the best-fitting model of COVID-19 infected cases was selected from four statistic models (Gaussian, logistic, lognormal distribution and allometric models), and the relationship between meteorological factors and COVID-19 infected cases was analyzed using multiple stepwise regression and Pearson correlation. The results showed that the lognormal distribution model was well adapted to describing the change of COVID-19 infected cases compared with other models (R2 > 0.78; p-values < 0.001). Under the condition of implementing community-based pandemic prevention and control, relationship between COVID-19 infected cases and meteorological factors differed among the four cities. Temperature and relative humidity were mainly the driving factors on COVID-19 transmission, but their relations obviously varied with season and geographical location. In summer, the increase in relative humidity and the decrease in maximum temperature facilitate COVID-19 transmission in arid inland cities, while at this point the decrease in relative humidity is good for the spread of COVID-19 in coastal cities. For the humid cities, the reduction of relative humidity and the lowest temperature in the winter promote COVID-19 transmission.","Yang, Xiao-Dong; Li, Hong-Li; Cao, Yue-E",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,1

With no clinically approved drugs, the global health system is struggling to find an effective treatment measure. At this crucial juncture, screening of plant-derived compounds may be an effective strategy to combat COVID-19. The present study investigated the binding affinity of phytocompounds with 3-Chymotrypsin-like (3CLpro) and Papain-like proteases (PLpro) of SARS-CoV2 using in-silico techniques. A total of 32 anti-protease phytocompounds were investigated for the binding affinity to the proteins. Docking was performed in Autodock Vina. Pharmacophore descriptors of best ligands were studied using LigandScout. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of apo-protein and ligand-bound complexes was carried out in YASARA software. The druglikeness properties of phytocompounds were studied using ADMETlab. Out of 32 phytochemicals, amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate showed the best binding affinity to 3CLpro (-9.4 kcal/mol) and PLpro (-8.8 kcal/mol). Phytochemicals such as savinin, theaflavin-3,3-digallate, and kazinol-A also showed strong affinity. MD simulation revealed ligand-induced conformational changes in the protein with decreased surface area and higher stability. The RMSD/F of proteins and ligands showed stability of the protein suggesting the effective binding of the ligand in both the proteins. Both amentoflavone and gallocatechin gallate possess promising druglikeness property. The present study thus suggests that Amentoflavone and Gallocatechin gallate may be potential inhibitors of 3CLpro and PLpro proteins and effective drug candidates for SARS-CoV2. However, the findings of in silico study need to be supported by in vivo studies to establish the exact mode of action. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Anogenital psoriasis has been associated with significant quality of life impairments, but little is known about specific patient needs/treatment goals. This study aimed to examine the overall and sex-related disease burden, patient needs and treatment benefits in patients with anogenital psoriasis, compared to patients with psoriasis not affecting the anal/genital areas. Within the cross-sectional nationwide survey, 2,009 participants were consecutively recruited in 157 randomly assigned German dermatology practices and clinics, according to the following inclusion criteria aged 18 years or over; diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris; ability to answer the questionnaires; and written informed consent. Based on a high-resolution grid on the topical distribution of psoriasis, two groups were formed: anogenital psoriasis (n = 622) and comparison group (n = 1,303). Clinical severity was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients completed the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Patient Benefit Index (PBI). Patients with anogenital psoriasis had higher PASI (13.0±10.6 vs. 8.9±7.6, P < 0.001) and more DLQI impairments (8.9±6.9 vs. 7.0±6.2, P = 0.002) than controls. At the item-level, they also reported more sex-related DLQI impairments (DLQI-i9: 0.5±0.8 vs. 0.3±0.7, P < 0.001) and treatment needs (PBI-i17: 2.2±1.8 vs. 1.9±1.8, P = 0.001). A great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses was found for sex-related items (23.3-41.9%). These results suggest that the assessment of sex-related impairments and treatment needs should be prioritised in patients with anogenital psoriasis. Questionnaires may be used as a less uncomfortable way for patients to discuss their genital lesions and sexual function during healthcare visits. However, the great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses to sex-related items calls for in-depth assessments and effective patient-physician communication regarding these sensitive topics.","da Silva, Neuza; Augustin, Matthias; Langenbruch, Anna; Mrowietz, Ulrich; Reich, Kristian; Thaçi, Diamant; Boehncke, Wolf-Henning; Kirsten, Natalia; Danckworth, Alexandra; Sommer, Rachel",PLoS One,618,16

We have developed a novel bioluminescence-based biosensor to probe a key host-virus interaction during viral entry: the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Derived from Nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT), the biosensor is composed of Nanoluciferase split into two complementary subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the Spike S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. The ACE2-S1 interaction results in reassembly of functional Nanoluciferase, which catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction that can be assayed in a highly sensitive and specific manner. We demonstrate the biosensor's large dynamic range, enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. In addition, we show the biosensor's versatility towards the high-throughput screening of drugs which disrupt the ACE2-S1 interaction, as well as its ability to act as a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Results obtained with our biosensor correlate well with those obtained with a Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus assay.

We are already facing a ""second wave"" of infections and we might be dealing during the next months with a ""third wave"" and subsequently new waves. Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for ""hot"" or presumed ""hot"" patients and ""cold"" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein binds to cell surface angiotensin converting enzyme type-II (ACE2) to initiate viral attachment and ultimately viral pathogenesis. The SARS-CoV-2 S RBD is a major target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) that block RBD - ACE2 interactions. In this report, NAb-RBD binding epitopes in the protein databank were classified as C1, C1D, C2, C3, or C4, using a RBD binding profile (BP), based on NAb-specific RBD buried surface area and used to predict the binding epitopes of a series of uncharacterized NAbs. Naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 RBD sequence variation was also quantified to predict NAb binding sensitivities to the RBD-variants. NAb and ACE2 binding studies confirmed the NAb classifications and determined whether the RBD variants enhanced ACE2 binding to promote viral infectivity, and/or disrupted NAb binding to evade the host immune response. Of 9 single RBD mutants evaluated, K417T, E484K, and N501Y disrupted binding of 65% of the NAbs evaluated, consistent with the assignment of the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 Japan/Brazil strain as a variant of concern (VoC). RBD variants E484K and N501Y exhibited ACE2 binding equivalent to a Wuhan-1 reference SARS-CoV-2 RBD. While slightly less disruptive to NAb binding, L452R enhanced ACE2 binding affinity. Thus, the L452R mutant, associated with the SARS-CoV-2 California VoC (B.1.427/B.1.429-California), has evolved to enhance ACE2 binding, while simultaneously disrupting C1 and C2 NAb classes. The analysis also identified a non-overlapping antibody pair (1213H7 and 1215D1) that bound to all SARS-CoV-2 RBD variants evaluated, representing an excellent therapeutic option for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 WT and VoC strains.","Deshpande, Ashlesha; Harris, Bethany D; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; Kobie, James J; Walter, Mark R",Front Immunol,618,1

Health care providers are overwhelmed, resulting in clinical teams spread more thinly. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing an app-based remote patient monitoring system (Huma Therapeutics) on a clinician's workload in the context of a COVID-19-specific virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. METHODS: A prospective feasibility study was carried out over 1 month where clinician workload was monitored, and full-time equivalents savings were determined. An NHS hospital repurposed a telephone-based respiratory virtual ward for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 in the amber zone (according to the National Health Service definition) were monitored for 14 days postdischarge to help identify deteriorating patients earlier. A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). RESULTS: In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). Digital remote patient monitoring resulted in a reduction in the number of phone calls from a mean total of 9 calls to 4 calls over the monitoring period. There was no change in the mean duration of phone calls (8.5 minutes) and no reports of readmission or mortality. These results equate to a mean saving of 47.60 working hours. Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data. Individual clinicians spent an average of 10.9 minutes per day reviewing data. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone-based remote patient monitoring technologies may offer tangible reductions in clinician workload at a time when service is severely strained. In this small-scale pilot study, we demonstrated the economic and operational impact that digital remote patient monitoring technology can have in improving working efficiency and reducing operational costs. Although this particular RPM solution was deployed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it may set a precedent for wider utilization of digital, remote patient monitoring solutions in other clinical scenarios where increased care delivery efficiency is sought.","Shah, Sachin Shailendra; Gvozdanovic, Andrew; Knight, Matthew; Gagnon, Julien",JMIR Form Res,618,28

Few information, dated back to almost two decades ago, exist as to whether a gluten-free diet (GFD) could reduce the islet-specific autoimmunity detected in patients at CD diagnosis. Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of GFD on 31 patients who presented islet-specific autoimmunity at CD diagnosis. METHODS: CD patient sera collected at diagnosis and throughout the GFD were analyzed for the main humoral autoantibodies so far identified in T1D, directed against one or more among insulin, glutamic-acid decarboxylase, tyrosine-phosphatase 2 and zinc cation-efflux transporter autoantigens. RESULTS: GFD (median duration 39 months) was associated to a decrease or disappearance of the islet-specific autoantibodies in 71% of CD patients. Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for &#8805;2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.

An 18.3 m flight tunnel was constructed in second growth rain forest using a concrete structure as a frame and large tarps to enclose the perimeter, leaving one end open. Bats were caught using mist nets in areas of both mature and second growth rain forest and disturbed habitats. Bats were moved to the tunnel area where morphological measurements were recorded and each bat was photographed with the wing extended. Wing area and wing span were measured using the program ImageJ. These data in combination with other morphological measurements were used to calculate aspect ratio and wing loading, which were each compared to flight speed. To measure flight speed, a bat was released in the flight tunnel and times were recorded at 6.1 m, 12.2 m, and 18.3 m. The findings reveal that flight speed shows little relation to aspect ratio, with the exception of Tadarida brasiliensis, and that flight speed increases as a function of wing loading. The comparison of aspect ratio to relative wing loading demonstrates strong ecomorphological segregation based on foraging mode.","Hixon, Sarah; Brooks, Ashley; Miculka, Brian; Richmond, Christine; Warrendorf, Diana; Whitmire, Amanda; Wilkins, Bethany; E.

Assuming increases to screening capacity are unrealistic, we propose two recovery strategies: one extends the screening interval by 6 months for all and the other extends the interval by 36/60 months, but only for women who have already missed being screened. METHODS: Using routine statistics from England we estimate the number of women affected by delays to screening. We used published research to estimate the proportion of screening age women with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and progression rates to cancer. Under two recovery scenarios, we estimate the impact of COVID-19 on cervical cancer over one screening cycle (3 years at ages 25-49 and 5 years at ages 50-64 years). The duration of disruption in both scenarios is 6 months. In the first scenario, 10.7 million women have their screening interval extended by 6 months. In the second, 1.5 million women (those due to be screened during the disruption) miss one screening cycle, but most women have no delay. RESULTS: Both scenarios result in similar numbers of excess cervical cancers: 630 vs. 632 (both 4.3 per 100,000 women in the population). However, the scenario in which some women miss one screening cycle creates inequalities-they would have much higher rates of excess cancer: 41.5 per 100,000 delayed for screened women compared to those with a 6-month delay (5.9 per 100,000). CONCLUSION: To ensure equity for those affected by COVID-19 related screening delays additional screening capacity will need to be paired with prioritising the screening of overdue women.","Castanon, Alejandra; Rebolj, Matejka; Pesola, Francesca; Sasieni, Peter",Br J Cancer,618,16

As such, there has been significant research into all aspects of the disease, including diagnostic biomarkers, associated risk factors, and strategies that might be used for its treatment and prevention. Toward this end, eosinopenia has been identified as one of many factors that might facilitate the diagnosis and prognosis of severe COVID-19. However, this finding is neither definitive nor pathognomonic for COVID-19. While eosinophil-associated conditions have been misdiagnosed as COVID-19 and others are among its reported complications, patients with pre-existing eosinophil-associated disorders (e.g., asthma, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders) do not appear to be at increased risk for severe disease; interestingly, several recent studies suggest that a diagnosis of asthma may be associated with some degree of protection. Finally, although vaccine-associated aberrant inflammatory responses, including eosinophil accumulation in the respiratory tract, were observed in preclinical immunization studies targeting the related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, no similar complications have been reported clinically in response to the widespread dissemination of either of the two encapsulated mRNA-based vaccines for COVID-19.","Rosenberg, Helene F; Foster, Paul S",Semin. immunopathol,618,19

People infected with this highly contagious virus can present with clinically inapparent, mild, or severe disease. Currently, the virus infection in individuals and at the population level is being monitored by PCR testing of symptomatic patients for the presence of viral RNA. There is an urgent need for SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests to identify all infected individuals, irrespective of clinical symptoms, to conduct surveillance and implement strategies to contain spread. As the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is poorly conserved between SARS-CoVs and other pathogenic human coronaviruses, the RBD represents a promising antigen for detecting CoV-specific antibodies in people. Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD's performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. By day 9 after the onset of symptoms, the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigen was highly sensitive (98%) and specific (100%) for antibodies induced by SARS-CoVs. We observed a strong correlation between levels of RBD binding antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in patients. Our results, which reveal the early kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, support using the RBD antigen in serological diagnostic assays and RBD-specific antibody levels as a correlate of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in people.","Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Segovia-Chumbez, Bruno; Jadi, Ramesh; Martinez, David R; Raut, Rajendra; Markmann, Alena; Cornaby, Caleb; Bartelt, Luther; Weiss, Susan; Park, Yara; Edwards, Caitlin E; Weimer, Eric; Scherer, Erin M; Rouphael, Nadine; Edupuganti, Srilatha; Weiskopf, Daniela; Tse, Longping V; Hou, Yixuan J; Margolis, David; Sette, Alessandro; Collins, Matthew H; Schmitz, John; Baric, Ralph S; de Silva, Aravinda M",Sci. immunol,618,14

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning video compression architecture that does not require motion estimation, which is the most expensive element of modern hybrid video compression codecs like H.264 and HEVC. Our framework exploits the regularities inherent to video motion, which we capture by using displaced frame differences as video representations to train the neural network. In addition, we propose a new space-time reconstruction network based on both an LSTM model and a UNet model, which we call LSTM-UNet. The combined network is able to efficiently capture both temporal and spatial video information, making it highly amenable for our purposes. The new video compression framework has three components: a Displacement Calculation Unit (DCU), a Displacement Compression Network (DCN), and a Frame Reconstruction Network (FRN), all of which are jointly optimized against a single perceptual loss function. The DCU obviates the need for motion estimation as in hybrid codecs, and is less expensive. In the DCN, an RNN-based network is utilized to conduct variable bit-rate encoding based on a single round of training. The LSTM-UNet is used in the FRN to learn space time differential representations of videos. Our experimental results show that our compression model, which we call the MOtionless VIdeo Codec (MOVI-Codec), learns how to efficiently compress videos without computing motion. Our experiments show that MOVI-Codec outperforms the video coding standard H.264, and is highly competitive with, and sometimes exceeds the performance of the modern global standard HEVC codec, as measured by MS-SSIM.","Chen, Meixu; Goodall, Todd; Patney, Anjul; Bovik, Alan C.",,618,16

For the first problem increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve ODC) is of advantage, for the 2nd, however, the contrary is the case. Indeed a right shift of the ODC has been found in former studies for anemia caused by reduced cell production or hemolysis. This resulted from increased 2,3-biphosphglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentration. In 3 investigations in COVID-19, however, no change of hemoglobin affinity was detected in spite of probably high [2,3-BPG]. The most plausible cause for this finding is formation of methemoglobin, which increases the oxygen affinity and thus apparently compensates for the 2,3-BPG effect. But this ""useful effect"" is cancelled by the concomitant reduction of functional hemoglobin. In the largest study on COVID-19 even a clear left shift of the ODC was detected when calculated from measurements in fresh blood rather than after equilibration with gases outside the body. This additional ""in vivo"" left shift possibly results from various factors (e. g. concentration changes of Cl-, 2,3-BPG, ATP, lactate, nitrocompounds, glutathione, glutamate, because of time delay between blood sampling and end of equilibration, or enlarged distribution space including interstitial fluid and is useful for O2 uptake in the lungs. Under discussion for therapy are the affinity-increasing 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (5-HMF), erythropoiesis stimulating substances like erythropoietin, and methylene blue against MetHb formation.","Böning, Dieter; Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Bloch, Wilhelm","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",618,20

Unfortunately, severe illness (eg, respiratory failure, compromised cardiac function, and shock) incurred by COVID-19 hinders the direct study of catecholamines in these patients, especially among those on multiple medications or those on adrenaline or noradrenaline infusions, or both. Phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) are tumours that secrete catecholamines, namely adrenaline and noradrenaline, often in excess. PPGL are well studied disease processes in which the effects of catecholamines are easily discernible and therefore their potential biochemical and physiological influences in patients with COVID-19 can be explored. Because catecholamines are expected to have a role in patients with critical illness, patients on vasopressor infusions, and patients who sustain some acute and chronic physical stresses, the challenges involved in the management of catecholamine excess states are directly relevant to the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In this Personal View, we discuss the complex interplay between catecholamines and COVID-19, and the management of catecholamine excess states, while referencing relevant insights derived from the study of PPGL.","Gubbi, Sriram; Nazari, Matthew A; Taieb, David; Klubo-Gwiezdzinska, Joanna; Pacak, Karel",Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol,618,21

DESIGN/SETTING: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019-February 2020) versus after (April 2020) lockdown. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 20 558 adults (&#8805; 16 years). MEASUREMENTS: The independent variable was the timing of the COVID-19 lockdown (before versus after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking, past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers), past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers) and use of evidence-based (e.g. prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support [telephone support/websites/applications (apps)] for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). FINDINGS: The COVID-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence [17.0% (after) versus 15.9% (before), odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.95-1.24], but was associated with increases in quit attempts [39.6 versus 29.1%, adjusted odds ratio (ORadj ) = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.23-1.98], quit success (21.3 versus 13.9%, ORadj = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22-3.33) and cessation (8.8 versus 4.1%, ORadj = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.69-4.09) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0 versus 51.5%, ORadj = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.72-1.68) but use of remote support increased (10.9 versus 2.7%, ORadj = 3.59, 95% CI = 1.56-8.23). Lockdown was associated with increases in high-risk drinking (38.3 versus 25.1%, OR = 1.85, CI = 1.67-2.06), but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5 versus 15.3%, ORadj = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.77-2.64). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2 versus 4.0%, ORadj = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.05-0.97) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9 versus 6.1%, ORadj = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.64-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Following the March 2020 COVID-19 lockdown, smokers and high-risk drinkers in England were more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce alcohol consumption and rates of smoking cessation and use of remote cessation support were higher. However, high-risk drinking prevalence increased post-lockdown and use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers decreased with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.","Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",Addiction,618,1

Controlling for air-pollution, rainfall, temperature, demographic factors that measure population density, the proportion of the elderly, and health infrastructure including per capita health spending and the proportion of respiratory cases, does not diminish the predictive power of BMI in influencing the spatial incidence and spread of the virus.

We find that among women, BMI proxies for a range of comorbidities (hemoglobin, high blood pressure and high glucose levels) that affects the severity of the virus while among men, these health indicators are also important, as is exposure to risk of contracting the virus as measured by work propensities.

A few psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce anxiety and depression, emotional distress, consumption of analgesics, and extubation time have been found effective, with low to moderate evidence quality. Many different psychological interventions have proved useful in clinical practice, including multimodal, multiprofessional interventions incorporating medications, education, sports, and exercise as well as psychosocial therapy including stress management. Individual psychotherapy during the period of acute inpatient treatment after myocardial infarction is also effective. CONCLUSION: Because psychosocial factors are important, the current guidelines recommend systematic screening for mental symptoms and comorbidities in advance of heart transplantation or the implantation of ventricular assist devices (VAD). Acute psychotherapeutic interventions to reduce mental symptoms can be offered in the perioperative setting.","Tigges-Limmer, Katharina; Sitzer, Matthias; Gummert, Jan",Dtsch Arztebl Int,618,1

(preprint),17.212639,5.1111426,2021,"We aim to assess physicians' level of resilience and define factors that improve or decrease the resilience level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physicians from hospitals located in areas with different COVID-19 caseload levels, were invited to participate in a national e-survey between April and May 2020. Study participants were mainly emergency physicians, and anaesthesiologists, infectious disease consultants, and intensive care. The survey assessed participant's characteristics, factors potentially associated with resilience, and resilience using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (RISC-25), with higher scores indicative of greater resilience. Factors associated with the resilience score were assessed using a multivariable linear regression. Of 451 responding physicians involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, 442 were included (98%). Age was 36.1 ± 10.3 years and 51.8% were male; 63% worked in the emergency department (n = 282), 10.4% in anesthesiology (n = 46), 9.9% in infectious disease department (n = 44), 4.8% in intensive care unit (n = 21) or other specialties (n = 49). The median RISC-25 score was at 69 (IQR 62-75). Factors associated with higher RISC scores were anesthesia as a specialty, parenthood, no previous history of anxiety or depression and nor increased anxiety. To conclude, this study is the first to characterize levels of resilience among physicians involved in COVID-19 unit. Our data points to certain protective characteristics and some detrimental factors, such as anxiety or depression, that could be amenable to remediating or preventing strategies to promote resilience and support caregivers in a pandemic.","Douillet, D; Caillaud, A; Riou, J; Miroux, P; Thibaud, E; Noizet, M; Oberlin, M; Léger, M; Mahieu, R; Riquin, E; Javaudin, F; Morin, F; Moumneh, T; Savary, D; Roy, P-M; Hugli, O",Transl Psychiatry,618,1

Despite the many studies carried out over decades to determine the etiologic agents of RSS involved in the disease, several outbreaks remained without the elucidation of, potentially multiple, etiologies involved. METHODS: We performed comparative analysis of viral metagenomes from four chicken flocks affected with RSS using next-generation sequencing. Primers for the detection of chicken enteric viruses were designed from the sequencing data obtained with metagenomics. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR were performed to detect a variety of etiological agents previously described in natural cases of RSS. RESULTS: The most abundant viral families identified in this study were Astroviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Caliciviridae, Reoviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Chicken astrovirus sequences were present in all four samples, suggesting an association between chicken astrovirus and RSS and chicken astrovirus as a candidate pathogen responsible for RSS. Picobirnavirus and the newly identified chapparvovirus were found in chickens in the Republic of Korea for the first time, and the genetic diversity of enteric viruses and viral communities was showed. CONCLUSIONS: Chicken astrovirus was consistently detected in broilers affected with RSS and the result of this study may contribute to knowledge of enteric diseases and viruses in chickens.","Kim, Hye-Ryoung; Kwon, Yong-Kuk; Jang, Il; Bae, You-Chan",Virol J,618,24

The best delivery models and strategies for broadening access of the vulnerable communities are not fully known. This review identified PrEP programmes reported in the Asia-Pacific, which were classified by delivery models and assessed with a healthcare accessibility framework. METHODS: We performed a literature search on PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE using relevant search terms, manual searched grey literature by visiting relevant websites, examined reference lists and contacted authors for clarification of included PrEP programmes reported through July 2019. A structured table was used for data extraction and summarizing findings in accordance with the five constructs of approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness grounded in the conceptual framework of Healthcare Accessibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This literature search yielded a total of 1308 publications; 119 full texts and abstracts were screened, and 24 publications were included in the review. We identified 11 programmes implemented in seven cities/countries in the Asia-Pacific. A typology of four PrEP delivery models was delineated: (a) fee-based public service model; (b) fee-based community setting model; (c) free public service model; and (d) free community setting model. Overall, the free community setting model was most commonly adopted in the Asia-Pacific, with the strength to boost the capacity of facility and human resources, which enhanced ""approachability"", ""availability"" and ""acceptability."" The free public service model was characterized by components designed in improving ""approachability,"" ""availability"" and ""appropriateness,"" with attention on equity in accessing PrEP. Among free-based models, long-term affordability both to the government and PrEP users would need to be maximized to increase accessibility. Alongside the need for raising awareness, supportive environments and ensuring timely access were means for enabling the development of a sustainable PrEP service. CONCLUSION: PrEP programmes could be classified by delivery models through the five constructs of healthcare accessibility. While the coverage of PrEP remains limited in the Asia-Pacific, an evaluation of these models could benchmark best practices, which would in turn allow effective models to be designed.","Lau, Janice Yc; Hung, Chi-Tim; Lee, Shui-Shan",J Int AIDS Soc,618,7

DESIGN: A three-arm parallel-group randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total 143 participants with simple and moderate CHD aged 15-24 years were recruited from June 2016 to February 2018. The 12-month programme compared two active intervention groups to a standard-care control group (n = 47). Participants in one active intervention group (n = 49) were provided with COOL Passport, a mobile healthcare application. Those in the other group (n = 47) were provided with access to the Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms along with COOL Passport. Outcomes were the Leuven Knowledge Questionnaire for Congenital Heart Disease and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Taiwan Show-Card Version. RESULTS: After 12 months, 103 participants remained; the overall attrition rate was 28%. No significant differences were observed between the groups in any domain of disease knowledge after 6 months or 1 year. Neither active group exhibited significantly greater physical activity intensity than the standard-care control group in any month during the 1 year. CONCLUSION: The mHealth-tailored intervention of the COOL programme did not improve disease knowledge or physical activity in young adults with CHD. IMPACT: The application of the COOL Passport and Health Promotion Cloud system and use of game-based interactive platforms must be modified and verified in future studies and may have clinical potential.

METHODS: Fifty-three discharged COVID-19 patients were enrolled at Beijing YouAn Hospital, Capital Medical University, between January 21 and March 10, 2020. Spearman correlation analysis was performed between CT scores and laboratory indicators. Patients were divided into the Wuhan group (lived in or with travel to Wuhan, numbering 30 cases) and non-Wuhan group (close contacts or unknown exposure, totaling 23 cases). The CT and laboratory findings were compared between and within groups during the clinical process. RESULTS: Fever (88.7%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (34%), and abnormal laboratory indicators, including lymphopenia, reduced albumin, albumin/globulin (A/G), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), were mainly observed. Subpleural ground-glass opacities (86.8%) were usually detected at admission. The CT scores were highly correlated with lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G at initial and follow-ups (all p < 0.05). Four days after admission, most patients (66.7% Wuhan, 47.8% non-Wuhan) showed progression, and the CT scores of Wuhan significantly increased (p = 0.015). Eight days after admission, the vast majority of patients (69.2% Wuhan, 100% non-Wuhan, p = 0.006) presented improvement, and the CT scores of non-Wuhan were significantly lower than Wuhan (p = 0.006). Pneumonia was completely absorbed in most patients 2-4 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: CT plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of changes in COVID-19. Lymphocytes, CRP, albumin, and A/G are expected to predict disease severity and prognosis. Viral pathogenicity in non-endemic areas may be weaker than core-infected areas. In most patients, lung lesions can disappear around 4 weeks after discharge.","Li, Ruili; Liu, Guangxue; Huang, Xiaojie; Jia, Cuiyu; Xia, Zhenying; Song, Wenyan; Li, Xueqin; Wang, Xing; Li, Hongjun",BMC Infect Dis,618,1

Based on a nanomechanical analysis of the structure and motions of atoms and molecules at multiple scales, we report sonified versions of the coronavirus spike protein of the pathogen of COVID-19, 2019-nCoV. The audio signal, created using a novel nanomechanical sonification method, features an overlay of the vibrational signatures of the protein's primary, secondary and higher-order structures. Presenting musical encoding in two versions - one in the amino-acid scale and one based on equal temperament tuning - the method allows for expressing protein structures in audible space, offering novel avenues to represent, analyze and design architectural features across length- and time-scales. We further report a hierarchical frequency spectrum analysis of five distinct protein structures, which offer insights into how genetic mutations, and the binding of the virus spike protein to the human ACE2 cell receptor directly influence the audio. Applications of the approach may include the development of de novo antibodies by designing protein sequences that match, through melodic counterpoints, the binding sites in the spike protein. Other applications of audible coding of matter include material design by manipulating sound, detecting mutations, and offering a way to reach out to broader communities to explain the physics of proteins. It also forms a physics-based compositional technique to create new art, referred to as materiomusic, which is akin to finding a new palette of colors for a painter. Here, the nanomechanical structure of matter, reflected in an oscillatory framework, presents a new palette for sound generation, and can complement or support human creativity.","Buehler, Markus J.",,618,24

However, few studies have examined relevant risk factors for pandemic-related MH issues. METHODS: A link to an online survey was posted from April 8th - June 11th, 2020 which included questions regarding COVID-19 experience, perceived impact of the pandemic on life domains (e.g., social communication, finances), behavioural alterations (e.g., online activities, substance use), and MH treatment history. Current psychiatric symptom severity and impairment were evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Perceived Stress Scale. RESULTS: Overall, 632 individuals (82% female, mean age:42.04 ± 16.56) in Canada and the United States completed the survey. While few reported contracting COVID-19 (0.5%), the impact of the pandemic was evident, with a vast majority reporting anxiety around COVID-19 infecting loved ones (88%). Almost half (43%) reported previous MH treatment and 31% met criteria for GAD, 29% for MDD and 63% reported significantly high levels of stress. Female sex, younger age and past MH treatment emerged as significant predictors of these issues(p < .01). Age-related differences in the impact of COVID-19 on life domains, substance use, and online activity were also noted.

Fairness considerations for spatial data often get confounded by the underlying spatial autocorrelation. We propose hypothesis testing methodology to detect the presence and strength of this effect, then mitigate it using a spatial filtering-based approach -- in order to enable application of existing bias detection metrics. We evaluate our proposed methodology through numerical experiments on real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that in presence of several types of confounding effects due to the underlying spatial structure our testing methods perform well in maintaining low type-II errors and nominal type-I errors.","Majumdar, Subhabrata; Flynn, Cheryl; Mitra, Ritwik",,618,13

It is inspired by current events but not intended to be an accurate depiction of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We consider the emergence of a highly transmissible pathogen, focusing on metropolitan areas. To ensure some degree of realism, we present a conceptual model of the outbreak and early attempts to stave off the onslaught, including the use of lockdowns. Model outputs show strong qualitative-in some respects even quantitative-resemblance to the events of Spring 2020 in many cities worldwide. We then use this model to project forward in time to examine different paths in epidemic control after the initial surge is tamed and before the arrival of vaccines. Three very different control strategies are analyzed, leading to vastly different outcomes in terms of economic recovery and total infected population (or progress toward herd immunity). Our model, which is a version of the SEIQR model, is a time-dependent dynamical system with feedback-control. One of the main conclusions of this analysis is that the course of the epidemic is not entirely dictated by the virus: how the population responds to it can play an equally important role in determining the eventual outcome.","Young, Lai-Sang; Danial, Zach",PLoS One,618,16

Until now, the secondary impact of COVID-19 has been little estimated. Our aim was to investigate factors underlying quality of life (QOL) during COVID-19 lockdown among a healthy population, while QOL reduction expands vulnerability to the pandemic secondary impact. METHODS: During the spring lockdown in Israel, 571 healthy adults completed a survey that included standard measurements for psychological distress, participation in daily life activities, a sense of social connectedness, resilience, and QOL. RESULTS: We found a high level of psychological distress, significant reduction in participation dimensions, and in QOL (psychical, psychological, and social). These indices were even lower among women, younger adults, and the unemployed. Path analysis demonstrated that psychological distress, participation dimensions, social connectedness, and self-efficacy explained QOL, while participation dimensions were found to be the mediators. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 has had a wide impact on the general population, with the potential for negative secondary impacts. Women, young adults, and the unemployed are at high risk for secondary effects. Public health strategies should address the reported factors and populations in order to improve QOL in a healthy population and limit the impact of the pandemic.","Lipskaya-Velikovsky, Lena",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,1

According to WHO, thus far (23 November 2020) 58,425,681 infected cases including 1,385,218 deaths have been reported worldwide. In order to reduce transmission and spread of this lethal virus, attempts are globally being made to develop an appropriate vaccine. Intending to neutralize pathogens at their initial entrance site, protective mucosal immunity is inevitably required. In SARS-CoV2 infection and transmission, respiratory mucosa plays a key role; hence, apparently mucosal vaccination could be a superior approach to elicit mucosal and systemic immune responses simultaneously. In this review, the advantages of mucosal vaccination to control COVID-19 infection, limitations, and outcomes of mucosal vaccines have been highlighted. Considering the gut microbiota dysregulation in COVID-19, we further provide evidences on utilization of recombinant probiotics, particularly lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as vaccine carrier. Their intrinsic immunomodulatory features, natural adjuvanticity, and feasible expression of relevant antigen in the mucosal surface make them more appealing as live cell factory. Among all available platforms, bioengineered probiotics are considered as the most affordable, most practical, and safest vaccination approach to halt this emerging virus.","Moradi-Kalbolandi, Shima; Majidzadeh-A, Keyvan; Abdolvahab, Mohadeseh Haji; Jalili, Neda; Farahmand, Leila",Probiot. antimicrob. proteins (Internet),618,1

All the investigated algorithms are based on the so-called heard/not-heard (HnH) method, which allows the GDs to detect the MA at the border of their antenna communication radius. Despite the simplicity of this method, its efficacy in terms of accuracy is poor because it relies on the antenna radius that continuously varies under different conditions. Usually, the antenna radius declared by the manufacturer does not fully characterize the actual antenna radiation pattern. In this paper, the radiation pattern of the commercial DecaWave DWM1001 Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) antennas is observed in a real test-bed at different altitudes for collecting more information and insights on the antenna radius. The compared algorithms are then tested using both the observed and the manufacturer radii. The experimental accuracy is close to the expected theoretical one only when the antenna pattern is actually omnidirectional. However, typical antennas have strong pattern irregularities that decrease the accuracy. For improving the performance, we propose range-based (RB) variants of the compared algorithms in which, instead of using the observed or the manufacturer radii, the actual measured distances between the MA and the GD are used. The localization accuracy tremendously improves confirming that the knowledge of the exact antenna pattern is essential for any RF algorithm.","Sorbelli, Francesco Betti; Das, Sajal K.; Pinotti, Cristina M.; Rigoni, Giulio",,618,16

Currently, a reliable method for the diagnosis of infected patients is a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The method is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, designing novel methods is important. In this paper, we used three deep learning-based methods for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients with the use of X-Ray images of lungs. For the diagnosis of the disease, we presented two algorithms include deep neural network (DNN) on the fractal feature of images and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods with the use of the lung images, directly. Results classification shows that the presented CNN architecture with higher accuracy (93.2%) and sensitivity (96.1%) is outperforming than the DNN method with an accuracy of 83.4% and sensitivity of 86%. In the segmentation process, we presented a CNN architecture to find infected tissue in lung images. Results show that the presented method can almost detect infected regions with high accuracy of 83.84%.

This study employed qualitative research methods, with primary and secondary data sources, and conducted in-depth interviews with 12 farmers and agricultural producers of Gatanga Sub-county in Murang'a County, Kenya. This study shows that the farmers experienced economic shocks owing to the fluctuated farm gate prices and projected resource scarcity. In contrast, their lifestyle changed due to income decrease and adjustment of commodity priorities and socio-demographic factors. The severity of COVID-19 impact on agriculture in the Gatanga Sub-County has been doubled by crop destruction, planting delays, and heavy rains that influence scarcity of food commodities. The study recommends other research to evaluate alternative solutions to supply the county's food outputs other than those already in co-operatives, like tea, coffee, milk, and avocados.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated ovarian cancer patients who underwent HIPEC following complete cytoreductive surgery performed during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in three different centers specializing in gynecological oncology. All patients who underwent cytoreduction plus HIPEC for a primary, interval, and recurrent surgery were evaluated. Primary outcomes was postoperative 30-day morbidity and mortality. The secondary outcome was infection of patient and/or related staff with COVID-19 during the perioperative or early postoperative period. RESULTS: We performed a total of 35 HIPEC procedures during the pandemic: 15 (42.9%) patients underwent primary/interval surgery, while 20 (57.1%) patients had recurrent disease. Grade 3-4 complications occurred in one patient (2.9%) (chronic renal failure), while mortality did not occur in any patient. Neither the patients nor related staff were infected with the coronavirus during the perioperative or early postoperative period. One patient, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia on postoperative day 80 died from the infection. Another patient died on postoperative day 85 due to progressive ovarian cancer, a disorder in vital functions, and organ failure. CONCLUSION: HIPEC during the COVID-19 pandemic seems a safe and feasible procedure, with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.

It continues to affect the lives and livelihood of people appallingly across the world. Maximum discussions focus towards the apprehension of catching the infection, dwelling in homes, overpopulated nursing homes and shut down of all kinds. But, here let’s discuss the positive side of COVID 19 pandemic.As COVID 19 has spread its influence all over the world, affected countries have either announced lockdown or have implemented severe restrictions in their respective countries. Because of this, everyone dwells in their homes. Thus, exercising social distancing and functioning from home. All of the above is directed at restricting the transmission of coronavirus and expectantly ostracising the fatality from COVID 19. These transformations have also brought about some unanticipated emanations; some good things have come out of the pandemic as well. Positive effects of COVID 19 are seen on reduced road traffic, and road traffic accidents lowered levels of air pollution which has to lead to lowered heart attack rates and rejuvenating environment. Crime rates have fallen, and expenses are reduced in most places. Community action, communication amongst families, behaviour, sanitation, hygiene, online and distance education has positively impacted by COVID 19 pandemic. COVID 19 despite a bane for humans, can be thought of a boon for living beings. The habitats and elements have been purified with the stringent use of petrochemical products. To breathe fresh air and to consume purified water is a boon by itself. Now, it is time for humans to lead a caring life to every bounty bestowed on them by Nature.

METHODS: The study reviewed confirmed cases of COVID-19 notified from 1 March to 18 July 2020. Data were obtained from the national COVID-19 Data Hub, the National Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the National Contact Management Programme and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. RESULTS: A total of 25 617 cases were notified during the study period. Weekly cases and deaths peaked in mid-April 2020 at 5701 and 316, respectively. Mean number of close contacts per case was lowest at 0.7 in April, rising to 6.6 by July. Outbreak settings shifted from travel and workplace in March, to healthcare in April. Restrictions implemented on 12 March extended to full lockdown on 27 March. Phased relaxation of restrictions commenced 18 May. Effective suppression of community transmission of COVID-19 was achieved by June 2020. CONCLUSION: Lockdown is a crude population-level restriction effective in controlling COVID-19. Phased relaxation of restrictions in Ireland, however, led to an immediate increase in mean number of contacts per case, which facilitates viral transmission unless individual-level restrictions are adhered to. This demonstrates a limitation of lockdown as a long-term mechanism of pandemic control.","Conway, Robert; Kelly, David M; Mullane, Paul; Ni Bhuachalla, Cliodhna; O039,; Connor, Lois; Buckley, Claire; Kearney, Patricia M; Doyle, Sarah",J. public health (Oxf),618,8

DESIGN: Cross-sectional. Recruitment took place between June-August 2020, via social media posts and Qualtrics online panels. SETTING: Participants completed the survey online through the Qualtrics platform. SAMPLE: Analyses included N = 502 participants (&#8805;18 years); 45.2% healthy weight (n = 227), 28.5% overweight (n = 143), and 26.3% obese (n = 132). MEASURES: Study-specific survey items included questions about demographics and perceived changes in health behaviors. ANALYSIS: Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed the odds of perceiving changes in health behaviors considered a risk for weight gain. RESULTS: Participants with obesity, but not overweight, were significantly more likely to report deleterious changes to health behaviors compared to healthy weight peers, including: (1) decreased fruit/vegetable consumption [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.13, 3.26)]; (2) increased processed food consumption [AOR = 1.85; 95%CI: (1.15, 3.00)]; (3) increased caloric intake [AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: (1.06, 2.61)]; (4) decreased physical activity [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.31, 3.28)]; and (5) deterioration in sleep quality [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.32, 3.25)].

In the education sector, governments had to close schools and universities around the world and turn into online mode of delivery. The sudden transformation to online learning demands educators and institutions to develop more innovative teaching methods in supporting students during this growing crisis. It is pertinent that this is the era of large-scale online learning, where education is delivered remotely utilizing various digital platforms. To this end, this move presented many challenges to students, educators, families, administrators, and government regulations. In this paper, we conduct an oriented and well-rounded survey that captures all aspects of distance learning verticals as perceived by educators in order to study online delivery aspects, including teaching models, communication media, and teaching best practices in distance learning. The paper will answer subtle and comprehensive questions related to student satisfaction and success, technical needs and challenges, teaching models, educator mobility, etc. across different universities in the UAE. In particular, the paper tries to identify best model to use given many key issues related to the adoption of e-learning during COVID-19. Overall, the survey results showed almost all participants agreed that online learning during the COVID-19 is a very good alternative solution to Face-to-Face approach. However, teaching models do vary in promoting students’ participation and students’ engagement. All participants agree that absence of the proper infrastructure at home will hinder the operation especially in courses with hands-on components.

METHODS: We investigated air and environmental contamination in the rooms of eight COVID-19 patients in four hospitals. Some patients were in negative-pressure rooms, and others were not. None had undergone aerosol-generating procedures. On days 0, 3, 5, and 7 of hospitalization, the surfaces in the rooms and anterooms were swabbed, and air samples were collected 2 m from the patient and from the anterooms. RESULTS: All 52 air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Widespread surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. In total, 89 of 320 (27%) environmental surface samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was common in rooms without surface disinfection and in rooms sprayed with disinfectant twice a day.

An adaptive blended learning method was developed in response to the requirements necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. This model combined pedagogical needs with digital technology using online learning activities to implement student learning in a medical neuroscience course for year one medical students. This approach provided medical students with an individually customized learning opportunity in medical neuroscience. The students had the complete choice to engage the learning system synchronously or asynchronously and learn neuroscience materials at different locations and times in response to the demands required to deal with the pandemic. Students' performance in summative and formative examinations of the adaptive blended learning activities were compared with the previous performance obtained the previous year when the contents of the medical neuroscience course were implemented using the conventional ""face-to-face"" learning approach. While the cohort of our students in 2019 and 2020 changed, the contents, sessions, volume of material and assessment were constant. This enabled us to compare the results of the 2019 and 2020 classes. Overall, students' performance was not significantly different between the adaptive blended learning and the in-person approach. More students scored between 70-79% during the adaptive blended learning compared with in-class teaching, while more students scored between 80-89% during the in-person learning than during the adaptive blended learning. Finally, the percentage of students that scored >90% was not significantly different for both Years 2019 and 2020. The adaptive blended learning approach was effective in enhancing academic performance for high performing medical students.

While the pre-pandemic focus of policy experts and government reports was on the question of whether to add outpatient pharmaceuticals to universal health coverage, the clustering of pandemic deaths in long-term care facilities has spurred calls for federal standards in long-term care (LTC) and its possible inclusion in universal health coverage. This has led to the probability that the federal government will attempt to expand medicare as Canadians have known it for the first time in over a half century. However, these efforts are likely to fail if the federal government relies on the shared-cost federalism that marked the earlier introduction of medicare. Two alternative pathways are suggested, one for LTC and one for pharmaceuticals, that are more likely to succeed given the state of the Canadian federation in the early 21st century.","Marchildon, Gregory P; Tuohy, Carolyn H",Health Econ Policy Law,618,16

In order to evaluate stress levels of pregnant woman in this difficult time, the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Scale (PREPS) was introduced in the US. The present study introduces and validates the German version of the PREPS. STUDY DESIGN: In total, 1364 German-speaking pregnant women from Germany and Switzerland took part in this online cohort study and completed the PREPS as well as gave information on sociodemographic, obstetric and other psychological factors. RESULTS: A confirmatory factor analysis of the PREPS showed very good psychometric values and confirmed the structure of the original questionnaire. The PREPS comprises three dimensions: Infection Stress (5 items), Preparedness Stress (7 items) and Positive Appraisal (3 items). Furthermore, correlations between the PREPS and other psychological factors such as Pregnancy Specific Stress and Fear of Childbirth highlight convergent validity. The sensitivity of the questionnaire was demonstrated by its associations with several obstetric and COVID-19 related factors. CONCLUSION: The German PREPS showed good psychometric properties and is a useful instrument for future studies which aim to investigate the impact of pandemic-related stress on birth outcomes and postpartum factors.","Schaal, Nora K; Marca-Ghaemmaghami, Pearl La; Preis, Heidi; Mahaffey, Brittain; Lobel, Marci; Amiel Castro, Rita",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,618,22

Although highly specific, SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been shown in clinical practice to be affected by a noninsignificant proportion of false-negative results. This study seeks to explore whether the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation is associated with increased sensitivity for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, and therefore may facilitate the identification of false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results. METHODS: This prospective cohort study enrolled consecutive adult patients with symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the emergency department (ED) of an Italian academic hospital. Immediately after the initial assessment, a lung ultrasonographic evaluation was performed and the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection, based on both clinical and lung ultrasonographic findings (""integrated"" assessment), was recorded. RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection was subsequently performed. RESULTS: We enrolled 228 patients; 107 (46.9%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sensitivity and negative predictive value of the clinical-lung ultrasonographic integrated assessment were higher than first RT-PCR result (94.4% [95% confidence interval {CI} 88.2% to 97.9%] versus 80.4% [95% CI 71.6% to 87.4%] and 95% [95% CI 89.5% to 98.2%] versus 85.2% [95% CI 78.3% to 90.6%], respectively). Among the 142 patients who initially had negative RT-PCR results, 21 tested positive at a subsequent molecular test performed within 72 hours. All these false-negative cases were correctly identified by the integrated assessment. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that, in patients presenting to the ED with symptoms commonly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the integration of lung ultrasonography with clinical evaluation has high sensitivity and specificity for coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and it may help to identify false-negative results occurring with RT-PCR.","Pivetta, Emanuele; Goffi, Alberto; Tizzani, Maria; Locatelli, Stefania M; Porrino, Giulio; Losano, Isabel; Leone, Dario; Calzolari, Gilberto; Vesan, Matteo; Steri, Fabio; Ardito, Arianna; Capuano, Marialessia; Gelardi, Maria; Silvestri, Giulia; Dutto, Stefania; Avolio, Maria; Cavallo, Rossana; Bartalucci, Alice; Paglieri, Cristina; Morello, Fulvio; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Maule, Milena M; Lupia, Enrico",Ann. emerg. med,618,30

High relative humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low, but tends to reduce transmission when temperature is high. Implementing classical control measures can dramatically slow the spread of the disease.

The service aimed to alleviate pandemic-associated stress, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and suicidal propensity. The effectiveness of Text4Hope was evaluated by comparing psychiatric parameters between two subscriber groups. Methods: A comparative cross-sectional study with two arms: Text4Hope subscribers who received daily texts for six weeks, the intervention group (IG); and new Text4Hope subscribers who were yet to receive messages, the control group (CG). Logistic regression models were used in the analysis. Results: Participants in the IG had lower prevalence rates for moderate/high stress (78.8% vs. 88.0%), likely GAD (31.4% vs. 46.5%), and likely MDD (36.8% vs. 52.1%), respectively, compared to respondents in the CG. After controlling for demographic variables, the IG remained less likely to self-report symptoms of moderate/high stress (OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.41-0.75), likely GAD (OR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.44-0.68), and likely MDD (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.47-0.73).

The former [8 + 2] reaction is stepwise, starting from attack of the diene substituent on furan, not the furyl moiety in dienylfurans, to DMAD to give a diradical intermediate, which then undergoes ring closure to form the second bond between DMAD and the furan moiety, generating the final [8 + 2] cycloadducts. In contrast, the latter [8 + 2] reaction starts from [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the diene in the furan ring of dienylisobenzofurans toward DMAD, followed by the rate-determining stepwise [1,5]-vinyl shift, forming the [8 + 2] products. The different mechanisms of [8 + 2] reactions are attributed to the facts that for dienylfurans, the reactive diene part is the diene substituent on furan, but in the case of dienylisobenzofurans, it is the diene in the furan ring (its reaction with DMAD to generate an aromatic benzene ring is the driving force for this regiochemistry). Consequently, the [8 + 2] reactions begin with the reaction of the most reactive part of tetraene (either the diene substituent on furan for dienylfurans or the diene in the furan ring for dienylisobenzofurans) with DMAD. FMO analysis and kinetic study have been carried out to gain more information of the reaction mechanisms. Two [8 + 2] reactions of dienylisobenzofurans with different substituents toward DMAD have also been further analyzed by DFT calculations in this paper.","Cui, Qi; Chen, Yuanyuan; Herndon, James W; Yu, Zhi-Xiang",J Org Chem,618,23

Thus, as an alternative to such clinical practices, various complementary therapies such as yoga and meditation have been proved to be effective in alleviating the causes and symptoms of different neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of altered brain waves in this context has been recognized and needs to be pursued at the highest level.

COVID-19 spreads primarily by contacting the virus either from a COVID-19-infected individual through coughing or sneezing or from COVID-19-contaminated surfaces. On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced COVID-19 as a pandemic. The government of Saudi Arabia was among the first countries in the world to take quick and serious precautions. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has made the public aware of the virus transmission patterns and the importance of quarantine and curfew. Despite strict measures taken, the awareness of people towards infectious viruses remains the most important factor in limiting the widespread of diseases. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey of 1767 participants, was conducted to explore the awareness, attitude and practice of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic data among residents in the city of Riyadh. RESULTS: Of all the participants, 58% showed a moderate level of awareness, 95% presented a high attitude and 81% presented an adequate practice regarding COVID-19. Significant positive correlation between awareness-attitude (r = 0.132, p-value < 0.001) and attitude-practice (r = 0.149, p-value < 0.001) were found. The gender of the participants was the only common characteristic significantly associated with both awareness and practice. This study revealed that males showed a slight increase (60%) in the level of awareness compared to female participants (57%), however, when it comes to the practice towards COVID-19, females showed slightly better practice (82%) than males (80%). The World health organization (WHO) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) were the main sources of information. CONCLUSION: Despite the moderate public awareness, their attitude and practice were better. Therefore, public awareness must be improved to be prepared for epidemic and pandemic situations. A comprehensive public health education program is important to increase awareness and to reach sufficient knowledge.","Alahdal, Hadil; Basingab, Fatemah; Alotaibi, Reem",J Infect Public Health,618,20

However, epidemiologically these outbreaks are not well defined. We aimed to define such outbreaks in ACFs by systematically reviewing literature published during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We searched 11 bibliographic databases for literature published on COVID-19 in ACFs between December 2019 and September 2020. Original studies reporting extractable epidemiological data as part of outbreak investigations or non-outbreak surveillance of ACFs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020211424. Findings: We identified 5,148 publications and selected 49 studies from four continents reporting data on 214,380 residents in 8,502 ACFs with 25,567 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Aged care residents form a distinct vulnerable population with single-facility attack rates of 45% [95% CI 32-58%] and case fatality rates of 23% [95% CI 18-28%]. Of the cases, 31% [95% CI 28-34%] were asymptomatic. The rate of hospitalization amongst residents was 37% [95% CI 35-39%]. Data from 21 outbreaks identified a resident as the index case in 58% of outbreaks and a staff member in 42%. Findings from the included studies were heterogeneous and of low to moderate quality in risk of bias assessment. Interpretation: The clinical presentation of COVID-19 varies widely in ACFs residents, from asymptomatic to highly serious cases. Preventing the introduction of COVID-19 into ACFs is key, and both residents and staff are a priority group for COVID-19 vaccination. Rapid diagnosis, identification of primary and secondary cases and close contacts plus their isolation and quarantine are of paramount importance.

Objetivo: analisar a trajetória da regulamentação do teletrabalho no Setor Judiciário Federal e como foi impactada pela pandemia da COVID-19. Métodos: estudo descritivo com base em resoluções que regulamentaram o teletrabalho na Justiça Federal. Resultados: o teletrabalho foi iniciado no Judiciário Federal em 2013, quando o Tribunal da 4ª Região publicou a primeira resolução a respeito. Em 2016, o Conselho Nacional de Justiça o regulamentou nacionalmente e cada Tribunal emitiu normativas complementares. Diante da pandemia, para não paralisar suas atividades devido ao isolamento e ao distanciamento social, o Judiciário Federal rapidamente estabeleceu o teletrabalho integral e compulsório a todos os magistrados, servidores e estagiários, porém com a adoção de diferentes metas e ações pelos tribunais. Aspectos ambientais, individuais e familiares, da organização e da natureza do trabalho devem ser observados na implementação do teletrabalho. Conclusão: os resultados sugerem que os desafios da realização do teletrabalho durante a crise devem contribuir para análise e aperfeiçoamento das normas, metas e políticas públicas vigentes em teletrabalho no Judiciário e nos demais setores, assim como para o entendimento e prevenção dos seus impactos à saúde dos trabalhadores e trabalhadoras.","Antunes, Evelise Dias; Fischer, Frida Marina",Rev. bras. saúde ocup,618,26

The obstacle faced by students during online lectures is the availability of internet services. Students have difficulty taking online lectures because not all areas where students live have an internet connection, if there is, the connection is very slow. This makes students sometimes late in getting lecture information, and submitting assignments. Apart from the availability of internet services, another challenge faced by students is constrained by costs. In taking online lectures, students have to pay more to buy internet data quotas. Of the 74 students, 64 students or 86.5% chose face-to-face education.

361406,361406,361406,COVID-19: Common Critical and Practical Questions,17.301052,5.141896,2020,"BACKGROUND: The advent of COVID-19 abruptly thrust the health and safety of children and families into greater risk around the world. As regional and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, families, and children grapple with the immediate public health impact of COVID-19, the rights and well-being of children, especially those who are already marginalized, have been overlooked. Those working with children have likely encountered unprecedented challenges and responded in innovative ways in efforts to address the needs and rights of all children. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol for a large-scale, multinational study using a new smartphone app to capture the real-time experiences and perspectives of practitioners and policymakers supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe in relation to a children's human rights 4P framework of protection, provision, prevention, and participation. METHODS: This protocol describes a mixed methods survey utilizing a custom-built iOS and Android smartphone app called the COVID 4P Log for Children's Wellbeing, which was developed in close consultation with 17 international key partner organizations. Practitioners and policymakers working with and for children's well-being across 29 countries and 5 continents were invited to download the app and respond to questions over the course of 8 weeks. The anticipated large amount of qualitative and quantitative response data will be analyzed using content analysis, descriptive statistics, and word frequencies. RESULTS: Formal data collection took place from October 2020 until March 2021. Data analysis was completed in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will directly inform the understanding of the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted practitioners', managers', and policymakers' efforts to support children's well-being in their practices, services, and policies, respectively. Innovative and ambitious in its scope and use of smartphone technology, this project also aims to inform and inspire future multinational research using app-based methodologies-the demand for which is likely to continue to dramatically rise in the COVID-19 era. Mitigating the risks of longitudinal remote data collection will help maximize the acceptability of the app, respondents' sustained engagement, and data quality.

We look forward to providing policy experience for other countries still in severe epidemics. METHODS: We analyzed data provided by National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center for the period 10 January 2020 to 25 May 252,020. We used generalized linear model to evaluate the associations between the main control policies and the number of confirmed cases and the policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. RESULTS: The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; China's goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germany's goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.","Zhang, Yuyao; Shi, Leiyu; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,618,24

In addition, employee responses to these changes are explored. Design/methodology/approach The authors carried out a field study of MC changes in PSFs in Italy, the first country in Europe that was severely impacted by COVID-19. Interviews with PSF employees form the primary data source. Pattern matching was used to identify similarities and differences and investigate how employees respond to the MC changes. Findings As a response to the shift to remote working, managers at PSFs made various MC-related changes. For instance, they increased the number of online meetings and made use of technologies to monitor employees from a distance. Employees reacted to this by engaging in ""voluntary visibilizing practices"", i.e. by trying to make sure they got noted by their superiors, for instance by doing overtime. In addition, collected evidence suggests increased stress levels among employees, changes to employee autonomy, changed perceptions of hierarchies and a weakened sense of relatedness with others in the organization. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to examine the impact of the sudden shift to remote working on MC. In addition, this paper contributes by exploring employee responses to the MC-related changes. The findings add to the growing literature on MC and motivation, and the notion of voluntary visibilizing practices is mobilized to warn against over-commitment and self-exploitation.","Delfino, G.

RE-LYMP (reactive lymphocytes) is an extended inflammation parameter (EIP) reported by XN analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) reflect the activation of lymphocytes triggered by infections. We aimed to assess the clinical utility of these parameters as biomarkers for the rapid detection of COVID 19. METHODS: The study group included 200 COVID 19 and 167 patients with other infections at admission. Differences of leukocyte differential, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and EIP among groups were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test; parameters statiscally different in the groups were tested with Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess their diagnostic performance in distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 infections. The reliability of the selected parameters was evaluated in a validation group of 347 patients (160 COVID 19 and 187 other infections). RESULTS: NLR performed well to discard viral infections, area under curve (AUC) 0.988 (95%CI 0.973 - 0.991) and RE-LYMP was useful to distinguish COVID 19 and bacterial infections AUC 0.920 (95%CI 0.884 - 0.948); the two conditions NLR> 3.3 RE-LYMP> 0.6% was applied to the validation group and 153 out of 160 COVID 19 patients were correctly distinguished (95.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for better caring of patients and to reduce the threat of nosocomial infection for professionals. Leukocyte differential and RE-LYMPH could assist in a preliminary differential diagnosis of the disease.","Urrechaga, Eloísa; Mugertza, Garazi; Fernández, Mónica; España, Pedro Pablo; Aguirre, Urko",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,618,24

The proposed framework combines mobility of UAV with IoT measurements and full-stack WebRTC communications. WebRTC offers simultaneous transmission of both a real-time video stream and the flow of data coming from sensors, and ensures a kind of protection of data flow, which leads to preserving its near-real-time character and enables contextual communication. Addition of the AI accelerator hardware makes this system AI-ready, i.e., the IoT communication hub, which is the air component of our system, is able to perform tasks of AI-supported computing. The exemplary prototype of this system was evaluated in terms of the ability to work with fast-response sensors, the ability to work with high temporal and high spatial resolutions, video information in poor visibility conditions and AI-readiness. Results show that prototypes based on the proposed framework are able to meet the challenges of monitoring systems in smart cities and industrial areas.","Chodorek, Agnieszka Chodorek Robert Ryszard Sitek Paweł",Sensors,618,5

Efforts have been made to search for prophylactic and therapeutic approaches including neutralizing antibodies development. By reviewing dozens of studies on anti-spike antibodies identification, we concluded that (1) promising therapeutic antibodies are being fished out by various approaches, such as screening of single B cells of convalescent patients, recombinant antibody library and B cells of immunized animals; (2) the epitopes are mainly RBD, but also some non-RBD domains, without the requisite of overlapping with ACE2 binding sites; (3) Neutralizing antibodies are convergent to a few germline genes, including IGHV3-30, IGHV3-53, IGHV3-66, with varying levels of somatic mutations. This review summarizes the progress in neutralizing antibodies development and the germline enrichment of effective antibodies, which will shed light on COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design.","Xiaojie, Shi; Yu, Li; Lei, Yan; Guang, Yang; Min, Qiang",Stem Cell Res,618,24

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused disruption to contemporary health service delivery, including alcohol and other drug treatment. Provisional research on drug and alcohol consumption patterns shows changes attributable to the pandemic, with implications for service delivery. Research also indicates the impact of the pandemic on healthcare staff is significant, leading to workforce challenges that threaten care provision. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study design. METHODS: Data were collected using semi-structured, individual telephone interviews with practising alcohol and other drug nurses from Australia and New Zealand (n = 19). COREQ reporting guidelines were used. RESULTS: After thematic analysis, three key themes emerged: 'No room at the inn: Changes to service delivery due to COVID-19', 'We are providing care to a very vulnerable group of people: Consumer factors during COVID-19' and 'Personally, we were very, very stressed: Workforce factors due to COVID-19'. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study indicate that the impact of the pandemic was felt by alcohol and other drug nurses, services and healthcare consumers alike. The experiences of alcohol and other drug nurses through the COVID-19 pandemic need further exploration both to ensure workforce sustainability and that disruptions to alcohol and other drug services do not occur in future outbreaks of communicable disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on nurses in all settings, and these effects are likely to be felt for some time after the pandemic: nursing specialties require support to ensure ongoing workforce sustainability and well-being of nursing staff. All nurses need to be aware of changes to alcohol and other drug use during the pandemic and screen healthcare consumers accordingly.","Searby, Adam; Burr, Dianna",J Clin Nurs,618,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient and pathway characteristics including prioritization strategies at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer located at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (RFH) before and during the surge of COVID-19. RESULTS: On 18 March 2020 all elective surgery was halted at RFH to redeploy resources and staff for the COVID-19 surge. Prioritizing of patients according to European Association of Urology guidance was introduced. Clinics and the specialist multidisciplinary team (SMDT) meetings were maintained with physical distancing, kidney surgery was moved to a COVID-protected site, and infection prevention measurements were enforced. During the 7 weeks of lockdown (23 March to 10 May 2020), 234 cases were discussed at the SMDT meetings, 53% compared to the 446 cases discussed in the 7 weeks pre-lockdown. The reduction in referrals was more pronounced for small and asymptomatic renal masses. Of 62 low-priority cancer patients, 27 (43.5%) were deferred.

No increase in clinical or pathological upstaging could be detected in patients who underwent deferred surgery compared to pre-COVID practice. CONCLUSION: The first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted diagnosis, referral and treatment of kidney cancer at a tertiary referral centre. With a policy of prioritization and COVID-protected pathways, capacity for time-sensitive oncological interventions was maintained and no immediate clinical harm was observed.","Kuusk, Teele; Cullen, David; Neves, Joana Briosa; Campain, Nicholas; Barod, Ravi; Boleti, Ekaterini; El-Sheihk, Soha; Grant, Lee; Kelly, John; Marchetti, Marta; Mumtaz, Faiz; Patki, Prasad; Ramachandran, Navin; Silva, Pedro; Tran-Dang, My-Anh; Walkden, Miles; Tran, Maxine G B; Powles, Thomas; Bex, Axel",BJU int,618,23

Probabilistic theories often treat it as axiomatic, whereas it follows from the meanings of conditionals in the theory of mental models. In this theory, intuitive models (system 1) do not represent what is false, and so produce errors in estimates of p(if A then C), yielding instead p(A & C). Deliberative models (system 2) are normative, and yield the proportion of cases of A in which C holds, i.e., the Equation. Intuitive estimates of the probability of a conditional about unique events: If covid-19 disappears in the USA, then Biden will run for a second term, together with those of each of its clauses, are liable to yield joint probability distributions that sum to over 100%. The error, which is inconsistent with the probability calculus, is massive when participants estimate the joint probabilities of conditionals with each of the different possibilities to which they refer. This result and others under review corroborate the model theory.","López-Astorga, Miguel; Ragni, Marco; Johnson-Laird, P N",Psychon. bull. rev. (Online),618,21

Machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one ML algorithm and limited performance evaluation to ""area under the curve"" (AUC). To obtain best results possible, it may be important to try multiple algorithms using machine learning (ML) to optimize performance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning (ML) algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we investigated which variables (i.e. vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc.) were most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: The data was retrospectively collected at our institution on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity. Patients were followed up for 30 days or death. This data was used for autoML to build 20 ML models with various algorithms. The main performance of ML models was measured by area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP). Finally, dimensionality reduction was conducted to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML was retrained using only these 10 variables and its output models was evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Input from 4313 patients was used. The best model that autoML generated using 48 variables was the stacked ensemble models (AUCPR = 0.807). The two best independent models were the Gradient Boost Models (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) models with AUCPR of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. Deep learning models were significantly inferior with AUCPR = 0.73. The ten most influential variables in generating high performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, troponin, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model again performed the best with AUCPR of 0.791. CONCLUSIONS: By using autoML, we have developed high-performing models that predict survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method to generate ML based clinical decision supporting tools.","Ikemura, Kenji; Bellin, Eran; Yagi, Yukako; Billett, Henny; Saada, Mahmoud; Simone, Katelyn; Stahl, Lindsay; Szymanski, James; Goldstein, D Y; Reyes Gil, Morayma",J. med. internet res,618,16

It improves the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. However, there is still limited access to palliative care in many countries. Knowledge about palliative care is key to increase its availability. Thus, this article aimed to explore the knowledge of the general population about palliative care in Ecuador. The study had a descriptive cross-sectional design. Through snowball sampling, between September 2019 and January 2020, 257 people completed an anonymous online questionnaire about general and specific aspects of palliative care. Descriptive and ANOVA analyses indicate that people have many misconceptions about palliative care and how it should be provided. Gender, education, training, occupation, and experience as caregivers were related to the total level of knowledge about palliative care. Regression analyses show other variables as predictors of knowledge. This study highlights the lack of knowledge about specific issues within palliative care in the general population in Ecuador. It also shows the need to develop and implement education measures to fill these gaps and enhance access to palliative care in health systems.","Hidalgo-Andrade, Paula; Mascialino, Guido; Miño, Diego; Mendoza, Matías; Marcillo, Anna Belén",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,1

A convenience sample of 606 Israeli parents (469 mothers and 137 fathers) whose first child was 3-12 months old was recruited through social media. No significant differences emerged between mothers and fathers in level of parental distress or apprehension. Poorer health, higher attachment avoidance and anxiety, lower self-mastery, and a higher level of COVID-19-related anxiety over going for infant health checkups contributed significantly to greater parental distress. Lower level of education, being a woman, higher attachment avoidance and anxiety, and higher levels of all COVID-19-related anxieties contributed significantly to greater pandemic-related apprehension. The findings show that new parents may experience parental distress and concerns about raising a child during the crisis, and that whereas specific COVID-19-anxieties are unrelated to global parental distress, they are linked to the apprehension aroused by the pandemic. Moreover, they highlight the contribution of parents' personal resources, showing that lower attachment avoidance and anxiety are associated with lower distress and apprehension, whereas self-mastery is especially significant for lessening the apprehension about raising an infant in this period. These insights may be used in targeted interventions to reduce distress in vulnerable populations, such as individuals who recently became parents for the first time.

METHODS: Between February 20, 2020 and April 4, 2020, consecutive confirmed 2541 COVID-19 patients from three designated hospitals were enrolled in this study. All patients received chest computed tomography (CT) and serological examinations at admission. Laboratory tests included routine blood tests, liver function, renal function, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and arterial blood gas. The SaO2 was measured using pulse oxygen saturation in room air at resting status. Independent high-risk factors associated with death were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the survival of severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 124 severe patients in the training cohort, and there were 71 and 76 severe patients in the two independent validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that age &#8805; 70 years (HR = 1.184, 95% CI 1.061-1.321), panting (breathing rate &#8805; 30/min) (HR = 3.300, 95% CI 2.509-6.286), lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 109/L (HR = 2.283, 95% CI 1.779-3.267), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 10 pg/ml (HR = 3.029, 95% CI 1.567-7.116) were independent high-risk factors associated with fatal outcome. We developed the nomogram for identifying survival of severe COVID-19 patients in the training cohort (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI 0.841-0.960, sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 77.5%); in validation cohort 1 (AUC = 0.811, 95% CI 0.763-0.961, sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 73.5%); in validation cohort 2 (AUC = 0.862, 95% CI 0.698-0.924, sensitivity 92.9%, specificity 64.5%). The calibration curve for probability of death indicated a good consistence between prediction by the nomogram and the actual observation. The prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients with high levels of IL-6 receiving tocilizumab were better than that of those patients without tocilizumab both in the training and validation cohorts, but without difference (P = 0.105 for training cohort, P = 0.133 for validation cohort 1, and P = 0.210 for validation cohort 2). CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram could help clinicians to identify severe patients who have high risk of death, and to develop more appropriate treatment strategies to reduce the mortality of severe patients.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate arrhythmia in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 during the current COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for case control studies that were published between January 1 and July 25, 2020, and that had data on arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Random effects model was used with the odds ratio as the effect size. The frequency of arrhythmia was compared between COVID-19 patients with and without the composite endpoint of severity. We also determined the pooled prevalence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19. Publication bias and heterogeneity were considered by using subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and the trim and fill method. RESULTS: A total of 1553 patients with COVID-19 were included in the 5 articles we obtained. Of these, 349 cases (22.47%) and 1204 cases (77.53%) were severely ill and non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, respectively. There were 790 (50.87%) male patients. A total of 105 cases (30.09%) of severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications, and 34 cases (2.82%) of non-severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia had arrhythmia complications. We found arrhythmia to be significantly associated with severely ill inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with a pooled odds ratio of 17.97 (95% CI (11.30, 28.55), p<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with severe COVID-19 was greater than that of those with non-severe COVID-19. Patients with severe COVID-19 had a higher risk of arrhythmia complications, which further showed that COVID-19 may be a risk factor for arrhythmia and that the incidence of arrhythmia may increase with the progression of the disease.

METHODS: All patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department, Dijon University Hospital, Dijon, France between 27 February and 30 April 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Clinical, biological and radiological data were collected, as well as treatment and outcome data. An unfavourable outcome was defined as death or transfer to the intensive care unit. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients who did and did not receive antibiotic therapy using propensity score matching. FINDINGS: Among the 222 patients included, 174 (78%) received antibiotic therapy. The univariate analysis showed that patients who received antibiotic therapy were significantly older, frailer and had more severe presentation at admission compared with patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy. Unfavourable outcomes were more common in patients who received antibiotic therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-8.11; P = 0.04]. Multi-variate analysis and propensity score matching indicated that antibiotic therapy was not significantly associated with outcome (HR 1.612, 95% CI 0.562-4.629; P = 0.37). CONCLUSION: Antibiotics were frequently prescribed in this study and this was associated with more severe presentation at admission. However, antibiotic therapy was not associated with outcome, even after adjustment.

However, whether those changes are specific to SARS-CoV-2 or driven by a general inflammatory response shared across severely ill pneumonia patients remains unknown. Here, we compared the immune profile of severe COVID-19 with non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ICU patients using longitudinal, high-dimensional single-cell spectral cytometry and algorithm-guided analysis. COVID-19 and non-SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia both showed increased emergency myelopoiesis and displayed features of adaptive immune paralysis. However, pathological immune signatures suggestive of T cell exhaustion were exclusive to COVID-19. The integration of single-cell profiling with a predicted binding capacity of SARS-CoV-2 peptides to the patients' HLA profile further linked the COVID-19 immunopathology to impaired virus recognition. Toward clinical translation, circulating NKT cell frequency was identified as a predictive biomarker for patient outcome. Our comparative immune map serves to delineate treatment strategies to interfere with the immunopathologic cascade exclusive to severe COVID-19.","Kreutmair, Stefanie; Unger, Susanne; Núñez, Nicolás Gonzalo; Ingelfinger, Florian; Alberti, Chiara; De Feo, Donatella; Krishnarajah, Sinduya; Kauffmann, Manuel; Friebel, Ekaterina; Babaei, Sepideh; Gaborit, Benjamin; Lutz, Mirjam; Jurado, Nicole Puertas; Malek, Nisar P; Goepel, Siri; Rosenberger, Peter; Häberle, Helene A; Ayoub, Ikram; Al-Hajj, Sally; Nilsson, Jakob; Claassen, Manfred; Liblau, Roland; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Bitzer, Michael; Roquilly, Antoine; Becher, Burkhard",Immunity,618,20

Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are extensively used in the diagnostic field owing to a phenomenon known as 'surface plasmonic resonance' in which the scattered light is absorbed by these NPs and can be detected via UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Consequently, sialic acid conjugated Au NPs (SA-Au NPs) were utilized for their plasmonic effect against SARS-CoV-2, influenza B virus, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS) in patients' swab samples. The SA-Au NPs system was prepared by a one-pot synthesis method, through which the NPs solution color changed from pale yellow to dark red wine color, indicting its successful preparation. In addition, the SA-Au NPs had an average particle size of 30 +/- 1 nm, negative zeta potential (-30 +/- 0.3 mV), and a UV absorbance of 525 nm.

DESIGN: Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 infection-related gene expression from endometrial transcriptomic data sets. SETTING: Infertility research department affiliated with a public hospital. PATIENT(S): Gene expression data from five studies in 112 patients with normal endometrium collected throughout the menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Gene expression and correlation between viral infectivity genes and age throughout the menstrual cycle. RESULT(S): Gene expression was high for TMPRSS4, CTSL, CTSB, FURIN, MX1, and BSG; medium for TMPRSS2; and low for ACE2. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, and MX1 expression increased toward the window of implantation. TMPRSS4 expression was positively correlated with ACE2, CTSB, CTSL, MX1, and FURIN during several cycle phases; TMPRSS2 was not statistically significantly altered across the cycle. ACE2, TMPRSS4, CTSB, CTSL, BSG, and MX1 expression increased with age, especially in early phases of the cycle. CONCLUSION(S): Endometrial tissue is likely safe from SARS-CoV-2 cell entry based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression, but susceptibility increases with age. Further, TMPRSS4, along with BSG-mediated viral entry into cells, could imply a susceptible environment for SARS-CoV-2 entry via different mechanisms. Additional studies are warranted to determine the true risk of endometrial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and implications for fertility treatments.","Henarejos-Castillo, Ismael; Sebastian-Leon, Patricia; Devesa-Peiro, Almudena; Pellicer, Antonio; Diaz-Gimeno, Patricia",Fertil Steril,618,11

CASE PRESENTATION: The Case 1 was a 90-year-old man, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab. Two days later, he was hospitalized and after eleven days transferred to Intensive Care Unit. A chest CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. Just that day, an erythematous maculo-papular rash appeared on trunk, shoulders and neck, becoming purpuric after few days. Histological evaluations revealed a chronic superficial dermatitis with purpuric aspects. The superficial and papillary dermis appeared edematous, with a perivascular lympho-granulocytic infiltrate and erythrocytic extravasation. At intraepithelial level, spongiosis and a granulocyte infiltrate were detected. Arterioles, capillaries and post-capillary venules showed endothelial swelling and appeared ectatic. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and tocilizumab. Regrettably, due to severe lung impairment, he died. The Case 2 was a 85-year-old man, admitted to Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab two days before. A chest RX showed bilateral atypical pneumonia. After seven days, a cutaneous reddening involving trunk, upper limbs, neck and face developed, configuring a sub-erythroderma. Histological evaluations displayed edema in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and tocilizumab. Sub-erythroderma as well as respiratory symptoms gradually improved until healing. CONCLUSIONS: The endothelial swelling detected in the Case 1 could be a morphological expression of SARS-CoV-2-induced endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesize that cutaneous damage could be initiated by endothelial dysfunction, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells or induced by immune system activation. The disruption of endothelial integrity could enhance microvascular permeability, extravasation of inflammatory cells and cytokines, with cutaneous injury. The Case 2 developed a sub-erythroderma associated with COVID-19, and a non-specific chronic dermatitis was detected at histological level. We speculate that a purpuric rash could represent the cutaneous sign of a more severe coagulopathy, as highlighted histologically by vascular abnormalities, while a sub-erythroderma could be expression of viral hematogenous spreading, inducing a non-specific chronic dermatitis.","Patrì, Angela; Vargas, Maria; Buonanno, Pasquale; Annunziata, Maria Carmela; Russo, Daniela; Staibano, Stefania; Servillo, Giuseppe; Fabbrocini, Gabriella",Diagn Pathol,618,31

We exploit self‐reported survey data from Argentina to study the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic quarantine had unintended consequences on intimate partner violence. The quarantine decree established clear exceptions for heterogeneous subsets of the population and, for reasons plausibly exogenous to the prevalence of intimate partner violence, only &lt;italic&gt;some&lt;/italic&gt; individuals were forced to spend more time with their partners. Using this variability in exposure we find that the lockdown led to an increase between 12% and 35% in intimate partner violence, depending type of violence (emotional, physical or sexual). Given the Argentinian government imposed the full national lockdown when few people felt threatened by the virus, these effects are likely to have been triggered by the actual confinement.

The public has grown aware of the role of social media as a superspreader of untrustworthy information, where even pandemics have not been immune. In this paper, we focus on COVID-19 misinformation and examine a subset of 2.1M tweets to understand misinformation as a function of engagement, tweet content (COVID-19- vs. non-COVID-19-related), and veracity (misleading or factual). Using correlation analysis, we show the most relevant feature subsets among over 126 features that most heavily correlate with misinformation or facts. We found that (i) factual tweets, regardless of whether COVID-related, were more engaging than misinformation tweets; and (ii) features that most heavily correlated with engagement varied depending on the veracity and content of the tweet.","Silva, Mirela; Ceschin, Fabr'icio; Shrestha, Prakash; Brant, Christopher; Gilda, Shlok; Fernandes, Juliana; Silva, Catia S.; Gr'egio, Andr'e; Oliveira, Daniela; Giovanini, Luiz",,618,10

Objectives: To explore the elderlys healthcare experiences during the lockdown and the problems that may have arisen regarding accessibility to the healthcare system and emerging adaptations to medical care. Methods: We coded the data using Atlas.ti 8 software and then triangled the analysis among researchers from different backgrounds. Finally, concept maps were developed and themes arising from these were described. Results: Thirty-nine participants were interviewed from the metropolitan area in Buenos Aires from April to July of 2020. The main emerging themes were: 1) access to regularly scheduled consults, 2) access to chronic medication, 3) emergency consultations, and 4) the role of information and communication technologies. Accessibility to the healthcare system was compromised due to reduced outpatient consultations, affecting health checkups, diagnosis, and treatment. However, participants tried to keep their immunizations up to date. Information and communication technologies were used to fill digital prescriptions and online medical consultations. While this was a solution to many, others did not have access to these technologies or had trouble using them. Conclusions: The global pandemic caused a reduction in outpatient medical consultations. Emerging needs originated new ways of carrying out medical consultations, mainly through information and communication technologies, which was a solution for many but led to the exclusion of others because of the preexisting technology gap.","Loza, Candela Agustina; Baez, German; Valverdi, Rodrigo; Pisula, Pedro; Salas Apaza, Julieta; Discacciati, Vilda; Granero, Mariano; Pizzorno, Ximena Salomé; Franco, Juan Víctor Ariel",Medwave,618,24

We investigated the consistency of the association between thalamus volume and cognition in MS for two common automated segmentation approaches, as well as fully manual outlining. METHODS: Standardized neuropsychological assessment and 3-Tesla 3D-T1-weighted brain MRI were collected (multi-center) from 57 MS patients and 17 healthy controls. Thalamus segmentations were generated manually and using five automated methods. Agreement between the algorithms and manual outlines was assessed with Bland-Altman plots; linear regression assessed the presence of proportional bias. The effect of segmentation method on the separation of cognitively impaired (CI) and preserved (CP) patients was investigated through Generalized Estimating Equations; associations with cognitive measures were investigated using linear mixed models, for each method and vendor. RESULTS: In smaller thalami, automated methods systematically overestimated volumes compared to manual segmentations [&#961;=(-0.42)-(-0.76); p-values < 0.001). All methods significantly distinguished CI from CP MS patients, except manual outlines of the left thalamus (p = 0.23). Poorer global neuropsychological test performance was significantly associated with smaller thalamus volumes bilaterally using all methods. Vendor significantly affected the findings. CONCLUSION: Automated and manual thalamus segmentation consistently demonstrated an association between thalamus atrophy and cognitive impairment in MS. However, a proportional bias in smaller thalami and choice of MRI acquisition system might impact the effect size of these findings.","Burggraaff, Jessica; Liu, Yao; Prieto, Juan C; Simoes, Jorge; de Sitter, Alexandra; Ruggieri, Serena; Brouwer, Iman; Lissenberg-Witte, Birgit I; Rocca, Mara A; Valsasina, Paola; Ropele, Stefan; Gasperini, Claudio; Gallo, Antonio; Pareto, Deborah; Sastre-Garriga, Jaume; Enzinger, Christian; Filippi, Massimo; De Stefano, Nicola; Ciccarelli, Olga; Hulst, Hanneke E; Wattjes, Mike P; Barkhof, Frederik; Uitdehaag, Bernard M J; Vrenken, Hugo; Guttmann, Charles R G",Neuroimage Clin,618,32

The understanding of the molecular mechanism of transmission and evolution is a prerequisite to foresee the trend of emerging vaccine-breakthrough variants and the design of mutation-proof vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. We integrate the genotyping of 1,489,884 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolates, 130 human antibodies, tens of thousands of mutational data points, topological data analysis, and deep learning to reveal SARS-CoV-2 evolution mechanism and forecast emerging vaccine-escape variants. We show that infectivity-strengthening and antibody-disruptive co-mutations on the S protein RBD can quantitatively explain the infectivity and virulence of all prevailing variants. We demonstrate that Lambda is as infectious as Delta but is more vaccine-resistant. We analyze emerging vaccine-breakthrough co-mutations in 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, Brazil, and Germany, etc. We envision that natural selection through infectivity will continue to be the main mechanism for viral evolution among unvaccinated populations, while antibody disruptive co-mutations will fuel the future growth of vaccine-breakthrough variants among fully vaccinated populations. Finally, we have identified the co-mutations that have the great likelihood of becoming dominant: [A411S, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, N501Y], [V401L, L452R, T478K], [K417N, L452R, T478K], [L452R, T478K, E484K, N501Y], and [P384L, K417N, E484K, N501Y].

In Poland, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD is offered by the National Health Fund only at selected hospital infusion centers. Patients with FB are considered at a high risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Some patients omitted infusions due to fear of infection or outbreaks in hospitals. Lack of alternative infusion sites hampered the situation. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on FD patients, especially their fears and expectations, the Polish FD Collaborative Group collaborated on a survey project. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September and November 2020, we distributed a customized survey exploring expectations and fears among FD subjects. RESULTS: Fifty-five individuals (35 receiving ongoing ERT) from different FD centers completed the study. The median age was 40 years [IQR 25; 50], and gender distribution was almost equal (27 F; 28 M). One-fourth of FD patients reported severe disability limiting transportation for infusions that, in the opinion of the other 25% of responders, consumed >4 h. Forty-four (80%) of all would prefer home infusions performed by a nurse (n = 37, 67.3%) or by a trained non-medical person (n = 7, 12.7%), while 8 (14.5%) patients would choose a local hospital. As expected, transportation time (in one direction) was longer in those preferring home infusions (89.4 ±63 vs 36.2 ±67 min; p = 0.02). Also, those with more severe FD manifestation would prefer home infusions to treatment in FD centers (p = 0.03). The vast majority of respondents (n = 46; 83%) would not change their preferences after pandemic termination. CONCLUSIONS: To maintain ERT, FD patients prefer home infusions or those given in the nearest hospital, especially during a pandemic.","Kusztal, Mariusz; Klopotowski, Mariusz; Bazan-Socha, Stanislawa; Blazejewska-Hyzorek, Beata; Pawlaczyk, Krzysztof; Oko, Andrzej; Krajewska, Magdalena; Nowicki, Michal",Adv Clin Exp Med,618,16

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to establish the level of knowledge about respiratory virus infections and the attitudes and practices among healthcare workers, leaders of infection control committees in hospitals of Bogotá, Colombia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a self-administered questionnaire of 28 items during the monthly meeting sponsored by the local health authority. ""Yes or no"" and ""true or false"" questions were applied to measure knowledge. Attitudes and practices were measured with a Likert-type scale according to the agreement degree. RESULTS: We surveyed 70 healthcare workers. Respondents demonstrated a good level of knowledge as 80% of them answered correctly more than five questions. A total of 54.4% showed a low degree of agreement when asked if their institutions have the policy to stay home when they are sick with respiratory symptoms and 67.1% never or rarely remain at home under such conditions. CONCLUSION: Healthcare worker leaders of infection control committees in Bogotá's ospitals have adequate knowledge about the prevention of seasonal respiratory viruses. There is a need for implementing urgent sick leave policies as a measure to prevent the spread of potential coronavirus infections in hospitals.","Cortés, Jorge Alberto; Espitia, Pilar; Rosero-Lasso, Yuliet Liliana",Biomedica,618,1

While COVID-19 has emerged as a monumental health threat for mass gathering events, heat illness must be acknowledged as a potentially large health threat for maintaining health services. We examined the number of COVID-19 admissions and the Tokyo rule for emergency medical care, in Tokyo, from March to September 2020, and investigated the weekly number of emergency transportations due to heat illness and weekly averages of the daily maximum Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) in Tokyo in the summer (2016-2020). The peak of emergency transportations due to heat illness overlapped the resurgence of COVID-19 in 2020, and an increase of heat illness patients and WBGT has been observed. Respect for robust science is critical for the decision-making process of mass gathering events during the pandemic, and science-based countermeasures and implementations for COVID-19 will be warranted. Without urgent reconsiderations and sufficient countermeasures, the double burden of COVID-19 and heat-related illnesses in Tokyo will overwhelm the healthcare provision system, and maintaining essential health services will be challenging during the 2021 summer Olympic and Paralympic Games.","Shimizu, Kazuki; Gilmour, Stuart; Mase, Hiromi; Le, Phuong Mai; Teshima, Ayaka; Sakamoto, Haruka; Nomura, Shuhei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,20

The current study aimed to identify the challenges faced by Israeli Air Force (IAF) career personnel. METHOD: A survey was conducted on 550 participants during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. The participants completed a questionnaire that dealt with unique challenges (personal, family, and command). RESULTS: Of 550 respondents, 54% reported low mood and irritability, 44% reported a constant feeling of anxiety, and 29% reported having sleep problems. Most of them (66%) were mainly concerned about infecting their family. The shift from normal work conditions to an unfamiliar capsule configuration concerned 58% of respondents. Functional continuity concerned 55% of respondents. Managing subordinates concerned 50% of the participants. Of the three types of challenges analyzed (personal, family, and command), the command challenge was the only one where the personal variables (military role, rank, and marital status) made no difference. Finally, about 30% of all respondents reported they needed professional support in dealing with the new circumstances. Their preferred platform was an easily accessible hotline. CONCLUSIONS: Life under the COVID-19 threat increased stress factors in the military career population. While reporting greater challenges and higher levels of stress, most of the respondents preferred a brief, focused consultation adjusted to the situation rather than conventional psychological help. The command challenge and the perceived responsibility stood above and beyond all variables examined in the present study.","Gordon, Shirley; Garbi, Dror; Ben Bassat, Shahar; Shapira, Shachar; Shelef, Leah",Mil. med,618,16

Compared to the pathognomonic symptoms of the named disease, homeopathic symptoms are always more helpful for homeopathic prescriptions. AIM: This study reports and summarizes the homeopathic symptoms observed in 18 confirmed/suspected epidemiologically related cases in cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in Hong Kong in early 2020. METHODS: Homeopathic symptoms from this case series were collected from 18 consecutive patients who, in addition to their concurrent conventional treatment or traditional Chinese medicine, actively sought help from homeopathy as an adjunctive measure for symptomatic relief from COVID-19. Cases were categorized according to outbreak clusters, focusing mainly on the homeopathic symptoms. In the analysis, frequency of all homeopathic medicines, common rubrics in all the cases, common rubrics in each of the top-ranked remedies, and differentiating symptoms for each top-ranked remedy were determined. RESULTS: Homeopathic symptoms of 18 cases, each identified as mild and belonging to one of six separate clusters, are reported. Eighteen common symptoms screened out of 79 selected rubrics constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures: Bryonia alba (n = 4) and Gelsemium sempervirens (n = 12). Eight and seven differentiating features, respectively, were identified for Bryonia alba and Gelsemium sempervirens. CONCLUSION: The common symptoms of 18 mild COVID-19 cases constituted two sets of homeopathic symptom pictures, indicating Bryonia alba or Gelsemium sempervirens; they were indicated in 4 and 12 cases, respectively, out of the 18 in total.","To, Ka Lun Aaron; Fok, Yuen Ying Yvonne",Homeopathy,618,16

This is largely due to the lack of trust in the diagnostic ability of non-stationary signals. To reach the level of clinical diagnostic application, classification using high-quality signal features is necessary. While there has been considerable progress in machine learning in recent years, especially deep learning, progress has been quite limited in the field of feature engineering. This study proposes a feature extraction algorithm based on group intelligence which we call a Plant Root System (PRS) algorithm. Importantly, the correlation between features produced by this PRS algorithm and traditional features is low, and the accuracy of several widely-used classifiers was found to be substantially improved with the addition of PRS features. It is expected that more biomedical signals can be applied to clinical diagnosis using the proposed algorithm.","Gong, Rui; Hase, Kazunori",,618,1

Because of that, SARS-CoV-2 was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30, 2020, by The World Health Organization (WHO). That's why many scientists are working on new methods to reduce further growth of new cases and, by intelligent patients allocation, reduce number of patients per doctor, what can lead to more successful treatments. However to properly manage the COVID-19 spread there is a need for real-time prediction models which can reliably support various decisions both at national and international level. The problem in developing such system is the lack of general knowledge how the virus spreads and what would be the number of cases each day. Therefore prediction model must be able to conclude the situation from past data in the way that results will show a future trend and will possibly closely relate to the real numbers. In our opinion Artificial Intelligence gives a possibility to do it. In this article we present a model which can work as a part of an online system as a real-time predictor to help in estimation of COVID-19 spread. This prediction model is developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to estimate the future situation by the use of geo-location and numerical data from past 2 weeks. The results of our model are confirmed by comparing them with real data and, during our research the model was correctly predicting the trend and very closely matching the numbers of new cases in each day.","Wieczorek, Michal; Silka, Jakub; Polap, Dawid; Wozniak, Marcin; Damasevicius, Robertas",PLoS One,618,16

Since neither country-level institutions nor firm-level factors alone offer satisfactory explanations for mobile money's success, we draw on institutional theory to uncover how firms interact with institutions in target markets and explain the adoption of mobile money services. We perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on 110 mobile money services from 46 emerging countries revealing four recipes for widespread adoption. In configuration 1, providers with high market power reach high adoption–irrespective of enabling institutions–if institutional voids are large. However, configurations 2 and 3 suggest that in most cases either enabling regulation or sufficient mobile and educational infrastructure are key for successful adoption. In these three configurations, providers are part of multinational telecommunication firms operating in markets with financial market voids. Configuration 4 suggests that certain fintech firms reach high adoption rates in more developed financial services sectors because they offer a broad scope of services. We highlight the usefulness of a configurational lens for institutional theory to understand phenomena at the intersection of innovation, society, and business – especially in emerging markets with complex institutional settings.","Kabengele, Christian Hahn Rüdiger",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,618,32

Building on an emerging literature connecting EESG with corporate compliance, this Essay argues that EESG is best understood as an extension of the board's duty to implement and monitor a compliance program under Caremark. If a company decides to do more than the legal minimum, it will simultaneously satisfy legitimate demands for strong EESG programs and promote compliance with the law. Building on that insight, we explain how boards can marry existing corporate compliance programs with budding EESG programs. By integrating compliance and EESG, corporations can meet growing societal demands in an effective and efficient manner that capitalizes on existing structures. Lastly, we address how EESG and corporate compliance responsibilities should be allocated at the board and senior management level. Instead of separating compliance and EESG oversight, this Essay suggests that boards embrace a functional approach, delegating similar compliance and EESG oversight to the same committee and managers. By situating EESG within the board's existing fiduciary duties, this Essay provides academics, legislators, investors, and managers with a novel framework to conceptualize EESG while also offering a path forward for boards struggling to place the current EESG movement within their existing corporate structure.","Strine, Leo E.; Jr.,; Smith, Kirby M.; Steel, Reilly S.",Iowa Law Review,618,24

Previous studies found that access to testing has not been equitable across several sociodemographic indicators. This study documents the preferred testing locations and examines differences across sociodemographic factors with a specific focus on race and ethnicity. METHODS: This study includes a primary analysis of cross-sectional data using a self-administered digital survey distributed to Arkansas residents using ARresearch, a volunteer research participant registry. The survey had 1288 responses, and 1221 met eligibility criteria for inclusion in the survey. Participants provided sociodemographic information and were asked to select up to 3 preferred testing locations from 12 options. Chi-square tests assessed differences in testing site preference across relevant sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: Participants preferred drive-through clinics as their top location for COVID-19 testing, with 55% reporting this was their preferred method of testing. This pattern was consistent across all comparison groups (ie, age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, insurance status). Significant differences in testing location preference were observed across age, race and ethnicity, and education, with the most differences observed across race and ethnicity. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that race and ethnicity are important to consider when deciding where to offer COVID-19 testing. The preferences for testing locations among the most vulnerable demographics will be used to develop targeted responses aimed at eliminating disparities in COVID-19 in Arkansas.","McElfish, Pearl A; Willis, Don E; Bryant-Moore, Keneshia; Rojo, Martha O; Andersen, Jennifer A; Kaminicki, Kyle F; James, Laura P",J Prim Care Community Health,618,1

In this study, developments in WRULD amongst students in the period 2004-2014 were investigated. Our findings can be a benchmark for future studies, in particular when there are major societal changes as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Differences in time (academic year), how long students have been studying (year of studying), relations with computer time and societal changes were points of interest. METHODS: 2254 students (average age 20.0 years) responded to a questionnaire on WRULD. Students experiencing complaints were further questioned about the severity of complaints and associated body locations. RESULTS: The average percentage of students experiencing complaints was 57%. The highest prevalence rates and severity scores were found in the first and last recorded academic years. The neck, shoulder, back and wrist were most often indicated. The prevalence of complaints raised from the 1st (49%) to the 4th (75%) year of studying. Two seriousness measures showed highest scores in the 5th/6th/7th year of studying. Relations were found between both the prevalence and seriousness of complaints with reported computer time. CONCLUSIONS: After an initial decreasing trend from the academic year 2006/2007 to 2010/2011 there was an increase in WRULD amongst students from 2010/2011 to 2013/2014. Limiting financial and study time factors may have played a role. Structural attention for WRULD prevention and risk factors seems to be effective in reducing prevalence and severity of WRULD. This seems to be even more necessary due to recent COVID-related changes in the students' lives.","Dekker, Marijke C; van Egmond, René; Molenbroek, Johan F M; Vink, Peter",Work,618,26

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) of this vaccine. METHODS: We did two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies at two hospitals in Russia. We enrolled healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18-60 years to both studies. In phase 1 of each study, we administered intramuscularly on day 0 either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S and assessed the safety of the two components for 28 days. In phase 2 of the study, which began no earlier than 5 days after phase 1 vaccination, we administered intramuscularly a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21. Primary outcome measures were antigen-specific humoral immunity (SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies measured by ELISA on days 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42) and safety (number of participants with adverse events monitored throughout the study). Secondary outcome measures were antigen-specific cellular immunity (T-cell responses and interferon-Î³ concentration) and change in neutralising antibodies (detected with a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay). These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04436471 and NCT04437875. FINDINGS: Between June 18 and Aug 3, 2020, we enrolled 76 participants to the two studies (38 in each study). In each study, nine volunteers received rAd26-S in phase 1, nine received rAd5-S in phase 1, and 20 received rAd26-S and rAd5-S in phase 2. Both vaccine formulations were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were pain at injection site (44 [58%]), hyperthermia (38 [50%]), headache (32 [42%]), asthenia (21 [28%]), and muscle and joint pain (18 [24%]). Most adverse events were mild and no serious adverse events were detected. All participants produced antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein. At day 42, receptor binding domain-specific IgG titres were 14â703 with the frozen formulation and 11â143 with the lyophilised formulation, and neutralising antibodies were 49·25 with the frozen formulation and 45·95 with the lyophilised formulation, with a seroconversion rate of 100%. Cell-mediated responses were detected in all participants at day 28, with median cell proliferation of 2·5% CD4+ and 1·3% CD8+ with the frozen formulation, and a median cell proliferation of 1·3% CD4+ and 1·1% CD8+ with the lyophilised formulation.

Participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire 3 weeks after lockdown implementation, evaluating their lifestyle behaviour focusing on self-reported and objectively assessed physical activity.1154 medical (59.5%) and 786 non-medical (40.5%) students were included (median age 22.0 [IQR, 20.0-25.0], 71.5% female). Physical activity decreased in both groups after lockdown implementation. During lockdown, medical students reported higher physical activity levels compared to non-medical students. This was corroborated by daily step count data assessed by wearables (median steps per day [IQR], 6979 [5218-9348] versus 6581 [4497-8491], p = 0.02). Smoking behaviour during lockdown did not differ between medical and non-medical students (increased in 11.8% vs 13.6%, decreased in 31.9% versus 36.9%).During the COVID-19 pandemic, alteration of lifestyle behaviour among medical students was significantly different compared to non-medical students.

Lipids, particularly ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids, together form lamellar membranes in the extracellular spaces of the SC that limit the loss of water and electrolytes. In addition to preventing water and electrolyte loss, the SC as a permeability barrier prevents the entry of harmful irritants, allergens, and microorganisms into the skin. Disruption of the epidermal barrier leads to skin that is irritated, more reactive, and more sensitive than normal skin. SC thickness, lipid profile, and barrier function vary with different ethnic groups, which is also reflected the differences in prevalence and manifestation of diverse skin conditions related to the skin barrier function such as atopic dermatitis and sensitive skin. In addition to these compromised skin barrier related conditions, we are just now starting to understand the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on the skin and how current preventative measures are contributing to skin barrier disorders. Our understanding of various approaches for restoration of skin barrier, especially the role of topically applied mixtures of cholesterol, ceramides, and essential/nonessential free fatty acids (FFAs) allows for the strengthening of the compromised skin barrier and alleviation of symptoms and discomfort associated with skin barrier disorders. Ceramide containing products on the market are commonly available and offer protection and reparative benefits to the skin barrier.

The purpose of this study was to determine the financial impact of these changes on arthroplasty surgeons. METHODS: We queried data for 35 arthroplasty surgeons within our practice from 10/2019 to 10/2020 and captured all office and arthroplasty-related surgical procedure codes. We compared the difference in both work relative value units (RVUs) and Medicare reimbursement by surgeon based on the current 2020 PFS to the 2021 changes. We also estimated the impact of several proposals to include office increases to the global surgical package for each code. RESULTS: While the mean per surgeon RVU amount for primary arthroplasty procedures will decrease (6267 vs 6,088, P = .78), the mean office work RVU (2755 vs 3,220, P = .16) will increase in 2021. However, the reduction in surgical reimbursement ($530,076 in 2020 to $464,414 in 2021) far exceeds the gains from the office ($99,456 vs $107,374), leading to an overall decrease in reimbursement ($629,532 vs $571,788), a reduction of 9%. The passage of the coronavirus disease 2019 relief bill delays many of the PFS cuts and will result in an overall reduction in reimbursement of 2.4% ($629,532 vs $612,475, P = .61). CONCLUSION: Arthroplasty surgeons are projected to lose 2.4% of Medicare reimbursement in 2021 with the changes in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services PFS. Further study is needed to determine whether these cuts will limit access to care for Medicare patients.","Krueger, Chad A; Courtney, P Maxwell",J. arthroplasty,618,22

We present a community-led intervention in Latino communities that integrated social services in mental health service delivery for an equity-based response. METHODS: We used tracking sheets to identify 1,436 unique participants (aged 5-86) enrolled in Latino Health Access's Emotional Wellness program, of whom 346 enrolled in the pre-COVID-19 period (March 2019-February 2020) and 1,090 in the COVID-19 period (March-June 2020). Demographic characteristics and types of services were aggregated to assess monthly trends using Pearson &#967;2 tests. Regression models were developed to compare factors associated with referrals in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. RESULTS: During the pandemic, service volume (P < .001) and participant volume (P < .001) increased significantly compared with the prepandemic period. Participant characteristics were similar during both periods, the only differences being age distribution, expanded geographic range, and increased male participation during the pandemic. Nonreferred services, such as peer support, increased during the pandemic period. Type of referrals significantly changed from primarily mental health services and disease management in the prepandemic period to affordable housing support, food assistance, and supplemental income. CONCLUSION: An effective mental health program in response to the pandemic must incorporate direct mental health services and address social needs that exacerbate mental health risk for Latino communities.

Although nucleic acid detection methods such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the gold standard, during the current pandemic, the deployment of RT-PCR tests has been extremely slow, and key reagents such as PCR primers and RNA extraction kits are at critical shortages. Rapid point-of-care viral antigen detection methods have been previously employed for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses. Therefore, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in patient samples could also be used for diagnosis of active infection, and alternative methodologies for specific and sensitive viral protein detection should be explored. Targeted mass spectrometry techniques have enabled the identification and quantitation of a defined subset of proteins/peptides at single amino acid resolution with attomole level sensitivity and high reproducibility. Herein, we report a targeted mass spectrometry assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleoprotein in a relevant biological matrix. Recombinant full-length spike protein and nucleoprotein were digested and proteotypic peptides were selected for parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) quantitation using a high-resolution Orbitrap instrument. A spectral library, which contained seven proteotypic peptides (four from spike protein and three from nucleoprotein) and the top three to four transitions, was generated and evaluated. From the original spectral library, we selected two best performing peptides for the final PRM assay. The assay was evaluated using mock test samples containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions, added to in vitro derived mucus. The PRM assay provided a limit of detection of â¼200 attomoles and a limit of quantitation of â¼ 390 attomoles. Extrapolating from the test samples, the projected titer of virus particles necessary for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleoprotein detection was approximately 2 × 105 viral particles/mL, making it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR assays. Potentially, mass spectrometry-based methods for viral antigen detection may deliver higher throughput and could serve as a complementary diagnostic tool to RT-PCR. Furthermore, this assay could be used to evaluate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in archived or recently collected biological fluids, in vitro-derived research materials, and wastewater samples.","Cazares, Lisa H; Chaerkady, Raghothama; Samuel Weng, Shao Huan; Boo, Chelsea C; Cimbro, Raffaello; Hsu, Hsiang-En; Rajan, Sarav; Dall039,; Acqua, William; Clarke, Lori; Ren, Kuishu; McTamney, Patrick; Kallewaard-LeLay, Nicole; Ghaedi, Mahboobe; Ikeda, Yasuhiro; Hess, Sonja",Anal Chem,618,20

A still open gap in that literature is that statistical and ensemble learning approaches systematically present lower predictive performance than deep learning methods. They generally disregard the data sequence aspect entangled with multivariate data represented in more than one time series. Conversely, this work presents a novel neural network architecture for time-series forecasting that combines the power of graph evolution with deep recurrent learning on distinct data distributions; we named our method Recurrent Graph Evolution Neural Network (ReGENN). The idea is to infer multiple multivariate relationships between co-occurring time-series by assuming that the temporal data depends not only on inner variables and intra-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate weights arising from ReGENN, showing that by looking at inter and intra-temporal relationships simultaneously, time-series forecasting is majorly improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously evolve.","Spadon, Gabriel; Hong, Shenda; Brandoli, Bruno; Matwin, Stan; Rodrigues-Jr, Jose Fernando; Sun, Jimeng",,618,16

By February 2020, several countries were reporting imported SARS-CoV-2 cases. To contain the virus, early detection of imported SARS-CoV-2 cases is critical. We used air travel volume estimates from Wuhan, China, to international destinations and a generalized linear regression model to identify locations that could have undetected imported cases. Our model can be adjusted to account for exportation of cases from other locations as the virus spreads and more information on importations and transmission becomes available. Early detection and appropriate control measures can reduce the risk for transmission in all locations.","De Salazar, Pablo Martinez; Niehus, René; Taylor, Aimee; Buckee, Caroline O039; Flaherty,; Lipsitch, Marc",Emerg Infect Dis,618,1

In this research, we introduce some training techniques that help the network learn better when we have an unbalanced dataset (fewer cases of COVID-19 along with more cases from other classes). We also propose a neural network that is a concatenation of the Xception and ResNet50V2 networks. This network achieved the best accuracy by utilizing multiple features extracted by two robust networks. For evaluating our network, we have tested it on 11302 images to report the actual accuracy achievable in real circumstances.

Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19. We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment. We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon.","Marino, A; Varisco, T; Quattrocchi, G; Amoroso, A; Beltrami, D; Venturiello, S; Ripamonti, A; Villa, A; Andreotti, M; Ciuffreda, M; Cimaz, R",Reumatismo,618,12

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the contemporary trends and geographic variation in ARF and ARDS-related mortality in the United States? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the National Center for Health Statistics' nationwide mortality data was conducted to assess the ARF and ARDS-related mortality trends from 2014 through 2018 and the geographic distribution of ARF and ARDS-related deaths in 2018 for all American residents. Piecewise linear regression was used to evaluate the trends in age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) in the overall population and various demographic subgroups of age, sex, race, urbanization, and region. RESULTS: Among 1,434,349 ARF-related deaths and 52,958 ARDS-related deaths during the study period, the AAMR was highest in older individuals (&#8805; 65 years), non-Hispanic Black people, and those living in the nonmetropolitan region. The AAMR for ARF-related deaths (per 100,000 people) increased from 74.9 (95% CI, 74.6-75.2) in 2014 to 85.6 (95% CI, 85.3-85.9) in 2018 (annual percentage change [APC], 3.4 [95% CI, 2.2-4.6]; Ptrend = .003). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARDS-related deaths was 3.2 (95% CI, 3.2-3.3) in 2014 and 3.0 (95% CI, 3.0-3.1 in 2018; APC, -0.9 [95% CI, -5.4 to 3.8]; Ptrend = .56). The observed increase in rates for ARF mortality was consistent across the subgroups of age, sex, race or ethnicity, urbanization status, and geographical region (Ptrend < .05 for all). The AAMR (per 100,000 people) for ARF (91.3 [95% CI, 90.8-91.8]) and ARDS-related mortality (3.3 [95% CI, 3.2-3.4]) in 2018 were highest in the South. INTERPRETATION: The ARF-related mortality increased at approximately 3.4% annually, and ARDS-related mortality showed a lack of decline in the last 5 years. These data contextualize important health information to guide priorities for research, clinical care, and policy, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the United States.","Parcha, Vibhu; Kalra, Rajat; Bhatt, Surya P; Berra, Lorenzo; Arora, Garima; Arora, Pankaj",Chest,618,10

Participants underwent either the Stroop task - a highly demanding cognitive task (CT) - or a control condition (CON) in which they viewed a documentary exhibition for 30 minutes. Perception of MF and motivation were assessed after treatments using a visual analog scale of 100 mm. Participants then engaged in a countermovement jump (CMJ) test and three sets of HBSE until they reached momentary concentric failure, reporting RPE at the end of each exercise set. Following the CT, participants showed a significantly increased self-perception of MF in relation to the CON condition (p = 0.01; d = 1.2), but this did not affect their motivation to engage in subsequent tests (p = 0.99; d = 0.006). Neither the CMJ performances nor the RPE were statistically different between CT and CON conditions (p = 0.33; d = 0.09 and p = 0.20; Î·2 = 0.20, respectively). TTV was significantly lower in the CT relative to the CON experimental condition (&#916; = -15.8%; p = 0.04; Î·2 = 0.48).

Demonstrating the ability to mount an appropriate antibody response in the presence of hyperglycaemia is relevant for the comprehension of mechanisms related to the observed worse clinical outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia in patients with diabetes and for the development of any future vaccination campaign to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Using a highly specific and sensitive measurement of antibodies by fluid-phase luciferase immunoprecipitation assays, we characterised the IgG, IgM and IgA response against multiple antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 509 patients with documented diagnosis of COVID-19, prospectively followed at our institution. We analysed clinical outcomes and antibody titres according to the presence of hyperglycaemia, i.e., either diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes, at the time of, or during, hospitalisation. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed COVID-19, 139 (27.3%) had diabetes: 90 (17.7%) had diabetes diagnosed prior to the hospital admission (comorbid diabetes) while 49 (9.6%) had diabetes diagnosed at the time of admission (newly diagnosed). Diabetes was associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers and hypercoagulopathy, as well as leucocytosis and neutrophilia. Diabetes was independently associated with risk of death (HR 2.32 [95% CI 1.44, 3.75], p = 0.001), even after adjustment for age, sex and other relevant comorbidities. Moreover, a strong association between higher glucose levels and risk of death was documented irrespective of diabetes diagnosis (HR 1.14 × 1.1 mmol/l [95% CI 1.08, 1.21], p < 0.001). The humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with diabetes was present and superimposable, as for timing and antibody titres, to that of non-diabetic patients, with marginal differences, and was not influenced by glucose levels. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was predictive of survival rate, both in the presence or absence of diabetes. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The observed increased severity and mortality risk of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with hyperglycaemia was not the result of an impaired humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. RBD IgG positivity was associated with a remarkable protective effect, allowing for a cautious optimism about the efficacy of future vaccines against SARs-COV-2 in people with diabetes.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered excellent alternatives. Among them, D-cateslytin (D-Ctl, derivative of a host defense peptide) has shown high efficiency against a broad spectrum of bacteria. The first target of AMPs is the outer membrane of the bacterium. However, the role of bacterial cell-wall structures on D-Ctl's mechanism of action has not yet been understood. In this study, we investigated the activity of D-Ctl on two isogenic strains of E. coli: one is devoid of any parietal structures; the other constitutively overexpresses only type 1 fimbriae. We studied the damage caused by D-Ctl at several initial concentrations of bacteria and D-Ctl, and exposure times to D-Ctl were examined using a combination of epifluorescence microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR). The analysis of nanomechanical and spectrochemical properties related to the antibacterial mechanism showed a concentration dependent activity. Whereas the membrane permeabilization was evidenced for all concentrations of D-Ctl and both mutants, no pore formation was observed. The bacterial stiffness is modified dramatically concomitantly to major membrane damage and changes in the spectral fingerprints of the bacteria. In the case of the occurrence of type 1 fimbriae only, an intracellular activity was additionally detected. Our results evidenced that D-Ctl activity is highly impacted by the cell-wall external structures and surface properties of the bacteria.","Quilès, Fabienne; Barth, Danielle; Peric, Oliver; Fantner, Georg E; Francius, Grégory",ACS chem. biol.

Here, we updated the meta-analysis with more studies and additional assessments that include adults and children within the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Sixteen articles (22 studies) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using three genetic models (allele, recessive and dominant), in which ARDS patients were compared with non-ARDS patients (A1) and healthy controls (A2). Mortality outcomes were also assessed (A3). The influence of covariates was examined by meta-regression. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple pooled associations. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Asians, Caucasians) and life stage (adults, children) were conducted. Heterogeneity was addressed with outlier treatment. RESULTS: This meta-analysis generated 68 comparisons, 21 of which were significant. Of the 21, four A1 and three A3 highly significant (Pa = 0.00001-0.0008) outcomes withstood Bonferroni correction. For A1, allele and recessive associations were found in overall (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.61), Caucasians (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.61) and children (ORs 0.49-0.66, 95% CI 0.33-0.84) analyses. For A3, associations were found in overall (dominant: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.68) and Asian subgroup (allele/ dominant: ORs 0.31-0.39, 95% CIs 0.18-0.63) analyses. These outcomes were either robust, or statistically powered or both and uninfluenced by covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the risk of ALI/ARDS were indicated in Caucasians and children as well as in Asians in mortality analysis. These findings were underpinned by high significance, high statistical power and robustness.

In contrast, data from emergency medical services (EMS) provide a source of information nearly in real time that may be useful for rapid and more granular surveillance of overdose mortality. Objective: To describe racial/ethnic, social, and geographic trends in EMS-observed overdose-associated cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic through December 2020 and assess the concordance with CDC-reported provisional total overdose mortality through May 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included more than 11â¯000 EMS agencies in 49 US states that participate in the National EMS Information System and 83.7 million EMS activations in which patient contact was made. Exposures: Year and month of occurrence of overdose-associated cardiac arrest; patient race/ethnicity; census region and division; county-level urbanicity; and zip code-level racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and educational attainment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overdose-associated cardiac arrests per 100â¯000 EMS activations with patient contact in 2020 were compared with a baseline of values from 2018 and 2019. Aggregate numbers of overdose-associated cardiac arrests and percentage increases were compared with provisional total mortality in CDC records from rolling 12-month windows with end months spanning January 2018 through July 2020. Results: Among 33.4 million EMS activations in 2020, 16.8 million (50.2%) involved female patients and 16.3 million (48.8%) involved non-Hispanic White individuals. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests were elevated by 42.1% nationally in 2020 (42.3 per 100â¯000 EMS activations at baseline vs 60.1 per 100â¯000 EMS activations in 2020). The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (r = 0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90â¯632 (95% CI, 85â¯737-95â¯525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","Friedman, Joseph; Mann, N Clay; Hansen, Helena; Bourgois, Philippe; Braslow, Joel; Bui, Alex A T; Beletsky, Leo; Schriger, David L","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

Moreover, the high-sensitive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics are contingent on an RNA extraction step, which, in turn, is restricted by constraints in the supply chain. Here, we present CASSPIT (Cas13 Assisted Saliva-based & Smartphone Integrated Testing), which will allow direct use of saliva samples without the need for an extra RNA extraction step for SARS-CoV-2 detection. CASSPIT utilizes CRISPR-Cas13a based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection, and lateral-flow assay (LFA) readout of the test results. The sample preparation workflow includes an optimized chemical treatment and heat inactivation method, which, when applied to COVID-19 clinical samples, showed a 97% positive agreement with the RNA extraction method. With CASSPIT, LFA based visual limit of detection (LoD) for a given SARS-CoV-2 RNA spiked into the saliva samples was ~200 copies; image analysis-based quantification further improved the analytical sensitivity to ~100 copies. Upon validation of clinical sensitivity on RNA extraction-free saliva samples (n = 76), a 98% agreement between the lateral-flow readout and RT-qPCR data was found (Ct<35). To enable user-friendly test results with provision for data storage and online consultation, we subsequently integrated lateral-flow strips with a smartphone application. We believe CASSPIT will eliminate our reliance on RT-qPCR by providing comparable sensitivity and will be a step toward establishing nucleic acid-based point-of-care (POC) testing for COVID-19.","Azmi, Iqbal; Faizan, Md Imam; Kumar, Rohit; Raj Yadav, Siddharth; Chaudhary, Nisha; Kumar Singh, Deepak; Butola, Ruchika; Ganotra, Aryan; Datt Joshi, Gopal; Deep Jhingan, Gagan; Iqbal, Jawed; Joshi, Mohan C; Ahmad, Tanveer",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,618,16

METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous online survey, shared via social media and targeting children and adolescents aged 1-18 years, subdivided into age groups: 1-3, 4-5, 6-12, and 13-18 years. Caregivers completed a modified version of the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC), along with demographic information. RESULTS: The final sample consisted of 4314 subjects: 2217 males (50.4%) and 2097 females (49.6%). Age group distribution was: 1-3 years 1263 (29.3%), 4-5 years 893 (20.7%), 6-12 years 1848 (42.8%) and 13-18 years 310 (7.2%). We found a significant delay in bedtime and risetime in all age groups. School-age children and adolescents experienced the most significant delay: weekday bedtime &#8805;23 was reported by 28.4% of 6- to 12-year-old children during lockdown vs. 0.9% before and by 63.5% vs. 12.3% of 13- to 18-year-old adolescents. Risetime was also delayed with most subjects waking up after 8 in all age groups and sleep duration increased in all groups but not in the younger group. The screen time (excluding online lessons) boosted during the lockdown, mainly in older children but also in younger children. Sleep disorders increased in all groups but not in adolescents. Younger groups had an increased prevalence of difficulty falling asleep, anxiety at bedtime, night awakenings, nightmares and sleep terrors. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that confinement due to COVID-19 determined a big delay in sleep/wake schedule of children in all age groups as well as an increase of sleep disturbances in all groups but adolescents.","Bruni, Oliviero; Malorgio, Emanuela; Doria, Mattia; Finotti, Elena; Spruyt, Karen; Melegari, Maria Grazia; Villa, Maria Pia; Ferri, Raffaele",Sleep medicine,618,16

The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine expresses a stabilized spike protein from the WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2, and has recently demonstrated protective efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 in humans in several geographical regions-including in South Africa, where 95% of sequenced viruses in cases of COVID-19 were the B.1.351 variant3. Here we show that Ad26.COV2.S elicits humoral and cellular immune responses that cross-react with the B.1.351 variant and protects against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Ad26.COV2.S induced lower binding and neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351 as compared to WA1/2020, but elicited comparable CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against the WA1/2020, B.1.351, B.1.1.7, P.1 and CAL.20C variants. B.1.351 infection of control rhesus macaques resulted in higher levels of virus replication in bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal swabs than did WA1/2020 infection. Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against both WA1/2020 and B.1.351, although we observed higher levels of virus in vaccinated macaques after B.1.351 challenge. These data demonstrate that Ad26.COV2.S provided robust protection against B.1.351 challenge in rhesus macaques. Our findings have important implications for vaccine control of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Yu, Jingyou; Tostanoski, Lisa H; Mercado, Noe B; McMahan, Katherine; Liu, Jinyan; Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Chandrashekar, Abishek; Atyeo, Caroline; Martinez, David R; Anioke, Tochi; Bondzie, Esther A; Chang, Aiquan; Gardner, Sarah; Giffin, Victoria M; Hope, David L; Nampanya, Felix; Nkolola, Joseph; Patel, Shivani; Sanborn, Owen; Sellers, Daniel; Wan, Huahua; Hayes, Tammy; Bauer, Katherine; Pessaint, Laurent; Valentin, Daniel; Flinchbaugh, Zack; Brown, Renita; Cook, Anthony; Bueno-Wilkerson, Deandre; Teow, Elyse; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G; Martinot, Amanda J; Baric, Ralph S; Alter, Galit; Wegmann, Frank; Zahn, Roland; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Barouch, Dan H",Nature,618,1

Research has not explored whether this increased risk is consistent across the US. OBJECTIVE: This study compared COVID-19 case-fatality rates among people with IDD in 11 states and the District of Columbia that are publicly reporting data. METHODS: Cumulative data reported through March 31 - April 13, 2021 were analyzed. Case-fatality rates and risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals for IDD settings were compared the overall case-fatality rate for the jurisdictions from Johns Hopkins' Center for Systems Science and Engineering COVID-19 data. RESULTS: Settings were reported as receiving any services, community or institutional residential services, or living in own/family home. Comparison of case-fatality rates between people with IDD and their respective jurisdiction populations demonstrates that case-fatality rates were consistently higher for people with IDD living in congregate residential settings (fifteen instances) and receiving 24/7 nursing services (two instances). Results were mixed for people with IDD living in their own or a family home (eight instances). CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight that people with IDD, especially those living in residential settings, are experiencing higher case-fatality rates from COVID-19 than the general population across multiple US jurisdictions. Short-term and long-term public health interventions addressing COVID-19 risks will not be able to properly address the needs of people with IDD until all states begin reporting COVID-19 outcomes for this population.","Landes, Scott D; Turk, Margaret A; Ervin, David A",Disabil Health J,618,6

The majority of patients with isolated lymph node involvement appear to harbor occult metastatic disease. Still, LND is not associated with increased perioperative morbidity when performed in experienced centers.

METHODS: We present two cases of COVID-19 which presented with unilateral otalgia and ipsilateral pulsatile headaches involving the temporal area. They were referred to the otolaryngology team of assessment of otalgia and subsequently referred to the ophthalmology team for possible Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). Both patients had no jaw claudication, scalp pain or tenderness. RESULTS: Serology testing showed raised C-Reactive Protein (CRP) but normal platelets and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Case 1 was tested for COVID-19 as part of a preoperative workup which returned positive. With a marked similarity in presentation, Case 2 was tested for COVID-19 which also returned positive. CONCLUSION: These two cases highlight another set of symptoms that COVID-19 patients may present with. In the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, if a patient presents symptoms similar to GCA but with isolated CRP, it should prompt consideration for COVID testing.","Au, Benjamin Wai Yin; Ku, Dominic Joey; Shivanand, Sheth",J. neuro-ophthalmol,618,21

METHODS: We identified patients from nine Seattle-area hospitals who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Clinical data were obtained through review of medical records. The data reported here are those available through March 23, 2020. Each patient had at least 14 days of follow-up. RESULTS: We identified 24 patients with confirmed Covid-19. The mean (±SD) age of the patients was 64±18 years, 63% were men, and symptoms began 7±4 days before admission. The most common symptoms were cough and shortness of breath; 50% of patients had fever on admission, and 58% had diabetes mellitus. All the patients were admitted for hypoxemic respiratory failure; 75% (18 patients) needed mechanical ventilation. Most of the patients (17) also had hypotension and needed vasopressors. No patient tested positive for influenza A, influenza B, or other respiratory viruses. Half the patients (12) died between ICU day 1 and day 18, including 4 patients who had a do-not-resuscitate order on admission. Of the 12 surviving patients, 5 were discharged home, 4 were discharged from the ICU but remained in the hospital, and 3 continued to receive mechanical ventilation in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 3 weeks of the Covid-19 outbreak in the Seattle area, the most common reasons for admission to the ICU were hypoxemic respiratory failure leading to mechanical ventilation, hypotension requiring vasopressor treatment, or both.

Methods: this was a cross-sectional descriptive study among HCWs in a tertiary hospital in South-western Nigeria that assessed the level of implementation of the WHO COVID-19 RRRHW document using a closed ended structured questionnaire. Results: five hundred and thirty-five HCWs participated in the study comprising 165(30.8%) males and 370(69.2%) females. Majority (87.3%) of the HCWs were 40 years and below. One hundred and sixty-three (30.5%) of the HCWs had been involved in the care of COVID-19 patients; less than 60% of the respondents were aware of the presence of an official platform for dissemination of information on suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 435(81.3%) were aware of hospital training on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); 191(35.7%) have had uninterrupted supplies of personal protective equipment(PPE) and IPC materials; 211(39.4%) were aware of mental and counselling services in the hospital while only 106(19.8%) knew how to access these services; 289(54%) have attended IPC training and 307(57.4%) are able to don and doff PPE.

Carbamazepine, the most well-known psychotropic drug, can cause substantial hyponatremia. Methylphenidate, a piperidine derivative structurally related to amphetamines, acts as a central nervous system stimulant. The current study evaluated whether methylphenidate affects hematological and biochemical parameters of patients diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.Patients undergoing treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at our Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic were enrolled in the study. Blood samples for complete blood count and common biochemical analyses were collected before patients started methylphenidate and after 3 months of continuous treatment.Participants included 64 patients comprised the study cohort. There were 48 (75%) males and 16 (25%) females, with a median age of 16 years (range 11-31). The total median potassium level decreased by 0.6âmg/dL (Pâ<â.0001), while glucose rose by 15âmg/dL (Pâ<â.0001), sodium decreased in 0.7meq/L, (Pâ=â.006).

To this end we utilize data mining, social network analysis, natural language processing techniques. Each examined internet platform was analyzed for representativeness and composition of the target group. We identified three temporal major cluster of the interest before disease introduction on the topic COVID-2019: China- and Italy-related peaks on all platforms, as well as a peak on social media related to the recent special law on combating COVID-2019. Besides, there was a peak in interest on the day of officially confirmed introduction as well as an exponential increase of interest when the Polish government declared war against disease with a massive mitigation program. From sociolingistic perspective, we found that concepts and issues of threat, fear and prevention prevailed before introduction. After introduction, practical concepts about disease and epidemic dominate. We have found out that Twitter reflected the structural division of the Polish political sphere. We were able to identify clear communities of governing party, mainstream oppostition and protestant group and potential sources of misinformation.

In mammalian species oligomannose N-glycans can have up to 9 Man; meanwhile structures can grow to over 200 units in yeast mannan. The highly dynamic nature, branching complexity, and 3D structure of oligomannoses have been recently highlighted for their roles in immune escape and infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2. The architectural features that allow these N-glycans to perform their functions are yet unclear, due to their intrinsically disordered nature that hinders their structural characterization. In this work we will discuss the results of over 54 µs of cumulative sampling by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of differently processed, free (not protein-linked) oligomannose N-glycans common in vertebrates. We then discuss the effects of a protein surface on their structural equilibria based on over 4 µs cumulative MD sampling of the fully glycosylated CD16a Fc Î³ receptor (FcÎ³RIIIa), where the type of glycosylation is known to modulate its binding affinity for IgG1s, regulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results show that the protein's structural constraints shift the oligomannoses conformational ensemble to promote conformers that satisfy the steric requirements and hydrogen bonding networks demanded by the protein's surface landscape. More importantly, we find that the protein does not actively distort the N-glycans into structures not populated in the unlinked forms in solution. Ultimately, the highly populated conformations of the Man5 linked glycans support experimental evidence of high levels of hybrid complex forms at N45 and show a specific presentation of the arms at N162, which may be involved in mediating binding affinity to the IgG1 Fc.","Fogarty, Carl A; Fadda, Elisa",J Phys Chem B,618,14

Specifically, using cross-national index data from the World Value Survey, the study tests how variations in social trust across countries generate different time durations at which each country reaches the peak in terms of increases in new infections of COVID-19. Using data drawn between December 31, 2019 and July 31, 2020, this study found that in countries with a high level of social trust, particularly trust among ingroup members, or with a narrower or wider range than the intermediate range of trustees, the number of new infections tended to reach the first peak within a shorter time duration than in other countries. These results imply that in such societies, on the one hand, high cooperation among people to achieve common goals and strong compliance to social norms may allow them to begin neutralizing COVID-19 faster. On the other hand, however, the low risk perception and prevalence of cohesive relationships among people may lead to speedier transmission of COVID-19 before neutralization takes place.","Min, Jungwon",PLoS One,618,1

We investigate whether HOF detection can profit by taking into account the relationships between HOF and similar concepts: (a) HOF is related to sentiment analysis because hate speech is typically a negative statement and expresses a negative opinion; (b) it is related to emotion analysis, as expressed hate points to the author experiencing (or pretending to experience) anger while the addressees experience (or are intended to experience) fear. (c) Finally, one constituting element of HOF is the mention of a targeted person or group. On this basis, we hypothesize that HOF detection shows improvements when being modeled jointly with these concepts, in a multi-task learning setup. We base our experiments on existing data sets for each of these concepts (sentiment, emotion, target of HOF) and evaluate our models as a participant (as team IMS-SINAI) in the HASOC FIRE 2021 English Subtask 1A. Based on model-selection experiments in which we consider multiple available resources and submissions to the shared task, we find that the combination of the CrowdFlower emotion corpus, the SemEval 2016 Sentiment Corpus, and the OffensEval 2019 target detection data leads to an F1 =.79 in a multi-head multi-task learning model based on BERT, in comparison to .7895 of plain BERT. On the HASOC 2019 test data, this result is more substantial with an increase by 2pp in F1 and a considerable increase in recall. Across both data sets (2019, 2021), the recall is particularly increased for the class of HOF (6pp for the 2019 data and 3pp for the 2021 data), showing that MTL with emotion, sentiment, and target identification is an appropriate approach for early warning systems that might be deployed in social media platforms.","Plaza-del-Arco, Flor Miriam; Halat, Sercan; Pad'o, Sebastian; Klinger, Roman",,618,26

They were divided into the arthroscopic group (n = 28) and the open group (n = 32). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS),visual analog scale (VAS), and Karlsson scores and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes pre-operatively and at six and 12 months and the final follow-up of at least 24 months post-operatively, with SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores evaluated for quality of life, and the anterior talar translation and talar tilt measurements for radiologic outcomes. RESULTS: There was no difference in pre-operative demographics between two groups (P > 0.05). At the final follow-up, the AOFAS, VAS, Karlsson, SF-36 PCS, and MCS scores improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.05).

OBJECTIVE: To provide a nationwide analysis on hospitalized PD patients in Germany and evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an administrative claims database covering 1468 hospitals and 5,210,432 patient hospitalizations including a total of 30,872 COVID-19+ cases between January 16 and May 15, 2020. RESULTS: Compared to 2019, hospitalizations for PD transiently decreased by up to 72.7% in 2020. COVID-19 frequency was significantly higher in the population of 64,434 PD patients (693 being COVID-19+ ) than in non-PD patients (1.1% vs. 0.6%, P < 0.001), especially in subjects with advanced age (&#8805; 65 years). Regarding established COVID-19 risk comorbidities, COVID-19+ inpatients with PD showed higher incidences than non-PD COVID-19+ subjects, particularly hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Advanced age and male sex were significantly more frequent in COVID-19+ than in COVID-19- PD patients. The COVID-19 inpatient mortality rate was much higher in PD patients than in non-PD patients (35.4% vs. 20.7%, P < 0.001), especially in patients aged 75-79 years. Of note, overall inpatient mortality of PD patients was significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (5.7% vs. 4.9%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PD inpatients are more frequently affected by COVID-19 and suffer from increased COVID-19-associated mortality in comparison to non-PD patients.

There were 4 males and 13 females, aged from 25.0 to 51.0 (39.8±7.5) years, who were closely contacted with NCP patients. The follow-up CT examination was performed 3 to 6 days after the initial CT examination in all patients. Six patients were treated using anti-virus, anti-inflammation andsymptomatic therapy, while the orther 11 patients were untreated. The CT imaging signs of subclinical and short-term follow-up were analyzed, and the CT image changes of short-term follow-up was summarized.@*Results@#Thelesions of 17 NCP patients were mainly located at the lower lobes of both lungs (9 cases at the left lower lobe and 10 cases at the right lower lobe in the subclinical stage, 9 casesat the left lower lobe and 11casesat the right lower lobe in the short-term follow-up). The number of lung segments involved increased from 46 in the subclinical stage to 90 in the short-term follow-up. In the subclinical stage, most of the lesions were multiple (13 cases), while in the short-term follow-up, the number of multiple cases decreased (7 cases), focal (6 cases) and diffuse distribution(4 cases) increased. The lesions were mainly distributed under the pleura (13 cases) or along the bronchovascular bundle (10 cases). In the short-term follow-up, 1 case progressed from subpleural to subpleural and along the bronchovascular bundle. There were 3 main types of lesions, including ground glass nodule, ground glass opacity and crazy-paving pattern. In the subclinical stage and short-term follow-up, ground glass nodules were seen in all the 17 cases. In the short-termfollow-up, ground glass nodules decreased in 4 cases and crazy-paving pattern increased in 4 cases. In 6 patients after treatment, 3 cases were changed from multiple to single ground glass nodule, 3 cases showed multiple ground glass opacity reduced. Therange of lesions in 11 patients without treatment enlarged.@*Conclusion@#TheHRCT features of the NCP patients in subcilincal stagehave some charicteristics, such as small ground glass nodule, ground glass opacity along the subpleural or along the bronchovascular bundle, and the great changescan be seen in the short-term follow-up.","JIANG, Nanchuan; ZHENG, Chuansheng; FAN, Yanqing; HAN, Xiaoyu; CHEN, Yan; CHENG, Qiguang; LIANG, Bo; HAN, Ping; SHI, Heshui",Chinese Journal of Radiology,618,2

There are a number of assumptions about AI registers as a governance model for automated systems that we seek to question. Starting with recent attempts to normalize AI by decontextualizing and depoliticizing it, which is a fraught political project that encourages what we call 'ethics theater' given the proven dangers of using these systems in the context of the digital welfare state. We agree with Floridi that much can be learned from these registers about the role of AI systems in municipal city management.

People and workers’ habits and behaviors have changed dramatically, as the use of technologies and connections, virtual reality, and remote support have been enhanced. Businesses and cities have been forced to quickly adapt to the new challenges. Digital technologies have allowed people to have better access to public services due to improved use of resources. Smart cities have significant potential for linking people to work and services as never done before. Additionally, the technological convergence produces data that can enhance interactions and decisions toward the “new normal”. In this paper, the aim is to assess how Portugal is prepared to respond to the accelerated process that this context demands from cities. Portuguese SMEs have developed a good capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation;however, they are still behind in converting the knowledge acquired in sales and exports and there is still limited collaboration at the public-private level. The acceleration of smart cities through the Internet of Things (IoT) may encourage changes in these issues. A more assertive alignment between the emergent technologies and the digitization goals of companies is required. This paper opens a discussion around major needs and trends of IoT (and related technologies) since the pandemic has leveraged them. The relationship between innovation and city smartness is approached to assess main contributing and limiting variables (through the European Innovation Scoreboard), to clarify future directions toward smarter services. The tourism sector, as the largest export economic activity in the country, is addressed in this matter. An analytical framework (using, for example, Power BI and Azure IoT Hub) around this approach can choose and support the most suitable areas of development in the country.","Fernandes, Silvia",Big Data and Cognitive Computing,618,30

Using the Vizient clinical databases, we analyzed inpatient hospital discharges from the general medicine service and its subspecialty services including cardiology, neonatology, pulmonary/critical care, oncology, psychiatry, and neurology between December 2019 and July 2020. We compared baseline discharge data to that of the first few months of the pandemic, from February to July, 2020. We set the baseline as discharges by specialty from February 2019 through January 2020, averaged over 12 months. Compared to baseline, by April 2020 the volume of general medicine hospital discharge was reduced by -20.2%, from 235,581 to 188,027 discharges. We found that while overall the number of discharges decreased from baseline, with a nadir in March, pulmonary/critical care services had an increase in hospital discharge volume throughout the pandemic, from 7,534 at baseline to 15,792 discharges in April. These findings are important for understanding healthcare utilization during the pandemic and ensuring proper allocation of resources and funding throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chinn, Justine; Nguyen, Ninh T; Ramirez, Andrew; Hohmann, Samuel; Amin, Alpesh",,618,18

This situation affected both developing and developed countries in a negative manner. Hence, the policies implemented by the states to prevent unemployment were also carefully considered during this process. Within this scope, various suggestions of ILO and OECD institutions have been made regarding these strategies. This study aims to identify the significant strategies countries should develop to reduce unemployment. For this purpose, 10 basic strategies offered by OECD to reduce the unemployment problem are considered. Moreover, an evaluation has been carried out by considering fuzzy DEMATEL methodology. The findings demonstrate that ensuring adequate income protection is the most appropriate criterion to minimize the unemployment problem in the COVID-19 process. During the pandemic period, economic rescue packages were announced by many governments and institutions. Despite all this support, millions of people lost their jobs in this process. Considering the analysis results obtained in this study, it would be appropriate for governments to focus primarily on the unemployed. In this framework, the implementation of strategies that will prevent citizens from being unemployed will contribute to the solution of this problem. Despite all these efforts, there may still be people losing their jobs in this process. Therefore, income-generating policies should be implemented especially for these people. For this purpose, the duration of unemployment benefits may be extended. In this way, it will be easier to combat the unemployment problem caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Kalkavan, H.; Baş, H.; Ersin, amp; Iacute,; Eti, S.; Yüksel, S.",Contributions to Management Science,618,32

However, the experience in very elderly patients is very limited, which has important implications for the investigation of hospital infection in medical and health institutions. METHODS: Seven patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Department of Geriatrics at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were included. Clinical data were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Laboratory tests and chest computed tomography (CT) images from the patients before and after the COVID-19 infection were compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 91 years old (87-96). Six patients had pneumonia in the last 6 months. Dyspnea occurred in one patient 64 h after the onset of the disease. In the other six patients, minor fatigue with low fever were the only other manifestations of the disease. Lymphopenia and a significant reduction in plasma globulin level was observed compared with levels before the onset of the disease. None had typical chest CT phenotypes during the early stage, except the critically ill patient mentioned who had developed ""white lung"" and then died. One patient even showed absorption of inflammation compared with previous hypostatic pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of fatal cases in very elderly patients with COVID-19 is no higher than that reported in non-elderly patients was, and probably due to a low immune response. However, the elderly patients manifested minor clinical symptoms and atypical changes in chest CT images, which usually lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient's general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. THERAPY AND COURSE OF EVENTS: The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. CONCLUSION: This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.","Hornuss, Daniel; Laubner, Katharina; Monasterio, Carmen; Thimme, Robert; Wagner, Dirk",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,618,16

The national guidelines on the care of women with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 (detection with polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) recommend individualized antenatal care, mode of delivery based on obstetric considerations, and no routine separation of the mother and the newborn. Breastfeeding is encouraged, and although there is no specific recommendation regarding wearing a face mask to prevent viral transmission to the newborn while nursing, instructions are given to keep high hygiene standards. All studies based on cases tested on hospital admission will capture more women with pregnancy complications than in the general population. Our aim was to describe the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-positive women and their neonates, and to report short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective case series with data from medical records including all test-positive women (n = 67) who gave birth to 68 neonates from 19 March to 26 April 2020 in Stockholm, Sweden. Means, proportions and percentages were calculated for clinical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: The mean age was 32 years, 40% were nulliparous and 61% were overweight or obese. Further, 15% had diabetes and 21% a hypertensive disease. Seventy percent of the women had a vaginal birth. Preterm delivery occurred in 19% of the women. The preterm deliveries were mostly medically indicated, including two women who were delivered preterm due to severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), corresponding to 15% of the preterm births. Four women (6%) were admitted to the intensive care unit postpartum but there were no maternal deaths. There were two perinatal deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death). Three neonates were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 after birth. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 67 women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic to manifest COVID-19 disease, few women presented with severe COVID-19 illness. The majority had a vaginal birth at term with a healthy neonate that was negative for SARS-CoV-2.","Remaeus, Katarina; Savchenko, Julia; Brismar Wendel, Sophia; Brusell Gidlöf, Sebastian; Graner, Sophie; Jones, Elin; Molin, Johanna; Saltvedt, Sissel; Wallström, Tove; Pettersson, Karin",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,618,33

However, as the COVID 19 pandemic unfolded, he became aware of critical fault lines in his B2B selling model. IG offered customised digital display solutions, but its primary source of revenue was B2B selling of interactive flat panel display (IFPD) devices. It, respectively, controlled about 35% and 3% of the market share of IFPD sales, respectively, in Goa and western India. IG’s success in the B2B segment was because of Shaikh’s ability to build strong relationships and customised solutions in an emerging market context. To deal with the COVID pandemic, the Indian Government had imposed a country-wide lockdown, which forced organisations to adopt work from home. This, in turn, created a pull for IFPDs. Yet, very soon Shaikh realised, in the new normal, there was a growing mismatch between his selling efforts and outcomes. Though overall revenue had not fallen much, but the veteran seller had started doubting his tried and tested relational solution selling model. Case dilemma involves the selection of appropriate selling approaches e.g. solution, insight or tiebreaker selling for different situations. This case also offers an opportunity to discuss, how to use online channels to complement B2B selling.

Mortality in 60%-90% of the COVID-19 cases is attributed to either one or more of these comorbidities. However, healthcare management for control of COVID-19 involves public health and policy decisions that may critically undermine the existing health needs of the most vulnerable NCD patients. Temporary closure of outpatient health facilities in some secondary and tertiary care hospitals have deprived millions of NCD patients of their regular medication and diagnostic health needs. The lack of robust primary healthcare facilities in most states, and the failure to maintain physical distancing norms due to inadequate infrastructure is also problematic. In the absence of effective public health interventions, socioeconomically vulnerable patients are likely to become non-adherent increasing manifold their risk of disease complications. In this context, the feasibility of dispensing longer than usual drug refills for chronic NCD conditions at functional government health facilities, home delivery of essential drugs, running dedicated NCD clinics at PHCs, and utilisation of telemedicine opportunities for care and support to patients warrant aggressive exploration.

The questionnaires were spread over a network of educational communities on Facebook from February 7 to February 28, 2020. Using the snowball sampling method, researchers delivered the survey to teachers and parents to provide formal consent before they forwarded it to their students and children. In order to measure the influence of students' socioeconomic status and occupational aspirations on their learning habits during school closures, the survey included three major groups of questions: (1) Individual demographics, including family socioeconomic status, school type, and occupational aspirations; (2) Student's learning habits, including hours of learning before and during the period of school suspension, with and without other people's support; and (3) Students' perceptions of their self-learning during the school closures. There was a total of 920 clicks on the survey link, but only 460 responses accompanied by consent forms were received.

In this paper, we aim to summarise experiences of international primary care systems. We explored personal accounts and findings in reporting on the early experiences from primary care during the pandemic, through the online Global Forum on Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care. During the early stage of the pandemic, primary care continued as the first point of contact to the health system but was poorly informed by policy makers on how to fulfil its role and ill equipped to provide care while protecting staff and patients against further spread of the infection. In many countries, the creativity and initiatives of local health professionals led to the introduction or extension of the use of telephone, e-mail and virtual consulting, and introduced triaging to separate 'suspected' COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 care. There were substantial concerns of collateral damage to the health of the population due to abandoned or postponed routine care. The pandemic presents important lessons to strengthen health systems through better connection between public health, primary care, and secondary care to cope better with future waves of this and other pandemics.","Rawaf, Salman; Allen, Luke N; Stigler, Florian L; Kringos, Dionne; Quezada Yamamoto, Harumi; van Weel, Chris",Eur J Gen Pract,618,6

AIM: How is the virtual German Rheumatology Congress accepted and what are the possibilities of optimization for the future? MATERIAL AND METHOD: The registered participants were asked to take part in an online congress evaluation. RESULTS: Of 2566 congress attendees, 721 participated in the evaluation. The majority (80.2%) were (very) satisfied with the event overall. Compared to the traditional format collegial exchange was perceived as worse using the virtual approach. The technology platform was predominantly described as easy to use and easily accessible. The selected topics of the congress met the expectations of 89% of the participants. The presented contents were estimated to be relevant for their professional activities by 85.2% of the participants. The majority of participants (85.3%) would welcome the congress contents to be permanently available on demand. DISCUSSION: Overall, the participants appreciated the virtual format of the German Rheumatology Congress. Optimization aspects could be shown and these could be considered in the implementation of further (digital) congresses. The results of this work provide suggestions for improvement on how the DGRh can meet and exceed the needs of participants in organizing a virtual or hybrid conference in the future.","Richter, Jutta G; Chehab, Gamal; Knitza, Johannes; Krotova, Anna; Schneider, Matthias; Voormann, Anna Julia; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Specker, Christof",Z Rheumatol,618,24

However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess its effectiveness. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cohort study involving 161 patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 1 to May 20, 2020. The study was conducted at Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Hospital (PMAH).The population included hospitalized adults (age &#8805;18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Each eligible patient was followed from the time of admission until the time of discharge. Patients were classified into two groups according to treatment type: in the HCQ group, patients were treated with HCQ; in the SC group, patients were treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to Ministry of Health (MOH) protocolsThe outcomes were hospitalization days, ICU admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation.We estimated the differences in hospital length of stay and time in the ICU between the HCQ group and the standard care (SC) group using a multivariate generalized linear regression. The differences in ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were compared via logistic regression. All models were adjusted for age and gender variables. Results: A total of 161 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Approximately 59% (n=95) received HCQ-based treatment, and 41% (n=66) received SC. Length of hospital stay and time in ICU in for patients who received HCQ based treatment was shorter than those who received SC. Similarly, there was less need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation among patients who received HCQ based treatment compared with SC, (8.6% vs. 10.7 and 3.1% vs. 9.1%). However, the regression analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups in terms of patient outcomes. Conclusion: HCQ had a modest effect on hospital length stay and days in ICU compared with SC. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution. Larger observational studies and RCTs that evaluate the efficacy of HCQ in COVID-19 patients in the Saudi population are urgently needed.","Almazrou, Saja H; Almalki, Ziyad S; Alanazi, Abdullah S; Alqahtani, Abdulhadi M; AlGhamd, Saleh M",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,618,1

However, a while later, information circulated that ibuprofen should be avoided as it could worsen COVID-19 symptoms. The aim of our study was to assess the association of acute and chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with worse COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study between April 12 and June 1, 2020. Adults consecutively diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Information on NSAID use was collected through a telephone questionnaire, and patients were followed up for COVID-19 infection outcomes, including death, admission, severity, time to clinical improvement, oxygen requirement and length of stay. RESULTS: Acute use of ibuprofen was not associated with a greater risk of mortality relative to non-use (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.632 [95% CI 0.073-5.441; P = 0.6758]). Chronic NSAID use was also not associated with a greater risk of mortality (adjusted HR 0.492 [95% CI 0.178-1.362; P = 0.1721]). Acute ibuprofen use was not associated with a higher risk of admission compared to non-NSAID users (adjusted odds ratio OR 1.271; 95% CI 0.548-2.953).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine geographical, age, and gender related differences in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated severity and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. We conducted a search using PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to include all COVID-19 studies published between January 1st, 2020 to July 24th, 2020 reporting comorbidities with severity or mortality. We included studies reporting the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 on human patients that also provided information on comorbidities or disease outcomes. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects method for calculating estimates. Of 120 studies with 125,446 patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (32%), obesity (25%), diabetes (18%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) while chronic kidney or other renal diseases (51%, 44%), cerebrovascular accident (43%, 44%), and cardiovascular disease (44%, 40%) patients had more COVID-19 severity and mortality respectively. Considerable variation in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated disease severity and mortality in different geographic regions was observed. The highest mortality was observed in studies with Latin American and European patients with any medical condition, mostly older adults (&#8805; 65 years), and predominantly male patients. Although the US studies observed the highest prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, the severity of COVID-19 among each comorbid condition was highest in Asian studies whereas the mortality was highest in the European and Latin American countries.

During this pandemic, significant improvements in the quality of air and water resources have been noted. The tracking of SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, in wastewater allowed wastewater-based epidemiology for this disease. However, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and the increased use of antimicrobials for personal hygiene and environmental disinfection can have serious consequences on the environment and public health. Air pollutants and greenhouse gases have been significantly reduced except for ozone that increased due to the decline in NOx. Tackling air pollution is important due to its role in spreading and worsening the COVID-19. Similarly, this pandemic has a strong impact on crop production systems, livestock industry, food supply chain and global food security. The zoonotic nature of this disease could change human interactions with wildlife and companion animals, but clear strategies are needed to safeguard both human health and biodiversity throughout the COVID-19 recovery.

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the mental health symptoms in health-care providers (HCPs) facing the second wave? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study (October 30-December 1, 2020) was conducted in 16 ICUs during the second wave in France. HCPs completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (for post-traumatic stress disorder), and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: Of 1,203 HCPs, 845 responded (70%) (66% nursing staff, 32% medical staff, 2% other professionals); 487 (57.6%) had treated more than 10 new patients with COVID-19 in the previous week. Insomnia affected 320 (37.9%), and 7.7% were taking a psychotropic drug daily. Symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and burnout were reported in 60.0% (95% CI, 56.6%-63.3%), 36.1% (95% CI, 32.9%-39.5%), 28.4% (95% CI, 25.4%-31.6%), and 45.1% (95% CI, 41.7%-48.5%) of respondents, respectively. Independent predictors of such symptoms included respondent characteristics (sex, profession, experience, personality traits), work organization (ability to rest and to care for family), and self-perceptions (fear of becoming infected or of infecting family and friends, feeling pressure related to the surge, intention to leave the ICU, lassitude, working conditions, feeling they had a high-risk profession, and ""missing the clapping""). The number of patients with COVID-19 treated in the first wave or over the last week was not associated with symptoms of mental health disorders. INTERPRETATION: The prevalence of symptoms of mental health disorders is high in ICU HCPs managing the second COVID-19 surge.

Advances in electronic health records and telepharmacy over the past 2 decades enabled pharmacy leaders to easily adapt their practice models to allow for telecommuting alternatives during the pandemic. While these changes were generally intended to be part of the short-term response, the sustained expansion of telecommuting within the pharmacy profession merits further exploration. Documented experience with telepharmacy and telehealth indicate a wide array of clinical and operational pharmacist activities that could be conducted by telecommuters. In addition, experience with telecommuters in other industries suggests potential benefits ranging from improving pharmacists' work-life balance to mitigating postpandemic financial burden. Health care organizations should consider integrating part-time telecommuter pharmacists into contemporary practice models to address other frontline issues and facilitate ongoing expansion of clinical pharmacy services to meet emerging patient needs.","Martin, Randy D",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),618,8

The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: Vaccination was completed in 191 subjects. Forty-four adverse reactions occurred within 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue. At days 14 and 28, the seroconversion rates were 87.5% and 79.2% (50 EU), 100% and 95.8% (100 EU), and 95.8% and 87.5% (150 EU), respectively, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.1 and 10.6, 54.5 and 15.4, and 37.1 and 18.5, respectively, for the schedules with 2-week and 4-week intervals.

Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) play a critical role in regulating blood cholesterol levels by binding to and clearing LDLs from the circulation. The disruption of the interaction between Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) and LDLR reduces blood cholesterol levels. It is not well known whether other members of the LDLR superfamily may be targets of PCSK9. The aim of this work was to determine if LDLR-related protein 5 (LRP5) is a PCSK9 target, and to study the role of PCSK9 and LRP5 in foam cell formation and lipid accumulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Primary cultures of human inflammatory cells (monocytes and macrophages) were silenced for LRP5 or PCSK9 and challenged with LDLs. We first show that LRP5 is needed for macrophage lipid uptake since LRP5-silenced macrophages show less intracellular CE accumulation. In macrophages, internalization of LRP5-bound LDL is already highly evident after 5 hours of LDL incubation and lasts up to 24hours; however in the absence of both LRP5 and PCSK9 there is a strong reduction of CE accumulation indicating a role for both proteins in lipid uptake. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that LRP5 forms a complex with PCSK9 in lipid-loaded macrophages. Finally PCSK9 participates in TLR4/NFkB signaling; a decreased TLR4 protein expression levels and a decreased nuclear translocation of NF&#954;B was detected in PCSK9 silenced cells after lipid loading, indicating a down-regulation of the TLR4/NF&#954;B pathway. CONCLUSION: Our results show that both LRP5 and PCSK9 participate in lipid uptake in macrophages. In the absence of LRP5 there is a reduced release of PCSK9 indicating that LRP5 also participates in the mechanism of release of soluble PCSK9. Furthermore, PCSK9 up-regulates TLR4/NF&#954;B favoring inflammation. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: We demonstrate that PCSK9 and LRP5 contribute to lipid uptake. We also show that LRP5 participates in PCSK9 transport to the plasma membrane and that PCSK9 inhibition protects against agLDL-induced inflammation associated to the TLR4/NF&#954;B pathway. These results offer new targets to prevent the progression of inflammation and hypercholesterolemia and their increased risk of cardiovascular events.","Badimon, Lina; Luquero, Aureli; Crespo, Javier; Peña, Esther; Borrell-Pages, Maria",Cardiovasc. res,618,1

For adolescents it is especially important as it should become for them a lifelong habit. The aim of the study was to assess the hand hygiene behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in a national Polish sample of secondary school adolescents and to verify the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on those behaviors. The study was conducted in April 2020 in a national sample of 2323 secondary school students recruited based on secondary school sampling procedure (random quota sampling with quotas for voivodeships). The hand hygiene behaviors that were assessed included: frequency of washing hands, reasons for not washing hands, circumstances of washing hands, and procedure of handwashing. Participants were asked each question twice-for the current period of the COVID-19 pandemic and for the period before the COVID-19 issue. The declared frequency of washing hands during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly higher than before (p &lt; 0.0001), as the majority of respondents declared doing it 6-15 times a day (58.4%) while before the pandemic, it was 3-10 times a day (68.1%). The share of respondents declaring washing their hands always while it would be needed was significantly higher for the period during the COVID-19 pandemic (54.8%) than it was for the period before (35.6%; p &lt; 0.0001), and there was a lower share of respondents declaring various reasons for not washing hands. For the majority of circumstances of washing hands, including those associated with meals, personal hygiene, leaving home, socializing, health, and household chores, the share of respondents declaring always washing their hands was significantly higher for the period during the COVID-19 pandemic than for the period before (p &lt; 0.0001). For the majority of steps of handwashing procedure, the share of respondents declaring including them always was significantly higher for the period during the COVID-19 pandemic than for the period before (p &lt; 0.0001), but a higher share declared not wearing a watch and bracelet (p = 0.0006), and rings (p = 0.0129). It was concluded that during the COVID-19 pandemic all the assessed hand hygiene behaviors of Polish adolescents were improved, compared with those before, but hand hygiene education is still necessary.","Głabska, Dominika; Skolmowska, Dominika; Guzek, Dominika",Sustainability,618,10

Although less common than upper respiratory symptoms, thrombotic complications are not infrequent and may result in severe and long-term sequelae. Common thrombotic complications include pulmonary embolism, cerebral infarction, or venous thromboembolism; less commonly seen are acute myocardial injury, renal artery thrombosis, and mesenteric ischemia. Several case reports and case series have described acute myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19 characterized by elevations in serum biomarkers. CASE REPORT: Here, we report the first case to our knowledge of a patient with acute coronary syndrome confirmed on catheter angiography and cardiac MRI. This patient was found to additionally have a left ventricular thrombus and ultimately suffered an acute cerebral infarction. Recognition of thrombotic complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection is essential for initiating appropriate therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In acute myocardial injury, given the different treatment strategies for myocarditis versus acute myocardial infarction secondary to coronary artery thrombus, imaging can play a key role in clinical decision making for patients.","Capaccione, Kathleen M; Leb, Jay S; D039,; souza, Belinda; Utukuri, Pallavi; Salvatore, Mary M",Clin Imaging,618,1

Due to the prone of this deadly virus, uncertainty is significantly the facility for a health condition. There are solutions to handle insecurity about health from coronavirus for assessing the condition through FIS (Fuzzy Inference System). Therefore, for this particular reason we study and develop the fuzzy system to help assess the safety of health-related issues of the patient's condition according to the changes of environment. The FIS is permitted to assess the patient's history like temperature of the body, travel history, disinfection frequency, breathing problem, suffering cough and cold and ventilation rate. A fuzzy system consists of several steps like fuzzification, fuzzy database rule and also defuzzification. Furthermore, a study of FIS identifies the risk of health status according to the patient's condition.

However, the role of NK cells during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has previously not been identified. Peripheral blood NK cells from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 naïve subjects were evaluated for their activation, degranulation, and interferon-gamma expression in the presence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. K562 and lung epithelial cells were transfected with spike proteins and co-cultured with NK cells. The analysis was performed by flow cytometry and immune fluorescence. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins did not alter NK cell activation in a K562 in vitro model. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 protein (SP1) intracellular expression by lung epithelial cells resulted in NK cell-reduced degranulation. Further experiments revealed a concomitant induction of HLA-E expression on the surface of lung epithelial cells and the recognition of an SP1-derived HLA-E-binding peptide. Simultaneously, there was increased modulation of the inhibitory receptor NKG2A/CD94 on NK cells when SP1 was expressed in lung epithelial cells. We ruled out the GATA3 transcription factor as being responsible for HLA-E increased levels and HLA-E/NKG2A interaction as implicated in NK cell exhaustion. We show for the first time that NK cells are affected by SP1 expression in lung epithelial cells via HLA-E/NKG2A interaction.

Experimental Survey Evidence on the Covid-19 Shock and Socio-Political Attitudes in Europe,17.38292,4.9199533,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the dynamics of the epidemic, for modeling purposes. METHODS: Data from Colombian official case information were collated for a period of five months. Dynamical parameters of the disease spread were then estimated from the data. Probability distribution models were identified that represent the time from symptom onset to hospitalization, to ICU admission and to death. Kaplan Meier estimates were also computed for the probability of eventually requiring hospitalization, needing ICU attention and of dying from the disease (the CFR). RESULTS: Probability distributions of the times and probabilities were computed for the population and for groups based on age and sex. Our results show that for the times that characterize the course of the disease for a given patient (to hospitalization, to ICU or death), the variation from an age group to another is very small (around of 10% of fixed effect intercept) and the effect of sex is even weaker (around 1%). The course of the disease appears to be very similar for all patients. The probability that a patient advances from one stage of the disease to another (to hospitalization, to ICU, to death), on the other hand, is heavily influenced by sex and age. Relative risk of death for males (based on 22924 dead) is 1.7. CONCLUSIONS: The times from one stage of the disease to another are almost independent of the major patient's variables (sex, age). This is in stark contrast to the probabilities of going from one stage to another which show a strong dependence on age and sex. Data also show that the length of hospital and ICU stays are almost independent of sex and age. The only factor that affects this length was the eventual outcome (survival or death) of the disease. The time is significantly longer for surviving patients.","Diaz, Hernando; España, Guido; Castañeda, Nelson; Rodriguez, Laura; de la Hoz-Restrepo, Fernando",Int. j. infect. dis,618,16

METHODS: A stratified cluster sample of 3702 children in total was randomly selected and examined clinically for caries (ICDAS II criteria). Caries experience was outlined by adapting ICDAS0-6 criteria to the d/D component of the WHO dmf/DMF index configuration. Percentages (%) of caries experience-free children, of children with initial caries (ICDAS1-2), and the mean d1-2t/D1-2T, d3-6mft/D3-6MFT and d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices were calculated. The probability of presenting with d1-2t/D1-2T &#8805; 1 was assessed by binary logistic regression analysis, whereas negative binomial regression models examined the effect of socio-demographic parameters on d3-6mfs/D3-6MFS indices (level of significance: p &#8804; 0.05). RESULTS: 60.1%, 48.1%, and 34.7% of the 5, 12, and 15-year-old children, respectively, had no caries experience at the defect level (d3-6mft/D3-6MFT = 0).

Clinical data reveal that in severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infects the lung, leading to a frequently lethal triad of respiratory insufficiency, acute cardiovascular failure, and coagulopathy. Physiologically, ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of three systems that could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19: the kinin-kallikrein system, resulting in acute lung inflammatory edema; the renin-angiotensin system, promoting cardiovascular instability; and the coagulation system, leading to thromboembolism. Here we assembled a healthy human lung cell atlas meta-analysis with ~ 130,000 public single-cell transcriptomes and show that key elements of the bradykinin, angiotensin and coagulation systems are co-expressed with ACE2 in alveolar cells and associated with their differentiation dynamics, which could explain how changes in ACE2 promoted by SARS-CoV-2 cell entry result in the development of the three most severe clinical components of COVID-19.","Sidarta-Oliveira, Davi; Jara, Carlos Poblete; Ferruzzi, Adriano J; Skaf, Munir S; Velander, William H; Araujo, Eliana P; Velloso, Licio A",Sci Rep,618,16

Occupations are changing, being added, or disappearing to fit the needs of today's market. In recent years the pace of this change has accelerated, due to factors such as globalization, digitization, and the shift to working from home. Different factors are relevant when selecting employment, e.g., cultural fit, compensation, provided degree of freedom. To successfully fulfill an occupation the gap between required (by the job) and possessed (by the job seeker) skills needs to be as small as possible. Decreasing this skill-gap improves the fit between a job candidate and occupation. In this paper we propose a custom-built Skills&Occupation Knowledge Graph (KG) that fits the above described dynamic nature of the labor market, by leveraging existing skills and occupation taxonomies enriched with external job posting data. We leverage this KG and explore several applications for skills-based matching of jobs to job seekers. First, we study link prediction as a means to quantify relevance of skills to occupations, which can help in prioritizing learning and development of employees. Next, we study node similarity methods and shortest path algorithms for career pathfinding. Finally, we leverage a term weighting method for identifying which skills are most""distinctive""for different (types of) occupations.","Groot, Maurits de; Schutte, Jelle; Graus, David",,618,16

Prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies have already shown striking effectiveness against COVID-19. Nevertheless, concerns remain about antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 as well as threats from other sarbecoviruses. Cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-related viruses provide opportunities to address such concerns. Here, we report on crystal structures of a cross-neutralizing antibody, CV38-142, in complex with the receptor-binding domains from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Recognition of the N343 glycosylation site and water-mediated interactions facilitate cross-reactivity of CV38-142 to SARS-related viruses, allowing the antibody to accommodate antigenic variation in these viruses. CV38-142 synergizes with other cross-neutralizing antibodies, notably COVA1-16, to enhance neutralization of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including circulating variants of concern B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Overall, this study provides valuable information for vaccine and therapeutic design to address current and future antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2 and to protect against zoonotic SARS-related coronaviruses.","Liu, Hejun; Yuan, Meng; Huang, Deli; Bangaru, Sandhya; Zhao, Fangzhu; Lee, Chang-Chun D; Peng, Linghang; Barman, Shawn; Zhu, Xueyong; Nemazee, David; Burton, Dennis R; van Gils, Marit J; Sanders, Rogier W; Kornau, Hans-Christian; Reincke, S Momsen; Prüss, Harald; Kreye, Jakob; Wu, Nicholas C; Ward, Andrew B; Wilson, Ian A",Cell Host Microbe,618,22

The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) receives reciprocal inputs from the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), the circumventricular organs that have been shown to be necessary in multiple central effects of changes in the osmolality and circulating ANG II directed toward the maintenance of sodium and water homeostasis. We, therefore, hypothesized that the MnPO is a crucial part of the central neuronal mechanisms mediating the blood pressure control by altered osmolality and/or ANG II signaling during chronic high dietary salt intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to either sham (operation), or electrolytic lesion of the MnPO. After a 7-day recovery, rats were instrumented with radiotelemetric transducers and aortic flow probes for the measurement of the mean arterial pressure + heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO), respectively. Femoral venous catheters were also implanted to collect blood for the measurements of plasma osmolality and sodium concentration, as well as plasma renin activity. Rats were given another 10 days to recover and then were subjected to a 28-day-long study protocol that included a 7-day control period (1.0% NaCl diet), followed by 14 days of high salt (4.0% NaCl), and a 7-day recovery period (1.0% NaCl). The data showed, that despite a slight increase in the MAP observed in both MnPO- (n = 12) and sham-lesioned (n = 8) rats during the high-salt period, there were no significant differences between the MAP, HR, and CO in the two groups throughout the study protocol. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the MnPO is necessary to maintain normal blood pressure during high dietary salt intake. However, MnPO-lesioned rats showed less sodium balance than sham-lesioned rats during the first 4 days of high salt intake. Although, these results may be explained partly by the plasma hyperosmolarity and hypernatremia observed in MnPO-lesioned rats; they also shed light on the role of the MnPO in central neuronal control of renal sodium handling during chronic high dietary salt intake.","Ployngam, T; Katz, S S; Collister, J P",Neurophysiology,618,16

This provides opportunities to observe changes in sports bettors' behaviour when their primary form of activity is removed and assess the impact of Covid-19 related circumstances upon gambling. METHODS: In July 2020, we conducted an online cross-sectional survey of people who bet regularly (at least monthly) on sports before Covid-19 (n = 3866). Bi-variate analyses compared changes in gambling behaviours before and during the initial lockdown. Multi-variate logistic regression models explored associations between problem gambling (men) and moderate risk or problem gambling (MRPG) (women) with changes in Covid-19 related circumstances and changing gambling behaviours during Britain's initial 'lockdown' (March-June 2020). RESULTS: 29.8% of male sports bettors and 33.4% of female sports bettors stopped gambling altogether during the initial Covid-19 lockdown, though 17.3% of men and 16.5% of women started a new form of gambling during lockdown. Among men, adjusted odds ratios of problem gambling were higher among those starting a new gambling activity during lockdown (OR = 2.50 [95% CI 1.38-4.53]). Among women, adjusted odds ratios of MRPG were higher among those whose frequency of gambling on any activity increased during lockdown (OR = 4.21 [1.99-8.92] and among those shielding for health reasons. Poorer wellbeing was associated with problem gambling for men and MRPG for women. CONCLUSIONS: Those changing gambling behaviours during the initial Covid-19 lockdown (e.g. increasing gambling frequency or starting a new gambling activity) are potentially vulnerable to gambling harms.","Wardle, Heather; Donnachie, Craig; Critchlow, Nathan; Brown, Ashley; Bunn, Christopher; Dobbie, Fiona; Gray, Cindy; Mitchell, Danielle; Purves, Richard; Reith, Gerda; Stead, Martine; Hunt, Kate",Addict Behav,618,16

It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches.

A multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression based on the smallest Akaike information criterion value was used to select demographic and clinical variables to construct a nomogram. Discrimination, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration, and Kaplan-Meier curves with the log-rank test were used to assess the nomogram model. The median LOS was 13 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 10-18). Age, alanine aminotransferase, pneumonia, platelet count, and PF ratio (PaO2/FiO2) were included in the final model. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.76 (95%confidence interval [CI] = 0.69-0.83), and the AUC was 0.88 (95%CI = 0.82-0.95).

These results confirmed that the nomogram model accurately predicted the LOS of patients with COVID-19. We developed and validated a nomogram that incorporated five independent predictors of LOS. If validated in a future large cohort study, the model may help to optimize discharge strategies and, thus, shorten LOS in patients with COVID-19.","Li, Kang; Zhang, Chi; Qin, Ling; Zang, Chaoran; Li, Ang; Sun, Jianping; Zhao, Yan; Feng, Yingmei; Zhang, Yonghong",Dis Markers,618,16

In the midst of the pandemic, ways to safely go back to schools and offices have been argued. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends taking all precautions such as vaccination and universal indoor masking. However, even if all the precautions are implemented and transmission is perfectly prevented in the facilities, they may be infected outside of the facilities, which would be a source of transmission in the facilities. Therefore, identifying those infected outside of the facility through screening is essential to safely go back to schools or offices. However, studies investigating the effectiveness of screening are limited. Further, it is not well clarified now which screening strategy (e.g., low or high sensitivity antigen tests, intervals and the number of tests) effectively identify infected and infectious individuals to avoid transmission in facilities MethodsWe assessed the effectiveness of various screening strategies in schools and offices through quantitative simulation. The effectiveness was assessed by the proportion of identified infected and infectious participants. Infection dynamics in the facility is governed by transmission dynamics of the population they belong to, and the screening is initiated at different epidemic phases: growth, peak, and declining phases. The viral load trajectory over time for each infected individual was modelled by the viral dynamics model, and the transmission process at the population level was modelled by a deterministic compartment model. The model parameters were estimated from clinical and epidemiological data. Screening strategies were varied by antigen tests with different sensitivity and schedules of screening over 10 days. ResultsUnder the daily screening, we found high sensitivity antigen tests (the detection limit: 6.3 x 104 copies/mL) yielded 88% (95%CI 86-89) of effectiveness by the end of 10 days screening period, which is about 20% higher than that with low sensitivity antigen tests (2.0 x 106 copies/mL). Comparing screening scenarios with different schedules, we found early and frequent screening is the key to maximize the effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis revealed that less frequent tests might be an option when the number of antigen tests is limited especially when the screening is performed at the growth phase. DiscussionHigh sensitivity antigen tests, high frequency screening, and immediate initiation of screening are the key to safely restart educational and economic activities allowing in-person interactions. Our computational framework is useful in assessment of screening strategies by incorporating additional factors for specific situations.","Jeong, Yong Dam; Ejima, Keisuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Iwanami, Shoya; Iwami, Shingo; Aihara, Kazuyuki",,618,16

In this work, in silico selection of DNA-aptamers to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed using molecular modeling methods. Material and methods. A new computational approach to aptamer in silico selection is based on a cycle of simulations, including the stages of molecular modeling, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations, and quantum chemical calculations. To verify the obtained calculated results flow cytometry, fluorescence polarization, and small-angle X-ray scattering methods were applied. Results. An initial library consisted of 256 16-mer oligonucleotides was modeled. Based on molecular docking results, the only one aptamer (Apt16) was selected from the library as a starting aptamer to the RBD protein. For Apt16/RBD complex, molecular dynamic and quantum chemical calculations revealed the pairs of nucleotides and amino acids whose contribution to the binding between aptamer and RBD is the largest. Taking into account these data, Apt16 was subjected to the structure modifications in order to increase the binding with the RBD. Thus, a new aptamer Apt25 was designed. The procedure of 1) aptamer structure modeling/modification, 2) molecular docking, 3) molecular dynamic simulations, 4) quantum chemical calculations was performed sev-eral times. As a result, four aptamers (Apt16, Apt25, Apt27, Apt31) to the RBD were designed in silico without any preliminary experimental data. Binding of the each modeled aptamer to the RBD was studied in terms of interactions between residues in protein and nucleotides in the aptamers. Based on the simulation results, the strongest binding with the RBD was predicted for two Apt27 and Apt31aptamers. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data obtained by flow cytometry, fluorescence polarization, and small-angle X-ray scattering methods. Conclusion. The proposed computational approach to selection and refinement of aptamers is universal and can be used for wide range of molecular ligands and targets. Key words. © ARTYUSHENKO P. V., MIRONOV V.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: COVID-19 convalescent plasma from 18 donors was collected longitudinally for a maximum of 63-129 days following resolution of symptoms. All the samples were initially screened by the Ortho total Ig test to confirm positivity and subsequently tested with seven additional direct sandwich or indirect binding assays (Ortho, Roche, Abbott, Broad Institute) directed against a variety of antigen targets (S1, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid [NC]), along with two neutralization assays (Broad Institute live virus PRNT and Vitalant Research Institute [VRI] Pseudovirus reporter viral particle neutralization [RVPN]). RESULTS: The direct detection assays (Ortho total Ig total and Roche total Ig) showed increasing levels of antibodies over the time period, in contrast to the indirect IgG assays that showed a decline. Neutralization assays also demonstrated declining responses; the VRI RVPN pseudovirus had a greater rate of decline than the Broad PRNT live virus assay. DISCUSSION: These data show that in addition to variable individual responses and associations with disease severity, the detection assay chosen contributes to the heterogeneous results in antibody stability over time. Depending on the scope of the research, one assay may be preferable over another. For serosurveillance studies, direct, double Ag-sandwich assays appear to be the best choice due to their stability; in particular, algorithms that include both S1- and NC-based assays can help reduce the rate of false-positivity and discriminate between natural infection and vaccine-derived seroreactivity.","Di Germanio, Clara; Simmons, Graham; Kelly, Kathleen; Martinelli, Rachel; Darst, Orsolya; Azimpouran, Mahzad; Stone, Mars; Hazegh, Kelsey; Grebe, Eduard; Zhang, Shuting; Ma, Peijun; Orzechowski, Marek; Gomez, James E; Livny, Jonathan; Hung, Deborah T; Vassallo, Ralph; Busch, Michael P; Dumont, Larry J",Transfusion,618,21

There are reports of breathlessness in patients many months post-infection. Purpose This study aimed to determine if hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (XeMRI) imaging could identify the possible cause of breathlessness in patients three months after hospital discharge following COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods This prospective study was undertaken between August and December 2020, with patients and healthy control volunteers enrolled. All patients underwent: lung function tests; ventilation and dissolved phase XeMRI, with the mean Red Blood Cell (RBC):Tissue Plasma (TP) ratio to be calculated; and a low dose chest CT scored for the degree of post-COVID-19 abnormalities. Healthy controls underwent XeMRI. The intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated for volunteer and patient scans, to assess repeatability. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Cohen's effect size calculated to assess for differences between RBC:TP in patient and controls. Results 9 patients (mean age 57±7 years, Male = 6) and 5 volunteers (29 ± 3 years, Female = 5) were enrolled. Patient mean time from hospital discharge was 169, range 116-254 days. There was a difference in RBC:TP between patients and controls (0.3 ± 0.1 versus 0.5 ± 0.1, respectively, p = 0.001, effect size = 1.36). There was significant difference between the RBC and gas phase spectral full width at half maximum (FWHM) between volunteers and patients (median ± 95 % confidence interval, 567 ± 1 vs 507 ± 81, p = 0.002 and 104 ± 2 vs 122 ± 17, p = 0.004, respectively). Results were reproducible with Intraclass Correlation Coefficients of 0.82 and 0.88 for patients and volunteers respectively. Participants had normal or near normal CT scans, mean 7/25, range 0-10/25. Conclusion Xe MRI showed alveolar-capillary diffusion limitation in all 9 post COVID-19 pneumonia patients despite normal or nearly normal CT scans.

Efforts have been made in the form of increasing food security at the household, local, and national levels. At the household level, the movement of homestead land use in villages with integrated farming and urban areas with urban farming has helped to increase food security. At the local level, local food development movements such as maize, cassava, sago, and tubers were carried out to reduce dependence on food supplies from other areas that were disrupted by distribution during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This was the first coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related death detected in Italy since the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province2. In response, the regional authorities imposed the lockdown of the whole municipality for 14 days3. Here we collected information on the demography, clinical presentation, hospitalization, contact network and the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasopharyngeal swabs for 85.9% and 71.5% of the population of Vo' at two consecutive time points. From the first survey, which was conducted around the time the town lockdown started, we found a prevalence of infection of 2.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-3.3%). From the second survey, which was conducted at the end of the lockdown, we found a prevalence of 1.2% (95% CI: 0.8-1.8%). Notably, 42.5% (95% CI: 31.5-54.6%) of the confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections detected across the two surveys were asymptomatic (that is, did not have symptoms at the time of swab testing and did not develop symptoms afterwards). The mean serial interval was 7.2 days (95% CI: 5.9-9.6). We found no statistically significant difference in the viral load of symptomatic versus asymptomatic infections (P = 0.62 and 0.74 for E and RdRp genes, respectively, exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test). This study sheds light on the frequency of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, their infectivity (as measured by the viral load) and provides insights into its transmission dynamics and the efficacy of the implemented control measures.","Lavezzo, Enrico; Franchin, Elisa; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Barzon, Luisa; Del Vecchio, Claudia; Rossi, Lucia; Manganelli, Riccardo; Loregian, Arianna; Navarin, Nicolò; Abate, Davide; Sciro, Manuela; Merigliano, Stefano; De Canale, Ettore; Vanuzzo, Maria Cristina; Besutti, Valeria; Saluzzo, Francesca; Onelia, Francesco; Pacenti, Monia; Parisi, Saverio G; Carretta, Giovanni; Donato, Daniele; Flor, Luciano; Cocchio, Silvia; Masi, Giulia; Sperduti, Alessandro; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Salvador, Renato; Nicoletti, Michele; Caldart, Federico; Castelli, Gioele; Nieddu, Eleonora; Labella, Beatrice; Fava, Ludovico; Drigo, Matteo; Gaythorpe, Katy A M; Brazzale, Alessandra R; Toppo, Stefano; Trevisan, Marta; Baldo, Vincenzo; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Dorigatti, Ilaria; Crisanti, Andrea",Nature,618,21

Foram coletadas 392 amostras de animais domésticos (bovinos, eqüinos, suínos, ovinos, cães e felinos) de 98 propriedades rurais do município de Teodoro Sampaio, Estado de São Paulo, 474 de aves silvestres de cativeiro de diversas famílias, provenientes de criadouros comerciais do Estado de São Paulo e criadas como estimação, 141 de sagüis de cativeiro do Estado de São Paulo, e 24 de humanos imunodeprimidos provenientes de hospital do município de São Paulo. As amostras foram submetidas a prova coproparasitológica e molecular para detecção e identificação de Cryptosporidium. Alinhamentos múltiplos obtidos de seqüências 18S rDNA de Cryptosporidium spp. determinadas neste estudo e de sequências recuperadas do Genbank foram analisados visualmente para a definição das regiões polimórficas. Após a definição das regiões polimórficas, foram realizadas análises filogenéticas empregando-se separadamente cada uma delas. Pelo exame coproparasitológico foi encontrado positividade em amostras de nove (4,57%) bovinos, três (11,11%) cães, 41 (8,64%) aves silvestres, 13 (9,20%) sagüis e todas as de humanos. As outras espécies de animais domésticos não apresentaram positividade para o parasita no exame coproparasitológico. Nos bovinos foi encontrado o Cryptosporidium Andersoni, em cães o Cryptosporidium canis, em sagüis o Cryptosporidium parvum e em humanos, C. parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, Cryptosporidium felis e C. canis. Dentre as amostras de aves nenhuma foi identificada como Cryptosporidium meleagridis. As amostras de curiós (Oryzoborus angolensis) foram classificadas como Cryptosporidium galli, com exceção de uma, identificada como Cryptosporidium baileyi. C. galli foi encontrado também em um Sabiá Laranjeira (Turdus rufiventris), um Picharro (Saltator similis), dois canários e um Pintassilgo (C. carduelis). C. baileyi foi encontrado em um pintassilgo (Carduelis carduelis) um Pichochó (Sporophila frontalis), um Galo da Campina (Paroaria dominicana) e dois Canários (Sicalis flaveola). Pelos resultados, duas regiões polimórficas em sequência 18S rDNA de Cryptosporidium spp. (denominadas regiões 1 e 3) permitiram discriminar as diferentes espécies neste gênero de parasita, podendo ser utilizadas isoladamente como marcadores moleculares para identificação molecular dentro deste gênero. Saguis (Chalitrix spp.) de cativeiro são espécies susceptíveis a infecção por Cryptosporidium parvum apresentando-se como um hospedeiro de importância epidemiológica para esta zoonose. Curiós (O. angolensis) de cativeiro são espécies susceptíveis a infecção por Cryptosporidium galli apresentando-se como hospedeiro de importância epidemiológica para esta espécie de parasito. A não detecção de Cryptosporidium parvum em animais domésticos na região de Teodoro Sampaio, Estado de São Paulo, mostra uma condição sanitária favorável, já que este agente é causador de importante zoonose. A presença de espécies de Cryptosporidium spp. adaptadas a animais domésticos (como o C. felis e o C. canis) em humanos na cidade de São Paulo mostra que estes animais podem desempenhar importante papel na cadeia epidemiológica da criptosporidiose humana","Sevá, Anaiá da Paixão",,618,16

The objective of the study is to compare the occurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM tests in subjects with and without recent (last year) seasonal influenza vaccinations. In a cross-sectional study located in three large towns of Silesian Voivodeship (Poland), we studied 5479 subjects in which 1253 (22.9%) had a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test and 400 (7.3%) had a positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM test. Seasonal influenza vaccination remains an independent factor protecting against positive IgG tests (OR = 0.68;0.55–0.83). The effect is not apparent with IgM antibodies. The obtained results confirmed that the serological status of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on vaccination against seasonal influenza.","Kowalska, Małgorzata Niewiadomska Ewa Barański Kamil Kaleta-Pilarska Angelina Brożek Grzegorz Zejda Jan Eugeniusz",Vaccines,618,24

This paper presents a comprehensive review of several crowd detection techniques based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which can be adopted to avoid crowding in various segments of the PT system (buses/trams/trains, railway/subway stations, and bus stops). To discuss such techniques in a clear systematic perspective, we introduce a reference framework called SALUTARY (Safe and Reliable Public Transportation System), which in our vision employs modern information and communication technologies (ICT) in order to: (i) monitor and predict crowding events; (ii) adapt in real-time PT system operations, i.e., by modifying service frequency, timetables, routes, and so on; (iii) inform the users of crowding events by electronic displays installed in correspondence of the bus stops/stations and/or by mobile transport applications. It is envisioned that the new anti-crowding functionalities can be incrementally implemented as an addon to the intelligent transportation system (ITS) platform, which is already in use by major PT companies operating in urban areas. Moreover, it is argued that in this new framework, additional services can be delivered, such as, e.g., on-line ticketing, vehicle access control and reservation in severely crowded situations, and evolved crowd-aware route planning.","Darsena, Donatella; Gelli, Giacinto; Iudice, Ivan; Verde, Francesco",,618,24

Yet the molecular events that underlie cellular recognition and response to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain to be elucidated. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 replication induces a delayed interferon (IFN) response in lung epithelial cells. By screening 16 putative sensors involved in sensing of RNA virus infection, we found that MDA5 and LGP2 primarily regulate IFN induction in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further analyses revealed that viral intermediates specifically activate the IFN response through MDA5-mediated sensing. Additionally, we find that IRF3, IRF5, and NF-&#954;B/p65 are the key transcription factors regulating the IFN response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In summary, these findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of the innate immune recognition and signaling response to SARS-CoV-2.","Yin, Xin; Riva, Laura; Pu, Yuan; Martin-Sancho, Laura; Kanamune, Jun; Yamamoto, Yuki; Sakai, Kouji; Gotoh, Shimpei; Miorin, Lisa; De Jesus, Paul D; Yang, Chih-Cheng; Herbert, Kristina M; Yoh, Sunnie; Hultquist, Judd F; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Chanda, Sumit K",Cell Rep,618,12

The results revealed that WGP demonstrated no clinical side effects on the body index, serum total IgA level, protein expression and the morphology of intestine in newborn mice. In the phase of life, compared with the cyclophosphamide-treated group (CG), WGP clearly promoted the secretion of sIgA and effectively regulated the cytokine gene (IL-2, IFN-Î³, TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, IL-5, IL-17, and TGF-ß1) expression in the intestine.

Therefore, the real-time monitoring of a patient′ s breathing pattern is crucial to respiratory rehabilitation therapies, such as magnetic resonance exams for respiratory-triggered imaging, chronic pulmonary disease treatment, and synchronized functional electrical stimulation. While numerous respiratory devices have been developed, they are often in direct contact with a patient, which can yield limited data. In this study, we developed a novel, non-invasive, and contactless magnetic sensing platform that can precisely monitor a patient′ s breathing, movement, or sleep patterns, thus providing efficient monitoring at a clinic or home. A magneto-LC resonance (MLCR) sensor converts the magnetic oscillations generated by a patient′ s breathing into an impedance spectrum, which allows for a deep analysis of one′ s breath variation to identify respiratory-related diseases like COVID-19. Owing to its ultrahigh sensitivity, the MLCR sensor yields a distinct breathing pattern for each patient tested. It also provides an accurate measure of the strength of a patient′ s breath at multiple stages as well as anomalous variations in respiratory rate and amplitude. The sensor can thus be applied to detect symptoms of COVID-19 in a patient, due to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, as well as track the disease′ s progress in real time. © 2021 by the authors.

This medicine is called the genus epidemicus. This study aims to demonstrate the reasoning used to propose the homeopathic medicine Antimonium tartaricum (Ant-t) as a genus epidemicus in the COVID-19 epidemic. It was decided to develop the reasoning based on the respiratory symptoms described in the epidemiological bulletins presented by the Health Surveillance Secretariat of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, as these symptoms are the most serious of the disease.

Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8+ lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8+ cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8+ T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon &#945;, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.","Yaqinuddin, Ahmed; Kashir, Junaid",Med Hypotheses,618,26

The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and physical contact from contaminated surfaces to the mucosa. Hand hygiene and oral decontamination among other measures are key to preventing the spread of the virus. We report the in vitro virucidal activity of topical and oral povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Suspension assays were used to assess the virucidal activity of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2. Products were tested at a contact time of 30 s for virucidal activity. Viral titres were calculated using the Spearman-Kärber method and reported as median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL. RESULTS: All four products [antiseptic solution (PVP-I 10%), skin cleanser (PVP-I 7.5%), gargle and mouth wash (PVP-I 1%) and throat spray (PVP-I 0.45%)] achieved &#8805; 99.99% virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to &#8805; 4 log10 reduction of virus titre, within 30 s of contact. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of rapid and effective virucidal activity of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2. PVP-I-based products are widely available for medical and personal use for hand hygiene and oral decontamination, and could be readily integrated into coronavirus disease, COVID-19, infection control measures in hospital and community settings.","Anderson, Danielle E; Sivalingam, Velraj; Kang, Adrian Eng Zheng; Ananthanarayanan, Abhishek; Arumugam, Harsha; Jenkins, Timothy M; Hadjiat, Yacine; Eggers, Maren",Infect Dis Ther,618,26

Spain, in particular, witnessed a significant outbreak of the pandemic. In consequence, all classes were cancelled and the Government declared a state of emergency, ordering the lockdown of the entire population from March to May. The aim of this research is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the representations of young university students from the University of the Basque Country and their emotional response when the crisis started. A free-association exercise was completed by 503 students from the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) (Northern Spain). To analyze the content, the Reinert method was used with the Iramuteq software for lexical analysis. The results showed that students placed COVID-19 at a distance from the self, pointing out issues related to social response and disinformation, while showing concerns for self-related issues that are linked to negative emotions, academic consequences, and potentially close victims. The students' concerns were categorized at four main levels: the communicative-informative level, health-emotional level, community-social level, and academic level. All of this has created overwhelming feelings of nervousness, along with anger and emotional fatigue. These results indicate the necessity for universities to work from a holistic standpoint, not only in terms of responding to academic needs but also from psychological, communicative, social, health, and well-being perspectives.","Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Berasategi Sancho, Naiara; Eiguren Munitis, Amaia; Dosil Santamaria, Maria",Health Educ Res,618,1

For college students, web-based physical education is a challenge, as these course are normally offered outdoors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use data from a web-based survey to evaluate the relationship between the mental health status of college students and their sports-related lifestyles. Problems related to web-based physical education were also examined. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8 to 11, 2020. Demographic data, mental health status, and sports-related lifestyles of college students in Wuhan as well as issues related to web-based physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of the DASS-21 subscales (2.46 for depression, 1.48 for anxiety, and 2.59 for stress) were significantly lower in our study than in a previous study (P<.05). Lower DASS-21 scores were significantly correlated with regular exercise, maintaining exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration >1 hour, and >2000 pedometer steps (all P<.05). None of the three forms of web-based physical education was preferred by more than 50% of respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087/1607 students (67.6%). Shape-up exercises (846/1607, 52.6%), a designed combination of exercises (710/1607, 44.2%), and Chinese kung fu (559/1607, 34.8%) were suggested sports for web-based physical education. CONCLUSIONS: Mental status was significantly correlated with regular exercise and sufficient exercise duration. Professional physical guidance is needed for college students in selected sports. Exercises not meeting students' preferences, frequent technical problems, and the distant interaction involved in web-based physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future.","Deng, Cheng-Hu; Wang, Jing-Qiang; Zhu, Li-Ming; Liu, He-Wang; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xue-Hua; Shao, Jian-Bo; Xia, Wei",J Med Internet Res,618,30

Physical distancing interventions and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in unprecedented reductions in many of the constraints on substance use and in critical evolutionarily salient sources of alternative reward, such as social interaction, physical activity, leisure activities and hobbies, and academic and occupational pursuits. Thus, behavioral economics suggests that the pandemic and necessary public health response have created a ""perfect storm"" for exacerbation of individual-level and population-level substance use problems and also points to multilevel intervention strategies. We summarize this perspective and research by highlighting 3 critical behavioral processes that will influence drug and alcohol consumption. First, the sudden absence of many effective constraints on substance use (work, school, community, or service obligations) will reduce the actual and perceived cost of use. Second, physical distancing measures will reduce the availability, and increase the cost, of many rewarding substance-free activities and commodities. Third, increased uncertainty around current and future events increases discounting of delayed rewards. These effects will be especially pernicious among populations with existing health disparities. Next, we outline interventions suggested by behavioral economics to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on substance use that are aimed at increasing perceived costs of use; increasing access to substance-free activities, including treatment; and lengthening the timeframe for behavioral allocation and altering environmental contexts to promote healthy choices.

At this time, the trend of integration of technology and music teaching and learning will continue. This article mainly reviews technology in music education. The author mainly analyzes the following three aspects: (1) The change of technology in the efficiency of student learning in music courses includes two parts: interaction and cooperation;(2) Technology changes in the learning concepts of music teachers and students;(3) A blended learning environment with technology-based music classrooms. Based on the findings of this review, the researcher believes that the use of technology in music classrooms can improve learning efficiency, cooperation, and interaction. In addition, the creation of technological music classrooms will subtly influence teachers and students, which can also affect their teaching and concepts. Also, the integration of technology into the music classroom has produced a virtual-real mixed learning environment, which has also changed the role of teachers. However, there may be some problems that need to be paid attention to. For example, teachers may need to think about the feasibility issues (e.g., technical equipment), their own technical mastery, and student acceptance. Therefore, there is still a long way to study the application of technology to music teaching. Even though technology brings a lot of conveniences, the problem of when large-scale technology is popularized and used remains to be studied. Besides, with the influence of online education under COVID-19 situations, the development of online classrooms will be greatly promoted, and the development of online music classrooms is also worth studying. © 2020 IEEE.","Liang, Q.","2020 International Conference on Information Science and Education, ICISE-IE 2020",618,16

The confinement of the population and the rising epidemic has disrupted the routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telehealth is a growing field, and its application in palliative care is seen as a solution to serve the population in this difficult crisis. Methodology: A exploratory survey was designed to assess the changes in the hospital-based practice of palliative care in the COVID-19 pandemic and patient/caregiver's perception about the provision of telehealth services to palliative care patients of a tertiary care cancer hospital of eastern India. Results: There was a dramatic reduction in the outpatient clinic footfalls by 51% with teleconsultation. Although there was no change in the number of emergency visits, the inpatient admissions reduced by 44%. Nearly 82% of patient/caregivers gave a positive feedback about telemedicine care provided by the department and mentioned that the service provided them with support and connectedness. Almost 64% of the patients and caregivers reported that the service helped allay the fear and reassured them that there was a someone to support them. As high as 76% of the participants felt that they would prefer teleconsultation in future and were ready to pay for teleconsultations if charges were to be applied in the future.

Widely reported U.S. excess death estimates have not accounted for recent population changes, especially increases in the population older than 65 years. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess deaths in the United States in 2020, after accounting for population changes. DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: United States, March to August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All decedents. MEASUREMENTS: Age-specific excess deaths in the United States from 1 March to 31 August 2020 compared with 2015 to 2019 were estimated, after changes in population size and age were taken into account, by using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional death data and U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. Cause-specific excess deaths were estimated by month and age. RESULTS: From March through August 2020, 1 671 400 deaths were registered in the United States, including 173 300 COVID-19 deaths. An average of 1 370 000 deaths were reported over the same months during 2015 to 2019, for a crude excess of 301 400 deaths (128 100 non-COVID-19 deaths). However, the 2020 U.S. population includes 5.04 million more persons aged 65 years and older than the average population in 2015 to 2019 (a 10% increase). After population changes were taken into account, an estimated 217 900 excess deaths occurred from March through August 2020 (173 300 COVID-19 and 44 600 non-COVID-19 deaths). Most excess non-COVID-19 deaths occurred in April, July, and August, and 34 900 (78%) were in persons aged 25 to 64 years. Diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and heart disease caused the most non-COVID-19 excess deaths. LIMITATION: Provisional death data are underestimated because of reporting delays. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an estimated 218 000 excess deaths in the United States between March and August 2020, and 80% of those deaths had COVID-19 as the underlying cause. Accounting for population changes substantially reduced the excess non-COVID-19 death estimates, providing important information for guiding future clinical and public health interventions.

Telehealth and telemedicine services, especially, fulfilled their promise by allowing patients to receive advice and care at a distance, making it safer for all concerned. Over the preceding years, professional societies, governments, and scholars examined ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) related to telemedicine and telehealth. Primary concerns evident from reviewing this literature have been quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. OBJECTIVES: To identify and summarize ethical, legal, and social issues related to information technology in healthcare, as exemplified by telehealth and telemedicine. To expand on prior analyses and address gaps illuminated by the COVID-19 experience. To propose future research directions. METHODS: Literature was identified through searches, forward and backward citation chaining, and the author's knowledge of scholars and works in the area. EU and professional organizations' guidelines, and nineteen scholarly papers were examined and categories created to identify ethical, legal, and social issues they addressed. A synthesis matrix was developed to categorize issues addressed by each source. RESULTS: A synthesis matrix was developed and issues categorized as: quality of care, consent and autonomy, access to care and technology, legal and regulatory, clinician responsibilities, patient responsibilities, changed relationships, commercialization, policy, information needs, and evaluation, with subcategories that fleshed out each category. The literature primarily addressed quality of care, access, consent, and privacy. Other identified considerations were little discussed. These and newer concerns include: usability, tailoring services to each patient, curriculum and training, implementation, commercialization, and licensing and liability. The need for interoperability, data availability, cybersecurity, and informatics infrastructure also is more apparent. These issues are applicable to other information technologies in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and organizations need updated guidelines for ethical use of telemedicine and telehealth care, and decision- and policy-makers need evidence to inform decisions. The variety of newly implemented telemedicine services is an on-going natural experiment presenting an unparalleled opportunity to develop an evidence-based way forward. The paper recommends evaluation using an applied ethics, context-sensitive approach that explores interactions among multiple factors and considerations. It suggests evaluation questions to investigate ethical, social, and legal issues through multi-method, sociotechnical, interpretive and ethnographic, and interactionist evaluation approaches. Such evaluation can help telehealth, and other information technologies, be integrated into healthcare ethically and effectively.","Kaplan, Bonnie",Int J Med Inform,618,16

Diener’s subjective well-being (SWB) was successfully validated with Exploratory Graph Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to track well-being differences of the COVID-19 quarantined individuals. Six tree-based Machine Learning models were trained to classify top 25% SWB scorers during COVID-19 quarantine, after data-splitting (train 70%, test 30%). The model input variables were demographics, to avoid overlapping of inputs-outputs. A 10-fold cross-validation method (70%-30%) was then implemented in the training session to select the optimal Machine Learning model among the six tested. A CART classification was the optimal algorithm (Train-Accuracy=.77, Test-Accuracy=.75). A clean, three-node tree suggested that if someone spends time on perceived creative activities during the COVID-19 quarantine, under clearly described conditions, he/she had high probabilities to be a top subjective well-being scorer. The key importance of creative activities was subsequently cross-validated with three different model configurations: (1) a different tree-based model (Test-Accuracy =.75);(2) a different operationalization of subjective well-being (Test-Accuracy =.75) and (3) a different construct (depression;Test-Accuracy =.73).

Analysis of the HRM data is important for several applications, such as, for detection of diseases (e.g., influenza, zika virus, SARS-Cov-2 and Covid-19 diseases) in health, for identification of spoiled foods in food industry, for analysis of crime scene evidence in forensic investigation, etc. However, the characteristics of the HRM data can change due to the experimental conditions or instrumental settings. In addition, it becomes laborious and time-consuming process as the number of samples increases. Because of these reasons, the analysis and classification of the HRM data become challenging for species which have similar characteristics. METHODS: To improve the classification accuracy of HRM data, we propose to use image (visual) representation of HRM data, which we call HRM images, that are generated using recurrence plots, and propose convolutional neural network (CNN) based models for classifying HRM images. In this study, two different types of recurrence plots are generated, which are black-white recurrence plots (BW-RP) and gray scale recurrence plots (GS-RP) and four different CNN models are proposed for classifying HRM data. RESULTS: The classification performance of the proposed methods are evaluated based on average classification accuracy and F1 score, specificity, recall, and precision values for each yeast species. When BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the best classification accuracy of 95.2% is obtained. The classification accuracies of CNN models for melting curve and GS-RP data representations of HRM data are 90.13% and 86.13%, respectively. The classification accuracy of support vector machines (SVM) model that take melting curve representation of HRM data is 86.53%. Moreover, when BW-RP representation of HRM data is used as input to the CNN models, the F1 score, specificity, recall and precision values are the highest for almost all of species. CONCLUSIONS: Experimental results show that using BW-RP representation of HRM data improved the classification accuracy of HRM data and CNN models that take these images as input outperformed CNN models that take melting curve and GS-RP representations of HRM data as inputs and SVM model that take melting curve representation of HRM data as input.","Ozkok, Fatma Ozge; Celik, Mete",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,618,19

Pricing in a pandemic is complicated and fraught. The policy puzzle involves balancing lower prices to ensure access to essential medications, vaccines, and tests, and adequate revenue streams to provide manufacturers incentives to make the substantial, risky investments needed to develop products in the first place. We review alternative pricing strategies (cost-recovery models, monetary prizes, advanced market commitments) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. Hybrid pricing strategies are undoubtedly needed in a pandemic, but even in a public health crisis, value-based pricing is important. Cost-effectiveness analyses can inform pricing. Ideally, analyses would be conducted from both a health system and societal perspective. Incorporating the added value of social benefits into cost effectiveness analyses doesn't mean manufacturers should capture the entire societal benefit of a diagnostic, vaccine, or therapy. Such analyses can provide important information and help policy makers consider the full costs and benefits of products and the wide-ranging ramifications of their actions.

Since its emergence, great uncertainty has surrounded the potential for COVID-19 to establish as a seasonally recurrent disease. Many infectious diseases, including endemic human coronaviruses, vary across the year. They show a wide range of seasonal waveforms, timing (phase), and amplitudes, which differ depending on the geographical region. Drivers of such patterns are predominantly studied from an epidemiological perspective with a focus on weather and behavior, but complementary insights emerge from physiological studies of seasonality in animals, including humans. Thus, we take a multidisciplinary approach to integrate knowledge from usually distinct fields. First, we review epidemiological evidence of environmental and behavioral drivers of infectious disease seasonality. Subsequently, we take a chronobiological perspective and discuss within-host changes that may affect susceptibility, morbidity, and mortality from infectious diseases. Based on photoperiodic, circannual, and comparative human data, we not only identify promising future avenues but also highlight the need for further studies in animal models. Our preliminary assessment is that host immune seasonality warrants evaluation alongside weather and human behavior as factors that may contribute to COVID-19 seasonality, and that the relative importance of these drivers requires further investigation. A major challenge to predicting seasonality of infectious diseases are rapid, human-induced changes in the hitherto predictable seasonality of our planet, whose influence we review in a final outlook section. We conclude that a proactive multidisciplinary approach is warranted to predict, mitigate, and prevent seasonal infectious diseases in our complex, changing human-earth system.","Kronfeld-Schor, N; Stevenson, T J; Nickbakhsh, S; Schernhammer, E S; Dopico, X C; Dayan, T; Martinez, M; Helm, B",J Biol Rhythms,618,16

Due to the disease severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, it is necessary to provide an accurate and automated triage system to classify and isolate the suspected cases. Different triage methods for COVID-19 patients have been proposed as disease symptoms vary by country. Still, several problems with triage systems remain unresolved, most notably overcrowding in EDs, lengthy waiting times and difficulty adjusting static triage systems when the nature and symptoms of a disease changes. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of general ED triage systems as well as COVID-19 triage systems. We identified important parameters that we recommend considering when designing an e-Triage (electronic triage) system for EDs, namely waiting time, simplicity, reliability, validity, scalability, and adaptability. Moreover, the study proposes a scoring-based e-Triage system for COVID-19 along with several recommended solutions to enhance the overall outcome of e-Triage systems during the outbreak. The recommended solutions aim to reduce overcrowding and overheads in EDs by remotely assessing patients' conditions and identifying their severity levels.","Alhaidari, Fahd; Almuhaideb, Abdullah; Alsunaidi, Shikah; Ibrahim, Nehad; Aslam, Nida; Khan, Irfan Ullah; Shaikh, Fatema; Alshahrani, Mohammed; Alharthi, Hajar; Alsenbel, Yasmine; Alalharith, Dima",Sensors (Basel),618,16

The aim of this article was to describe our experience with the rollout and use of a virtual pretransplantation evaluation platform to facilitate ongoing transplant waitlisting during the early peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective analysis of the process improvement project implemented to continue the evaluation of potential kidney transplantation candidates and ensure waitlist placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational metrics include transplantation volume per month, referral volume per month, pretransplantation patients halted before completing an evaluation per month, evaluations completed per month, and patients waitlisted per month. RESULTS: Between April and September 2020, a total of 1,258 patients completed an evaluation. Two hundred and forty-seven patients were halted during this time period before completing a full evaluation. One hundred and fifty-two patients were presented at selection and 113 were placed on the waitlist. In addition, the number of patients in the active referral phase was able to be reduced by 46%. More evaluations were completed within the virtual platform (n = 930 vs n = 880), yielding similar additions to the waitlist in 2020 (n = 282) vs 2019 (n = 308) despite the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The virtual platform allowed continued maintenance of a large kidney transplantation program despite the inability to have in-person visits. The value of this platform will likely transform our approach to the pretransplantation process and provides an additional valuable method to improve patient equity and access to transplantation.","Rohan, Vinayak S; Pilch, Nicole; Cassidy, Deborah; McGillicuddy, John; White, Jared; Lin, Angello; Nadig, Satish N; Taber, David J; Dubay, Derek; Baliga, Prabhakar K",J.

It has been reported that up to 25% [1] of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 develop VTE (venous thromboembolism), and this can be as high as 31% in ICU patients with COVID-19 [2]. AIMS: To determine VTE rates in ICU patients with COVID compared to those admitted with influenza and a control group. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 113 patients admitted to ICU at our hospital. Patient characteristics, comorbidities, coagulation profile and prevalence of radiologically proven VTE were recorded and compared between groups. RESULTS: More males than females were found in each group. When groups were compared the mean age, BMI and cigarette smoking were similar, as was the incidence of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease. aPTT was higher in the COVID-19 (30.9 ± 3.7 SD) vs (12.8 ± 4.1 SD) the influenza group vs (15.2 ± 4.1 SD) in controls p < 0.001, but fibrinogen was lower 6.2 ± 1.6 SD vs 34.6 ± 14.0SD vs 30.8 ± 5.0 SD, respectively, p < 0.001. VTE rates in the COVID (13.2%) (DVT 5.3%, PE 10.5%) and influenza groups (15.8%) (DVT 13.2%, PE 2.6%) were similar but were higher than the control group (8.1%) (DVT 8.1%, PE 2.7%), but not significantly so (p = 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: ICU patients with COVID-19 displayed an abnormal coagulation profile and a VTE rate that is similar to ICU patients with influenza. VTE occurred despite thromboprophylaxis and remains a pertinent differential to keep in mind.","Boyd, Sean; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio",Ir. j. med. sci,618,24

We aim to summarize different aspects, such as CoV immune evasion mechanisms and host innate immune response to these infections, and their role in pathogenesis. We have also elaborated the up-to-date findings on different vaccine development strategies and progress against CoVs in both humans and non-human models. Most importantly, we have described the Phageome-human immune interaction, its therapeutic usage as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory agent, and implications for multiple vaccine development systems. The data suggest that endogenous phages might play a vital role in eliminating the infection and regulating the body's immune system. Considering the innate-immune-induced pathogenesis against CoVs and the therapeutic aptitude of phageome, we propose that the prophylactic administration of phages and phage-based vaccines could be a useful strategy to control the emerging CoV infections.","Abaidullah, M; Peng, S; Kamran, M; Song, X; Ali Sher, A; Chen, Y; Rehman, A; Lin, L; Jia, R; Yin, Z",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,618,7

Methods: The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes condition and NCP patients' disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. t-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of Ace2 (r > 0.2, FDR < 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. Conclusion: We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection.","Guan, G W; Gao, L; Wang, J W; Wen, X J; Mao, T H; Peng, S W; Zhang, T; Chen, X M; Lu, F M",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,618,16

Many efforts aimed at deriving effective Mpro inhibitors are currently underway, including an international open-science discovery project, codenamed COVID Moonshot. As part of COVID Moonshot, we used saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) spectroscopy to assess the binding of putative Mpro ligands to the viral protease, including molecules identified by crystallographic fragment screening and novel compounds designed as Mpro inhibitors. In this manner, we aimed to complement enzymatic activity assays of Mpro performed by other groups with information on ligand affinity. We have made the Mpro STD-NMR data publicly available. Here, we provide detailed information on the NMR protocols used and challenges faced, thereby placing these data into context.

RESULTS: All seven kits detected all sample pool with low Ct value (<30). While testing weak positive pooled samples with high Ct value (>30); TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay and BGI RT PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. However; Fosun kit, LabGun Kit and Patho detect kit could detect only 90%, 85% and 75% of weak positive samples respectively. CONCLUSION: We conclude that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. While performing pooled sample testing it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding the positive identification in samples pool i.e. TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay and BGI Real time RT PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV - 2.

Staged excision with circumferential margin control (SECMC) has the potential to achieve low recurrence rates. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical outcomes of SECMC using permanent, paraffin-embedded sections and delayed reconstruction. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, uncontrolled, observational cohort study involving patients who underwent staged excision for LM of the head and neck at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada, from September 2010 to March 2013. Recurrence and infection rates were ascertained from patient charts and postal surveys. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients (45 female, 57 male) were included with a median follow-up time of 1410.5 (IQR 260-1756) days. The median age was 69 (IQR 61-79) years. Approximately one-fifth (21%, 21/102) of patients required greater than 0.5 cm margins to achieve histological clearance. One patient (1/102) upstaged to invasive melanoma based on the initial stage of excision. The infection rate was 6% (6/102) and the 5-year cumulative recurrence rate was 1.4% (95% CI 0.2-9.6%). CONCLUSION: SECMC using permanent sections and delayed reconstruction appears to be a safe and effective treatment method for LM on the head and neck.

It is unknown how this affected people living with HIV (PLHIV), who already experience disproportionate levels of mental health issues, comorbidity and stigma. An online survey was designed with HIV community-based organisations to investigate the impact of the pandemic on Victorian PLHIV. Participants were recruited voluntarily both through social media and Infectious Diseases clinics at participating hospitals. There were 153 respondents. Most were male (77%), aged between 30 and 60 years (77%), and Australian-born (63%). Forty-three percent, 31%, and 25% reported negative impacts upon personal relationships, employment, and income, respectively. HIV care continued with 95% and 98% being able to access their HIV provider and antiretroviral therapy (ART), respectively. Telehealth was used by 92% and was largely well received. PLHIV reported worry about physical health (68%), mental health (66%), finances (50%) and accommodation (25%). Fifty percent of participants reported weight gain and 27% increased alcohol intake. This study demonstrated the widespread negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on PLHIV in Victoria, although provision of HIV care and ART continued uninterrupted.

Concern has been aroused regarding a potential harmful effect of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in this clinical context. METHODS: Using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, we evaluated the relationship of cardiovascular disease and drug therapy with in-hospital death among hospitalized patients with Covid-19 who were admitted between December 20, 2019, and March 15, 2020, and were recorded in the Surgical Outcomes Collaborative registry as having either died in the hospital or survived to discharge as of March 28, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 8910 patients with Covid-19 for whom discharge status was available at the time of the analysis, a total of 515 died in the hospital (5.8%) and 8395 survived to discharge. The factors we found to be independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death were an age greater than 65 years (mortality of 10.0%, vs. 4.9% among those &#8804;65 years of age; odds ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 2.41), coronary artery disease (10.2%, vs. 5.2% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.51), heart failure (15.3%, vs. 5.6% among those without heart failure; odds ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.79), cardiac arrhythmia (11.5%, vs. 5.6% among those without arrhythmia; odds ratio, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.86), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14.2%, vs. 5.6% among those without disease; odds ratio, 2.96; 95% CI, 2.00 to 4.40), and current smoking (9.4%, vs. 5.6% among former smokers or nonsmokers; odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.47). No increased risk of in-hospital death was found to be associated with the use of ACE inhibitors (2.1% vs. 6.1%; odds ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.54) or the use of ARBs (6.8% vs. 5.7%; odds ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.74). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death among patients hospitalized with Covid-19. Our results did not confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital death in this clinical context.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs are key in the optimization of TB treatment and help to prevent slow response to treatment, acquired drug resistance, and adverse drug effects. The aim of this review was to provide an update on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-TB drugs and to show how population pharmacokinetics and Bayesian dose adjustment can be used to optimize treatment. We cover aspects on preclinical, clinical, and population pharmacokinetics of different drugs used for drug-susceptible TB and multidrug-resistant TB. Moreover, we include available data to support therapeutic drug monitoring of these drugs and known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets that can be used for optimization of therapy. We have identified a wide range of population pharmacokinetic models for first- and second-line drugs used for TB, which included models built on NONMEM, Pmetrics, ADAPT, MWPharm, Monolix, Phoenix, and NPEM2 software. The first population models were built for isoniazid and rifampicin; however, in recent years, more data have emerged for both new anti-TB drugs, but also for defining targets of older anti-TB drugs. Since the introduction of therapeutic drug monitoring for TB over 3 decades ago, further development of therapeutic drug monitoring in TB next steps will again depend on academic and clinical initiatives. We recommend close collaboration between researchers and the World Health Organization to provide important guideline updates regarding therapeutic drug monitoring and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.","Sturkenboom, Marieke G G; Märtson, Anne-Grete; Svensson, Elin M; Sloan, Derek J; Dooley, Kelly E; van den Elsen, Simone H J; Denti, Paolo; Peloquin, Charles A; Aarnoutse, Rob E; Alffenaar, Jan-Willem C",Clin Pharmacokinet,618,1

The recent reports shown that the rate performance of Indonesian government in handling COVID-19 posits at the 4th worst all over the world. Meanwhile, through responsive, strict, and strategic policy, some Asia countries pushed the elimination case by doing lockdown. This paper questioned how government respond this pandemic, tried to track down the unresponsive and slow decisions, and analyze them comprehensively trough policy system framework. Moreover, we also considered a few feasible and strategic recommendations to accelerate the pandemic responding. Methods: To visualize the anatomy of problems in handling these pandemic responses, this work applied Easton's black box analysis in formulating and introducing public policy. The black box analysis would help us to portray and understood the interests, rationalities, and priorities behind introducing public policies which was implemented to handle this health problem. Besides, the policy triangle framework was used to analyze how environment influenced key actor in making decision. Results: This analysis study discovered the conflict interests in formulating and implementing public policy in handling COVID-19. The public policies are negotiated, discussed, and formulated under black box that ignore transparency, and other good governance principles. Consequently, the substance of public policy represents a certain interest of policy makers, that may conflict with the others and often contradict to the constitutional-based public interests, that is public health. It was impacted the emergence of messy and uncoordinated institutions that implement the conflicted policies. Undeniably, this situation may spark counter-productive ways, attitudes, and actions of people in responding those ambiguous policies. Therefore, this work recommended revising the coherences norms and public policies; reforming the ministry of health in public health's paradigm context; and improving the integration and coordination of cross related institutions, creating a single data on public health, and changing a new paradigm of people, including improving collective awareness in responding and handling COVID-19 appropriately.","Ayuningtyas, Dumilah; Haq, Hayyan Ul; Utami, Raden Roro Mega; Susilia, Sevina",Front Public Health,618,13

This study aims to measure France's global competitiveness for international clinical trials (CT) and assess its strengths and areas of excellence. METHODS: A descriptive and comparative analysis was conducted using the data from both the ClinicalTrials.gov registry for the 2015-2019 period and those reported in a national web-based database (OSCAR) involving the major pharmaceutical companies operating in France in 2018-2019. OSCAR allows to describe the administrative authorization and starting process for all drug trials conducted in France. RESULTS: Among 8607 worldwide drug trials initiated in 2019, 34.3% (n=2.954) were funded exclusively by pharmaceutical companies (52.1% in France). On average, France was involved in 10.5% of all global industrial CTs launched over 2018-2019, still ranking in the 4th position among European countries. Early-phase trials represented 17.3% of trials conducted by the drug companies in France, versus 25% in Germany and 29% in United Kingdom. Oncology remains an area of excellence in France with 18.7% of all worldwide CTs conducted in this therapeutic area over the study period involving at least some French centres, ranking France 2nd among European countries. The median of total deadline before the first patient inclusion of 204 days in 2018-2019 with no marked improvement as compared to 2016-2017 period. However, the delay getting initial trial authorization was slightly reduced and an overall deadline of 167 days was observed for CTs entered the pilot phase initiated recently by the European regulation. CONCLUSION: After ten difficult years, areas of excellence, such as oncology and rare diseases and more recently, the outstanding mobilization for the COVID-19 research, have enabled France to maintain its pharmaceutical research. Furthermore, a set of additional decisions would strengthen this position in the next years.","d039,; Andon, Anne; Galaup, Ariane; Fabron, Cecile; Detournay, Bruno; Borel, Thomas",Therapie,618,16

METHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, hospitalized adults with Covid-19 pneumonia to receive either tofacitinib at a dose of 10 mg or placebo twice daily for up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. The primary outcome was the occurrence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 as assessed with the use of an eight-level ordinal scale (with scores ranging from 1 to 8 and higher scores indicating a worse condition). All-cause mortality and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients underwent randomization at 15 sites in Brazil. Overall, 89.3% of the patients received glucocorticoids during hospitalization. The cumulative incidence of death or respiratory failure through day 28 was 18.1% in the tofacitinib group and 29.0% in the placebo group (risk ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.97; P = 0.04). Death from any cause through day 28 occurred in 2.8% of the patients in the tofacitinib group and in 5.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15 to 1.63). The proportional odds of having a worse score on the eight-level ordinal scale with tofacitinib, as compared with placebo, was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36 to 1.00) at day 14 and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.27 to 1.06) at day 28. Serious adverse events occurred in 20 patients (14.1%) in the tofacitinib group and in 17 (12.0%) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients hospitalized with Covid-19 pneumonia, tofacitinib led to a lower risk of death or respiratory failure through day 28 than placebo.

Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS: SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

Therefore, it is uncertain whether obesity is in fact associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes compared to non-obese individuals. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed (including MEDLINE) and Google Scholar on May 18, 2020 to identify published studies on COVID-19 outcomes in non-obese and obese patients, covering studies published during the first 6 months of the pandemic. Meta-analyses with random effects modeling was used to determine unadjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for various COVID-19 outcomes in obese versus non-obese patients.

Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third ""ghost"" deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.","Franzo, Giovanni; Tucciarone, Claudia Maria; Moreno, Ana; Legnardi, Matteo; Massi, Paola; Tosi, Giovanni; Trogu, Tiziana; Ceruti, Raffaella; Pesente, Patrizia; Ortali, Giovanni; Gavazzi, Luigi; Cecchinato, Mattia",Sci Rep,618,1

Data sources were obtained from Ministry of Health Data, sampled and processed from COVID19.go.id and bnpb.go.id. The variables used in the study are the number of positive cases (x1), number of cases cured (x2) and number of deaths (x3) by province. The classification and classification methods used are k-medoids and C4.5. The k-medoids method works to map clusters of regions in Indonesia by province. The mapping labels used are 3 clusters: high cluster (C1 = red zone), alert cluster (C2 = yellow zone), low cluster (C3 = green zone). The results of the mapping are continued using the C4.5 method to see the rules in the form of a decision tree. The analysis process is assisted with the RapidMiner software. Determination of the number of clusters (k) is determined by using the Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) parameter to optimize the cluster results obtained. For k = 3 has an optimal value of 0.740. The mapping results obtained 9 provinces are in the high cluster (C1 = red zone), 3 provinces are in the alert cluster (C2 = yellow zone) and 22 provinces are in the low cluster (C3 = green zone).

Although thousands of COVID-19 trials were rapidly started, many are unlikely to provide robust statistical evidence and meet regulatory standards (e.g., because of lack of randomization or insufficient power). This has led to an inefficient use of time and resources. With more coordination, the sheer number of patients in these trials might have generated convincing data for several investigational treatments. Collaborative platform trials, comparing several drugs to a shared control arm, are an attractive solution. Those trials can utilize a variety of adaptive design features in order to accelerate the finding of life-saving treatments. In this paper, we discuss several possible designs, illustrate them via simulations, and also discuss challenges, such as the heterogeneity of the target population, time-varying standard of care, and the potentially high number of false hypothesis rejections in phase II and phase III trials. We provide corresponding regulatory perspectives on approval and reimbursement, and note that the optimal design of a platform trial will differ with our societal objective and by stakeholder. Hasty approvals may delay the development of better alternatives, whereas searching relentlessly for the single most efficacious treatment may indirectly diminish the number of lives saved as time is lost. We point out the need for incentivizing developers to participate in collaborative evidence-generation initiatives when a positive return on investment is not met.","Collignon, Olivier; Burman, Carl-Fredrik; Posch, Martin; Schiel, Anja",Clin. pharmacol. ther,618,25

To date there is emerging evidence to provide effectiveness and compliance to intervention measures on COVID-19 due to rapid spread of the disease. We synthesized evidence of community interventions and innovative practices to mitigate COVID-19 as well as previous respiratory outbreak infections which may share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. In the study, we systematically searched the literature on community interventions to mitigate COVID-19, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), H1N1 Influenza and MERS (middle east respiratory syndrome) epidemics in PubMed, Google Scholar, World Health Organization (WHO), MEDRXIV and Google from their inception until May 30, 2020 for up-to-date published and grey resources. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicates. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183064). Of 41,138 papers found, 17 studies met the inclusion criteria in various settings in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). One of the papers from LMICs originated from Africa (Madagascar) with the rest from Asia 9 (China 5, Bangladesh 2, Thailand 2); South America 5 (Mexico 3, Peru 2) and Europe 2 (Serbia and Romania). Following five studies on the use of face masks, the risk of contracting SARS and Influenza was reduced OR 0.78 and 95% CI = 0.36-1.67. Equally, six studies on hand hygiene practices reported a reduced risk of contracting SARS and Influenza OR 0.95 and 95% CI = 0.83-1.08. Further two studies that looked at combined use of face masks and hand hygiene interventions showed the effectiveness in controlling the transmission of influenza OR 0.94 and 95% CI = 0.58-1.54. Nine studies on social distancing intervention demonstrated the importance of physical distance through closure of learning institutions on the transmission dynamics of disease. The evidence confirms the use of face masks, good hand hygiene and social distancing as community interventions are effective to control the spread of SARS and influenza in LMICs. However, the effectiveness of community interventions in LMICs should be informed by adherence of the mitigation measures and contextual factors taking into account the best practices. The study has shown gaps in adherence/compliance of the interventions, hence a need for robust intervention studies to better inform the evidence on compliance of the interventions. Nevertheless, this rapid review of currently best available evidence might inform interim guidance on similar respiratory infectious diseases like Covid-19 in Kenya and similar LMIC context.","Abdullahi, Leila; Onyango, John Joseph; Mukiira, Carol; Wamicwe, Joyce; Githiomi, Rachel; Kariuki, David; Mugambi, Cosmas; Wanjohi, Peter; Githuka, George; Nzioka, Charles; Orwa, Jennifer; Oronje, Rose; Kariuki, James; Mayieka, Lilian",PLoS One,618,16

There is a dearth of studies exploring the identifiable factors accounting for it. We aimed to identify the factors responsible for panic buying extracted from online media reports. Methods: We scrutinized the media reports published in English discussing the different aspects of panic buying. We collected data until May 30, 2020, and searched the possible mentioned reasons responsible for panic buying. Results: We analyzed a total of 784 media reports. The majority of the reports were found in Bing (18%), Ecosia (12.6%), Google (26.4%), and Yahoo (12.5%). Panic buying was reported in 93 countries. Among the 784 responses, a total of 171 reports did not explain the responsible factors of panic buying. Therefore, we analyzed the remaining 613 reports to identify the same. A sense of scarcity was reportedly found as the important factor in about 75% of the reports followed by increased demand (66.07%), the importance of the product (45.02%), anticipation of price hike (23.33%), and due to COVID-19 and its related factors (13.21%). Other reported factors were a rumor, psychological factors (safety-seeking behavior, uncertainty, anxiety reduction, and taking control), social learning, lack of trust, government action, and past experience. Conclusions: The study revealed the responsible factors of panic buying extracted from media reports. Further, studies involving the individuals indulging in panic buying behavior are warranted to replicate the findings.","Arafat, S M Yasir; Kar, Sujita Kumar; Menon, Vikas; Alradie-Mohamed, Angi; Mukherjee, Srijeeta; Kaliamoorthy, Charanya; Kabir, Russell",Front Public Health,618,26

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of two strategies on transmission of COVID-19 to health care workers (HCW) on labor and delivery (L&D). STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision analytic model comparing universal COVID-19 screening and universal PPE on L&D. Probabilities and costs were derived from the literature. We used individual models to evaluate different scenarios including spontaneous labor, induced labor, and planned cesarean delivery (CD). The primary outcome was the cost to prevent COVID-19 infection in one HCW. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $25,000 to prevent a single infection in an HCW. RESULTS: In the base case using a COVID-19 prevalence of 0.36% (the rate in the United States at the time), universal screening is the preferred strategy because while universal PPE is more effective at preventing COVID-19 transmission, it is also more costly, costing $4,175,229 and $3,413,251 to prevent one infection in the setting of spontaneous and induced labor, respectively. For planned CD, universal PPE is cost saving. The model is sensitive to variations in the prevalence of COVID-19 and the cost of PPE. Universal PPE becomes cost-effective at a COVID-19 prevalence of 34.3 and 29.5% and at a PPE cost of $512.62 and $463.20 for spontaneous and induced labor, respectively. At a higher cost-effectiveness threshold, the prevalence of COVID-19 can be lower for universal PPE to become cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Universal COVID-19 screening is generally the preferred option. However, in locations with high COVID-19 prevalence or where the local societal cost of one HCW being unavailable is the highest such as in rural areas, universal PPE may be cost-effective and preferred. This model may help to provide guidance regarding allocation of resources on L&D during these current and future pandemics.

All consecutive patients who received healthcare in both urology and emergency COVID-19 clinics by urologists during this period were included. We classified our healthcare into 4 categories: 1) Standard urological outpatient clinic procedures, 2) Urological emergency procedures, 3) Standard inpatient treatment clinic procedures and specific inpatient treatment clinic procedures for COVID-19 suspected cases, and 4) Specific emergency clinic procedures for COVID-19. Epidemiologic data and patient characteristics were analyzed using independent t test and chi-square test. RESULTS: Overall, the data of 990 patients were evaluated. Of these patients, 344 were seen in standard urology outpatient clinic and 212 were transferred from COVID-19 emergency clinic and hospitalized because of suspected COVID-19 infection. In the COVID-19 emergency clinic, 361 patients were seen by urologists in different shifts. Our workload was on behalf of COVID-19 cases. In our COVID-19 experience, there were no statistically significant differences between our suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients in terms of mean age, sex and age periods (p=0.30, p=0.77, and p=0.78, respectively).

By using panel data from the World Development Indicators, the study examined the determinants of health care expenditure among twenty-two (22) emerging countries from the year 2000 to 2018. METHODS: The study employed cross-section dependence and homogeneity tests to confirm cross-sectional dependence and to deal with homogeneity issues. The Quantile regression technique is employed to test for the relationship between private and public health care expenses and its determinants. The Pooled mean group causality test is used to examine the causal connections among the variables. RESULTS: The outcome of the quantile regression test revealed that economic growth and aging population could induce healthcare costs in emerging countries. However, the impact of industrialization, agricultural activities, and technological advancement on health expenses are found to be noticeably heterogeneous at the various quantile levels. Unidirectional causality was found between industrialization and public health expenses; whereas two-way causal influence was reveled amongst public health expenditure and GDP per capita; public health expenditure and agricultural activities. CONCLUSION: It is therefore suggested that effective and integrated strategies should be considered by industries and agricultural sectors to help reduce preventable diseases that will ultimately reduce healthcare costs among the emerging countries.","Zhou, Lulin; Ampon-Wireko, Sabina; Asante Antwi, Henry; Xu, Xinglong; Salman, Muhammad; Antwi, Maxwell Opuni; Afua, Tordzro Mary Norvienyo",BMC Health Serv Res,618,1

Fourth, experimentally providing participants with information about mortality and contagiousness causally affects participants' worries regarding the aggregate economy and their personal economic situation. Finally, we document that participants' subjective mental models understate the non-linear nature of disease spread, and that these mental models shape the extent of economic worries. These results underscore the importance of public education about the virus for successful containment as well as the need for timely measures that decrease economic hardship and anxiety during a major global pandemic.","Fetzer, Thiemo; Hensel, Lukas; Hermle, Johannes; Roth, Christopher",,618,25

The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected more than 51 million people across the globe as of 12 November 2020. The crown-like spikes on the surface of the virion are the unique structural feature of viruses in the family Coronaviridae. The spike (S) protein adopts distinct conformations while mediating entry of the virus into the host. This multifunctional protein mediates the entry process by recognizing its receptor on the host cell, followed by the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane. This review article focuses on the structural and functional comparison of S proteins of the human betacoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we review the current state of knowledge about receptor recognition, the membrane fusion mechanism, structural epitopes, and glycosylation sites of the S proteins of these viruses.

Although there exist large datasets of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant articles in the biomedical literature, including those that report findings on radiographs. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions, and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures. Because a large portion of figures in COVID-19 articles are not CXR or CT, we designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to improved deep-learning (DL) performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza, another common infectious respiratory illness that may present similarly to COVID-19, and fine-tuned a baseline deep neural network to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We fine-tuned an unsupervised one-class classifier from non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared 15 clinical symptoms and 20 clinical findings of COVID-19 versus those of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. Our database is unique, as the figures are retrieved along with relevant text with fine-grained descriptions, and it can be extended easily in the future. We believe that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We developed and evaluated a one-step colorimetric reverse-transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (COVID-19-LAMP) for detection of SARS-CoV-2, using SARS-CoV-2 isolate and respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19 (n = 223) and other respiratory virus infections (n = 143). The assay involves simple equipment and techniques and low cost, without the need for expensive qPCR machines, and the result, indicated by color change, is easily interpreted by naked eyes. COVID-19-LAMP can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA with detection limit of 42 copies/reaction. Of 223 respiratory samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR, 212 and 219 were positive by COVID-19-LAMP at 60 and 90 min (sensitivities of 95.07% and 98.21%) respectively, with the highest sensitivities among nasopharyngeal swabs (96.88% and 98.96%), compared to sputum/deep throat saliva samples (94.03% and 97.02%), and throat swab samples (93.33% and 98.33%). None of the 143 samples with other respiratory viruses were positive by COVID-19-LAMP, showing 100% specificity. Samples with higher viral load showed shorter detection time, some as early as 30 min. This inexpensive, highly sensitive and specific COVID-19-LAMP assay can be useful for rapid deployment as mobile diagnostic units to resource-limiting areas for point-of-care diagnosis, and for unlimited high-throughput mass screening at borders to reduce cross-regional transmission.","Chow, Franklin Wang-Ngai; Chan, Tony Tat-Yin; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Zhao, Suhui; Yao, Weiming; Fung, Joshua; Cheng, Flora Ka-Kei; Lo, George Chi-Shing; Chu, Stella; Aw-Yong, Kam Leng; Tang, James Yat-Man; Tsang, Chi-Ching; Luk, Hayes Kam-Hei; Wong, Antonio Cheuk-Pui; Li, Kenneth Sze-Ming; Zhu, Longchao; He, Zirong; Tam, Emily Wan Ting; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Wong, Sally Cheuk Ying; Que, Tak-Lun; Fung, Kitty Sau-Chun; Lung, David Christopher; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Woo, Patrick Chiu-Yat; Lau, Susanna Kar-Pui",,618,24

Such support may manifest itself via biased recognition of hate crimes. Psychological surveys were conducted in the wakes of mass shootings in the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands (total n = 2,332), to test whether factors that typically predict endorsement of violent extremism also predict biased hate crime perceptions. Path analyses indicated a consistent pattern of motivated judgment: hate crime perceptions were directly biased by prejudicial attitudes and indirectly biased by an aggrieved sense of disempowerment and White/Christian nationalism. After the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, disempowerment-fueled anti-Semitism predicted lower perceptions that the gunman was motivated by hatred and prejudice (study 1). After the shootings that occurred at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice similarly predicted lower hate crime perceptions (study 2a). Conversely, after the tram shooting in Utrecht, Netherlands (which was perpetrated by a Turkish-born immigrant), disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice predicted higher hate crime perceptions (study 2b). Finally, after the Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas, hate crime perceptions were specifically biased by an ethnonationalist view of Hispanic immigrants as a symbolic (rather than realistic) threat to America; that is, disempowered individuals deemphasized likely hate crimes due to symbolic concerns about cultural supremacy rather than material concerns about jobs or crime (study 3). Altogether, biased hate crime perceptions can be purposive and reveal supremacist sympathies.","Leander, N Pontus; Kreienkamp, Jannis; Agostini, Maximilian; Stroebe, Wolfgang; Gordijn, Ernestine H; Kruglanski, Arie W",Proc.

Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0-59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97). Furthermore, patients who had a first grade contact with an infected persons and showed symptoms themselves also had an increased OR for positive testing (OR: 5.16; 95% CI: 1.72-15.51). This correlation was also present when they themselves were still asymptomatic (OR: 12.55; 95% CI: 3.97-39.67).

Current studies reported that the cytokine/chemokine network is crucial in the onset and maintenance of the ""cytokine storm"", the event occurring in those patients in whom the progression of COVID-19 will progress, in most cases, to a very severe and potentially threatening disease. Detecting a possible ""immune signature"" in patients, as assessed by chemokines status in patients with COVID-19, could be helpful for individual risk stratification for developing a more or less severe clinical course of the disease. The present review is specifically aimed at overviewing current evidences provided by in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the issue of which chemokines seems to be involved, at least at present, in COVID-19. Currently available experimental and clinical studies regarding those chemokines more deeply studied in COVID-19, with a specific focus on their role in the cytokine storm and ultimately with their ability to predict the clinical course of the disease, will be taken into account. Moreover, similarities and differences between chemokines and cytokines, which both contribute to the onset of the pro-inflammatory loop characterizing SARS-COV-2 infection, will be briefly discussed. Future studies will rapidly accumulate in the next months and their results will hopefully provide more insights as to the complex physiopathology of COVID-19-related cytokine storm. This will likely make the present review somehow ""dated"" in a short time, but still the present review provides an overview of the scenario of the current knowledge on this topic.","Coperchini, Francesca; Chiovato, Luca; Ricci, Gianluca; Croce, Laura; Magri, Flavia; Rotondi, Mario",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,618,16

Nearly 30 years ago it was predicted that such triaxial dark matter halos should exhibit steady figure rotation or tumbling motions for durations of several gigayears. The angular frequency of figure rotation predicted by cosmological simulations is described by a log-normal distribution of pattern speed with a median value 0.15hkm/s/kpc (~ 0.15h rad/Gyr ~ 9h deg/Gyr) and a width of 0.83km/s/kpc. These pattern speeds are so small that they have generally been considered both unimportant and undetectable. In this work we show that even this extremely slow figure rotation can significantly alter the structure of extended stellar streams produced by the tidal disruption of satellites in the Milky Way halo. We simulate the behavior of a Sagittarius-like polar tidal stream in triaxial dark matter halos with different shapes, when the halos are rotated about the three principal axes. For pattern speeds typical of cosmological halos we demonstrate, for the first time, that a Sagittarius-like tidal stream would be altered to a degree that is detectable even with current observations. This discovery will potentially allow for a future measurement of figure rotation of the Milky Way's dark halo, and perhaps enabling the first evidence of this relatively unexplored prediction of LambdaCDM.","Valluri, Monica; Price-Whelan, Adrian M.; Snyder, Sarah J.",,618,6

However, this usage has suffered from an important restriction: the function boundaries are assumed fixed and matched. Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically arise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19 infection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this case, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use partial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another function. Here, we develop a comprehensive Riemannian framework that allows for partial matching, comparing, and clustering of functions under both phase variability and uncertain boundaries. We extend past work by: (1) Forming a joint action of the time-warping and time-scaling groups; (2) Introducing a metric that is invariant to this joint action, allowing for a gradient-based approach to elastic partial matching; and (3) Presenting a modification that, while losing the metric property, allows one to control relative influence of the two groups. This framework is illustrated for registering and clustering shapes of COVID-19 rate curves, identifying essential patterns, minimizing mismatch errors, and reducing variability within clusters compared to previous methods.","Bryner, Darshan; Srivastava, Anuj",,618,1

The aim of this study was to compare the differences between the centre of rotation of the femoral head and that of the acetabulum in normal and dysplastic hips. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty dysplastic hips and 30 control hips without dysplastic hip were included in this study. Computed tomography data were imported into three-dimensional analysis software. The sphere radius of the acetabulum, the sphere radius of the femoral head, and the deviation of the centre of rotation of the femoral head from that of the acetabulum were analysed. RESULTS: The sphere radii of the acetabulum and femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic hips. Distances between the centre of rotation of the acetabulum and that of the femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic group than in control group. The centre of rotation of the femoral head was significantly deviated anterosuperiorly in dysplastic hips. We found significant negative correlations between centre-edge angle and the distance between the centre of rotation of the acetabulum and that of the femoral head in all subjects. CONCLUSION: In dysplastic hip joints, the centre of rotation of the femoral head was more deviated anterosuperiorly from that of the acetabulum than in normal hip joints even in static condition, which might be clinically associated with the micro-instability in dysplastic hips.","Hoshino, Hironobu; Furuhashi, Hiroki; Shimizu, Yuta; Matsuyama, Yukihiro",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,618,20

Although appropriate preventive measures are the most important interventions to prevent coronavirus infection among healthcare workers, they are also highly concerned about the consequences of the pandemic. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess preventive practices, perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 crisis among healthcare professionals at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 1,134 respondents (52.6% females). Data were collected between 9th and 20th June 2020 using self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with worry about COVID-19 crisis. The highest percentage of respondents were nurses (39.3%) and physicians (22.2%), followed by interns (10.8%) and midwives (10.3%). Wearing facemask (93%) and frequent hand washing (93%) were the commonly reported preventive practices. Perceived risk of becoming infected with coronavirus (88%) and the potential risk of infection to their family (91%) were very high. The mean (median) worry score about COVID-19 crisis was 2.37 (3.0), on 1 to 3 scale, with 1 (not worried) and 3 (highly worried). The majority worried a lot about the health system being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients (92%), the health of their loved ones (90%) and losing someone due to COVID-19 (89%). Respondents who had previously provided clinical care to Ebola, SARS and cholera patients had significantly lower levels of worry about COVID-19 crisis than participants who had not (ß = -1.38, P<0.001). Our findings reveal respondents' widespread practice of preventive measures, highest levels of perceived risk and worry about the COVID-19 crisis. Increased perceived risk and worry about COVID-19 might enable healthcare workers to adopt appropriate preventive measures more effectively against the disease.","Deressa, Wakgari; Worku, Alemayehu; Abebe, Workeabeba; Gizaw, Muluken; Amogne, Wondwossen",PLoS One,618,16

Human IFIT1 binds to cap0 (m7GpppN) RNA, which lacks methylation on the first and second cap-proximal nucleotides (cap1, m7GpppNm, and cap2, m7GpppNmNm, respectively). These modifications are signatures of ""self"" in higher eukaryotes, whereas unmodified cap0-RNA is recognized as foreign and, therefore, potentially harmful to the host cell. IFIT1 inhibits translation at the initiation stage by competing with the cap-binding initiation factor complex, eIF4F, restricting infection by certain viruses that possess ""nonself"" cap0-mRNAs. However, in mice and other rodents, the IFIT1 orthologue has been lost, and the closely related Ifit1b has been duplicated twice, yielding three paralogues: Ifit1, Ifit1b, and Ifit1c. Although murine Ifit1 is similar to human IFIT1 in its cap0-RNA-binding selectivity, the roles of Ifit1b and Ifit1c are unknown. Here, we found that Ifit1b preferentially binds to cap1-RNA, whereas binding is much weaker to cap0- and cap2-RNA. In murine cells, we show that Ifit1b can modulate host translation and restrict WT mouse coronavirus infection. We found that Ifit1c acts as a stimulatory cofactor for both Ifit1 and Ifit1b, promoting their translation inhibition. In this way, Ifit1c acts in an analogous fashion to human IFIT3, which is a cofactor to human IFIT1. This work clarifies similarities and differences between the human and murine IFIT families to facilitate better design and interpretation of mouse models of human infection and sheds light on the evolutionary plasticity of the IFIT family.","Mears, Harriet V; Sweeney, Trevor R",J Biol Chem,618,20

This analysis compared the safety of deutetrabenazine during titration versus maintenance. METHODS: Safety was assessed during titration versus maintenance using integrated data from two 12-week placebo-controlled studies (ARM-TD and AIM-TD) and the open-label extension study. Rates were compared for overall and serious adverse events (AEs), AEs leading to discontinuation, treatment-related AEs, common AEs (&#8805;4%), and specific AEs (parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, restlessness). RESULTS: In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with placebo (n=130) were: overall, 43.1% vs 25.4%; serious, 4.6% vs 2.3%; leading to discontinuation, 3.1% vs 0; treatment-related, 26.9% vs 10.0%. For placebo, common AEs during titration were somnolence, headache, nausea, fatigue, and dry mouth; none occurred during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates in fixed-dose deutetrabenazine 12-36 mg (n=216) were: overall, 33.3-38.9% vs 22.2-29.2%; serious, 2.8-6.9% vs 0-1.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.8-5.6% vs 0; treatment-related, 8.3-16.7% vs 8.3-13.9%. For fixed-dose deutetrabenazine, common AEs during titration were headache, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, depression, hypertension, and dry mouth; headache was the only common AE during maintenance. In titration versus maintenance, AE rates with flexible-dose deutetrabenazine (n=168) were: overall, 49.4% vs 32.7%; serious, 3.6% vs 2.4%; leading to discontinuation, 2.4% vs 0.6%. For flexible-dose deutetrabenazine, the only common AE during titration was somnolence; none occurred during maintenance. Rates of parkinsonism, suicidal ideation, akathisia, and restlessness were low and comparable in titration and maintenance. CONCLUSIONS: Deutetrabenazine was well-tolerated, with AE rates similar to placebo during both phases; AE rates were higher during titration and decreased during maintenance.

In this article, we present the application of CNNs for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 using X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images of COVID-19 patients. The CNN models discussed in this review were mainly developed for the detection, classification, and segmentation of COVID-19 images. The base models used for detection and classification were AlexNet, Visual Geometry Group Network with 16 layers, residual network, DensNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, Inception, and extreme Inception. U-Net and voxel-based broad learning network were used for segmentation. Even with limited datasets, these methods proved to be beneficial for efficiently identifying the occurrence of COVID-19. To further validate these observations, we conducted an experimental study using a simple CNN framework for the binary classification of COVID-19 CT images. We achieved an accuracy of 93% with an F1-score of 0.93. Thus, with the availability of improved medical image datasets, it is evident that CNNs are very useful for the efficient diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19.","Kugunavar, Sneha; Prabhakar, C J",Vis Comput Ind Biomed Art,618,16

Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions.

As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occurs-particularly when it is associated with a novel pathogen-the question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was in full swing at the time this document was written, is an excellent example of this scenario. During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant. To promote the most rigorous science, it is critical to outline optimal methods for milk collection, handling, storage, and analysis in these situations, and investigators should openly share their methods in published materials.

The increase in hazardous infectious waste (HIW) caused by the pandemic is associated with the risk of transmitting the virus. In this study, hazardous waste includes infectious waste generated both by individuals and by hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. To control the outbreak by maintaining social distance and home quarantine protocols, daily necessities and health supplies must be provided to the people affected. Governments play an essential role in the management of the crisis, creating an elaborate plan for collecting HIW and providing necessities and health supplies. This paper proposes a leader-follower approach for hazardous infectious waste collection and government aid distribution to control COVID-19. At the top level of the model, government policies are designed to support people by distributing daily necessities and health supplies, and to support contractors by waste collection. The lower level of the model is related to the operational decisions of contractors with limited capacities. Due to the potential risk of virus transmission via contaminated waste, the proposed model considers the complications imposed on contractors at the lower level. Applying a stochastic programming approach, four possible scenarios are examined, dependent of the severity of the outbreak. As a solution approach, the Benders decomposition method is combined with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The results show that government support, in addition to much better management of citizen demand, can control the spread of the virus by implementing quarantine decisions.","Valizadeh, Jaber; Hafezalkotob, Ashkan; Alizadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Mozafari, Payman",Sustain Cities Soc,618,20

Several pseudotyped viruses expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are available, but many of these can only infect hACE2-overexpressing cell lines. Here, we report the use of a simple, two-plasmid, pseudotyped virus system comprising a SARS-CoV-2 spike-expressing plasmid and an HIV vector with or without vpr to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 entry event in various cell lines. When an HIV vector without vpr was used, pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses produced in the presence of fetal bovine serum (FBS) were able to infect only engineered hACE2-overexpressing cell lines, whereas viruses produced under serum-free conditions were able to infect a broader range of cells, including cells without hACE2 overexpression. When an HIV vector containing vpr was used, pseudotyped viruses were able to infect a broad spectrum of cell types regardless of whether viruses were produced in the presence or absence of FBS. Infection sensitivities of various cell types did not correlate with mRNA abundance of hACE2, TMPRSS2, or TMPRSS4. Pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 viruses and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus were equally sensitive to neutralization by an anti-spike RBD antibody in cells with high abundance of hACE2. However, the anti-spike RBD antibody did not block pseudotyped viral entry into cell lines with low abundance of hACE2. We further found that CD147 was involved in viral entry in A549 cells with low abundance of hACE2. Thus, our assay is useful for drug and antibody screening as well as for investigating cellular receptors, including hACE2, CD147, and tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL), for the SARS-CoV-2 entry event in various cell lines.","Xu, Chuan; Wang, Annie; Geng, Ke; Honnen, William; Wang, Xuening; Bruiners, Natalie; Singh, Sukhwinder; Ferrara, Fortunato; D039,; Angelo, Sara; Bradbury, Andrew R M; Gennaro, Maria Laura; Liu, Dongfang; Pinter, Abraham; Chang, Theresa L",Viruses,618,16

Its evolution is unpredictable, making it hard for governments to provide response actions suited for all populations. Meanwhile, informal street workers carry on with their labor despite contingency measures to sustain their lives. The objective was to conduct a case-control study to become aware of how street vendors' economy is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY: During phase 2 of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Mexican suburban city. We interviewed informal street vendors (cases) and formal employees (controls). RESULTS: Before mobility restrictions were in place, population income came 1.5% from formal employment and 23.5% from informal employment (street vendors). Informal employees lived on less than the equivalent of 1.5 Big Macs per day (p <0.001). After the contingency measures, formal employment kept the same, while the informal employment ratio increased to 57.4% (p < 0.001). The street vendors were almost 100-times less likely to be concerned about the coronavirus outbreak (p < 0.001) and were 38-times less likely to stop working compared with the formal workers (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We have proven that street vendors are a sector of the population that is highly vulnerable to significant economic loss due to contingency measures. Informal workers cannot stop working despite the ""Stay at Home"" initiative because the government has not implemented strategies that guarantee their survival and their families. Therefore, street vendors continue to be a source of the virus's spread throughout cities.","Romero-Michel, Jessica C; Mokay-Ramírez, Karen A; Delgado-Machuca, Marina; Delgado-Enciso, Josuel; Aurelien-Cabezas, Nomely S; Tiburcio-Jimenez, Daniel; Meza-Robles, Carmen; Delgado-Enciso, Osiris G; Guzman Esquivel, José; Zaizar-Fregoso, Sergio A; Martinez Fierro, Margarita L; Rodriguez Sanchez, Iram P; Melnikov, Valery; Barajas-Saucedo, Carlos E; Lara-Esqueda, Agustin; Delgado-Enciso, Ivan",J Infect Dev Ctries,618,11

SUMMARY ANSWER: A delay in IVF treatment up to 180 days does not affect the live birth rate for women with diminished ovarian reserve when compared to women who initiate IVF treatment within 90 days of presentation. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In clinical practice, treatment delays can occur due to medical, logistical or financial reasons. Over a period of years, a gradual decline in ovarian reserve occurs which can result in declining outcomes in response to IVF treatment over time. There is disagreement among reproductive endocrinologists about whether delaying IVF treatment for a few months can negatively affect patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective cohort study of infertile patients in an academic hospital setting with diminished ovarian reserve who started an IVF cycle within 180 days of their initial consultation and underwent an oocyte retrieval with planned fresh embryo transfer between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2018. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Diminished ovarian reserve was defined as an anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) <1.1 ng/ml. In total, 1790 patients met inclusion criteria (1115 immediate and 675 delayed treatment). Each patient had one included cycle and no subsequent data from additional frozen embryo transfer cycles were included. Since all cycle outcomes evaluated were from fresh embryo transfers, no genetically tested embryos were included. Patients were grouped by whether their cycle started 1-90 days after presentation (immediate) or 91-180 days (delayed). The primary outcome was live birth (&#8805;24 weeks of gestation). A subgroup analysis of more severe forms of diminished ovarian reserve was performed to evaluate outcomes for patients with an AMH <0.5 and for patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (Bologna criteria for diminished ovarian reserve). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted a priori for patient age, was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% CI. All pregnancy outcomes were additionally adjusted for the number of embryos transferred. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The mean ± SD number of days from presentation to IVF start was 50.5 ± 21.9 (immediate) and 128.8 ± 25.9 (delayed). After embryo transfer, the live birth rate was similar between groups (immediate: 23.9%; delayed: 25.6%; OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.85-1.38). Additionally, a similar live birth rate was observed in a subgroup analysis of patients with an AMH <0.5 ng/ml (immediate: 18.8%; delayed: 19.1%; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65-1.51) and in patients >40 years old with an AMH <1.1 ng/ml (immediate: 12.3%; delayed: 14.7%; OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.77-1.91). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is the potential for selection bias with regard to the patients who started their IVF cycle within 90 days compared to 91-180 days after initial consultation. In addition, we did not include patients who were seen for initial evaluation but did not progress to IVF treatment with oocyte retrieval; therefore, our results should only be applied to patients with diminished ovarian reserve who complete an IVF cycle. Finally, since we excluded patients who started their IVF cycle greater than 180 days from their first visit, it is not known how such a delay in treatment affects pregnancy outcomes in IVF cycles. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in initiating IVF treatment in patients with diminished ovarian reserve up to 180 days from the initial visit does not affect pregnancy outcomes. This observation remains true for patients who are in the high-risk categories for poor response to ovarian stimulation. Providers and patients should be reassured that when a short-term treatment delay is deemed necessary for medical, logistic or financial reasons, treatment outcomes will not be affected.

In Korea, as in other countries, the number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 have been rising. This study aimed to calculate the burden of disease due to COVID-19 in Korea. METHODS: We used data on confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 between January 20 and April 24, 2020 provided by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the local governments and the public media to determine disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by sex and age. Morbidity was estimated directly among the confirmed, cured, and fatal cases. Disability weights were adopted from previous similar causes on the severity of COVID-19 for the years of life lived with disability (YLDs). The years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated using the standard life expectancy from the 2018 life tables for each sex and age. RESULTS: The YLDs were higher in females (155.2) than in males (105.1), but the YLLs were higher in males (1,274.3) than in females (996.4). The total disease burden attributable to COVID-19 in Korea during the study period, was estimated to be 2,531.0 DALYs, and 4.930 DALYs per 100,000 population. The YLDs and the YLLs constituted 10.3% and 89.7% of the total DALYs, respectively. The DALYs per 100,000 population were highest in people aged &#8805; 80 years, followed by those aged 70-79, 60-69, and 50-59 years, but the incidence was the highest in individuals aged 20-29 years. CONCLUSION: This study provided the estimates of DALYs due to COVID-19 in Korea. Most of the disease burden from COVID-19 was derived from YLL; this indicates that decision-makers should focus and make an effort on reducing fatality for preparing the second wave of COVID-19.","Jo, Min Woo; Go, Dun Sol; Kim, Rhieun; Lee, Seung Won; Ock, Minsu; Kim, Young Eun; Oh, In Hwan; Yoon, Seok Jun; Park, Hyesook",J Korean Med Sci,618,24

Our primary endpoint was severe COVID-19 progression defined as a composite of transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 99 patients (median age 67 years [interquartile range 56&ndash;76], 37% females) were included and 35% developed severe COVID-19 progression (24% needed ICU treatment, 19% died). Patients had a high burden of comorbidities with a median Charlson comorbidity index of 3 points and a high prevalence of hypertension (57%), chronic kidney disease (28%) and obesity (27%). Baseline characteristics with the highest prognostic value for the primary endpoint by means of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were male gender (0.63) and initial laboratory values including shock markers (lactate on ambient air 0.67; lactate with O2 supply 0.70), markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein 0.72, procalcitonin 0.80) and markers of compromised oxygenation (pO2 0.75 on ambient air), whereas age and comorbidities provided little prognostic information.

Markers of disease progression such as inflammatory markers, markers for shock and impaired respiratory function provided the most prognostic information regarding severe COVID-19 progression in our sample.","Gregoriano, Claudia; Koch, Daniel; Haubitz, Sebastian; Conen, Anna; Fux, Christoph A; Mueller, Beat; Bernasconi, Luca; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Oberle, Micheal; Burgermeister, Susanne; Reiter, Hartwig; Kutz, Alexander; Schuetz, Philipp",Swiss Med Wkly,618,16

COVID-19 affects all age groups; however, it is suggested to progress into severe disease and cause mortality in over 10% of the confirmed cases, depending on the individual characteristics of the affected population. One of the biggest unanswered questions it is why only some individuals develop into the severe stages of the disease. Current data indicate that most of the critically ill are the elderly or those with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. However, it has been noted that, in some populations, severe disease is mostly observed in much younger individuals (<60-years old) with no reported underlying medical conditions. Certainly, many factors may contribute to disease severity including intrinsic host factors such as genetic variants, the expression levels of tissue proteins, among others. Considering all these aspects, this review aims to discuss how the expression levels of tissue proteases and the different profiles of immune responses influence the susceptibility to COVID-19 as well as disease severity and outcome.","Mulinari Turin de Oliveira, Natália; Fernandes da Silva Figueiredo, Isabella; Cristine Malaquias da Silva, Liziane; Sauruk da Silva, Karien; Regis Bueno, Laryssa; Barbosa da Luz, Bruna; Rita Corso, Cláudia; de Paula Werner, Maria Fernanda; Soares Fernandes, Elizabeth; Maria-Ferreira, Daniele",,618,1

However, such developments have already been transforming justice over the course of the previous 20?years. Scholars and legal professinals have expressed concerns over how remote appearance in court impacts perceptions of the accused. In this article, we consider some of these concerns and explore the concept of the ?distributed court? as a potential remedy. Unlike traditional video appearance in court, where a defendant participates remotely while all other players are co-located in the same courtroom, in a distributed court all participants meet in a shared virtual space. Such a configuration is similar to the virtual courts developed worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on a reimagining of co-presence from scholars in the sociology of technology to elaborate the concept of the distributed court. We then present the results of a mock jury study that examines how jurors respond to variations in court technology configurations. We find that appearing by video does not impact the likelihood of a guilty verdict. Rather, a defendant appearing alone in a dock seems to be the most prejudicial location. We find that a distributed court can communicate equality and produce a shared experience of remote participation. We conclude with a discussion of how this research can inform best practice in a future where a significant number of criminal hearings are likely to continue in a virtual format.","Rossner, Meredith Tait David",Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice,618,13

As CHBs can fluctuate on a daily basis, this study examined how daily CHBs are associated with daily intention to quit smoking and daily number of cigarettes smoked before and after a quit date at the between- and within-person level. The study comprised a prospective longitudinal design and investigated 83 women and 83 men for 32 consecutive days during an ongoing joint self-set quit attempt. Daily CHBs varied from day to day and between individuals. At the between-person level, higher women's mean CHBs were associated with lower intention (b = -0.23, p = 0.04) and at the 10% level with more cigarettes smoked after the quit date (rate ratio (RR) = 1.92, p = 0.07). At the within-person level, women's higher than usual CHBs were unrelated to intention to quit, but were related to less smoking before (RR = 0.96, p = 0.03) and at the 10% level after the quit date (RR = 0.91, p = 0.09). A marginally positive association between daily CHBs and smoking at the within-person level emerged for men. The negative effect of daily CHBs at the between-person level on smoking seems to unfold after the quit attempt and for women only.","Amrein, Melanie A; Lüscher, Janina; Berli, Corina; Radtke, Theda; Scholz, Urte",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,3

Here we present a deep-learning (DL) based CT super-resolution (SR) method that can reconstruct low-resolution (LR) sinograms into high resolution (HR) CT images. The method synergistically combines a SR model in sinogram domain, a deblur model in image domain, and the iterative framework into a CT SR algorithm super resolution and deblur based iterative reconstruction (SADIR). We incorporated the CT domain knowledge into the SADIR and unrolled it into a DL network (SADIR Net). The SADIR Net is a zero shot learning (ZSL) network, which can be trained and tested with a single sinogram in the test time. The SADIR was evaluated via SR CT imaging of a Catphan700 physical phantom and a biological ham, and its performance was compared to the other state of the art (SotA) DL-based methods. The results show that the zero-shot SADIR-Net can indeed provide a performance comparable to the other SotA methods for CT SR reconstruction, especially in situations where training data is limited. The SADIR method can find use in improving CT resolution beyond hardware limits or lowering requirement on CT hardware.","Zhang, Zhicheng; Yu, Shaode; Qin, Wenjian; Liang, Xiaokun; Xie, Yaoqin; Cao, Guohua",,618,20

It created many issues around the optimal and safest way to treat complex patients with severe allergic disease. A significant number of the patients are on treatment with biologicals, and clinicians face the challenge to provide optimal care during the pandemic. Uncertainty of the potential risks for these patients is related to the fact that the exact sequence of immunological events during SARS-CoV-2 is not known. Severe COVID-19 patients may experience a ""cytokine storm"" and associated organ damage characterized by an exaggerated release of pro-inflammatory type 1 and type 3 cytokines. These inflammatory responses are potentially counteracted by anti-inflammatory cytokines and type 2 responses. This expert-based EAACI statement aims to provide guidance on the application of biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation in patients with allergic disease. Currently, there is very little evidence for an enhanced risk of patients with allergic diseases to develop severe COVID-19. Studies focusing on severe allergic phenotypes are lacking. At present, noninfected patients on biologicals for the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, or chronic spontaneous urticaria should continue their biologicals targeting type 2 inflammation via self-application. In case of an active SARS-CoV-2 infection, biological treatment needs to be stopped until clinical recovery and SARS-CoV-2 negativity is established and treatment with biologicals should be re-initiated. Maintenance of add-on therapy and a constant assessment of disease control, apart from acute management, are demanded.","Vultaggio, Alessandra; Agache, Ioana; Akdis, Cezmi A; Akdis, Mubeccel; Bavbek, Sevim; Bossios, Apostolos; Bousquet, Jean; Boyman, Onur; Chaker, Adam M; Chan, Susan; Chatzipetrou, Alexia; Feleszko, Wojciech; Firinu, Davide; Jutel, Marek; Kauppi, Paula; Klimek, Ludger; Kolios, Antonios; Kothari, Akash; Kowalski, Marek L; Matucci, Andrea; Palomares, Oscar; Pfaar, Oliver; Rogala, Barbara; Untersmayr, Eva; Eiwegger, Thomas",Allergy,618,16

Cases with aerosol producing procedures are isolated to a few ORs, initial phase I recovery of those patients is in the ORs, and multimodal environmental decontamination applied. We quantified the potential increase in productivity from also resequencing these cases among those 2 or 3 ORs. DESIGN: Computer simulation provided sample sizes requiring >100 years experimentally. Resequencing was limited to changes in the start times of surgeons' lists of cases. SETTING: Ambulatory surgery center or hospital outpatient department. MAIN RESULTS: With case resequencing applied before and on the day of surgery, there were 5.6% and 5.5% more cases per OR per day for the 2 ORs and 3 ORs, respectively, both standard errors (SE) < 0.1%. Resequencing cases among ORs to start cases earlier permitted increases in the hours into which cases could be scheduled from 10.5 to 11.0 h, while assuring >90% probability of each OR finishing within the prespecified 12-h shift. Thus, the additional cases were all scheduled before the day of surgery. The greater allocated time also resulted in less overutilized time, a mean of 4.2 min per OR per day for 2 ORs (SE 0.5) and 6.3 min per OR per day for 3 ORs (SE 0.4). The benefit could be achieved while limiting application of resequencing to days when the OR with the fewest estimated hours of cases has &#8804;8 h. CONCLUSIONS: Some ambulatory surgery ORs have unusually long OR times and/or room cleanup times (e.g., infection control efforts because of the pandemic). Resequencing cases before and on the day of surgery should be considered, because moving 1 or 2 cases occasionally has little to no cost with substantive benefit.","Wang, Zhengli; Dexter, Franklin; Zenios, Stefanos A",J Clin Anesth,618,16

Bias-corrected bootstrap method was used to test the moderated mediation model. Results indicated that after controlling for participants' age, gender, education, income, and insurance, personal responsibility mediated the relationship between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, the direct relation between COVID-19 information consumption on social media and preventive behaviors, and the mediation effect of personal responsibility were moderated by health orientation.

Accurate outcome prognostication could facilitate hospital resource allocation. We develop and validate predictive models for each outcome using retrospective electronic health record data for COVID-19 patients treated between March 2 and May 6, 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For each outcome, we trained 3 classes of prediction models using clinical data for a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2)-positive patients (n = 2256). Cross-validation was used to select the best-performing models per the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic and precision-recall curves. Models were validated using a held-out cohort (n = 855). We measured each model's calibration and evaluated feature importances to interpret model output. RESULTS: The predictive performance for our selected models on the held-out cohort was as follows: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve-MV 0.743 (95% CI, 0.682-0.812), RRT 0.847 (95% CI, 0.772-0.936), readmission 0.871 (95% CI, 0.830-0.917); area under the precision-recall curve-MV 0.137 (95% CI, 0.047-0.175), RRT 0.325 (95% CI, 0.117-0.497), readmission 0.504 (95% CI, 0.388-0.604). Predictions were well calibrated, and the most important features within each model were consistent with clinical intuition. DISCUSSION: Our models produce performant, well-calibrated, and interpretable predictions for COVID-19 patients at risk for the target outcomes. They demonstrate the potential to accurately estimate outcome prognosis in resource-constrained care sites managing COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: We develop and validate prognostic models targeting MV, RRT, and readmission for hospitalized COVID-19 patients which produce accurate, interpretable predictions. Additional external validation studies are needed to further verify the generalizability of our results.","Rodriguez, Victor Alfonso; Bhave, Shreyas; Chen, Ruijun; Pang, Chao; Hripcsak, George; Sengupta, Soumitra; Elhadad, Noemie; Green, Robert; Adelman, Jason; Metitiri, Katherine Schlosser; Elias, Pierre; Groves, Holden; Mohan, Sumit; Natarajan, Karthik; Perotte, Adler",J. am. med. inform. assoc,618,32

We aimed to evaluate the safety, feasibility and biological effect of administering high-dose intravenous zinc (HDIVZn) to patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a phase IIa double-blind, randomised controlled trial to compare HDIVZn to placebo in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We administered trial treatment once daily for a maximum of seven days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. RESULTS: For eligible patients, we randomised and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n=15) or placebo (n=18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, 3 participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation. Mean serum zinc on day 1 in the placebo, and the HDIVZn group was 6.9 ± 1.1 and 7.7 ± 1.6 µmol/l, respectively, consistent with zinc deficiency. HDIVZn, but not placebo, increased serum zinc levels above the deficiency cut off of 10.7 µmol/l (P<0.001) by day 6. Our study did not reach its target enrolment because stringent public health measures markedly reduced patient hospitalisations. CONCLUSION: Hospitalised COVID-19 patients demonstrated zinc deficiency. This can be corrected with HDIVZn. Such treatment appears safe, feasible and only associated with minimal peripheral infusion site irritation. This pilot study justifies further investigation of this treatment in COVID-19 patients.

Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living.ImportanceSome of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as a nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate between contagious newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","Colosi, Lisa M; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Porter, Michael D; Poulter, Melinda D; Ratliff, Cameron; Simmons, William; Steinberg, Limor I; Wilson, D Derek; Morse, Rena; Zmick, Paul; Mathers, Amy J",,618,1

I look at the potential of issues to do with measurement in the context of COVID-19 (e.g. measurement of mortality figures) to introduce school students to issues about philosophy of science, and I show how COVID-19 has the affordance to broaden and deepen the moral philosophy that students typically meet in biology lessons. COVID-19 also provides opportunities to introduce students to sociological ways of thinking, examining data and questioning human practices. It can also enable students to see how science, economics and politics inter-relate.

Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells are among the first targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show that ColdZyme medical device mouth spray efficiently protected against virus entry, excessive inflammation, and tissue damage. Applying ColdZyme to fully differentiated, polarized human epithelium cultured at an air-liquid interphase (ALI) completely blocked binding of SARS-CoV-2 and increased local complement activation mediated by the virus as well as productive infection of the tissue model. While SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in exaggerated intracellular complement activation immediately following infection and a drop in transepithelial resistance, these parameters were bypassed by single pretreatment of the tissues with ColdZyme mouth spray. Crucially, our study highlights the importance of testing already evaluated and safe drugs such as ColdZyme mouth spray for maintaining epithelial integrity and hindering SARS-CoV-2 entry within standardized three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models mimicking the in vivo human airway epithelium.IMPORTANCE Although our understanding of COVID-19 continuously progresses, essential questions regarding prophylaxis and treatment remain open. A hallmark of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is a hitherto-undescribed mechanism leading to excessive inflammation and tissue destruction associated with enhanced pathogenicity and mortality. To tackle the problem at the source, transfer of SARS-CoV-2, subsequent binding, infection, and inflammatory responses have to be avoided. In this study, we used fully differentiated, mucus-producing, and ciliated human airway epithelial cultures to test the efficacy of ColdZyme medical device mouth spray in terms of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, we found that pretreatment of the in vitro airway cultures using ColdZyme mouth spray resulted in significantly shielding the epithelial integrity, hindering virus binding and infection, and blocking excessive intrinsic complement activation within the airway cultures. Our in vitro data suggest that ColdZyme mouth spray may have an impact in prevention of COVID-19.","Posch, W; Vosper, J; Zaderer, V; Noureen, A; Constant, S; Bellmann-Weiler, R; Lass-Flörl, C; Wilflingseder, D",mBio (Online),618,25

METHODS: A cross-sectional study among women presenting for antenatal (N = 750) and postpartum (N = 740) care in Jamaica, Kenya and Malawi took place in 2015-2016. Functioning was measured through the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12). Data on health conditions and socio-demographic characteristics were collected through structured interview, medical record review, and clinical examination. This paper presents descriptive data on the distribution of functioning status among pregnant and postpartum women and examines the relationship between functioning and health conditions. RESULTS: Women attending antenatal care had a lower level of functioning than those attending postpartum care. Women with a health condition or associated demographic risk factor were more likely to have a lower level of functioning than those with no health condition. However, the absolute difference in functioning scores typically remained modest. CONCLUSIONS: Functioning is an important concept which integrates a woman-centered approach to examining how a health condition affects her life, and ultimately her return to functioning after delivery. However, the WHODAS-12 may not be the optimal tool for use in this population and additional components to capture pregnancy-specific issues may be needed. Challenges remain in how to integrate functioning outcomes into routine maternal healthcare at-scale and across diverse settings.","Cresswell, Jenny A; Barbour, Kelli D; Chou, Doris; McCaw-Binns, Affette; Filippi, Veronique; Cecatti, Jose Guilherme; Barreix, Maria; Petzold, Max; Kostanjsek, Nenad; Cottler-Casanova, Sara; Say, Lale",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,618,9

In many cases, such as the recent mucormycosis spread in the COVID-19 pandemic, an initial treatment can be safely suggested to the patient during the earliest stage of the mycological diagnostic process by performing a direct examination of biopsies or samples through a microscope. Computer-aided diagnosis systems using deep learning models have been trained and used for the late mycological diagnostic stages. However, there are no reference literature works made for the early stages. A mycological laboratory in Colombia donated the images used for the development of this research work. They were manually labelled into five classes and curated with a subject matter expert assistance. The images were later cropped and patched with automated code routines to produce the final dataset. This paper presents experimental results classifying five fungi types using two different deep learning approaches and three different convolutional neural network models, VGG16, Inception V3, and ResNet50. The first approach benchmarks the classification performance for the models trained from scratch, while the second approach benchmarks the classification performance using pre-trained models based on the ImageNet dataset. Using k-fold cross-validation testing on the 5-class dataset, the best performing model trained from scratch was Inception V3, reporting 73.2% accuracy. Also, the best performing model using transfer learning was VGG16 reporting 85.04%. The statistics provided by the two approaches create an initial point of reference to encourage future research works to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the dataset built is published in Kaggle and GitHub to foster future research.","Sopo, Camilo Javier Pineda; Hajati, Farshid; Gheisari, Soheila",,618,24

We described changes in alcohol and tobacco consumption after implementation of these restrictions among a small number of participants in a tuberculosis treatment cohort. METHOD: The timeline follow-back procedure and Fägerstrom test for nicotine dependence was used to collect monthly alcohol and tobacco use information. We report changes in heavy drinking days (HDD), average amount of absolute alcohol (AA) consumed per drinking day, and cigarettes smoked daily during the alcohol and tobacco ban compared to use prior to the ban. RESULTS: Of the 61 participants for whom we have pre-ban and within-ban alcohol use information, 17 (27.9%) reported within-ban alcohol use. On average, participants reported one less HDD per fortnight (interquartile range (IQR): -4, 1), but their amount of AA consumed increased by 37.4 g per drinking occasion (IQR: -65.9 g, 71.0 g). Of 53 participants who reported pre-ban tobacco use, 17 (32.1%) stopped smoking during the ban. The number of participants smoking >10 cigarettes per day decreased from 8 to 1. CONCLUSIONS: From these observations, we hypothesize that policies restricting alcohol and tobacco availability seem to enable some individuals to reduce their consumption. However, these appear to have little effect on the volume of AA consumed among individuals with more harmful patterns of drinking in the absence of additional behavior change interventions.","Myers, Bronwyn; Carney, Tara; Rooney, Jennifer; Malatesta, Samantha; White, Laura F; Parry, Charles D H; Bouton, Tara C; Ragan, Elizabeth J; Horsburgh, Charles Robert; Warren, Robin M; Jacobson, Karen R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),618,30

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked widespread disruption to clinical nurses' work. It is important to understand clinical nurses' processes of coping during disasters to support the nursing workforce during events such as global pandemics. DESIGN: We employed the Corbin and Strauss variant of grounded theory methodology, informed by symbolic interactionism, and applied the EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research publication (COREQ). METHODS: Data collection entailed semi-structured interviews with experienced clinical nurses (n =20) across diverse settings. We analysed data by identifying key points in the nurses' coping processes inductively building concepts around these points. RESULTS: The predictor of nurses' outcomes in this grounded theory was their confidence in their ability to cope during the pandemic. When nurses lacked confidence, they experienced working in the context of acute COVID-a state of chaos and anxiety, with negative consequences for nurses. However, when nurses were confident in their abilities to cope with the pandemic, they experienced working in the context of chronic COVID, a calmer state of acceptance. There were many workplace factors that influenced nurses' confidence, including adequacy of personal protective equipment, clear information and guidance, supportive leadership, teamwork and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinical nurses' experience of coping during COVID-19 is essential to maintain the nursing workforce during similar disasters. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse leaders can target areas that support nurses' confidence, such as adequate PPE and staffing. In turn, increased confidence enables clinical nurses to cope during disasters such as a global pandemic.","Nowell, Lorelli; Dhingra, Swati; Andrews, Kimberley; Jackson, Jennifer",J. clin. nurs,618,1

Although analysts tend to be overly optimistic about dividends paid over short horizons, the authors find analysts possess skill regarding the direction of future dividend growth. The authors provide evidence that prices of dividend futures are driven more by hedging activity than fundamental views or uncertainty around future cash flows, leading prices to drop significantly below analysts' expectations and subsequent realized payoffs in times of increased equity market volatility. Looking at the outbreak of COVID-19 and the following Euro Stoxx 50 crash, they find that most of the drop in the equity index was attributable to discount rate adjustments, not fundamental views.

Covid patients develop a wide range of pathologies. This study aims to identify the impact of COVID-19 in diseases commonly treated by vascular surgeons. METHODS: Four conditions were selected: venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and microangiopathy. A systematic review of the literature using PRISMA guidelines was. RESULTS: Out of 1195 papers reviewed for conditions in COVID-19 patients relevant to routine vascular surgery practice, 43 papers were included and analyzed. Venous thrombosis was found to be the most common COVID-19 associated pathology with a cumulative incidence of 25% at 7 days and 48% at 14 days. Additionally, D-dimer levels proved to be a good predictor, even in the early stages of the disease with a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 88.5% and a negative predictive value of 94.7%. Patients in the ICU demonstrated a significantly higher risk of developing VTE, even when receiving pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Although evidence of arterial thrombosis was less common (1% to 16.3%), its consequences were typically more serious, including limb loss and death even in young individuals (OR = 25, 95% CI). Finally, microangiopathy has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations from retinal microangiopathy to other more severe manifestations such as myocardial injury, pulmonary compromise and potential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathophysiological pathway by which COVID-19 produces thrombosis is not completely clear, the incidence of both arterial and venous thrombosis is increased. D-dimer screening should be done in all COVID-19 patients, as a predictor of thrombotic complications.","Ulloa, Jorge H; Figueroa, Valentin; Cifuentes, Juan Sebastian; Pinto, Paula; Lurie, Fedor",Vasc Endovascular Surg,618,2

DesignObservational cohort study SettingNationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a large integrated US national healthcare system Participants9,058 patients admitted to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center between June 7, 2020-December 5, 2020 within 14-days after SARS-CoV-2 positive test; exclusion criteria include less than a 48 hour stay, receipt of prior systemic corticosteroids, and no indication of acute medical care for COVID-19. Main outcome measure90-day all-cause mortality ResultsOf 9,058 total patients (95% men, median age 71 years, 27% black), 6,825 (75%) were not on IRS within 48 hours. Among the 3,025 patients on no oxygen, 598 (20%) received corticosteroids and 283 (9%) died; of 3,800 patients on low-flow nasal cannula oxygen (NC), 2,808 (74%) received corticosteroids and 514 (13%) died. In stratified, inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazards models comparing those who did and did not receive corticosteroids, patients on no oxygen experienced an 89% increased risk for 90-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33 to 2.68); there was weak evidence of increased mortality among patients on NC (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.57). Results were robust in subgroup analyses including restricting corticosteroids to dexamethasone, and in sensitivity analyses employing different modeling approaches. ConclusionsIn patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we found no evidence of a mortality benefit associated with early initiation of corticosteroids among those on no oxygen or NC in the first 48 hours, though there was evidence of potential harm. These real-world findings support that clinicians should consider withholding corticosteroids in these populations and further clinical trials may be warranted.","Crothers, Kristina; DeFaccio, Rian; Tate, Janet; Alba, Patrick R; Goetz, Matthew; Jones, Barbara; King, Joseph T; Marconi, Vincent; Ohl, Michael E; Rentsch, Christopher T.; Rodriguez-Barradas, Maria; Shahrir, Shahida; Justice, Amy; Akgun, Kathleen",,618,20

This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average.

The dashboard was made publicly available on 6 April 2020 to illustrate the counts of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19 at the level of country or continent. This dashboard is intended as a user-friendly dashboard for researchers as well as the general public to track the COVID-19 pandemic, and is generated from trusted data sources and built in open-source R software (Shiny in particular); ensuring a high sense of transparency and reproducibility. The R Shiny framework serves as a platform for visualization and analysis of the data, as well as an advance to capitalize on existing data curation to support and enable open science. Coded analysis here includes logistic and Gompertz growth models, as two mathematical tools for predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the Moran's index metric, which gives a spatial perspective via heat maps that may assist in the identification of latent responses and behavioral patterns. This analysis provides real-time statistical application aiming to make sense to academic- and public consumers of the large amount of data that is being accumulated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salehi, Mahdi; Arashi, Mohammad; Bekker, Andriette; Ferreira, Johan; Chen, Ding-Geng; Esmaeili, Foad; Frances, Motala",Front Public Health,618,29

Respondents were recontacted after four months. Information sources included mainstream media, state health departments, the CDC, the White House, and a well-known university. We also examined how demographics, political partisanship, and skepticism about COVID-19 were associated with the perceived trustworthiness of information sources and decreased trustworthiness over time. At baseline, the majority of respondants reported high trust in COVID-19 information from state health departments (75.6%), the CDC (80.9%), and a university (Johns Hopkins, 81.1%). Mainstream media was trusted by less than half the respondents (41.2%), and the White House was the least trusted source (30.9%). At the 4-month follow-up, a significant decrease in trustworthiness in all five sources of COVID-19 information was observed. The most pronounced reductions were from the CDC and the White House. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with rating the CDC, state health department, and a university as trustworthy sources of COVID-19 information were political party affiliation, level of education, and skepticism about COVID-19. The most consistent predictor of decreased trust was political party affiliation, with Democrats as compared to Republicans less likely to report decreased trust across all sources.","Latkin, Carl A; Dayton, Lauren; Strickland, Justin C; Colon, Brian; Rimal, Rajiv; Boodram, Basmattee",J Health Commun,618,1

With the spread of COVID-19, the routine clinical diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer patients has been disturbed. Due to the systemic immunosuppressive of lung cancer patients caused by the malignancy and anticancer treatments, lung cancer patients are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Furthermore, patients with cancer had poorer prognosis from infection. Lung cancer patients should be the priority group for COVID-19 prevention. The protection provisions and control measures aiming to protect lung cancer patients from COVID-19 have been increasingly concerned. During the COVID-19 outbreak period, it should be carefully differentiated for fever and respiratory symptoms for lung cancer patients receiving anti-tumor treatment, in order to evaluate the risk of COVID-19.

The successful development of biosensor to achieve an efficient detection of glioma cells at low concentration remains a great challenge for the personalized glioma therapy. Herein, an ultrasensitive pulse induced electrochemically impedimetric biosensor for glioma cells detection has been successfully fabricated. The 4-11 nm sulfur-doped graphene quantum dots (S-GQDs) are homogeneously deposited onto gold nanoparticles decorated carbon nanospheres (Au-CNS) by Au-thiol linkage to form S-GQDs@Au-CNS nanocomposite which acts as dual functional probe for enhancing the electrochemical activity as well as conjugating the angiopep-2 (Ang-2) for glioma cell detection. Moreover, the application of an externally electrical pulse at +0.6 V expend the surface of glioma cells to accelerate the attachment of glioma cells onto the Ang-2-conjugated S-GQDs@Au-CNS nanocomposite, resulting in the enhanced sensitivity toward glioma cell detection. An ultrasensitive impedimetric detection of glioma cells with a wide linear range of 100-100,000 cells mL-1 and a limit of detection of 40 cells mL-1 is observed. Moreover, the superior selectivity with long-term stability of the developed biosensor in human serum matrix corroborates the feasibility of using S-GQDs@Au-CNS based nanomaterials as the promising sensing probe for practical application to facilitate the ultrasensitive and highly selective detection of cancer cells.","Ganganboina, Akhilesh Babu; Dega, Naresh Kumar; Tran, Hai Linh; Darmonto, Win; Doong, Ruey-An",Biosens Bioelectron,618,20

In this paper, a detailed characterisation of mild-to-moderate ear, nose nd throat (ENT) symptoms is presented with the aim of recognising the disease early to help reduce further spread and progression. Methods: A total of 230 cases testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 134 negative controls were recruited for a case-control analysis. Symptoms were analysed using the Acute Respiratory Tract Infections Questionnaire, while other symptoms were investigated by ad hoc questions. Results: Among the study samples (n = 364), 149 were males and 215 were females with age ranging from 20 to 89 years (mean 52.3). Four main groups of symptoms were obtained: influenza-like symptoms, ENT-symptoms, breathing issues and asthenia-related symptoms, representing 72%, 69%, 64% and 53% of overall referred clinical manifestations, respectively. ENT symptoms, breathing issues and influenza-like symptoms were associated with positivity to SARS-CoV-2, whereas asthenia-related symptoms did not show a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 infection after controlling for other symptoms, comorbidities and demographic characteristics. Conclusions: ENT symptoms are equally represented with influenza-like ones as presenting symptoms of COVID-19.

Despite this, many government agencies and members of the general public may be resistant to NPI adoption. We sought to understand public attitudes and beliefs regarding various NPIs and self-reported adoption of NPIs, and to explore associations between NPI performance and the baseline characteristics of respondents. We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6 and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 [OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p = 0.014] and with a belief that NPIs were not difficult to perform [OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p &lt; 0.0001]. Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently. NPI non-adherence is associated with both outcome expectations (belief that NPIs are effective) and process expectations (belief that NPIs are not overly inconvenient); these findings have important implications for designing public health outreach efforts, where the feasibility, as well as the effectiveness, of NPIs should be stressed.","Kantor, Bella Nichole; Kantor, Jonathan",Front.

Thus, these changes in living conditions have had deleterious consequences on the behavior of PWD and subsequently on their caregivers' mental health, the two being linked. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to examine changes in behavior among PWD and to look for associations between the evolution of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and caregivers' mental health in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: The study was conducted among caregivers of PWD living at home in France. Caregivers were interviewed via an anonymous cross-sectional online survey during the first lockdown between April 15 and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a relative living at home participated in the study; 43.3%of the PWD presented a worsening of BPSD during the lockdown. With multivariate logistic regressions, a significant association was observed between ""more BPSD"" and burden, anxiety and depression, between ""BPSD equivalent"" and anxiety and depression, and between ""emerging BPSD"" and only depression. CONCLUSION: The lockdown seems to have an impact on behavioral disorders in PWD and these disorders are associated with poorer mental health of caregivers. Our findings suggest attention should be given to caregivers of PWD who have BPSD before lockdown and the need for continued consultations and professional help in case of new lockdowns.","Pongan, Elodie; Dorey, Jean-Michel; Borg, Céline; Getenet, Jean Claude; Bachelet, Romain; Lourioux, Charles; Laurent, Bernard; Rey, Romain; Rouch, Isabelle",J Alzheimers Dis,618,16

Data were statistically analyzed with paired sample t test. Results: All the flaps of the 21 patients survived with good blood supply and no infection. The wounds at the donor sites were all healed. All the patients were followed up, with the time rangeing from 8 to 22 months. The appearances of flaps were good with their color and texture similar to the surrounding tissue. There was no pain in the fingertip and pulp, nor any double sensibility in flaps. There was only some linear scar left at the radial side of thumb. At the final follow-up, the static 2-point discrimination of the flaps of the patients was 6 to 11 mm; the appearance of the injured hand evaluation was strongly satisfied in 18 patients and satisfie in the 3 patients. The value of TAM in the injured thumbs and the value of the angle of thumb web of the injured hands of the patients were respectively (140±5)º and (94±9)°, which showed no statistically significant differences with the value of (141±5)º in the contralateral thumbs and (95±9)° in the contralateral hands, respectively (t=-2.024, -1.142, P>0.05). Conclusions: The neurocutaneous vascular flap innervated by terminal branch of lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve, has constant anatomy, simple procedure, good appearance, and provides excellent thumb function. It is a good option for repairing fingertip and pulp wounds of the thumb and worthy of application and promotion.","Wang, H; Yang, X X; Huo, Y X; Hao, R Z; Chang, H; Liu, W; Wang, B",Zhonghua Shao Shang Za Zhi,618,29

Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities-Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown.","Bherwani, Hemant; Nair, Moorthy; Musugu, Kavya; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Kapley, Atya; Kumar, Rakesh",Air Qual Atmos Health,618,1

A total of 200 serially collected nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens from 38 COVID-19 patients and 122 specimens from negative controls were analyzed. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were assessed in comparison to molecular test results and subdivided according to targeted genes (E, RdRP, and N) and days post-symptom onset (PSO). For the kinetics evaluation, cut-off-indices from serial NP specimens were used according to the number of days PSO. Both RATs showed sensitivity of 91.3â100% for specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) < 25. The specificity of AFIAS was 98.7â98.9% and that of ichromaTM was 100.0%. The kappa values of AFIAS and ichromaTM for the molecular testing of specimens with Ct < 25 (RdRP) were 0.97 and 1.00, respectively. The sensitivity of AFIAS and ichromaTM for all genes was lower for specimens collected at 8â14 PSO than for those collected before 7-days PSO. The kinetics profiles showed that antigen levels gradually decreased from &#8804; 7-days PSO to > 22-days PSO. Both RATs showed excellent specificity and acceptable sensitivity for NP specimens with higher viral loads and for specimens collected within 7-days PSO. Hence, they have the potential to become useful tools for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, because of concerns about false negativity, RATs should be used in conjunction with molecular tests.","Kweon, Oh Joo; Lim, Yong Kwan; Kim, Hye Ryoun; Choi, Yoojeong; Kim, Min-Chul; Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Lee, Mi-Kyung",PLoS One,618,2

In a pilot study, the authors used social listening to quickly extract information from social media channels to explore what people with COVID-19 are talking about regarding symptoms and disease progression. The goal was to determine whether, by amplifying patient voices, new information could be identified that might have been missed through other sources. Two data sets from social media groups of people with or presumed to have COVID-19 were analyzed: a Facebook group poll, and conversation data from a Reddit group including detailed disease natural history-like posts. Content analysis and a customized analytics engine that incorporates machine learning and natural language processing were used to quickly identify symptoms mentioned. Key findings include more than 20 symptoms in the data sets that were not listed in online lists of symptoms from 4 respected medical information sources. The disease natural history-like posts revealed that people can experience symptoms for many weeks and that some symptoms change over time. This study demonstrates that social media can offer novel insights into patient experiences as a source of real-world data.

A majority of tumor-promoting kinase signaling pathways feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. The activation status of ERK1/2 during invasion of MB cells is not known and its implication in invasion control unclear. We established a synthetic kinase activation relocation sensor (SKARS) for the MAPK ERK1/2 pathway in MB cells for real-time measuring of drug response. We used 3D invasion assays and organotypic cerebellum slice culture to test drug effects in a physiologically relevant tissue environment. We found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) caused rapid nuclear ERK1/2 activation in MB cells, which persisted for several hours. Concomitant treatment with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib completely repressed nuclear ERK1/2 activity induced by HGF and EGF but not by bFGF. Increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity correlated positively with speed of invasion. Dasatinib blocked ERK-associated invasion in the majority of cells, but we also observed fast-invading cells with low ERK1/2 activity. These ERK1/2-low, fast-moving cells displayed a rounded morphology, while ERK-high fast-moving cells displayed a mesenchymal morphology. Dasatinib effectively blocked EGF-induced proliferation while it only moderately repressed tissue invasion, indicating that a subset of cells may evade invasion repression by dasatinib through non-mesenchymal motility. Thus, growth factor-induced nuclear activation of ERK1/2 is associated with mesenchymal motility and proliferation in MB cells and can be blocked with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib.","Schönholzer, Marc Thomas; Migliavacca, Jessica; Alvarez, Elena; Santhana Kumar, Karthiga; Neve, Anuja; Gries, Alexandre; Ma, Min; Grotzer, Michael A; Baumgartner, Martin",Neoplasia,618,24

COVID-19 mitigation strategies have unintended consequences on managing chronic conditions such as hypertension, a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and health disparities in the United States. During the first wave of the pandemic in the United States, the combination of observed racial/ethnic inequities in COVID-19 deaths and social unrest reinvigorated a national conversation about systemic racism in health care and society. The 4th Annual University of Utah Translational Hypertension Symposium gathered frontline clinicians, researchers, and leaders from diverse backgrounds to discuss the intersection of these 2 critical social and public health phenomena and to highlight preexisting disparities in hypertension treatment and control exacerbated by COVID-19. The discussion underscored environmental and socioeconomic factors that are deeply embedded in US health care and research that impact inequities in hypertension. Structural racism plays a central role at both the health system and individual levels. At the same time, virtual healthcare platforms are being accelerated into widespread use by COVID-19, which may widen the divide in healthcare access across levels of wealth, geography, and education. Blood pressure control rates are declining, especially among communities of color and those without health insurance or access to health care. Hypertension awareness, therapeutic lifestyle changes, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy are essential. There is a need to improve the implementation of community-based interventions and blood pressure self-monitoring, which can help build patient trust and increase healthcare engagement.","Bress, Adam P; Cohen, Jordana B; Anstey, David Edmund; Conroy, Molly B; Ferdinand, Keith C; Fontil, Valy; Margolis, Karen L; Muntner, Paul; Millar, Morgan M; Okuyemi, Kolawole S; Rakotz, Michael K; Reynolds, Kristi; Safford, Monika M; Shimbo, Daichi; Stuligross, John; Green, Beverly B; Mohanty, April F",J Am Heart Assoc,618,24

In this paper we present GAN-DL, a Discriminator Learner based on the StyleGAN2 architecture, which we employ for self-supervised image representation learning in the case of fluorescent biological images. We show that Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks combined with linear Support Vector Machines enable high-throughput compound screening based on raw images. We demonstrate this by classifying active and inactive compounds tested for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in VERO and HRCE cell lines. In contrast to previous methods, our deep learning based approach does not require any annotation besides the one that is normally collected during the sample preparation process. We test our technique on the RxRx19a Sars-CoV-2 image collection. The dataset consists of fluorescent images that were generated to assess the ability of regulatory-approved or in late-stage clinical trials compound to modulate the in vitro infection from SARS-CoV-2 in both VERO and HRCE cell lines. We show that our technique can be exploited not only for classification tasks, but also to effectively derive a dose response curve for the tested treatments, in a self-supervised manner. Lastly, we demonstrate its generalization capabilities by successfully addressing a zero-shot learning task, consisting in the categorization of four different cell types of the RxRx1 fluorescent images collection.","Mascolini, Alessio; Cardamone, Dario; Ponzio, Francesco; Cataldo, Santa Di; Ficarra, Elisa",,618,16

Here, we report the results of a natural experiment where 29 ferrets in one home had prolonged, direct contact and constant environmental exposure to two humans with symptomatic disease, one of whom was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2. We observed no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from humans to ferrets based on viral and antibody assays. To better understand this discrepancy in experimental and natural infection in ferrets, we compared SARS-CoV-2 sequences from natural and experimental mustelid infections and identified two surface glycoprotein Spike (S) mutations associated with mustelids. While we found evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme II provides a weak host barrier, one mutation only seen in ferrets is located in the novel S1/S2 cleavage site and is computationally predicted to decrease furin cleavage efficiency. These data support the idea that host factors interacting with the novel S1/S2 cleavage site may be a barrier in ferret SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and that domestic ferrets are at low risk of natural infection from currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. We propose two mechanistically grounded hypotheses for mustelid host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, with possible effects that require additional investigation.","Sawatzki, Kaitlin; Hill, Nichola J; Puryear, Wendy B; Foss, Alexa D; Stone, Jonathon J; Runstadler, Jonathan A",Proc.

Herein a comprehensive study of swab design considerations for mass production by stereolithography is presented. The retention and comfort performance of a range of novel designs of 3D-printed swabs are compared with the standard flocked-head swab used in clinical environments. Sample retention of the 3D swab is governed by the volume, porosity density, and void fraction of the head as well as by the pore geometry. 3D-printed swabs outperform conventional flock-head swabs in terms of sample retention. It is argued that mechanically functional designs of the swab head, such as corkscrew-shaped heads and negative Poisson ratio heads, maximize sample retention and improve patient comfort. In addition, available designs of swab shafts for an optimized sample collection procedure are characterized. The study is conducted in vitro, using artificial mucus, covering the full range of human mucus viscosities in a 3D-printed model of a nasal cavity.

Severe disease and deaths occur especially in older people with chronic illnesses. Residents of nursing homes are considered to be the most vulnerable group. In this paper, the experiences with COVID-19 in nursing homes in Frankfurt will be presented and discussed. Materials and methods: Based on the data of the statutory reporting obligation, the reported COVID-19 cases are presented and incidences are calculated in different age groups and among residents of nursing homes. Outbreaks in various homes are described in detail based on the documentation from the public health department. Results: By August 28, 2020, 2,665 COVID-19 infections were reported in Frankfurt am Main (incidence 351/100,000 inhabitants), including 116 (4.3%) residents of nursing homes (2,416/100,000 residents). Almost half (39%) of all deaths in Frankfurt (n=69; incidence 9.1/100,000) were among nursing home residents (n=27; incidence 558/100,000 nursing home residents), with 22 of them in just one long-term care facility (LTCF). Compared to previous years, the mortality rate in nursing homes did not increase in the first half of 2020. In one home, 75% of residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 25% died; in two other homes, 6.7% and 14.1% of the residents became infected, and the mortality rate was 0.5% and 1%, resp. In the other 42 homes in the city (3,906 beds), the infection rate remained below 1% and the death rate was 0.1%. Discussion: In many countries, 30-70% of all deaths occur among nursing home residents, including Frankfurt (39%). An increase in overall mortality compared to previous years was not observed in Frankfurt as a whole or in the nursing homes in the city specifically. Due to the measures taken (monitoring of residents and staff, nursing care in protective clothing, prohibition or restriction of visits, physical distancing, isolation of infected people and quarantining of contact persons), only individual cases of COVID-19 illnesses occurred in nursing home residents in most homes and the outbreaks in the three homes could be stopped. We do not recommend regular nontargeted testing in nursing homes, but rather vigilance and the implementation of good hygiene as well as immediate targeted testing if COVID-19 is suspected in residents or staff. In order to mitigate the considerable negative effects of these measures on the residents, a good balance should be sought between infection prevention and the goal of ensuring self-determination and the residents' quality of life.","Heudorf, Ursel; Müller, Maria; Schmehl, Cleo; Gasteyer, Stephanie; Steul, Katrin",GMS Hyg Infect Control,618,24

METHODS: A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/µL versus 70/µL, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/µL, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratio's (0.621 versus 0.846, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Eosinopenia - <10/µL - and eosinophil/PMN ratio are useful, low-cost, reproducible tools to help diagnose COVID-19, during an epidemic period, in a population of hospitalized patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19.","Outh, Roderau; Boutin, Caroline; Gueudet, Philippe; Suzuki, Marcelino; Saada, Matthieu; Aumaître, Hugues",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,618,29

Our monthly OMFS journal club has been no different, and is currently meeting on the video conferencing application Microsoft Teams. The use of a virtual setting for training in medicine and dentistry is not new and, as in the case of our recent move to a virtual medium, it may be that COVID-19 has fast-tracked this digital transformation. There are of course disadvantages to online teaching that traditional face-to-face teaching overcomes. We conducted a survey to examine how trainees' attitudes and experiences have altered with this change, and to understand whether some elements of this new style of training may be advantageous in the post-pandemic world. We aimed to assess trainees' attitudes towards online teaching, and which elements, if any, would be beneficial once face-to-face teaching becomes possible again. A survey was created for all trainees taking part in journal club meetings at Bradford Teaching Hospitals. Multiple-choice and Likert scale questions were designed to ascertain the differences in experience between online and face-to-face settings. A Wilcoxon matched pairs signed test was used to analyse the results. Responses were kept anonymous. Results showed that the majority of trainees found it easier to attend the online journal club, and also indicated that the most found Microsoft Teams easy to use, though we did not have another online application for comparison. There was no significant difference in participation comfort between the two settings, though trainees felt that the online setting considerably improved learning effectiveness. Furthermore, 79% (11/14) thought that online tutorials and meetings should replace traditional face-to-face meetings in the future. The use of internet technology such as video conferencing is not new, and although journal clubs are typically held in academic institutions, online and virtual clubs are flourishing. With an array of advantages, there is no shying away from the trend to move our teaching to a virtual medium.

Despite numerous preliminary results, there is as yet no treatment of proven efficacy for this condition. In this context, the pharmacological properties of lithium, better known as a treatment for mood disorders, merit closer examination. Lithium has shown in vitro efficacy at inhibiting the replication of coronaviruses responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in animals. It has immunomodulatory properties that may be of additional benefit in moderating the host inflammatory response to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, there is evidence that lithium may exert a protective action against upper respiratory infections and influenza-like illnesses in patients taking it for other indications. These promising reports must be balanced against the narrow therapeutic index and high risk of toxicity associated with lithium therapy, its documented interactions with several commonly used drugs, and the absence of evidence of its efficacy against coronaviruses responsible for human disease. Nevertheless, naturalistic studies of the risk of COVID-19 in patients already receiving lithium could provide indirect evidence of its efficacy, and understanding the putative antiviral and immune-regulatory mechanisms of lithium in models of SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide leads for the development of safer and more effective treatments with a specific action against COVID-19.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Drug Dev Res,618,24

COVID-19 has been spreading swiftly globally, and as of March 2020, has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the challenges in managing COVID-19 is the identification of a swift, accessible, and reliable diagnostic modality that could serve as an alternative to a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). As of the writing of this paper, RT-PCR is still the recommended tool in diagnosing COVID-19, but the notion of a more prompt and accurate diagnostic tool is a possibility worth looking into. The objective of this case study is to investigate the importance and utility of chest computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID-19, as increasing pieces of evidence suggest that chest CT could prove useful in the clinical pathway in diagnosing COVID-19.","Tenda, Eric Daniel; Yulianti, Mira; Asaf, Moses Mazmur; Yunus, Reyhan Eddy; Septiyanti, Wita; Wulani, Vally; Pitoyo, Ceva Wicaksono; Rumende, Cleopas Martin; Setiati, Siti",Acta Med Indones,618,30

The reliability was determined based on the Cronbach's alpha internal consistency measurement and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The Pearson correlation analysis results are significantly higher (r > 0.254, p < 0.01) compared to the critical value table. Single factors accounting for 57.66% variance in the scales exhibit a unidimensional latent structure. The internal consistency between items is excellent as shown by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient (0.91). The ICC analysis shows an acceptable result (0.552, p < 0.01).

Not only mutation of the CEBPA gene, but also promoter methylation, which results in silencing of CEBPA, contributes to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We sought for another differentially methylated region (DMR) that associate with the CEBPA silencing and disease phenotype. METHODS: Using databases, we identified a conserved DMR in the CEBPA 3'-untranslated region (UTR). RESULTS: Methylation-specific PCR analysis of 231 AML cases showed that hypermethylation of the 3'-UTR was associated with AML that had a myeloid/NK/T-cell phenotype and down-regulated CEBPA. Most of these cases were of an immature phenotype with CD7/CD56 positivity. These cases were significantly associated with lower hemoglobin levels than the others. Furthermore, we discovered that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR can enhance transcription from the CEBPA native promoter. In vitro experiments identified IKZF1 binding sites in the 3'-UTR that are responsible for this increased transcription of CEBPA. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the CEBPA 3'-UTR DMR is a novel regulatory element of CEBPA related to myeloid/NK/T-cell lineage leukemogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of CEBPA by IKZF1 may provide a clue for understanding the fate determination of myeloid vs. NK/T-lymphoid progenitors.","Kimura, Yukiko; Iwanaga, Eisaku; Iwanaga, Kouta; Endo, Shinya; Inoue, Yoshitaka; Tokunaga, Kenji; Nagahata, Yousuke; Masuda, Kyoko; Kawamoto, Hiroshi; Matsuoka, Masao",Eur. j. haematol,618,3

Moreover, we explore whether a country's level of income can augment the underlying relationship between stock market declines and stimulus packages. The findings reveal that a larger stock market decline results in a larger stimulus package; however, this effect is only observed in countries that have an income level greater than the mean and/or median per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Moreover, our results show that monetary policy is more responsive to a stock market decline than fiscal policy.

METHODS: A cohort-based probabilistic simulation model, informed by the latest epidemiological estimates on COVID-19 in the United States provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature review. Heterogeneity of parameter values across age group was accounted for. The main outcome studied was QALYs for the infected patient, patient's family members, and the contagion effect of the infected patient over the duration of the pandemic. RESULTS: Averting a COVID-19 infection in a representative US resident will generate an additional 0.061 (0.016-0.129) QALYs (for the patient: 0.055, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.014-0.115; for the patient's family members: 0.006, 95% CI 0.002-0.015). Accounting for the contagion effect of this infection, and assuming that an effective vaccine will be available in 3 months, the total QALYs gains from averting 1 single infection is 1.51 (95% CI 0.28-4.37) accrued to patients and their family members affected by the index infection and its sequelae. These results were robust to most parameter values and were most influenced by effective reproduction number, probability of death outside the hospital, the time-varying hazard rates of hospitalization, and death in critical care. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the health benefits of averting 1 COVID-19 infection in the United States are substantial.

This has led to an increase in internet usage including social media. This study was carried out in order to discover how the pandemic affected the Maltese population who use social media networks daily. METHODS: A dataset comprising more than 50,000 comments and in excess of 150,000 interactions were extracted from Facebook over four months. The method was quantitative and qualitative. Pearson correlation was used to analyse trends. RESULTS: Online interaction increased 200% between February-April 2020, with a significant positive correlation. There was also a significant correlation between online interaction and engagement and the Covid-19 situation in Malta (p âª 0.0001). Online posts portraying a sense of care, affection, and unity increased by more than 300% over the same period, and this also significantly correlated with the number of COVID-19 cases in Malta (p âª 0.0001). An increase in the number of COVID-19 cases had an emotional impact mainly on anxiety and agitation. DISCUSSION: The pandemic has unleashed a veritable 'infodemic' (an over-abundance of information - some accurate and some not). Social media engagement may have been resorted to not only to seek information but also to interact with friends and family who were not physically accessible due to social distancing measures. Yet another reason could have been to seek comfort and reassurance by interacting with those closest to us. Social media is not only an everyday tool but also a haven of last resort when physical connection is not possible.","Agius, Steve; Grech, Anton; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,618,1

A subsequent quantitative study demonstrated that, although the fragile church thesis was more strongly endorsed by rural clergy it was also endorsed by clergy serving in other areas. The present study conducted among 2,496 Church of England laity confirms that the thesis is not just in the mind of the clergy, but to a lesser extent in the mind of the laity as well. Once again the thesis is more strongly endorsed by laity living in rural areas than by laity living elsewhere. The current study points to serious investment in discipleship learning as a strategy for addressing the malaise underpinning the fragile church thesis and invites the rural church to rise to this challenge.

In many cases, these differences in behaviour relate to pre-existing group identities. However, in times of rapid societal change, novel opinion-based groups can emerge and provide a new basis for partisan identification and divergent collective behaviour. Here, we use network methods to map the emergence of opposing opinion-based groups and assess their implications for public health behaviour. In a longitudinal study, we tracked public health attitudes and self-reported behaviour in a sample of UK participants over four time points. Network visualisation reveal a rift in attitudinal alignment over time and the genesis of two distinct groups characterised by trust, or distrust, in science (Study 1a; N = 253). These groups also diverge in public health behaviour. In a brief follow-up study (N = 206), we find that this opinion polarization partially reflects underlying societal divides. We discuss implications for opinion-based group research and public health campaigns.","Maher, Paul J; MacCarron, Pádraig; Quayle, Michael",Br J Soc Psychol,618,2

The 14-day quarantine caused surgery of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) postponed. We aimed to explore the risk factors of RRD progression in a group of patients whose surgery was postponed during the top-level emergency response of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective case series. Medical records of all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of RRD who underwent a surgical treatment at Beijing Tongren Hospital's retina service from February 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020 have been reviewed retrospectively. Medical history, symptoms, and clinical signs of progression of RRD were recorded. RRD progression was defined as the presence of either choroidal detachment or proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) progression during the quarantine period. Risk factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model, survival analysis, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Seventy-nine eyes of 79 patients met the inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The median time from the patients' presentation at the clinic to admission for surgery was 14 days (3-61 days). There were 70 cases (88.6%) who did not present to the hospital within 1 week of the onset of visual symptoms. There were 69 (87.3%) macular-off cases at the presentation and 27 (34.2%) cases combined with choroidal detachment. There were 49 (62.0%) cases with PVR B, 22 (27.8%) cases with PVR C, 4 (5.1%) cases with PVR D, and 4 (5.1%) cases with anterior PVR. After the 14-day quarantine, 21 (26.6%) cases showed RRD progression, and 9 cases showed RRD regression at the time of surgery. Neither the time of onset of the visual symptom (p = 0.46) nor the time between presentation and admission (p = 0.31) was significantly different between the patients with RRD progression and patients without RRD progression. The combination of choroidal detachment (3.07, 1.68-5.60, p<0.001) and retinal breaks located posterior to the equator (3.79, 1.21-11.80, p=0.02) were factors related to the progression of RRD. CONCLUSIONS: In our study during the COVID-19 outbreak, the RRD progression risk factors included a combination of choroidal detachment and retinal breaks posterior to the equator. Ophthalmologists should schedule the surgeries for RRD patients with these signs as soon as possible.","Zhao, Meng; Li, Jipeng; She, Haicheng; Liu, Ningpu",BMC Ophthalmol,618,1

Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence and characterize specific symptoms associated with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study included 326 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection evaluated at the Emergency Department of the Umberto I Polyclinic Hospital, Rome, Italy between March 6th and April 30th, 2020. In order to assess xerostomia, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions secondary to COVID-19, a telephone-based a modified survey obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 for taste and smell disorders and the Fox Questionnaire for dry mouth were administered to 111 patients (34%) after discharge between June 4th and June 12th. RESULTS: Taste dysfunction was the most common reported symptom (59.5%; n = 66), followed by xerostomia (45.9%; n = 51) and olfactory dysfunctions (41.4%; n = 46). The most severe symptom was olfactory dysfunction with a median severity score of 8.5 (range: 5-10). Overall 74.5% (n = 38) of patients with xerostomia, 78.8% (n = 52) of patients with gustatory dysfunctions and 71.1% (n = 33) of patients with olfactory dysfunctions reported that all symptoms appeared before COVID-19 diagnosis. Overall, the majority of patients reported one symptom only (45.9%, n = 51), 37 (33.3%) reported the association of two symptoms, and 23 (20.7%) patients reported the association of three symptoms at the same time. CONCLUSION: Xerostomia, gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions may present as a prodromal or as the sole manifestation of COVID-19.

Healthy older adults have been shown to have a 15-20% lower walking economy compared with young adults. However, older adults who run for exercise have a higher walking economy compared with older adults who walk for exercise. Yet, it remains unclear if other aerobic exercises yield similar improvements on walking economy. The purpose of this study was to determine if regular bicycling exercise affects walking economy in older adults. We measured metabolic rate while 33 older adult ""bicyclists"" or ""walkers"" and 16 young adults walked on a level treadmill at four speeds between (0.75-1.75 m/s). Across the range of speeds, older bicyclists had a 9-17% greater walking economy compared with older walkers (p = .009). In conclusion, bicycling exercise mitigates the age-related deterioration of walking economy, whereas walking for exercise has a minimal effect on improving walking economy.","Aslan, Daniel H; Collette, Joshua M; Ortega, Justus D",J Aging Phys Act,618,1

No Brasil tem sido relatado um número crescente de cães infectados, entretanto a maioria deles não apresentam sinais clínicos aparentes, porém alterações laboratoriais podem ser encontradas. Sendo os exames complementares essenciais, junto com o histórico e exame físico, para a avaliação do estado clínico do animal antes do tratamento adulticida. O único tratamento reconhecido é o dicloridrato de melarsomina, porém além de causar tromboembolismo nos animais tratados não se encontra disponível no mercado brasileiro, levando alguns autores a estudar tratamentos alternativos, utilizando tetraciclinas e lactonas macrocíclicas. Desta forma, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar as alterações hematológicas e bioquímicas, além da eficácia das lactonas macrocíclicas em associação com tetraciclinas em cães naturalmente infectados com D. immitis. Para avaliação hematológica foram analisados 51 animais sorologicamente positivos, domiciliados, de ambos os sexos, sem critério racial, idade superior a seis meses, negativos para hematozoários no exame parasitológico, bem como animais que não fizeram uso de doxiciclina e lactonas macrocíclicas nos últimos seis meses. Todos foram submetidos ao exame parasitológico, onde foram divididos em grupos microfilarêmicos e amicrofilarêmicos. Os parâmetros hematológicos e bioquímicos foram interpretados baseados nos valores de referência. Dos 51 animais, 35,3% (18) eram microfilarêmicos e 64,7% (33) amicrofilarêmicos. Em ambos os grupos foi observado microcitose, eosinofilia e hiperproteinemia sem diferenças estatísticas. Os monócitos estavam dentro dos valores de referência, porém apresentaram diferença estatística entre os grupos, com maior quantidade no grupo microfilarêmico, além disso, foi encontrado trombocitopenia apenas no grupo amicrofilarêmico com diferença estatística. Entretanto a média dos valores bioquímicos estavam dentro dos valores de normalidade e sem diferenças estatísticas entre os grupos. Para a realização do tratamento foram utilizados seis cães, provenientes do atendimento ambulatorial do Hospital Veterinário da UFRPE, destes 50% fêmeas, todos de raças variadas e adultos. Foram avaliados do ponto de vista clínico, submetidos ao exame sorológico SNAP ® 4DX, teste rápido DPP® para Leishmaniose Visceral Canina, e pesquisa parasitológica de hematozoários e microfilárias circulantes. Os animais foram submetidos ao protocolo de tratamento com doxiciclina na dose de 5mg/kg a cada 12 horas durante 30 dias, e posteriormente ivermectina na dose de 0,006mg/kg uma vez por mês, por tempo indeterminado.

The aim of this study is to meet the global requirements of knowledge on ventilatory management, prepare and to evaluate the effectiveness of the teaching module for non-anesthesiology trainees on COVID-19 patients. Methods: Quasi experimental cross sectional pilot study was conducted with a sample of twenty-six trainees. A teaching module was prepared and validated which consisted of lectures, audio-video sessions, demonstrations with hands-on training, debriefing, analytical-phase and reflection. Pre and Post evaluations from student t-test and direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) were used for knowledge and skill assessment respectively and feedback obtained from Likert's score. Results: Pre- and Post-tests had a mean score of 7.42 ± 2.12 and 14.92 ± 2.9 respectively (P value 0.00001). DOPS included 16 point score, in which 23 trainees (88.4%) met the expectations and above expectations as per training objectives.

Signs and symptoms of gallstone disease are nausea/vomiting, right upper quadrant tenderness, and a history of gallstone disease. With persistence of the obstruction, inflammation and bacterial overgrowth within the gallbladder lumen and tissue may lead to eventual venous congestion, pressure necrosis and even empyema of the gallbladder. CASE REPORT A 60-year old male presented with complaints of mild mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back. He denied previous similar history. CT and ultrasound of the abdomen revealed acute cholecystitis. During surgery, it was clear that the imaging did not accurately represent the severity of the infection and he was diagnosed with gallbladder empyema. Surgery was difficult but was successfully finished. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results normalized by post-operative day 3 and he was discharged. He had no further complications during 2-week follow up. CONCLUSIONS Physicians should keep the abnormal presentations of gallbladder empyema in mind and prepare themselves for a presentation different from imaging during surgery. Several prognostic factors including gallbladder wall thickness, gender, white cell count and diabetes mellitus have been associated with severe complicated cholecystitis and empyema of the gallbladder.","Elkbuli, Adel; Sanchez, Carol; Kinslow, Kyle; McKenney, Mark; Boneva, Dessy",Am J Case Rep,618,25

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","Chan, Daniel Kam Yin; Mclaws, Mary-Louise; Forsyth, Duncan Ronald",Int. j. qual. health care,618,24

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Prolonged respiratory failure is common in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the disease process caused by infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tracheostomy, although posing potential risk to the operative team and other healthcare workers, may be beneficial for safe weaning of sedation and ventilator support. However, short- and long-term outcomes remain largely unknown. METHODS: A prospectively collected database of patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy at a major medical center in New York City between April 4 and April 30, 2020 was reviewed. The primary endpoint was need for continued mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes included complication rates, sedation weaning, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) level of care. Patient characteristics, perioperative conditions, and outcomes between percutaneous and open groups were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 67 consecutive patients underwent tracheostomy, including 48 males and 19 females with a median age of 66 years [interquartile range (IQR) 52-72]. Two surgeons alternated techniques, with 35 tracheostomies performed percutaneously and 32 via an open approach. The median time from intubation to tracheostomy was 23 days (IQR 20-26). At a median follow-up of 26 days, 52 patients (78%) no longer required mechanical ventilation and 58 patients (87%) were off continuous sedation. Five patients (7.5%) died of systemic causes. There were 11 total complications (16%) in 10 patients, most of which involved minor bleeding. There were no significant differences in outcomes between percutaneous and open methods. CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy under apneic conditions by either percutaneous or open technique can be safely performed in patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Tracheostomy facilitated weaning from continuous intravenous sedation and mechanical ventilation. Continued follow-up of these patients to ascertain long-term outcome data is ongoing.","Long, Sallie M; Chern, Alexander; Feit, Noah Z; Chung, Sei; Ramaswamy, Apoorva T; Li, Carol; Cooley, Victoria; Hill, Shanna; Rajwani, Kapil; Villena-Vargas, Jonathan; Scheneck, Edward; Stiles, Brendon; Tassler, Andrew B",Ann. surg,618,16

AIM: This study aimed to investigate the association between vitamin D serum level and anthropometric indices of overweight and obese male adolescents at baseline and after 18 weeks of a weight reduction intervention. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 90 male students aged 12 to 16 years who were randomly selected from two schools in Tehran, Iran. The participants were assigned to two groups with high and low vitamin D level based on their serum vitamin D levels at baseline. Five ml blood samples were collected at the baseline and after the 18 weeks of a weight reduction intervention. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percent and body muscle percent were measured using a bio impedance analysis (BIA) scale. RESULTS: Vitamin D level in non-obese adolescents was significantly higher than the obese participants (44.01 vs 37.67 ng/dl, p < 0.04). However, there was no significant correlation between changes of vitamin D level and anthropometric measurements after 18 weeks. Adjusting the effect of age did not alter the association. Further adjustments for physical activity, dietary intake of vitamin D, and fat and muscle percentage had no effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS: The serum level of vitamin D was negatively associated with obesity, but not with short-term changes of anthropometric measurements in male adolescents.","Doaei, Saeid; Jarrahi, Seyed; Torki, Saheb; Haghshenas, Rulollah; Jamshidi, Zahra; Rezaei, Shahla; Moslem, Alireza; Ghorat, Fereshteh; Khodabakhshi, Adeleh; Gholamalizadeh, Maryam",Pediatr Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,618,2

Given the known human protein machinery for (a) SARS-CoV-2 entry, (b) the host innate immune response, and (c) virus-host interactions (protein-protein and RNA-protein), the potential effects of human genetic variation in this machinery, which may contribute to clinical differences in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and help determine individual risk for COVID-19 infection, are explored. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) was used to show that several rare germline exome variants of proteins in these pathways occur in the human population, suggesting that carriers of these rare variants (especially for proteins of innate immunity pathways) are at risk for severe symptoms (like the severe symptoms in patients who are known to be rare variant carriers), whereas carriers of other variants could have a protective advantage against infection. The occurrence of genetic variation is thus expected to motivate the experimental probing of natural variants to understand the mechanistic differences in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis from one individual to another.","Chakravarty, Suvobrata",J. proteome res,618,10

Initial efforts to evaluate changes in college drinking have not yet accounted for typical drinking patterns within a semester. METHODS: To fill this gap, we evaluated how college student drinking patterns changed with the onset of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic during spring 2020 relative to spring 2018 and 2019. Participants were 1,365 college students aged 19 and older, including 895 students who reported past-month alcohol use. Daily drinking data were extracted from an online Timeline Followback survey. RESULTS: Negative binomial hurdle models revealed that, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, college student drinkers did not increase their drinking frequency as was typical in late spring semester, and the number of drinks per occasion declined substantially (28% reduction), greater than the change observed from early to late spring 2018 (3% reduction) or spring 2019 (8% increase). This reduction in drinking quantity in spring 2020 was larger for college student drinkers who moved residences because of the pandemic (49% reduction) than students who did not move (21% reduction). Perceptions in pandemic-related changes in drinking also revealed that 83.5% of college student drinkers self-reported that their drinking stayed the same or decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that, on average, college students drank less-not more-during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of living situation in college student drinking behavior. More research is needed to assess alcohol use in other universities, as this information could be utilized in norms-based interventions to further reduce drinking in students who remain at risk.","Jaffe, Anna E; Kumar, Shaina A; Ramirez, Jason J; DiLillo, David",Alcohol Clin Exp Res,618,26

Healthcare personnel (HCP) were disproportionately affected, accounting for approximately 10% of notified cases. Exclusion from work for 7 days was recommended for HCP with high-risk occupational exposure. Our aim was to evaluate the 7-day exclusion from work policy for HCP with high-risk exposure. METHODS: HCP with a history of occupational exposure to COVID-19 were notified to the Hellenic National Public Health Organization, regardless of their exposure risk category. Exposed HCP were followed for 14 days after last exposure. RESULTS: We prospectively studied 3398 occupationally exposed HCP; nursing personnel accounted for most exposures (n=1705; 50.2%). Of the 3398 exposed HCP, 1599 (47.1%) were classified as low-risk, 765 (22.5%) as moderate-risk, and 1031 (30.4%) as high-risk exposures. Sixty-six (1.9%) HCP developed COVID-19 at a mean of 3.65 days (range: 0-17 days) post-exposure. Of the 66 HCP with COVID-19, 46, 7, and 13 had a history of high-, moderate- or low-risk exposure (4.5%, 0.9%, and 0.8% of all high-, moderate-, and low-risk exposures, respectively). Hospitalization and absenteeism were more prevalent among HCP with high-risk exposure. A logistic regression analysis showed that the following variables were significantly associated with an increased risk for the onset of COVID-19: male, administrative personnel, underlying disease and high-risk exposure. CONCLUSION: HCP with high-risk occupational exposure to COVID-19 had increased probability of serious morbidity, healthcare seeking, hospitalization and absenteeism. Our findings justify the 7-day exclusion from work policy for HCP with high-risk exposure.","Maltezou, Helena C; Dedoukou, Xanthi; Tseroni, Maria; Tsonou, Evi; Raftopoulos, Vasileios; Papadima, Kalliopi; Mouratidou, Elisavet; Poufta, Sophia; Panagiotakopoulos, George; Hatzigeorgiou, Dimitrios; Sipsas, Nikolaos",Clin. infect. dis,618,1

METHODS: This report is a sub-analysis of a larger qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with PWID admitted to an academic medical center from 2017 to 2020 for an invasive injection-related infection. Standard qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of both inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the effects of COVID-19 on participants. RESULTS: Among the 30 PWID interview participants, 14 reported barriers to accessing health and addiction services due to COVID-19. As facilities decreased appointment availability or transitioned to telemedicine, PWID reported being unable to access services. Social distancing led to isolation or loneliness during hospital stays and in the community. Recovery meetings and support groups, critical to addiction recovery, were particularly affected. Other participants reported that uncertainty and fear of contracting the virus generated changes in behavior that led them to avoid seeking services. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has disrupted health systems and social services, leading PWID to experience unprecedented barriers to accessing and maintaining health and addiction services in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Opioid use disorder management must be understood as a holistic process, and a multidisciplinary approach to ensuring comprehensive care, even in the midst of this pandemic, is needed.","Gleason, Emily; Nolan, Nathanial S; Marks, Laura R; Habrock, Tracey; Liang, Stephen Y; Durkin, Michael J",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),618,26

A rapid defeat of the pandemic requires carrying out on the population a mass screening, able to separate positive from negative cases. Such a cleaning will free a flow of productive population. The current rate and cost of testing, performed with the common PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method and with the available resources, is forcing a selection of the subjects to be tested. Indeed, each one must be examined individually at the cost of precious time. Moreover, the exclusion of potentially positive individuals from screening induces health risks, a broad slowdown in the effort to curb the viral spread, and the consequent mortality rates. We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of Infected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate sample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the joint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients and in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the first or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional correlation case in function of the infection probability. The multi-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered. Extensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their outcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or thousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable. Purim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular international event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is growing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion. Therefore, the earlier, the better.","Fargion, Benjamin Isac; Fargion, Daniele; Lucentini, Pier Giorgio De Sanctis; Habib, Emanuele",,618,24

Customarily, this feature has been treated somewhat superficially in phylogenetic analyses, often as a single 'defining' character of a chondrichthyan clade. TCC is actually a complex hard tissue with numerous distinctive attributes, but its utility as a character complex for phylogenetic analysis has not yet been optimized. In this paper, we attempt to improve this situation by presenting new terminology for certain aspects of tesseral architecture, including single-monolayered, multiple-monolayered, polylayered and voussoir tesserae; new histological data, including thin sections of TCC in several Paleozoic taxa; and new proposals for ways in which various characters and states (many of which are defined here for the first time) could be applied in future phylogenetic analyses of chondrichthyan fishes. We conclude that many, but not all of the unique attributes of modern TCC were evolved by the Early Devonian (ca 400 MY). The globular calcified cartilage reported in Silurian sinacanthids, and the so-called 'sub-tessellated' perichondral biomineralization (with irregular and ill-defined geometries of a layer or layers of calcified cartilage blocks) of certain extinct 'acanthodians' (e.g., Climatius, Ischnacanthus, Cheiracanthus) could represent evolutionary precursors of TCC, which seems to characterize only part of the chondrichthyan total group. We hypothesize that heavily biomineralized 'layer-cake' TCC in certain Paleozoic chondrichthyans perhaps served a dual physiological role, as a phosphate sink and in providing increased skeletal density in very large (7+ m) Devonian-Permian marine sharks such as ctenacanths, and as an adaptation to calcium-deficient environments among Permo-Carboniferous non-marine sharks such as xenacanths. By contrast, the equivalent tissue in modern elasmobranchs probably serves only to reinforce regions of cartilage (mostly in the jaws) subjected to high loading. We also note that much of the variation observed in tesseral architecture (including localized remodeling), ultrastructure and histology in modern and extinct chondrichthyans is confined to the perichondrally-facing cap zone (where Type-1 collagen matrix predominates in modern TCC), whereas the main body of the tessera (where Type-2 collagen matrix predominates) exhibits comparatively little evidence of remodeling and histological or structural variation.

OBJECTIVE: ""United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"" office in Ecuador in collaboration with ""Universidad de Las Américas"", performed a surveillance screening at shelters for women victims of gender violence granting access to RT-qPCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis since July 2020, few weeks after the general population lockdown was lifted. RESULTS: From 411 people tested, 52 tests were SARS-CoV-2 positive, yielding an overall high attack rate of 12.65%. Moreover, COVID-19 outbreaks were found in 9 out of 11 shelters included on the study. While attacks rates vary among shelters, no association was found with occupancy. CONCLUSION: This study is key to clarify the epidemiological situation in this highly vulnerable population in Latin America, and remark the importance of massive testing beyond symptomatic population to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Vallejo-Janeta, Alexander Paolo; Morales-Jadan, Diana; Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Lozada, Tannya; Cherrez-Bohorquez, Cesar; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Int. j. infect. dis,618,16

AIMS: To assess the burden and impact of cardiovascular comorbidities in women with COVID-19. METHODS: All consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 across 24 hospitals from 26 February to 20 April 2020 were included. The primary composite outcome was transfer to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death. RESULTS: Among 2878 patients, 1212 (42.1%) were women. Women were older (68.3±18.0 vs. 65.4±16.0 years; P<0.001), but had less prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities than men. Among women, 276 (22.8%) experienced the primary outcome, including 161 (13.3%) transfers to an intensive care unit and 115 (9.5%) deaths without transfer to intensive care unit. The rate of in-hospital death or transfer to an intensive care unit was lower in women versus men (crude hazard ratio [HR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.72). Age (adjusted HR: 1.05 per 5-year increase, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10), body mass index (adjusted HR: 1.06 per 2-unit increase, 95% CI: 1.02-1.10), chronic kidney disease (adjusted HR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.11-2.22) and heart failure (adjusted HR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.04-2.22) were independently associated with the primary outcome in women. Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide/N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (adjusted HR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.70-3.44) and troponin (adjusted HR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.39-2.88) concentrations at admission were also associated with the primary outcome, even in women free of previous coronary artery disease or heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Although female sex was associated with a lower risk of transfer to an intensive care unit or in-hospital death, COVID-19 remained associated with considerable morbimortality in women, especially in those with cardiovascular diseases.","Weizman, Orianne; Mika, Delphine; Cellier, Joffrey; Geneste, Laura; Trimaille, Antonin; Pommier, Thibaut; Panagides, Vassili; Marsou, Wassima; Deney, Antoine; Attou, Sabir; Delmotte, Thomas; Ribeyrolles, Sophie; Chemaly, Pascale; Karsenty, Clément; Giordano, Gauthier; Gautier, Alexandre; Chaumont, Corentin; Guilleminot, Pierre; Sagnard, Audrey; Pastier, Julie; Duceau, Baptiste; Sutter, Willy; Fauvel, Charles; Pezel, Théo; Bonnet, Guillaume; Cohen, Ariel; Waldmann, Victor",Arch Cardiovasc Dis,618,26

Such interactions might arise from COVID-19 immune responses, from infection of neurons themselves or may reflect social-psychological causes. To clarify this we sought the key gene expression pathways altered in COVID-19 also affected in bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophrenia, since this may identify pathways of interaction that could be treatment targets. We performed large scale comparisons of whole transcriptome data and immune factor transcript data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COVID-19 patients and patients with psychiatric disorders. We also analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, comparing GWAS and whole-genome sequence data from patients with bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia patients. These studies revealed altered signalling and ontology pathways shared by COVID-19 patients and the three psychiatric disorders. Finally, co-expression and network analyses identified gene clusters common to the conditions. COVID-19 patients had peripheral blood immune system profiles that overlapped with those of patients with psychiatric conditions. From the pathways identified, PTSD profiles were the most highly correlated with COVID-19, perhaps consistent with stress-immune system interactions seen in PTSD. We also revealed common inflammatory pathways that may exacerbate psychiatric disorders, which may support the usage of anti-inflammatory medications in these patients. It also highlights the potential clinical application of multi-level dataset studies in difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders in this COVID-19 pandemic.","Moni, Mohammad Ali; Lin, Ping-I; Quinn, Julian M W; Eapen, Valsamma",Transl Psychiatry,618,33

METHOD: Chest CT derived measurements were evaluated retrospectively for 217 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Using a CT histogram analysis, we measured pectoralis muscle volume (PV) and pectoralis muscle density (PD). Patients were divided into groups first according to gender and then subgroups, which are age and outcome. RESULTS: The COVID-19 diagnoses were confirmed by RT-PCR testing, chest CT and clinical findings in 217 patients (108 men, 109 women), aged 21-92 years (mean 61 years). PD measurements were lower in the exitus group (p = 0.001) and in patients aged &#8805;65 than in those aged <65 years (p < 0.05). There was a significant difference between PD measurements of outpatient and inpatient under 65 years age (p < 0.05). Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between fatty volume measurements according to the exitus status of cases (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CT-derived measurements of the pectoralis muscle can be useful in predicting disease severity and mortality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia in adult patients.","Hocaoglu, Elif; Ors, Suna; Yildiz, Omer; Inci, Ercan",Acad. radiol,618,1

This study describes abortion centre staff's perceptions of the influence of protective measures on abortion consultations and procedures, and aims to identify obstacles and opportunities that arose from this situation. Through the anonymised patient records of one Flemish abortion centre, we compared the number of requests and abortions during the first lockdown (16 March-14 June 2020) with the same period in the five preceding years. Using a phenomenological approach, we documented the procedures and conducted interviews (all inductively coded in Nvivo) with the centre's coordinator, seven psychosocial staff members and three doctors. Though fewer people requested and had an abortion, the pressure on the staff was high due to changed procedures. A substantial change was the substitution of telephone for in-person consultations, which the staff perceived as less suited for discussing worries, contraception counselling, and building trust. The centre remained accessible, but the staff perceived an influence on the emotional reactions of clients. Staff agreed that the lockdown did not negatively influence the abortion procedure itself. However, they felt a negative influence on the level of psychological support they could offer, especially in interactions with clients who were less certain of their choice and clients with whom there was no common language. When the lockdown was relaxed, a triage system was set up to ensure emotionally safe abortion care - as perceived by staff - for all clients.","De Kort, Leen; Wouters, Edwin; Van de Velde, Sarah",Sex Reprod Health Matters,618,16

We speculate that the perceived threat of COVID-19 is related to a general, non-target-specific aggressive tendency during the pandemic. We surveyed 1556 Chinese people in April 2020 (757 people in Hubei Province, the pandemic epicenter in China, and 799 in other regions of China where the pandemic is relatively not severe). A multiple-group structural equation modeling analysis found significant total effects between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic in both regional groups, and the effect between them was mainly achieved through the mediating roles of sense of control and powerlessness during the pandemic. For all participants, negative coping strategies significantly aggravated the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic, but the buffers were different across regions of outbreak severity. For participants in other regions where the pandemic is relatively not severe, positive coping strategies could mitigate the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressions. However, for participants in Hubei Province, the epicenter of China's pandemic, higher life satisfaction was more effective in buffering. These findings extend the possible consequences of the perceived COVID-19 threat and suggest that improving the life satisfaction of residents in areas with severe outbreaks is more effective in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19.

Two drugs are being used as antiviral against this virus; cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, although controversy exists concerning their effectiveness. The main objective of this report is to present the electronic properties of cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that might help explain the action mechanisms against virus. The idea that emerges from this study is that acid-base equilibrium is not the only criteria of importance to explain the action mechanism, but that the oxide-reduction balance may also help explain the toxicity or effectiveness of these drugs. Being molecules able to oxidize other molecules is similar to yin-yang; a dualism that describes contrary forces, as oxidation may produce dysfunction and affect the conditions needed for viral infection, replication and propagation of the virus, but also contribute to increasing oxidative stress.

Our objectives were to describe the viral shedding and the viral load in LRT and to determine their association with mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a binational study merging prospectively collected data from two COVID-19 reference centers in France and Switzerland. First, we described the viral shedding duration (i.e., time to negativity) in LRT samples. Second, we analyzed viral load in LRT samples. Third, we assessed the association between viral presence in LRT and mortality using mixed-effect logistic models for clustered data adjusting for the time between symptoms' onset and date of sampling. RESULTS: From March to May 2020, 267 LRT samples were performed in 90 patients from both centers. The median time to negativity was 29 (IQR 23; 34) days. Prolonged viral shedding was not associated with age, gender, cardiac comorbidities, diabetes, immunosuppression, corticosteroids use, or antiviral therapy. The LRT viral load tended to be higher in non-survivors. This difference was statistically significant after adjusting for the time interval between onset of symptoms and date of sampling (OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.13-12.64, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The viral shedding in LRT lasted almost 30 days in median in critically ill patients, and the viral load in the LRT was associated with the 6-week mortality.","Buetti, Niccolò; Wicky, Paul-Henri; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Ruckly, Stéphane; Mazzuchelli, Timothy; Loiodice, Ambre; Trimboli, Pierpaolo; Forni Ogna, Valentina; de Montmollin, Etienne; Bernasconi, Enos; Visseaux, Benoit; Timsit, Jean-François",Crit Care,618,24

The practice of endocrinology is suited to provide virtual care to patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. In this survey, we aimed to gauge the adoption of telehealth practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among endocrinologists in the United States (U.S.). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey-based study. Members of the Facebook group ""Endocrinologists"" were invited to participate in the survey. Characteristics of respondents and their rates of adoption of telehealth were described and analyzed for statistically significant associations using the Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 181 physicians responded to the survey. The majority of respondents were females (75%), younger than or equal to 40 years of age (51%), employed (72%) either by a private group/hospital or by an academic setting, worked in an urban area (88.4%), and were adult endocrinologists (93%). With the COVID-19 outbreak, more than two-fifths (44.2%) of participants switched to completely virtual visits, and an additional 44.2% switched to a majority of virtual visits, with some in-person visits in the outpatient setting. Additionally, there was a significantly higher adoption rate of telehealth among endocrinologists younger than or equal to 40 years of age (P = .02) and among those who practiced in northeastern, midwestern, and the western geographic regions of the U.S. (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The majority of the responding endocrinologists from the U.S. appeared to have swiftly adapted by using telehealth within a few weeks of COVID-19 being declared a national emergency.

In the present study, volume and shape of the basal ganglia was examined in people with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder relative to healthy controls and hypothesized that unique neuroanatomical differences would be observed in each patient group. Magnetic resonance 1.5T images were obtained from schizophrenia (n = 47), schizoaffective disorder (n = 15), and from healthy control (n = 42) participants, matched for age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, and race. The caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus were characterized using high-dimensional brain mapping procedures (Csernansky et al., 2004b). Results revealed significant shape deformations between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder that also differed from control subjects. Relative to schizophrenia, schizoaffective subjects showed exaggerated inward deformations indicative of localized volume loss in subregions of the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus (all p < 0.001). These shape features correlated with mental flexibility and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (all p < 0.05), but not schizoaffective disorder. To the extent that differences in important basal ganglia substructures reflect biological heterogeneity among these two psychotic illnesses, this data could prove useful in improving diagnostic precision, as well as informing the affective component of mental illness.","Cobia, Derin; Rich, Chaz; Smith, Matthew J; Mamah, Daniel; Csernansky, John G; Wang, Lei",Psychiatry Res Neuroimaging,618,5

METHODS: Using a large multi-center electronic health record network, we conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with SARDs diagnosed with COVID-19 (identified by diagnostic code or positive molecular test) versus non-SARD comparators with COVID-19, matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (primary model) and comorbidities and health care utilization (extended model). Thirty-day outcomes were assessed, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (ARF), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. RESULTS: We initially identified 2,379 SARD patients with COVID-19 (mean age 58 years, 79% female) and 142,750 comparators (mean age 47 years, 54% female). In the primary matched model (2,379 SARD patients and 2,379 matched non-SARD comparators with COVID-19), SARD patients had significantly higher risks of hospitalization (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.26), ICU admission (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), ARF (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.07), and VTE (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.45) versus comparators but did not have significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation or death. In the extended model, all risks were largely attenuated except risk of VTE (RR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: SARD patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, ARF, and VTE versus matched comparators. These risks may be largely mediated by comorbidities, except for risk of VTE.","D039,; Silva, Kristin M; Jorge, April; Cohen, Andrew; McCormick, Natalie; Zhang, Yuqing; Wallace, Zachary S; Choi, Hyon K",Arthritis Rheumatol,618,33

The highly flexible S-protein, with its mobile domains, presents a moving target to the immune system. Here, to better understand S-protein mobility, we implemented a structure-based vector analysis of available ß-CoV S-protein structures. Despite an overall similarity in domain organization, we found that S-proteins from different ß-CoVs display distinct configurations. Based on this analysis, we developed two soluble ectodomain constructs for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, in which the highly immunogenic and mobile receptor binding domain (RBD) is either locked in the all-RBDs 'down' position or adopts 'up' state conformations more readily than the wild-type S-protein. These results demonstrate that the conformation of the S-protein can be controlled via rational design and can provide a framework for the development of engineered CoV S-proteins for vaccine applications.","Henderson, Rory; Edwards, Robert J; Mansouri, Katayoun; Janowska, Katarzyna; Stalls, Victoria; Gobeil, Sophie M C; Kopp, Megan; Li, Dapeng; Parks, Rob; Hsu, Allen L; Borgnia, Mario J; Haynes, Barton F; Acharya, Priyamvada",Nat Struct Mol Biol,618,24

This global pandemic becomes a lethal outbreak since there is no vaccine to treat or prevent transmission of the virus. Rapid Test is selected as an essential method to detect Covid-19 in Indonesia because the price is fairly cheap compared to the SWAB test. The increase in Covid-19 patients tends to lead to limited capacity for the Covid-19 test available at the hospital so that the latest technology to detect and overcome this pandemic issue is needed. Thus, the present research aims to examine the total of 100 X-Ray chest images of the Covid-19 patients and 100 X-ray normal chest images. The application of Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) methods are implemented to analyze the dataset with two scenarios in obtaining the detection results. The results of this research reveal that the application of CLAHE is likely to affect Covid-19 detection accuracy using CNN.

METHODS: Using real-time insights from two Cancer Council NSW services-131120 Information and Support Line and Online Community (CCOC) forums-we assessed service demand trends, distress levels (using the distress thermometer), and content from 131120 calls and online posts between 01 December 2019 and 31 May 2020. Emergent themes were identified through an inductive conventional content analysis with 131120 call notes, followed by a deductive directed content analysis on CCOC posts. RESULTS: In total, 688 COVID-19-related 131120 calls (n = 496) and online posts (n = 192) were analysed. Service demand peaked in March 2020 and self-reported distress peaked in May 2020 at an average of 8/10 [Mean = 7.5; SD = 0.9]. Five themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: psychological distress and fear of virus susceptibility, practical issues, cancer service disruptions, information needs, and carer Issues. CONCLUSIONS: The psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on people affected by cancer are multifaceted and likely to have long-lasting consequences. Our findings drove the development of six recommendations across three domains of support, information, and access. Cancer patients, survivors, and carers already face stressful challenges dealing with a cancer diagnosis or survivorship. The added complexity of restrictions and uncertainty associated with the pandemic may compound this. It is important that healthcare providers are equipped to provide patient-centred care during and after this crisis.

This study was hence aimed to explore whether the Google search volume may have been useful to predict the trajectory of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We accessed Google Trends for collecting data on weekly Google searches for the keywords ""tosse"" (i.e., cough), ""febbre"" (i.e., fever) and ""dispnea"" (dyspnea) in Italy, between February and May 2020. The number of new weekly cases of COVID-19 in Italy was also obtained from the website of the National Institute of Health. RESULTS: The peaks of Google searches for the three terms predicted by 3 weeks that of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases. The peaks of weekly Google searches for ""febbre"" (fever), ""tosse""( cough) and ""dispnea"" (dyspnea) were 1.7-, 2.2- and 7.7-fold higher compared to the week before the diagnosis of the first national case. No significant correlation was found between the number of newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and Google search volumes of ""tosse"" (cough) and ""febbre"" (fever), whilst ""dyspnea"" (dyspnea) was significantly correlated (r= 0.50; p=0.034). The correlation between newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases and ""tosse"" (cough; r=0.65; p=0.008) or ""febbre"" (fever; 0.69; p=0.004) become statistically significant with a 3-week delay.

In silico simulations using Rosetta and molecular dynamics followed by biochemical and cellular experiments consistently demonstrate that individual filaments assemble bidirectionally. By contrast, the recognition between AIM2 and ASC requires at least one to be oligomeric and occurs in a head-to-tail manner. Using in silico mutagenesis as a guide, we also identify specific axial and lateral interfaces that dictate the recognition and distinction between AIM2 and ASC filaments.

Whether ambient air pollutants increase the risk of common acute respiratory infections among adults is uncertain, yet this may help understand whether pollutants influence spread of pandemic respiratory infections like COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between ambient air pollutant exposures and respiratory infections in adults. METHODS: During five study examinations over 12 years, 6536 participants in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) reported upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, pneumonia or febrile illness in the preceding 2 weeks. Using a validated spatiotemporal model, we estimated residential concentrations of ambient PM2.5, NOx and NO2 for the 2-6 weeks (short-term) and year (long-term) prior to each examination. RESULTS: In this population aged 44-84 years at baseline, 10%-32% of participants reported a recent respiratory infection, depending on month of examination and study region. PM2.5, NOx and NO2 concentrations over the prior 2-6 weeks were associated with increased reporting of recent respiratory infection, with risk ratios (95% CIs) of 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09), 1.15 (1.10 to 1.20) and 1.21 (1.10 to 1.33), respectively, per increase from 25th to 75th percentile in residential pollutant concentration. CONCLUSION: Higher short-term exposure to PM2.5 and traffic-related pollutants are associated with increased risk of symptomatic acute respiratory infections among adults. These findings may provide an insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19.","Kirwa, Kipruto; Eckert, Carly M; Vedal, Sverre; Hajat, Anjum; Kaufman, Joel D",,618,24

After the patient smoked a cigarette, the scotoma scintillans ceased. However, he then developed a headache, general fatigue, and shoulder and elbow pain. He therefore called an ambulance. Based on the rules of the medical cooperative system for decompression sickness in Izu Peninsula, the fire department called a physician-staffed helicopter. After a physician checked the patient, his complaints remained aside from a low-grade fever. A portable ultrasound revealed bubbles in his inferior vena cava. Because of the risk of his being infected with COVID-19, he was transported to our hospital not by air evacuation but via ground ambulance staff while receiving a drip infusion of fluid and oxygen. After arriving at the hospital, his symptoms had almost subsided. Whole-body computed tomography revealed gas around the bladder, left hip, right knee, bilateral shoulder, joints, and right intramedullary humerus. The patient received high-concentration oxygen, infusion therapy, and observational admission. On the second day of admission, his symptoms had completely disappeared, and he was discharged. To our knowledge, this is the first report that computed tomography might be useful for detecting gas in multiple joints, suggesting the onset of decompression sickness after diving. This might be the first report of gas in an intramedullary space after diving as a potential cause of dysbaric osteonecrosis.","Jitsuiki, Kei; Kushida, Yoshihiro; Nishio, Ryota; Yanagawa, Youichi",Wilderness environ. med,618,1

Emergency department (ED) evaluation of symptomatic patients with normal vital signs is frequently limited to chest auscultation and oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We tested the null hypothesis that patients being screened for COVID-19 in the ED with normal vital signs and without hypoxia would have a point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) consistent with COVID-19 less than 2% of the time. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, structured, blinded ultrasound review and chart review in patients 14 years or older with symptoms prompting ED evaluation for COVID-19. We excluded those with known congestive heart failure or other chronic lung conditions likely to cause excessive B-lines on LUS. We used a two-sided exact hypothesis test for binomial random variables. We measured LUS diagnostic performance using computed tomography as the gold standard. RESULTS: We reviewed 77 charts; 49 met inclusion criteria. Vital signs were normal in 30/49 patients; 10 (33%) of these patients had LUS consistent with viral pneumonitis. We rejected the null hypothesis (p-value <0.001). The treating physicians' interpretations of their own point-of-care LUS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI), 74%, 100%), specificity 88% (95% CI, 47%, 100%), likelihood ratio (LR) positive of 5.8 (95% CI, 1.3, 25), and LR negative of 0.05 (95% CI, 0.03, 0.71) when compared to CT findings. CONCLUSION: LUS had a meaningful detection rate for pneumonitis in symptomatic ED patients with normal vital signs who were being evaluated for COVID-19. We recommend at least LUS be used in addition to polymerase chain reaction testing when evaluating symptomatic ED patients for COVID-19.","Walsh, Paul; Hankins, Andrea; Bang, Heejung",West J Emerg Med,618,20

Design and method: This is a retrospective observational study comparing the association by gender of hypertensive status and with mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19.All patients admitted to our Hospitals, from 12 March to 12 April 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Patients with COVID-19 included in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance. Patients' demographic characteristics and clinical data (symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory findings, and outcomes) during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality by gender during hospitalization. Other endpoints included the time elapsed between onset of symptoms and discharge, the rates of use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the differences by gender in the treatment. The diagnosis of hypertension was given by the patient's physician prior to the infection with SARS-CoV-2. Results: In total, 877 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. The median time from symptom onset to hospitalization was 4.6 for men and 2.6 days for women (p&lt;0.05). Among these patients, 58% had a medical history of hypertension (57% men and 46% for women), p &lt;0.05. The spectrum of symptoms of COVID-19 at admission between the two cohorts did not differ significantly. A total of (15.0%) patients died in the hypertension cohort (14% for men and 16% for women;p ns) In particular, patients with hypertension had the propensity to develop more severe/ critical COVID-19 disease (P for trend &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to receive invasive mechanical ventilation (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 and hypertension have been reported to have an increased risk of adverse outcomes. In particular female patients with hypertension require intensive care (16% vs 11% for men, p &lt;0.05) but no differences by gender for mortality rate we report. As described above, these data showed that hypertensive patients are at the highest risk for outcomes adverse. To further verify our results, as well as this hypothesis, we have also designed a randomized controlled trial.","Ciarambino, T.; Ciaburri, F.; Delli Paoli, V.; D039,; Avino, M.; Campania, D.

Simultaneously, the SARS-COV-2 virus has a rapid mutation phenomenon, and somegene coding regions by mutation and recombination may be related to the drug resistance of the virus. Therefore, studying the relationship between the co-infection of bacteria and fungi and the evolution of SARS-COV-2 has important guiding significance for preventing a pandemic. We found that the SARS-COV-2 virus's nsp3 protein had a CRISPR/Cas 9 (II-B)-like function by searching for conserved domains. The system could target and edit the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2. We speculated that the crRNA (CRISPR RNA) produced by the CRISPR/Cas system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa carried the genetic information of the conserved domains of bacteriophages and Pseudomonas, including drug resistance. After the phage lysed the Pseudomonas, the crRNA was released and attached to the fungal spores, and then invaded the patient's cells along with the spores or hyphae. nsp3 synthesized and assembled 4Fe-4S, iron-containing molecules bound to the cas4 domain, in the mitochondria of phagocytes. The iron came from hemoglobin attacked by the SARS-COV-2 virus protein. The nsp3 protein bound the crRNA in the phagocytic cytoplasm. It targeted the negative-strand RNA of SARS-COV-2, inserting conserved domain gene fragments into the negative-strand RNA through editing and splicing. Since the Cas protein had no codon checking function, the cutting and splicing would destroy the protein-coding information in the original RNA coding region, causing mutation and recombination of the SARS-COV-2 virus genome. If crRNA carried the drug resistance gene fragments of bacteria or phage, SARS-COV-2 would have similar drug resistance. Because of the growing problem of drug resistance in COVID-19 patients, we should pay attention to preventing fungi and bacteria co-infection. Avoid the CRISPR/Cas-like system of the novel coronavirus to cause rapid mutation and recombination and increased the drug resistance problem of SARS-COV-2.","liu, wenzhong Li hualan",,618,29

Food insecurity has in fact soared all over the UK, with many people forced to rely on food support providers to not go hungry. This paper uses a unique dataset on 55 food support organizations active in Greater Manchester during the first COVID-19 wave, and 41 semi-structured interviews with food aid spokespersons and stakeholders, to shed light on what they overcame, the complications and drawbacks of the food emergency response plan put in place. The results indicate that food aid organizations that remained open were surprisingly effective despite the growth in user demand and the decrease in volunteers. However, the necessity to maintain a timely supply food at all costs came with important drawbacks. The lockdown measures that followed COVID-19 not only affected the financial stability and management of the organizations, and the availability of food, but undermined the ways in which food support providers used to operate. Owing to physical distancing measures and to the increasing numbers of users, more or less intangible forms of support such as financial advice, empathic listening and human warmth were partially lost, probably when they were needed more than ever.

This can easily lead to deviations in efficiency estimates. In order to solve this problem, a three-stage DEA model was used to better reflect the carbon emission efficiency of Chinese construction industry (CEECI) (2006-2017) from the perspective of non-management factors. The internal influencing factors of CEECI are analyzed by the Tobit model, which provides a more accurate basis for formulating policies. It is found that the CEECI is significantly affected by the GDP, the level of industrialization, the degree of opening-up, technological innovation, and energy structure. After excluding environmental factors and random interference, the average CEECI increased by 16%. The resulting calculations are noteworthy in three aspects. First, there are significant regional differences in the CEECI. Both the multi-polarization phenomenon of CEECI and regional differences also reduced gradually over time. Second, the CEECI can be decomposed into pure carbon emission efficiency (PCEE) and scale efficiency (SE), which is mainly caused by SE. Excluding external environmental factors and random interference will have a specific impact on the CEECI. All the 30 provinces are divided into four categories to analyze the reasons and solutions of the differences in the CEECI in provinces. Third, many factors had inhibitory effects on the CEECI, PCEE, and SE; these included energy structure optimization, labor force number, total power of construct ion equipment, and construction intensity in the construction industry. Nevertheless, the development level of the construction industry did have a significant positive effect.","Zhang, Mengna; Li, Lianshui; Cheng, Zhonghua",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated challenges in accessing obstetrical ultrasound for patients in underserved rural and remote communities where this service is not available. This prospective descriptive study describes our experience of providing obstetrical ultrasound services remotely using a telerobotic ultrasound system in a northern Canadian community isolated due to a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A telerobotic ultrasound system was used to perform obstetrical ultrasound exams remotely in La Loche, Canada, a remote community without regular access to obstetrical ultrasound. Using a telerobotic ultrasound system, a sonographer 605 km away remotely controlled an ultrasound probe and ultrasound settings. Twenty-one exams were performed in a five-week period during a COVID-19 outbreak in the community, including limited first-, second- and third-trimester exams (n = 11) and complete second-trimester exams (n = 10). Participants were invited to complete a survey at the end of the telerobotic ultrasound exam describing their experiences with telerobotic ultrasound. Radiologists subsequently interpreted all exams and determined the adequacy of the images for diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 11 limited obstetrical exams, radiologists indicated images were adequate in nine (81%) cases, adequate with some reservations in one (9%) case and inadequate in one (9%) case. Of 10 second-trimester complete obstetrical exams, radiologists indicated images were adequate in two (20%) cases, adequate with some reservations in three (30%) cases and inadequate in five (50%) cases. Second-trimester complete obstetrical exams were limited due to a combination of body habitus, foetal lie and telerobotic technology. DISCUSSION: A telerobotic ultrasound system may be used to answer focused clinical questions such as foetal viability, dating and foetal presentation in a timely manner while minimising patient travel to larger centres and potential exposure to severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus 2 during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adams, Scott J; Burbridge, Brent; Chatterson, Leslie; McKinney, Veronica; Babyn, Paul; Mendez, Ivar",J Telemed Telecare,618,10

In our study, we evaluated a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster model. Hamsters were vaccinated with a DNA-plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full length spike open reading frame (ORF) to induce host cells to produce spike protein and protective immune responses before exposure to infectious virus. We tested this vaccine candidate by both intranasal (IN) and intramuscular (IM) routes of administration and complexing with and without an in vivo delivery reagent. Hamsters receiving prime-boost-boost IM-only vaccinations recovered body weight quicker, had decreased lung viral loads, and increased SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody titers compared to control vaccinated animals but, surprisingly, lung pathology was as severe as sham vaccinated controls. The IM/IN combination group showed no efficacy in reducing lung virus titers or pathology. With increasing public health need for rapid and effective interventions, our data demonstrate that in some vaccine contexts, significant antibody responses and decreased viral loads may not be sufficient to prevent lung pathology.","Leventhal, Shanna S.; Clancy, Chad Erasmus Jesse Feldmann Heinz Hawman David W.",Microorganisms,618,16

In Canada, following provincial legislation the Workers' Compensation Board of Alberta (WCB-Alberta) stopped in-person rehabilitation services on March 23, 2020. On April 1, training began on remote service delivery using videoconferencing or telerehabilitation, which started April 3. We studied WCB-Alberta's transition to remote rehabilitation service delivery. Methods A population-based descriptive study was conducted, with data extracted from the WCB-Alberta database. This included clinical data from rehabilitation providers. We included workers completing services between January 1 and May 31, 2020. We statistically examined differences before and after the transition to remote services. Results The dataset included 4,516 individuals with work-related injuries. The mean number of work assessments per week pre-COVID was 244.6 (SD 83.5), which reduced to 135.9 (SD 74.5). Workers undergoing remote assessments were significantly more likely to work in health care or trades, did not require an interpreter, and were less likely to be working or judged as ready to return to work. Number of completed rehabilitation programs also reduced from 125.6 to 40.8 per week, with most (67.1%) remote programs being functional restoration. Few adverse effects were observed. Conclusions We describe the transition to completely remote delivery of occupational rehabilitation due to COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions in one Canadian compensation jurisdiction. It appears the use of remote services was successful but proceeded cautiously, with fewer complex cases being referred for assessment or rehabilitation. Further research examining longer-term work outcomes and stakeholder perceptions is needed.","Gross, Douglas P; Asante, Alexander; Pawluk, Joanne; Niemeläinen, Riikka",J. occup. rehabil,618,16

(COVID-19 special issue.),17.107939,4.7705917,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Traditionally, shift work for radiographers at our institution comprised of three shift patterns - morning (8am-2pm), afternoon (2pm-9pm) and night (9pm-8am). However, when COVID-19 was first detected in Singapore in January 2020, the 12-h shift was introduced for better team segregation and deployment to meet the service needs of the Emergency Department. The 12-h shift consisted of the day (9am-9pm) and night (9pm-9am) shifts. While the 12-h shift is common to nursing practices, it is new to the radiography profession within the study centre. This study explores the radiographers' perspectives of the new shift and the impact of shift patterns on radiographers' wellness and work performance compared to the original three shift patterns. METHODS: A mixed-methods design study was adopted for this single-centre evaluation. An anonymous online questionnaire was administered to radiographers who had experienced both shift types. Additionally, the number of radiographers who had taken sick leave, and images rejected and accepted from the X-ray consoles were retrospectively collected to measure the impact of the new shift. RESULTS: Radiographers experienced fatigue and appreciated the longer rest days associated with the 12-h shift. Additionally, the sick leave rates and image reject counts were more favourable with the 12-h shift pattern. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that the extended shift hours are effective during a pandemic but may result in radiographer burnout during a prolonged outbreak. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Studying these variables will provide an effective starting point in understanding the efficacy and applicability of a 12-h shift system during pandemic periods.","Ooi, J W L; Er, A T W; Lee, W C; Chee, H C",,618,17

We aimed to measure air and surface environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus when CPAP and HFNO were used, compared with supplemental oxygen, to investigate the potential risks of viral transmission to healthcare workers and patients. Methods30 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, with a fraction of inspired oxygen [≥]0.4 to maintain oxygen saturations [≥]94%, were prospectively enrolled into an observational environmental sampling study. Participants received either supplemental oxygen, CPAP or HFNO (n=10 in each group). A nasopharyngeal swab, three air and three surface samples were collected from each participant and the clinical environment. RT qPCR analyses were performed for viral and human RNA, and positive/suspected-positive samples were cultured for the presence of biologically viable virus. ResultsOverall 21/30 (70%) of participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the nasopharynx. In contrast, only 4/90 (4%) and 6/90 (7%) of all air and surface samples tested positive (positive for E and ORF1a) for viral RNA respectively, although there were an additional 10 suspected-positive samples in both air and surfaces samples (positive for E or ORF1a). CPAP/HFNO use or coughing was not associated with significantly more environmental contamination. Only one nasopharyngeal sample was culture positive. ConclusionsThe use of CPAP and HFNO to treat moderate/severe COVID-19 was not associated with significantly higher levels of air or surface viral contamination in the immediate care environment.","Winslow, Rebecca; Zhou, Jie; Windle, E F; Nur, I X; Lall, Ranjit; Ji, Chen; Millar, Jonathan E; Dark, Paul M; Naisbitt, Jay; Simonds, Anita; Dunning, Jake; Barclay, Wendy; Baillie, J Kenneth; Perkins, Gavin D; Semple, Malcolm Gracie; McAuley, Danny F; Green, C A",,618,24

A multi-country survey was conducted in 16 countries involving 825 food companies. Based on the results of the survey, it is obvious that the level of maturity of a food safety system in place is the main trigger in classifying companies and their responses to the pandemic challenge. Staff awareness and hygiene are the two most important attributes in combating Covid-19, opposed to temperature checking of workers in food establishment and health protocols from the World Health Organization, recognized as attributes with limited salience and importance. Companies confirmed implementation of more restrictive hygiene procedures during the pandemic and the need for purchasing more additional personal protective equipment. Retailers were identified as the food supply chain link mostly affected by the pandemic opposed to food storage facilities ranked as least affected. During this challenging period, all companies declared that food safety has not been compromised at any moment.

Moreover, we introduce two types of home quarantine, namely gradual and abrupt one. We compute the equilibria of the new model and derive its reproduction number. Using numerical simulations we analyze the effect of quarantine and testing on the epidemic dynamic. Given a constraint that limits the maximal number of simultaneous active cases, we demonstrate that the isolation rate, which enforces this constraint, decreases with the increasing testing rate. Our simulations show that massive testing allows to control the infection spread using a much lower isolation rate than in the case of indiscriminate quarantining. Finally, based on the effective reproduction number we suggest a strategy to manage the epidemic. It consists in introducing abrupt quarantine as well as relaxing the quarantine in such a way that the epidemic remains under control and further waves do not occur. We analyze the sensitivity of the model dynamic to the quarantine size, timing and strength of the restrictions.","Chladná, Zuzana; Kopfová, Jana; Rachinskii, Dmitry; Štepánek, Pavel",J Dyn Differ Equ,618,16

This single-site survey aimed at assessing perceived stress and risk to develop burnout syndrome among physicians operating in COVID wards. METHODS This longitudinal survey evaluated stress and burnout in 51 physicians operating in the COVID team of Gemelli Hospital, Italy. Participants were asked to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire on short run (PSQs) (referring to the past 7 days) at baseline (T0) and then for four weeks (T1-T4). Perceived Stress Questionnaire on long run (PSQl) (referring to the past 2 years) was completed only at T0. RESULTS Compared to physicians board certified in internal medicine, those board certified in other disciplines showed higher scores for the Emotional Exhaustion (EE) score of the MBI scale (p<.001). Depersonalization (DP) score showed a reduction over time (p=.002). Attending physicians scored lower than resident physicians on the DP scale (p=.048), and higher than resident physicians on the Personal Accomplishment (PA) scale (p=.04). PSQl predicted higher scores on the EE scale (p=.003), DP scale (p=.003) and lower scores on the PA scale (p<.001). PSQs showed a reduction over time (p=.03). Attending physicians had a lower PSQs score compared to the resident physicians (p=.04). CONCLUSIONS Medical specialty and clinical position could represent risk factors for the development of burnout in a COVID team. In these preliminary results, physicians board certified in internal medicine showed lower risk of developing EE during the entire course of the study.","Dionisi, Tommaso; Sestito, Luisa; Tarli, Claudia; Antonelli, Mariangela; Tosoni, Alberto; D'Addio, Stefano; Mirijello, Antonio; Vassallo, Gabriele Angelo; Leggio, Lorenzo; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Addolorato, Giovanni",International journal of clinical practice,618,25

The acute episode is characterized by deterioration in consciousness, often with focal neurologic deficits and seizures. Additionally, symmetric multifocal brain lesions are seen in the bilateral thalami as well as other characteristic regions, involving both gray and white matter. Prognosis is variable, with a high mortality rate and most surviving patients having persistent neurologic deficits. Early treatment with high dose steroids is associated with a more favorable outcome, however the diagnosis is often overlooked resulting in delayed treatment. The RANBP2 mutation associated with ANE1 causes an incompletely penetrant predisposition to encephalopathy in the setting of febrile illness through a mechanism that remains elusive. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses suggesting possible etiologies for this phenotype based on the many functions of RANBP2 within the cell. These include dysfunctions in nucleocytoplasmic trafficking and intracellular metabolic regulation, as well as cytokine storm, and abnormal distribution of mitochondria. This narrative review explores these key concepts of the RANBP2 mutation and its clinical and therapeutic implications in pediatric populations.","Levine, Jesse M.; Ahsan, Nusrat; Ho, Eugenia; Santoro, Jonathan D.",Mult Scler Relat Disord,618,28

Similar to most medical imaging modalities, they are profoundly multi-modal and are capable of visualising a variety of combinations of conditions. There is an ever pressing need for greater quantities of labelled images to drive forward the development of diagnostic tools; however, this is in direct opposition to concerns regarding patient confidentiality which constrains access through permission requests and ethics approvals. Previous work has sought to address these concerns by creating class-specific generative adversarial networks (GANs) that synthesise images to augment training data. These approaches cannot be scaled as they introduce computational trade offs between model size and class number which places fixed limits on the quality that such generates can achieve. We address this concern by introducing latent class optimisation which enables efficient, multi-modal sampling from a GAN and with which we synthesise a large archive of labelled generates. We apply a Progressive Growing GAN (PGGAN) to the task of unsupervised X-ray synthesis and have radiologists evaluate the clinical realism of the resultant samples. We provide an in depth review of the properties of varying pathologies seen on generates as well as an overview of the extent of disease diversity captured by the model. We validate the application of the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) to measure the quality of X-ray generates and find that they are similar to other high-resolution tasks. We quantify X-ray clinical realism by asking radiologists to distinguish between real and fake scans and find that generates are more likely to be classed as real than by chance, but there is still progress required to achieve true realism. We confirm these findings by evaluating synthetic classification model performance on real scans. We conclude by discussing the limitations of PGGAN generates and how to achieve controllable, realistic generates going forward. We release our source code, model weights, and an archive of labelled generates.","Segal, Bradley; Rubin, David M.; Rubin, Grace; Pantanowitz, Adam",SN Comput Sci,618,1

We assessed whether adding azithromycin to standard of care, which included hydroxychloroquine, would improve clinical outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital with severe COVID-19. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised clinical trial at 57 centres in Brazil. We enrolled patients admitted to hospital with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and at least one additional severity criteria as follows: use of oxygen supplementation of more than 4 L/min flow; use of high-flow nasal cannula; use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation; or use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg via oral, nasogastric, or intravenous administration once daily for 10 days) plus standard of care or to standard of care without macrolides. All patients received hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily for 10 days) because that was part of standard of care treatment in Brazil for patients with severe COVID-19. The primary outcome, assessed by an independent adjudication committee masked to treatment allocation, was clinical status at day 15 after randomisation, assessed by a six-point ordinal scale, with levels ranging from 1 to 6 and higher scores indicating a worse condition (with odds ratio [OR] greater than 1·00 favouring the control group). The primary outcome was assessed in all patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population who had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by molecular or serological testing before randomisation (ie, modified ITT [mITT] population). Safety was assessed in all patients according to which treatment they received, regardless of original group assignment. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321278. FINDINGS: 447 patients were enrolled from March 28 to May 19, 2020. COVID-19 was confirmed in 397 patients who constituted the mITT population, of whom 214 were assigned to the azithromycin group and 183 to the control group. In the mITT population, the primary endpoint was not significantly different between the azithromycin and control groups (OR 1·36 [95% CI 0·94–1·97], p=0·11). Rates of adverse events, including clinically relevant ventricular arrhythmias, resuscitated cardiac arrest, acute kidney failure, and corrected QT interval prolongation, were not significantly different between groups. INTERPRETATION: In patients with severe COVID-19, adding azithromycin to standard of care treatment (which included hydroxychloroquine) did not improve clinical outcomes.

The review is guided by the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework and discusses the role of the innovation, its recipients, context, and facilitation in influencing successful implementation of MH apps. The review highlights critical literature published between 2015 and 2020 with a focus on depression and anxiety apps. Sources were identified via PubMed, Google Scholar, and Twitter using a range of keywords pertaining to MH apps. Findings suggest that for apps to be successful, they must be advantageous over alternative tools, relatively easy to navigate, and aligned with users’ needs, skills, and resources. Significantly more attention must be paid to the complex contexts in which MH app implementation is occurring in order to refine facilitation strategies. The evidence base is still uncertain regarding the effectiveness and usability of MH apps, and much can be learned from the apps we use daily; namely, simpler is better and plans to integrate full behavioral treatments into smartphone form may be misguided. Non-traditional funding mechanisms that are nimble, responsive, and encouraging of industry partnerships will be necessary to move the course of MH app development in the right direction.","Connolly, Samantha L.; Hogan, Timothy P.; Shimada, Stephanie L.; Miller, Christopher J.",J Technol Behav Sci,618,16

METHODS: Forty hospitalized patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction test were evaluated. They were randomly divided into an experimental group (n= 20; gargling with 1.0% H(2)O(2) and nasal wash with 0.5% H(2)O(2)) or a control group (n= 20). The solutions were used for 7 days and the patients were monitored every 2 days, for a total of 8 days. At check-ups, patients were asked about their symptoms and possible adverse effects of the solutions. The presence and severity (mild, moderate, or severe) of symptoms were recorded. Data were compared using the Student test and the Fisher exact test (α= 0.05). RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the length of hospital stay (p= 0.65). The most frequent symptom on day 0 was coughing (72.0% in the experimental group and 76.5% in the control group), which abated over time.

The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.","Kot, A.

In the field of AI, medical disease detection is an instantly growing domain of research. In the past years, numerous endeavours have been made for the improvements of medical disease detection, because the errors and problems in medical disease detection cause serious wrong medical treatment. Meta-heuristic techniques have been frequently utilized for the detection of medical diseases and promise better accuracy of perception and prediction of diseases in the domain of biomedical. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm-based intelligent stochastic search technique encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm during the searching of their food source. Consequently, for the versatility of numerical experimentation, PSO has been mostly applied to address the diverse kinds of optimization problems. However, the PSO techniques are frequently adopted for the detection of diseases but there is still a gap in the comparative survey. This paper presents an insight into the diagnosis of medical diseases in health care using various PSO approaches. This study presents to deliver a systematic literature review of current PSO approaches for knowledge discovery in the field of disease detection. The systematic analysis discloses the potential research areas of PSO strategies as well as the research gaps, although, the main goal is to provide the directions for future enhancement and development in this area. This paper gives a systematic survey of this conceptual model for the advanced research, which has been explored in the specified literature to date.

It is a demyelinating disease affecting mainly the white matter of the cerebellum and areas adjacent to the fourth ventricle; the enzymes of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) group, especially MMP-2 and MMP-9 have a key role in the myelin basic protein fragmentation and in demyelination, as well as in leukocyte traffic into the nervous milieu. To evaluate the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis, we measured the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by zymography in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the cerebellum of 14 dogs naturally infected with CDV and 10 uninfected dogs. The infected dogs presented high levels of pro-MMP-2 in the CSF and elevated levels of pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 in the cerebellar tissue. Active MMP-2 was detected in the CSF of some infected dogs. As active MMP-2 and MMP-9 are required for cellular migration across the blood–brain barrier and any interference between MMPs and their inhibitors may result in an amplification of demyelination, this study gives additional support to the involvement of MMPs during subacute distemper leukoencephalitis and suggests that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may take part in the brain inflammatory changes of this disease.","Machado, Gisele F.; Melo, Guilherme D.; Souza, Milena S.; Machado, Andressa A.; Migliolo, Daniela S.; Moraes, Olívia C.; Nunes, Cáris M.; Ribeiro, Érica S.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,618,24

This has dramatically altered people’s daily activities, especially among families with young children, those living with disabilities such as spinal cord injury (SCI), those who have experienced a stroke, and older adults. OBJECTIVE: We aim to (1) investigate how COVID-19 restrictions influence daily activities, (2) track the psychosocial effects of these restrictions over time, and (3) identify strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of these restrictions. METHODS: This is a longitudinal, concurrent, mixed methods study being conducted in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Data collection occurred at four time points, between April 2020 and February 2021. The first three data collection time points occurred within phases 1 to 3 of the Province of BC’s Restart Plan. The final data collection coincided with the initial distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines. At each time point, data regarding participants’ sociodemographics, depressive and anxiety symptoms, resilience, boredom, social support, instrumental activities of daily living, and social media and technology use were collected in an online survey. These data supplemented qualitative videoconference interviews exploring participants’ COVID-19–related experiences. Participants were also asked to upload photos representing their experience during the restriction period, which facilitated discussion during the final interview. Five groups of participants were recruited: (1) families with children under the age of 18 years, (2) adults with an SCI, (3) adults who experienced a stroke, (4) adults with other types of disabilities, and (5) older adults (>64 years of age) with no self-reported disability. The number of participants we could recruit from each group was limited, which may impact the validity of some subgroup analyses. RESULTS: This study was approved by the University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board (Approval No. H20-01109) on April 17, 2020. A total of 81 participants were enrolled in this study and data are being analyzed. Data analyses are expected to be completed in fall 2021; submission of multiple papers for publication is expected by winter 2021. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from our study will inform the development and recommendations of a new resource guide for the post–COVID-19 period and for future public health emergencies.

METHODS: All data were generated as part of routine work at Marseille university hospitals. Biological diagnoses were made by RT-PCR testing. A telephone survey of families in which a laboratory confirmed case was diagnosed was conducted to determine possible exposure events. RESULTS: As of March 30, 2020, 63 patients were linked to 6 epidemic clusters. The 6 clusters were linked to religious and social activities: a ski trip, organized meals for the Purim Jewish celebration in community and family settings on March 10, a religious service and a charity gala. Notably, 40% of the patients were infected by index patients during the presymptomatic period, which was 2.5 days before symptom onset. When considering household members, all 12 patients who tested negative and who did not develop any relevant clinical symptoms compatible with COVID-19 were 1–16 years of age. The clinical attack rate (symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and biologically confirmed by PCR) in adults was 85% compared to 26% in children. CONCLUSIONS: Family and community gatherings for the Purim Jewish celebration probably accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in the Marseille Jewish community, leading to multiple epidemic clusters. This investigation of family clusters suggested that all close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were not infected were children.","Aherfi, Sarah; Gautret, Philippe; Chaudet, Hervé; Raoult, Didier; La Scola, Bernard",Int J Infect Dis,618,16

In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use to treat multiple cancers has increased in oncology, but equally has raised the question of whether ICI therapy and its side‐effects is harmful or beneficial during this pandemic. METHODS: A combination of published literature in PubMed between January 2010 and December 2020, recommended guidelines in non‐cancer patients, and clinical experience was utilized to outline recommendations on glucocorticoid timing and dosing regimens in ICI‐treated patients presenting with AI during this COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: The potential immune interaction between ICIs and COVID‐19 require major consideration because these agents act at the intersection between effective cancer immunotherapy and increasing patient susceptibility, severity and complications from the SARS‐CoV‐2 sepsis. Furthermore, ICI use can induce autoimmune adrenal insufficiency (AI) that further increases infection susceptibility. Thus, ICI‐treated cancer patients with AI may be at greater risk of COVID‐19 infection. Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone for replacement therapy, and for treatment and mitigation of adrenal crisis and relief of mass effects in ICI‐related hypophysitis. High‐dose glucocorticoids have also been used with cytotoxic chemotherapy as part of cancer treatment, and iatrogenic AI may arise after glucocorticoid discontinuation that increases the risk of adrenal crisis. Furthermore, in patients who develop the “long COVID‐19” syndrome, when to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy becomes crucial to avoid unnecessary prolongation of therapy and the development of iatrogenic hypercortisolemia. CONCLUSION: During the COVID‐19 pandemic, much of cancer care have been impacted and an important clinical question is how to optimally manage ICI‐related AI during these unprecedented times. Herein, we suggest practical recommendations on the timing and dosing regimens of glucocorticoids in different clinical scenarios of ICI‐treated cancer patients presenting with AI during this COVID‐19 pandemic.","Yuen, Kevin C.

The cellular effects of insulin occur through two main postreceptor pathways that are the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K) pathways. Obesity-related IR implicates the PI3-K pathway that confers the metabolic effects of insulin. Numerous and complex pathogenic pathways link obesity with the development of IR, including chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction (with the associated production of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress), gut microbiota dysbiosis and adipose extracellular matrix remodelling. IR itself plays a key role in the development of metabolic dysfunction, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and dysglycaemia. Furthermore, IR promotes weight gain related to secondary hyperinsulinaemia, with a resulting vicious cycle of worsening IR and its metabolic sequelae. Ultimately, IR underlies obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). IR also underlies many obesity-related malignancies, through the effects of compensatory hyperinsulinaemia on the relatively intact MAP-K insulin pathway, which controls cellular growth processes and mitoses. Furthermore, the emergent data over recent decades support an important role of obesity- and T2D-related central IR in the development of cognitive dysfunction, including effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Importantly, IR is largely reversible through the optimisation of lifestyle factors that include regular engagement in physical activity with the avoidance of sedentariness, improved diet including increased fibre intake and sleep sufficiency. IR lies at the key crossroad between obesity and both metabolic and cognitive dysfunction. Given the importance of IR in the pathogenesis of many 21st century chronic diseases and its eminent reversibility, it is important that we all embrace and facilitate optimised lifestyles to improve the future health and wellbeing of the populace.","Barber, Thomas M.; Kyrou, Ioannis; Randeva, Harpal S.; Weickert, Martin O.",Int J Mol Sci,618,20

With on-going climate change there is an increasing need to understand the effect changes in temperature may have on emerging infectious disease. We investigated whether species’ susceptibilities change with temperature and ask if susceptibility is greatest at different temperatures in different species. We infected 45 species of Drosophilidae with an RNA virus and measured how viral load changes with temperature. We found the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in viral load at each temperature, with strong phylogenetic correlations between viral loads across temperature. The variance in viral load increased with temperature, while the mean viral load did not. This suggests that as temperature increases the most susceptible species become more susceptible, and the least susceptible less so. We found no significant relationship between a species’ susceptibility across temperatures, and proxies for thermal optima (critical thermal maximum and minimum or basal metabolic rate). These results suggest that whilst the rank order of species susceptibilities may remain the same with changes in temperature, some species may become more susceptible to a novel pathogen, and others less so.","Roberts, Katherine E.; Hadfield, Jarrod D.; Sharma, Manmohan D.; Longdon, Ben",PLoS Pathog,618,20

This study aims to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and case-fatality rate of AKI in patients with documented COVID-19. Methods We reviewed the health medical records of 307 consecutive patients hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19 at the University Hospital of Modena, Italy. Results AKI was diagnosed in 69 out of 307 (22.4%) patients. The stages of AKI were stage 1 in 57.9%, stage 2 in 24.6% and stage 3 in 17.3%. Hemodialysis was performed in 7.2% of the subjects. AKI patients had a mean age of 74.7 {+/-} 9.9 years and higher serum levels of the main marker of inflammation and organ involvement (lung, liver, hearth and liver) than non-AKI patients. AKI events were more frequent in subjects with severe lung comprise. Two peaks of AKI events coincided with in-hospital admission and death of the patients. Kidney injury was associate with a higher rate of urinary abnormalities including proteinuria (0.448{+/-} 0.85 vs 0.18 {+/-} 0.29; P=<0.0001) and hematuria (P=0.032) compared to non-AKI patients. At the end of follow-up, 65.2% of the patients did not recover their renal function after AKI. Risk factors for kidney injury were age, male sex, CKD and non-renal SOFA. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (hazard ratio [HR]=3.74; CI 95%, 1.34-10.46) compared to non-AKI patients. Groups of patients with AKI stage 2-3 and failure to recover kidney function were associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality. Lastly, long-hospitalization was positively associated with a decrease of serum creatinine, likely due to muscle depletion occurred with prolonged bed rest. Conclusions AKI was a dire consequence of patients with COVID-19. Identification of patients at high-risk for AKI and prevention of kidney injury by avoiding dehydration and nephrotoxic agents is imperative in this vulnerable cohort of patients.","Alfano, G.; Ferrari, A.; Fontana, F.; Mori, G.; Magistroni, R.; Marianna, M.; Erica, F.; Menozzi, M.; Cuomo, G.; Orlando, G.; Santoro, A.; Di Gaetano, M.; Puzzolante, C.; Carli, F.; Bedini, A.; Milic, J.; Raggi, P.; Girardis, M.; Mussini, C.; Cappelli, G.; Guaraldi, G.",,618,20

This virus was first detected in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) in Brazil in February 26, 2020 and it has revealed important gaps in infectious disease surveillance that must be covered. Phylodynamic analysis is a tool that can help to monitor and adapt traditional surveillance measures in order to cover those. Therefore, this work aims to contrast data driven from epidemiologic surveillance in LAC with parameters inferred from phylodynamic analysis of reported genomes of SARS-CoV-2 across different LAC countries Methods: We obtained epidemiological data from daily reports provided by European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control up to 13th May, 2020. We estimated Effective Reproductive Number (Re) and calculated epidemic curves with exponential growth (EG) and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. SARS-CoV-2 phylodynamic in Latin-American was analyzed using sequences reported in GISAID for Central and South America up to May 13th 2020. Sequences were aligned, and ML phylogeny was constructed. Coalescent model Birth Death SIR (serial) was run, and SIR trajectories from the birth-death SIR model were plotted. Results: A total of 404,448 cases were reported up to 13th May 2020. Overall reproduction number for Latin America, estimated through the EG and ML methods, were 1.424 (IC95% 1.422 to 1.426) and 1.305 (IC95% 1.299 to 1.311) respectively. Phylodynamic analysis for Latin America showed an overall Re of 1.27 (IC95% 1.07 to 1.49). We did not find statistically significant differences between epidemiological and phylodynamic data at the cut-off time, except for Brazil. Discussion: Our results support that epidemiological and genomic surveillance are two complementary approaches. Evidence suggests that even with a low number of sequences proper estimations of Re could be performed. We suggest that countries, especially developing countries, should consider to add genomic surveillance to their systems for monitoring and adapting epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2.","Rojas-Gallardo, D.

This research analyzes possible drugs for these proteins as targets in computational drug designing using already available experimental drugs from the drug bank database. METHODS: Out of 471 proteins and 8820 drugs download from Protein Data Bank, PDB and Drug Bank database respectively, 16 proteins similar to NSP 1–15 and 31 drugs as per the “Rule of three” were selected for docking. Out of 88 docking results using PyRx, 18 proteins/chains with three promising drugs, DB01977, DB07132 and DB07535 were analyzed using PyMOL for final results. RESULTS: NSPs 3, 5, 11, 14 and 15 were identified as targets for the drugs, DB01977, BD07132 and DB07535. Drugs, DB01977 and DB07535 bind in the same binding pockets of NSP 5 and NSP 15. Drug, DB07132 binds with more number of residues when compared with the other two drugs and this indicates that the strength of protein-drug association is more by this drug with the NSPs than other drugs. Binding pockets of NSPs for these three drugs are very close with many sharing residues in common suggesting of similarity of pharmacophore of these drugs with the target binding pockets. CONCLUSION: The binding pockets of NSPs are well matched with the pharmacophore of drugs and with polar surface of drugs less than or equal to 100 A(2), drugs, DB01977, DB07132 and DB07535 bind individually and effectively with NSPs 3, 5, 11, 14 and 15 of ORF1ab of SARS-CoV-2 genome to bring changes in the activity of SARS-CoV-2 which may be useful for biological and clinical considerations.","Raj, Resal",Biochem Biophys Rep,618,8

Endothelial activation triggers rapid exocytosis of WPB, leading to the surface presentation of adhesion molecules relevant for leukocyte rolling (P-selectin) and platelet capture (von Willebrand factor [VWF]). Despite its role as an important secretory organelle, a comprehensive compilation of factors associated with WPB has not been carried out. We addressed this via a proximity proteomics approach employing the peroxidase APEX2 coupled with 2 known WPB-associated proteins: the Rab GTPases Rab3b and Rab27a. We show that APEX2-Rab3b/27a fusion constructs are correctly targeted to WPB of primary endothelial cells, and that proteins in their close proximity can be biotinylated through the WPB-recruited APEX2. Mass spectrometry analysis of the biotinylated proteins identified 183 WPB-associated proteins. Whereas these include factors reported before to localize to WPB, the majority comprises proteins not previously associated with WPB biology. Among them, the SNARE-interacting protein Munc13-2 was shown here to specifically localize to WPB and to serve as a novel factor promoting histamine-evoked WPB exocytosis and VWF secretion. Thus, APEX2-based proximity proteomics can be used to specifically identify novel organelle-associated factors in primary endothelial cells.","Holthenrich, Anna; Drexler, Hannes C.A.; Chehab, Tarek; Naß, Johannes; Gerke, Volker",Blood,618,28

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests fomites may not be the main route through which the novel coronavirus spreads. Supporting the same view, the latest the World Health Organization report recommends wearing masks for every individual in public, highlighting the transmission through the air. In the current study AERMOD, one of the most validated and tested models suggested by the USEPA, is used to model SARS-CoV-2-laden PM(10) in a hypothetical outdoor environment. Multiple scenarios including particle size, wind speed, source height variations as well as and combined scenarios were modeled to estimated how exposure risk changes with the above-mentioned variables. The results reveal that wind speed majorly narrows infectious plume rather than transferring the peak concentration. The particle size variation indicated that small particles, i.e.,0.01 − 2.5 μm, could reach more than 9 m away from the source in concentration range of 10 − 20 (μg/m(3)). On the other hand, source height contributes to peak plume shift rather than dispersing the infected particles. This idea was further studies by using combined scenarios which indicated height difference can impact peak plume displacement rather than wind speed. In the worst-case scenario, the results indicate that the virus-laden particles can travel outdoors more than 8 m away from an infected source. The video output of the model results clearly shows the dynamic of viral peak shifts in several scenarios. The results also indicate that in specific conditions the airborne SARS-CoV-2 can be transported to 9 m away from the source. These findings can be useful for individuals as well as decision-makers to mitigated exposure risk in real-world conditions.

Ad mist university examinations in India medical schools have switched to online assessment methods to avoid student gatherings. In this context, we conducted online anatomy practical evaluation and we have aimed at quantifying the students’ experience on virtual assessment. METHODS: A total of 250 first year MBBS students appeared for online anatomy practical examinations. Immediately after the completion of exams electronic feedback about their experience, in questionnaire format was obtained after getting informed consent. Their feedback was analysed and quantified. RESULTS: Completed feedback forms were submitted by 228 students. More than 50% of students favoured online anatomy spotter examinations. Only 32.8% of students were comfortable with soft parts discussion using images. For image based viva voce 61.4%, 80% & 82% of students responded that the features and orientation of osteology, radiology and embryology images, respectively, were good. For surface marking 55% of the participants preferred online verbal evaluation. Finally, more than 60% of the students preferred the conventional over online assessment methods. CONCLUSIONS: The inclination of students’ preference for traditional anatomy examination methods mandates adequate training of both students and teachers for virtual examination.

The proposed method will be known as Fuzzy Electromagnetism Optimization (FEMO). As the name suggests, the proposed approach is based on the electromagnetism-like optimization (EMO) method. The EMO method is extended, modified, and combined with the modified type 2 fuzzy C-Means algorithm to improve its efficiency especially for biomedical image segmentation. The proposed FEMO method uses fuzzy membership and the electromagnetism-like optimization method to locate the optimal positions for the cluster centers. The proposed FEMO approach does not have any dependency on the initial selection of the cluster centers. Moreover, this method is suitable for the biomedical images of different modalities. This method is compared with some standard metaheuristics and evolutionary methods (e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Electromagnetism-like optimization (EMO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), etc.) based image segmentation approaches. Four different indices Davies–Bouldin, Xie–Beni, Dunn and [Formula: see text] index are used for the comparison and evaluation purpose. For the GA, PSO, ACO, EMO and the proposed FEMO approach, the optimal average value of the Davies–Bouldin index is 1.833578359 (8 clusters), 1.669359475 (3 clusters), 1.623119284 (3 clusters), 1.647743907 (4 clusters) and 1.456889343 (3 clusters) respectively. It shows that the proposed approach can efficiently determine the optimal clusters. Moreover, the results of the other quantitative indices are quite promising for the proposed approach compared to the other approaches The detailed comparison is performed in both qualitative and quantitative manner and it is found that the proposed method outperforms some of the existing methods concerning some standard evaluation parameters.","Chakraborty, Shouvik; Mali, Kalyani",Appl Soft Comput,618,21

Eukaryotes have developed two main pathways, namely Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homologous Recombination (HR), to repair DSBs. While most of the current research is focused on the role of key protein players in the functional regulation of DSB repair pathways, accumulating evidence has uncovered a novel class of regulating factors termed non-coding RNAs. Non-coding RNAs have been found to hold a pivotal role in the activation of DSB repair mechanisms, thereby safeguarding genomic stability. In particular, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have begun to emerge as new players with vast therapeutic potential. This review summarizes important advances in the field of lncRNAs, including characterization of recently identified lncRNAs, and their implication in DSB repair pathways in the context of tumorigenesis.","Papaspyropoulos, Angelos; Lagopati, Nefeli; Mourkioti, Ioanna; Angelopoulou, Andriani; Kyriazis, Spyridon; Liontos, Michalis; Gorgoulis, Vassilis; Kotsinas, Athanassios",Cells,618,30

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic alerted us to the important roles that preventive measures, such as vaccines, play in fighting infectious diseases. In order to inform the public of the benefits of vaccines, it is important to provide society with information regarding new vaccine developments, adjuvants, the cost–benefit ratio of vaccine introduction, and vaccine effectiveness and safety. Clinical research is essential for obtaining evidence of vaccine effectiveness and safety. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts active surveillance in defined areas before and after the introduction of vaccines and documents the reduction in infection rates as a measure of vaccine effectiveness. However, vaccine efficacy and side effects may vary by country and ethnicity. Therefore, it is necessary for individual countries to develop their own evidence-based surveillance programs. We have studied vaccine efficacy and documented side-effects observed in patients for the varicella and rotavirus vaccines in Japan.

Available studies report varying prevalence rates. Hence, the exact prevalence remains uncertain. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate regarding the appropriate dosage of thromboprophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review and proportion meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched PubMed and EMBASE for studies exploring the prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients till 22/07/2020. We pooled the proportion of VTE. Additionally, in a subgroup analysis, we pooled VTE events detected by systematic screening. Finally, we compared the odds of VTE in patients on prophylactic compared to therapeutic anticoagulation. Results: The review comprised of 24 studies and over 2500 patients. The pooled proportion of VTE prevalence was 0.31 (95% CI 0.24, 0.39 I2 94%), of VTE utilizing systematic screening was 0.48 (95% CI 0.33, 0.63 I2 91%), of deep-venous-thrombosis was 0.23 (95% CI 0.14, 0.32 I2 96%), of pulmonary embolism was 0.14 (95% CI 0.09, 0.20 I2 90%). In a subgroup of studies, utilizing systematic screening, VTE risk increased significantly with prophylactic, compared to therapeutic anticoagulation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.90, 15.57 I2 0%). Discussion: Our review revealed a high prevalence of VTE in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Almost 50% of patients had VTE detected by systematic screening.

Similar to jurisdictions where this has been a more long-standing option for end-of-life care, the Supreme Court’s decision in Canada included a caveat that no healthcare provider could be compelled to participate in medical assistance in dying. The Canadian Nurses Association, in alignment with numerous ethical guidelines for healthcare providers around the globe, maintains that nurses may opt out of participation in medical assistance in dying if they conscientiously object to this procedure. The realities of implementing medical assistance in dying are still unfolding. One area that has received little attention in the literature thus far is the ability of nurses who aid with, rather than administer, medical assistance in dying to conscientiously object. This is particularly significant in rural and remote areas of Canada where geographic dispersion and limited numbers of nursing staff create conditions that limit the ability to transfer care or call on a designated team. Exercising conscientious objection to medical assistance in dying in rural and remote areas, by way of policies developed with an urban focus, is one example of how the needs of rural nurses and patients may not be met, leading to issues of patient access to medical assistance in dying and retention of nursing staff. To illustrate the complexities of nurses’ conscientious objection to medical assistance in dying in a rural setting, we apply an ethical decision-making framework to a hypothetical case scenario and discuss the potential consequences and implications for future policy. Realizing that conscientious objection may not be a viable option in a rural or remote context has implications for not only medical assistance in dying, but other ethically sensitive healthcare services as well. These considerations have implications for policy in other jurisdictions allowing or considering medically assisted deaths, as well as other rural and remote areas where nurses may face ethical dilemmas.","Panchuk, Julia; Thirsk, Lorraine M",Nurs Ethics,618,24

Modified minimally invasive surgical technique (M-MIST) is designed to deal with isolated interdental intrabony defects, and has achieved satisfactory periodontal regenerative effect. Bio-Oss Collagen, as a bioactive material, has been applied for periodontal regeneration. It is similar to human cancellous bone, with the ability to promote bone formation; furthermore, it has exceptional plasticity and spatial stability. The combination of different materials and techniques has become a research hotspot in recent years. By combining the superiority of regeneration technology and materials, better regenerative effect can be achieved. This study will search for differences between M-MIST combined with Bio-Oss Collagen, and M-MIST alone in regeneration therapy for intrabony defects. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present research is designed as a two-group parallel randomised controlled trial. The total number of patients is 40. The patients will be randomly assigned to two groups, with 20 participants in each group, for further periodontal regenerative surgery. Test group: M-MIST plus Bio-Oss Collagen. Control group: M-MIST. After 12 months, the measurement indices will be recorded; these will include clinical attachment gain and radiographical intrabony defect depth change as the primary results, and secondary outcomes of full-mouth plaque scores, probing depth, full-mouth bleeding scores, gingival recession, mobility, gingival papilla height and Visual Analogue Scale. The paired samples t-test will be applied to detect any difference between baseline and 1-year registrations.

METHODS: In the phase 3 portion of an adaptive trial, we randomly assigned outpatients with Covid-19 and risk factors for severe disease to receive various doses of intravenous REGEN-COV or placebo. Patients were followed through day 29. A prespecified hierarchical analysis was used to assess the end points of hospitalization or death and the time to resolution of symptoms. Safety was also evaluated. RESULTS: Covid-19-related hospitalization or death from any cause occurred in 18 of 1355 patients in the REGEN-COV 2400-mg group (1.3%) and in 62 of 1341 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization concurrently (4.6%) (relative risk reduction [1 minus the relative risk], 71.3%; P<0.001); these outcomes occurred in 7 of 736 patients in the REGEN-COV 1200-mg group (1.0%) and in 24 of 748 patients in the placebo group who underwent randomization concurrently (3.2%) (relative risk reduction, 70.4%; P = 0.002). The median time to resolution of symptoms was 4 days shorter with each REGEN-COV dose than with placebo (10 days vs. 14 days; P<0.001 for both comparisons). REGEN-COV was efficacious across various subgroups, including patients who were SARS-CoV-2 serum antibody-positive at baseline. Both REGEN-COV doses reduced viral load faster than placebo; the least-squares mean difference in viral load from baseline through day 7 was -0.71 log10 copies per milliliter (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.90 to -0.53) in the 1200-mg group and -0.86 log10 copies per milliliter (95% CI, -1.00 to -0.72) in the 2400-mg group. Serious adverse events occurred more frequently in the placebo group (4.0%) than in the 1200-mg group (1.1%) and the 2400-mg group (1.3%); infusion-related reactions of grade 2 or higher occurred in less than 0.3% of the patients in all groups.

AIMS: This follow-up explanatory case study compares the effectiveness of intervention module with that of the previous regular module. METHODS: The regular group (n = 28) comprised clinical instructors who participated in the FD module during the 2013–2014 year while the intervention group (n = 28) was composed of 2015–2016 participants. Prior to the formal (hands-on) training, participants in the intervention group were asked to study the online materials of the regular module. These participants then received a 30-h hands-on training in conducting, designing, and leading skills. Finally, they prepared a 10-h reflective end-of-module presentation of their real-world practices. RESULTS: Following the training, a higher degree improvement in participants self-reported familiarity with CC education, self-confidence in their ability to deliver CC education and sustained involve CC education were noted among the intervention FD group, compared with the regular FD group. In the intervention group, senior academicians (associate and full professor) are more substantially involved in designing and leading CC-based courses than junior academicians (lecturers and assistant professors). Among non-teaching award winners of in the intervention FD group, the follow-up degree of sustained involvement in delivering, designing and leading CC-based courses was significantly higher than that of the regular group.

ExoN catalytic residues are arranged in three motifs: I (DE), II (E), and III (D). Alanine replacement of the motif I residues (AA-E-D; four nucleotide substitutions) in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV yields viable mutants with impaired replication and fitness, increased mutation rates, and attenuated virulence in vivo. Despite these impairments, MHV- and SARS-CoV ExoN motif I AA mutants (ExoN-AA) have not reverted at motif I in diverse in vitro and in vivo environments, suggesting that profound fitness barriers prevent motif I reversion. To test this hypothesis, we engineered MHV-ExoN-AA with 1, 2, or 3 nucleotide mutations along genetic pathways to AA-to-DE reversion. We show that engineered intermediate revertants were viable but had no increased replication or competitive fitness compared to that of MHV-ExoN-AA. In contrast, a low-passage-number (passage 10 [P10]) MHV-ExoN-AA showed increased replication and competitive fitness without reversion of ExoN-AA. Finally, engineered reversion of ExoN-AA to ExoN-DE in the presence of ExoN-AA passage-adaptive mutations resulted in significant fitness loss. These results demonstrate that while reversion is possible, at least one alternative adaptive pathway is more rapidly advantageous than intermediate revertants and may alter the genetic background to render reversion detrimental to fitness. Our results provide an evolutionary rationale for lack of ExoN-AA reversion, illuminate potential multiprotein replicase interactions and coevolution, and support future studies aimed at stabilizing attenuated CoV ExoN-AA mutants. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses encode an exoribonuclease (ExoN) that is important for viral replication, fitness, and virulence, yet coronaviruses with a defective ExoN (ExoN-AA) have not reverted under diverse experimental conditions. In this study, we identify multiple impediments to MHV-ExoN-AA reversion. We show that ExoN-AA reversion is possible but evolutionarily unfavorable. Instead, compensatory mutations outside ExoN-AA motif I are more accessible and beneficial than partial reversion. We also show that coevolution between replicase proteins over long-term passage partially compensates for ExoN-AA motif I but renders the virus inhospitable to a reverted ExoN. Our results reveal the evolutionary basis for the genetic stability of ExoN-inactivating mutations, illuminate complex functional and evolutionary relationships between coronavirus replicase proteins, and identify potential mechanisms for stabilization of ExoN-AA coronavirus mutants.","Graepel, Kevin W.; Agostini, Maria L.; Lu, Xiaotao; Sexton, Nicole R.; Denison, Mark R.",Journal of Virology,618,22

METHODS: We reviewed the outbreak investigation reports and medical records of 1 index case and 25 additional MERS cases in hospitals A (14 cases) and B (11 cases), and conducted an in-depth interview with the index case. RESULTS: The CFR in hospital B was higher than that in hospital A (63.6% vs. 28.6%, respectively). Higher MERS-CoV exposure conditions were also found in hospital B, including aggravated pneumonia in the index case and nebulizer use in a six-bed admission room. The host factors associated with high CFR were pre-existing pneumonia, smoking history, an incubation period of less than 5 days, leukocytosis, abnormal renal function at diagnosis, and respiratory symptoms such as sputum and dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS: The conditions surrounding MERS-CoV exposure and the underlying poor pulmonary function due to a smoking history or pre-existing pneumonia may explain the high CFR in hospital B. The clinical features described above may enable prediction of the prognosis of MERS cases.","Nam, Hae-Sung; Park, Jung Wan; Ki, Moran; Yeon, Mi-Yeon; Kim, Jin; Kim, Seung Woo",Int J Infect Dis,618,16

Artemisinin-related studies have been extensively and intensively executed in the last few decades. However, although many purely technological reviews have been completed in this field, studies on artemisinin from the perspective of patents are still very limited. In terms of the importance of patents for academic research and commercial development, this study aims to reveal the overall patent landscape of artemisinin in the temporal, spatial, and technological dimensions. This work may provide a useful reference for relevant decision-making by researchers, investors, and policymakers. METHODS: All available patent data relevant to artemisinin derivatives and artemisinin-based drug combinations developed for use in various therapeutic areas were collected from the Derwent Innovation database. Descriptive statistics and citation analyses were used to analyze the patent landscape. RESULTS: A total of 4594 patent documents and 1450 simple patent families from 1986 to 2019 were analyzed. A comprehensive patent landscape of artemisinin is presented from the aspects of time trends, filing countries, patent ownership, co-patents, technological categories, therapeutic areas, and citation networks and pathways. CONCLUSIONS: China and the United States are mainly responsible for the dramatic increase of artemisinin patents over the last three decades. From the point of view of patents, notable technological issues on artemisinin are chemical and biological synthesis, novel combinations, new formulations and administration routes, drug repositioning, and minimizing the resistance. Furthermore, a critical challenge lies in how to stimulate the industry to develop artemisinin-related drugs by government regulation and public-private partnership.","Liu, Kunmeng; Zuo, Huali; Li, Guoguo; Yu, Hua; Hu, Yuanjia",Pharmacol Res,618,16

Several case studies include parametric classifiers such as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, which is one of the most widely used today. Others use non-parametric classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Naïve Bayes (NB), Adaboost, and Random Forest (RF). However, there is still little work directed toward a new trend in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (X-AI). This new trend seeks to make Machine Learning (ML) algorithms increasingly simple and easy to understand for users. Therefore, following this new wave of knowledge, in this work, the authors develop a new pattern classification methodology, based on the implementation of the novel Minimalist Machine Learning (MML) paradigm and a higher relevance attribute selection algorithm, which we call dMeans. We examine and compare the performance of this methodology with MLP, NB, KNN, SVM, Adaboost, and RF classifiers to perform the task of classification of Computed Tomography (CT) brain images. These grayscale images have an area of 128 × 128 pixels, and there are two classes available in the dataset: CT without Hemorrhage and CT with Intra-Ventricular Hemorrhage (IVH), which were classified using the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation method. Most of the models tested by Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation performed between 50% and 75% accuracy, while sensitivity and sensitivity ranged between 58% and 86%. The experiments performed using our methodology matched the best classifier observed with 86.50% accuracy, and they outperformed all state-of-the-art algorithms in specificity with 91.60%. This performance is achieved hand in hand with simple and practical methods, which go hand in hand with this trend of generating easily explainable algorithms.","Solorio-Ramírez, José-Luis; Saldana-Perez, Magdalena; Lytras, Miltiadis D.; Moreno-Ibarra, Marco-Antonio; Yáñez-Márquez, Cornelio",Diagnostics (Basel),618,1

Hypertension appeared consistently as the most prevalent risk factors in COVID‐19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID‐19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and increased mortality in these patients. This raised concern about the potential association between hypertension (and its treatment) and propensity for COVID‐19. There are only a few follow‐up studies that investigated the impact of comorbidities on outcome in these patients with conflicting findings. Hypertension has been proven to be more prevalent in patients with an adverse outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of hypertension on mortality in COVID‐19 patients. There are many speculations about this coronavirus and its relation with different risk factors and underlying diseases. The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between hypertension and COVID‐19 and the role of hypertension on outcome in these patients.","Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Grassi, Guido; Mancia, Giuseppe",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),618,1

We introduce ASMODEE (automatic selection of models and outlier detection for epidemics), a new tool for detecting sudden changes in COVID-19 incidence. Our approach relies on automatically selecting the best (fitting or predicting) model from a range of user-defined time series models, excluding the most recent data points, to characterize the main trend in an incidence. We then derive prediction intervals and classify data points outside this interval as outliers, which provides an objective criterion for identifying departures from previous trends. We also provide a method for selecting the optimal breakpoints, used to define how many recent data points are to be excluded from the trend fitting procedure. The analysis of simulated COVID-19 outbreaks suggests ASMODEE compares favourably with a state-of-art outbreak-detection algorithm while being simpler and more flexible. As such, our method could be of wider use for infectious disease surveillance. We illustrate ASMODEE using publicly available data of National Health Service (NHS) Pathways reporting potential COVID-19 cases in England at a fine spatial scale, showing that the method would have enabled the early detection of the flare-ups in Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen, two to three weeks before their respective lockdown.

Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of “trained immunity” or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 epidemiological data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity—a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations—is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. We seek to draw attention toward the inclusion of controls for underlying “trained immunity” and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be preexisting or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning potential benefit from them.","Singh, Samer; Maurya, Rajendra Prakash; Singh, Rakesh K.",PLoS Pathog,618,3

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients admitted to our institution with confirmed COVID-19 status by PCR between March 1, 2020 and May 13, 2020 and selected those who underwent both D-dimer and venous duplex US. This cohort was divided into two groups, those with and without DVT based on duplex US. These groups were then compared to determine the value of D-dimer in establishing this diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 1170 patients were admitted with COVID-19, of which 158 were selected as our study. Of the 158, there were 52 patients with DVT and 106 without DVT. There were no differences in gender, age, race, or ethnicity between groups. Diabetes and routine hemodialysis were less commonly seen in the group with DVT. Over 90% of patients in both groups received prophylactic anticoagulation, but the use of LMWH or subcutaneous heparin prophylaxis was not predictive of DVT. All patients had elevated acute-phase D-dimer levels using conventional criteria, and 154/158 (97.5%) had elevated levels with age-adjusted criteria (mean D-dimer 16,163 ± 5,395 ng/mL). Those with DVT had higher acute-phase D-dimer levels than those without DVT (median 13,602 [6,616-36,543 ng/mL] vs. 2,880 [1,030-9,126 ng/mL], p < 0.001). An optimal D-dimer cutoff of 6,494 ng/mL was determined to differentiate those with and without DVT (sensitivity 80.8%, specificity 68.9%, negative predictive value 88.0%). Wells DVT criteria was not found to be a significant predictor of DVT. Elevated D-dimer as defined by our optimal metric was a statistically significant predictor of DVT in both univariate and multivariable analyses when adjusting for other factors (OR 6.12, 95%CI [2.79-13.39], p <0.001). CONCLUSION: D-dimer levels are uniformly elevated in COVID-19 patients. While standard predictive criteria failed to predict DVT, our analysis showed a D-dimer of less than 6,494 ng/mL may exclude DVT, therefore potentially limiting the need for venous duplex ultrasonography.","Cho, Edward S.; McClelland, Paul H.; Cheng, Olivia; Kim, Yuri; Hu, James; Zenilman, Michael E.; D’Ayala, Marcus",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,618,20

The clinical role of chest computed tomography (CT) in describing the progression of COVID-19-associated lung injury remains to be clarified. We investigated in COVID-19 patients the regional distribution of lung injury and the influence of clinical and laboratory features on its progression. METHODS: This was a prospective study. For each CT, twenty images, evenly spaced along the cranio-caudal axis, were selected. For regional analysis, each CT image was divided into three concentric subpleural regions of interest and four quadrants. Hyper-, normally, hypo- and non-inflated lung compartments were defined. Nonparametric tests were used for hypothesis testing (α = 0.05). Spearman correlation test was used to detect correlations between lung compartments and clinical features. RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 111 recruited patients were eligible for further analysis. Five hundred-sixty CT images were analyzed. Lung injury, composed by hypo- and non-inflated areas, was significantly more represented in subpleural than in core lung regions. A secondary, centripetal spread of lung injury was associated with exposure to mechanical ventilation (p < 0.04), longer spontaneous breathing (more than 14 days, p < 0.05) and non-protective tidal volume (p < 0.04). Positive fluid balance (p < 0.01), high plasma D-dimers (p < 0.01) and ferritin (p < 0.04) were associated with increased lung injury. CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure, a predominant subpleural distribution of lung injury is observed. Prolonged spontaneous breathing and high tidal volumes, both causes of patient self-induced lung injury, are associated to an extensive involvement of more central regions. Positive fluid balance, inflammation and thrombosis are associated with lung injury. Trial registration Study registered a priori the 20th of March, 2020. Clinical Trials ID NCT04316884.

Disruptive technologies include high-tech and emerging technologies such as AI, industry 4.0, IoT, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), big data, virtual reality (VR), Drone technology, and Autonomous Robots, 5 G, and blockchain to offer digital transformation, research and development and service delivery. Disruptive technologies are essential for Industry 4.0 development, which can be applied to many disciplines. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. The proposed framework restricts the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks, ensures the safety of the healthcare teams and maintains patients' physical and psychological healthcare conditions. The framework is designed to deal with the severe shortage of PPE for the medical team, reduce the massive pressure on hospitals, and track recovered patients to treat COVID-19 patients with plasma. The study provides oversight for governments on how to adopt technologies to reduce the impact of unprecedented outbreaks for COVID-19. Our work illustrates an empirical case study on the analysis of real COVID-19 patients and shows the importance of the proposed intelligent framework to limit the current outbreaks for COVID-19. The aim is to help the healthcare team make rapid decisions to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals, home quarantine, or identifying and treating patients with typical cold or flu.","Abdel-Basset, Mohamed; Chang, Victor; Nabeeh, Nada A.",Technol Forecast Soc Change,618,16

Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the orofacial adverse effects of two recently authorised COVID‐19 vaccines, namely BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273. METHODS: Publicly available data on BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273 vaccines were accessed from the relevant regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada, European Union and United Kingdom. Both patient/recipient information and healthcare professional fact sheets for each of these drugs were manually searched to find their orofacial adverse effects. RESULTS: Adverse events affecting the orofacial region were reported for both vaccines. These were rare and included acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), facial swelling, and swelling of the lips, face or tongue associated with anaphylaxis. There was heterogeneity in the acknowledgement of vaccine‐related adverse events in North America compared with Europe. CONCLUSION: Globally, there are inconsistencies in the description of adverse effects presenting in the orofacial region of the COVID‐19 vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA‐1273. We believe that awareness of these orofacial manifestations will improve recognition, management and reporting of vaccine‐related adverse effects.","Cirillo, Nicola",J Oral Pathol Med,618,1

Primary care providers are in the frontline. COVID-19 is spread primarily by respiratory droplets contaminating surfaces and hands that then transmit the virus to another person’s respiratory system. The incubation period is 2–9 days and the majority of cases are mild. The most common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Older people and those with cardiopulmonary co-morbidities or immunological deficiency will be more at risk of severe disease. If people meet the case definition, the primary care provider should immediately adopt infection prevention and control measures. Diagnosis is made by a RT-PCR test using respiratory secretions, usually nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. Mild cases can be managed at home with self-isolation, symptomatic treatment and follow-up if the disease worsens. Contact tracing is very important. Observed case fatality is between 0.5% and 4%, but may be overestimated as mild cases are not always counted.

Apart from its severity for all communities, a chronic disease patient is highly vulnerable to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess preparedness and response against the COVID-19 among chronic diseases patients who had follow-up at healthcare facilities. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the North Shoa Zone from May 5, 2020, to June 5/2020. A pre-tested and semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data. The study participants were selected by simple random sampling technique. The data were entered into the Epi-data and exported to SPSS for cleaning and analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify the factors associated with the COVID-19 preparedness and response. RESULTS: A total of 410 (97%) patients were responded to face to face interview administered questionnaire. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents had good knowledge, 54% were well prepared, and 63% had a good response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Male participants, news media (TV & Radio), social media, tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with a good preparedness. Informal education, news media (TV & Radio), and having hypertension were significantly associated with good response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic among chronic disease patients was low. Male participants, source of information, educational status, and having chronic diseases were significantly associated with the COVID-19 prevention preparedness and response. It should be continued to provide awareness creation for chronic patients through news media (TV and radio) and social media to increasing the preparedness and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Geleta, Tinsae Abeya; Deriba, Berhanu Senbeta; Beyane, Rebik Shukure; Mohammed, Ahmed; Birhanu, Tadesse; Jemal, Kemal",Int J Gen Med,618,3

METHODS: Synthesizing data from various government and nonprofit institutions for all 3142 United States (US) counties, we studied county-level characteristics that were associated with cumulative and weekly case and death rates through 12/21/2020. We used generalized linear mixed models to model cumulative and weekly (40 repeated measures per county) cases and deaths. Cumulative and weekly models included state fixed effects and county-specific random effects. Weekly models additionally allowed covariate effects to vary by season and included US Census region-specific B-splines to adjust for temporal trends. RESULTS: Rural counties, counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation, and counties with more people with no high school diploma and with medical comorbidities were associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. In the spring, urban counties and counties with more minorities and white/non-white segregation were associated with increased weekly case and death rates. In the fall, rural counties were associated with larger weekly case and death rates. In the spring, summer, and fall, counties with more residents with socioeconomic disadvantage and medical comorbidities were associated greater weekly case and death rates. CONCLUSIONS: These county-level associations are based off complete data from the entire country, come from a single modeling framework that longitudinally analyzes the US COVID-19 pandemic at the county-level, and are applicable to guiding government resource allocation policies to different US counties.

Devant l’afflux de personnes nécessitant un dépistage et le manque de place en unité d’isolement dans les établissements de soins référent (ESR), un système dégradé d’accueil pour le dépistage des cas suspects de CoViD-19 a été élaboré. En concertation avec les autorités sanitaires françaises et la direction de l’hôpital, le département des maladies infectieuses a développé le projet AmbuCoV pour pouvoir accueillir au mieux et sans délais toutes les personnes qui lui étaient adressées. Matériels et méthodes Mise en place d’une unité dédiée pour la prise en charge des personnes nécessitant un dépistage pour le CoViD-19 et ne justifiant pas d’une hospitalisation. L’unité AmbuCoV, ouverte 24h/24 et 7j/7, a fonctionné avec le personnel minimum et respecté un parcours patient développé par l’équipe pluridisciplinaire du service pour le dépistage et l’isolement au sein de l’établissement. Le laboratoire de virologie procédait à deux séries de PCR par jour, avec un rendu des résultats vers 13h pour les prélèvements envoyés avant 8h, et 19h pour ceux envoyés avant 14h. Une évaluation interne a été menée afin d’évaluer quantitativement et qualitativement ce dispositif. Résultats AmbuCoV a été ouvert le 31 janvier 2020 et comprenait 22 lits répartis en 16 chambres. Une infirmière effectuait le prélèvement nasopharyngé et la prise des constantes dans le box dédié en pression négative de l’unite d’isolement. Les personnes sans ATCD et paucisymptomatiques (constantes normales, t<38°C, absence de dyspnée et de toux) étaient accompagnées pour être isolées dans l’unité AmbuCoV jusqu’à réception des résultats. Ces patients ne nécessitant pas de soins infirmiers, une aide-soignante présente dans l’unité en permanence répondait à leurs besoins et assurait le lien avec les infirmières et médecins du service. En cas d’infection CoViD-19 confirmée les patients devaient être hospitalisés dans l’unité d’isolement. Les deux premières semaines, 15 personnes de 10 à 48 ans ont été admises dans AmbuCov soit 20 % des personnes admises pour dépistage du CoViD-19 dans notre ESR. Nous présentons en photos et à l’aide de figures la procédure et le parcours des personnes prises en charge. Aucune personne suspecte d’infection à CoViD-19 ne s’est vue refusée l’admission pour dépistage dans notre ESR. Les usagers et le personnel soignant se sont montrés satisfaits de ce programme. La principale limitation à l’utilisation de l’unité AmbuCoV était l’absence de pression négative dans les chambres qui contre-indiquait la prise en charge des personnes présentant une toux ou des signes broncho-pulmonaires. Un système de recyclage de l’air par appareil mobile (Plasmair) est à l’essai. Conclusion Nous avons mis en place une stratégie de dépistage ambulatoire d’une infection virale émergente pour faire face à l’augmentation de patients et de cas suspects en contexte épidémique. Cette unité baptisée AmbuCoV nous a permis de faire face rapidement et efficacement à l’afflux de personnes et pourra être réutilisée à l’avenir en cas de nouvelle épidémie.

Yet invisible obstacles or barriers appear to impede mass adoption of these services among this population group. The aim of the current research is to provide a qualitative picture of these invisible obstacles and to profile their main features, with special attention to the role of family members in supporting OHS use among this population group. METHODS: This qualitative study entailed a series of in-depth, semi-structured, open phone interviews conducted with 31 individuals age 50 and up in Israel, who constituted a sample of OHS users and non-users among older adults. RESULTS: 1. While older adults are aware of OHS to some extent, they often do not fully understand the specific benefits of using these services; 2. Older adults need to acquire much more experience with OHS use. OHS user interfaces still have a long way to go for older adults to feel comfortable using them. People age 50 and up seem to be less concerned about privacy and security issues than about seemingly more trivial issues such as recovering forgotten passwords; 3. Family members can play key roles in helping older adults adopt OHS by providing technical support as well as encouragement; 4. Older adults have worthwhile recommendations for innovations and policy improvements that would facilitate wider adoption of OHS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study reveal important nuances regarding the importance of awareness, user interface and experience for OHS use among older adults, as well as the critical role of family members in OHS adoption. Based on these findings, we recommend the following: expanding advertising on media channels to emphasize the benefits of OHS use; improving HMO websites to make them more user-friendly for older people; developing HMO-run community OHS guidance programs geared to older people to reduce the gap between required skills and user competencies, thus enabling older people to benefit from OHS use.","Mizrachi, Y.; Shahrabani, S.; Nachmani, M.; Hornik, A.",Isr J Health Policy Res,618,1

METHODS: Using number of daily confirmed cases from January 23, 2020 to March 22, 2020 and their symptom onset date from the official website of the Seoul Metropolitan Government and the district office, we calculated R(t) using program R’s package “EpiEstim”. For asymptomatic cases, their symptom onset date was considered as -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2 days of confirmed date. RESULTS: Based on the information of 313 confirmed cases, the epidemic curve was shaped like ‘propagated epidemic curve’. The daily R(t) based on R(t_c) peaked to 2.6 on February 20, 2020, then showed decreased trend and became <1.0 from March 3, 2020. Comparing both R(t) from R(t_c) and from the number of daily onset cases, we found that the pattern of changes was similar, although the variation of R(t) was greater when using R(t_c). When we changed assumed onset date for asymptotic cases (-2 days to +2 days of the confirmed date), the results were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: R(t) can be estimated based on R(t_c) which is available from daily report of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This paper is the first systematic attempt to provide estimates on how many people would contract the virus and how many would die in the coming few months across Africa. Methods: The forecasts on caseloads and incidences are from a co-variate-based instrumental variable regression model. Fatality rates from Italy and China were further applied to generate mortality estimates after adjustments were made for differences in age-structure, health service quality, and living standards between each of the African countries and those of the reference population. We cover all countries that reported a confirmed case as of March 31, 2020. Results: By the end of June, 16,283,085 people will contract COVID-19 (95% CI 718,403 to 98, 358, 799). With a cumulative caseload of 5,413,4517 (95% CI 1,332,953 to 8,489,940) and 906,625 (95% CI 173, 821 to 4,742,917) Northern and Eastern Africa will respectively be the most and least affected sub-regions in the continent. Cumulative COVID-19 cases on June 30, 2020 are expected to reach 2,912, 864 (95% CI 465,028 to 18,286,358) in Southern Africa, 2,787, 913 (95% CI 517, 489 to 15,056,314) in Western Africa, and 1,185,742 (95% CI 229, 111 to 6,138,692) in Central Africa. New infections (incidence) for the month of April are expected to be the highest in Djibouti, 32.8 per 1000 (95% CI 6.25 to 171.77), while Morocco 1045 (95% CI 167 to 6,547) will register the highest number of deaths. Conclusion: Our study shows that countries that are least urbanized and have a low level of socio-economic development, hence least connected to the outside world, are likely to register lower and slower transmissions, at least at the early stage of the epidemic. However, the same set of enabling factors that worked for their benefit are likely to go against them in implementing interventions that have lessened the impact of the disease elsewhere.","Kinfu, Y.; Alam, U.; Achoki, T.",,618,24

In view of this, HCWs were evaluated for their knowledge of and attitude towards MERS in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in two hospitals of Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 280 healthcare workers were selected to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed by using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were carried out to express participants’ demographic information, mean knowledge score and mean attitude score of HCWs. Inferential statistics (Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests, p < 0.05) were used to examine differences between study variables. Chi squares tests were used to assess the association between study variables and attitude questions. Spearman’s rho correlation was used to identify the association between the knowledge, attitude scores. RESULT: Participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. The mean scores of knowledge and attitude were 9.45 ± 1.69 (based on 13 knowledge questions) and 1.82 ± 0.72 (based on 7 attitude questions). The correlation between knowledge and attitude was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.12; P <0.001). HCWs were less educated about the management (42.4%), source (66%) and consequences of MERS (67.3%), while a majority of them were well aware of the hallmark symptoms (96%), precautionary measures (96%) and hygiene issues (94%). Although the majority of respondents showed positive attitude towards the use of protective measures (1.52 ± 0.84), their attitude was negative towards their active participation in infection control program (2.03 ± 0.97). Gender and experience were significantly associated with knowledge and attitude (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study showed that healthcare workers in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia have good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. Yet there are areas where low knowledge and negative attitude of HCWs was observed. However, studies are required to assess the knowledge and attitude of HCWs at national level so that effective interventions could be designed as surveillance and infection control measures are critical to global public health.","Khan, Muhammad Umair; Shah, Shahjahan; Ahmad, Akram; Fatokun, Omotayo",BMC Public Health,618,32

Particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), mHealth approaches for clinical decision support and record-keeping offer numerous potential advantages over paper records and in-person training and supervision. We conducted a content analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews using the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM-3) to explore perspectives of providers and health managers in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, India who were using the ASMAN (Alliance for Saving Mothers and Newborns) platform, a package of mHealth technologies to support management during the peripartum period. Respondents uniformly found ASMAN easy to use and felt it improved quality of care, reduced referral rates, ensured timely referral when needed, and aided reporting requirements. The TAM-3 model captured many determinants of reported respondent use behavior, including shifting workflow and job performance. However, some barriers to ASMAN digital platform use were structural and reported more often in facilities where ASMAN use was less consistent; these affect long-term impact, sustainability, and scalability of ASMAN and similar mHealth interventions. The transitioning of the program to the government, ensuring availability of dedicated funds, human resource support, and training and integration with government health information systems will ensure the sustainability of ASMAN.","Usmanova, Gulnoza; Gresh, Ashley; Cohen, Megan A.; Kim, Young-Mi; Srivastava, Ashish; Joshi, Chandra Shekhar; Bhatt, Deepak Chandra; Haws, Rachel; Wadhwa, Rajni; Sridhar, Pompy; Bahl, Nupur; Gaikwad, Pratibha; Anderson, Jean",Int J Environ Res Public Health,618,22

Priority in detection and specific therapies for these patients are necessary. We wanted to investigate the impact of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MS) on the clinical course of COVID-19 and whether prognostic biomarkers described are useful to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in patients with obesity or MS. This prospective cohort study included 303 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Participants were first classified according to the presence of obesity; then, they were classified according to the presence of MS. Clinical, radiologic, and analytical parameters were collected. We reported that patients with obesity presented moderate COVID-19 symptoms and pneumonia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and needed tocilizumab more frequently. Meanwhile, patients with MS presented severe pneumonia and respiratory failure more frequently, they have a higher mortality rate, and they also showed higher creatinine and troponin levels. The main findings of this study are that IL-6 is a potential predictor of COVID-19 severity in patients with obesity, while troponin and LDH can be used as predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity in MS patients. Therefore, treatment for COVID-19 in patients with obesity or MS should probably be intensified and personalized.","Perpiñan, Carles; Bertran, Laia; Terra, Ximena; Aguilar, Carmen; Lopez-Dupla, Miguel; Alibalic, Ajla; Riesco, David; Camaron, Javier; Perrone, Francesco; Rull, Anna; Reverté, Laia; Yeregui, Elena; Marti, Anna; Vidal, Francesc; Auguet, Teresa",J Pers Med,618,5

Materials and Methods: 224 patients with confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection outside Wuhan who had chest CT examinations were retrospectively screened. Clinical data were obtained from electronic medical records. CT images were reviewed and scored for lesion distribution, lobe and segment involvement, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, and interstitial thickening. All included patients with moderate NCP were observed for at least 14 days from admission to determine whether they exacerbated to severe NCP (progressive group) or not (stable group). CT and clinical characteristics between the two groups were compared, and multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the risk factors for developing severe NCP. Results: A total of 141 patients with moderate NCP were included, of which 15 (10.6%) patients developed severe NCP during hospitalization and assigned to the progressive group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 [1.04-1.53]; P = 0.018) and CT severity score (OR and 95% CI, 1.25 [1.08-1.46]; P = 0.004) on admission were independent predictors for progression to severe NCP, and sensitivity analysis confirmed the consistent results in nonimported patients but not in imported patients. However, no significant difference in lung involvement was found on CT between imported and nonimported patients (all P > 0.05). Patients who were admitted more than 4 days from symptom onset tended to have more severe lung involvement. Spearman correlation analysis showed the close association between CT severity score and inflammatory indexes (r = 0.17~0.47, all P < 0.05). Conclusion: CT severity score was associated with inflammatory levels and higher NLR and CT severity score on admission were independent risk factors for short-term progression in patients with NCP outside Wuhan. Furthermore, early admission and surveillance by CT should be recommended to improve clinical outcomes.","Feng, Zhichao; Yu, Qizhi; Yao, Shanhu; Luo, Lei; Duan, Junhong; Yan, Zhimin; Yang, Min; Tan, Hongpei; Ma, Mengtian; Li, Ting; Yi, Dali; Mi, Ze; Zhao, Huafei; Jiang, Yi; He, Zhenhu; Li, Huiling; Nie, Wei; Liu, Yin; Zhao, Jing; Luo, Muqing; Liu, Xuanhui; Rong, Pengfei; Wang, Wei",,618,17

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), which ranges from mild respiratory symptoms to severe lung injury and death in the most severe cases. The COVID-19 pandemic is currently a major health issue worldwide. Immune dysregulation characterized by altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to the pathology of COVID-19 patients, which is a testimony of the fundamental role of the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we further characterized the host cell antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 by using primary human airway epithelia and immortalized model cell lines. We mainly focused on the type I and III interferon (IFN) responses, which lead to the establishment of an antiviral state through the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Our results demonstrate that both primary airway epithelial cells and model cell lines elicit a robust immune response characterized by a strong induction of type I and III IFN through the detection of viral pathogen molecular patterns (PAMPs) by melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5. However, despite the high levels of type I and III IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication, whereas IFN pre-treatment strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. Taken together, these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and the timing of IFN responses.","Antoine, Rebendenne; Valadão Ana Luiza, Chaves; Marine, Tauziet; Ghizlane, Maarifi; Boris, Bonaventure; Rémi, Planès; Joe, McKellar; Sébastien, Nisole; Mary, Arnaud-Arnould; Olivier, Moncorgé; Caroline, Goujon",bioRxiv,618,20

Methods A cross-sectional retrospective study was performed in the ED of a tertiary training and research hospital between 1 April and 31 May 2020 in İstanbul, Turkey. The daily count of emergency visits and the count of the emergency consultations during the study period were recorded. The emergency visits and consultations in the same months of the previous year (1 April-31 May 2019) were included as a control group. Results Approximately 50% reduction in ED visits and a 30% reduction in emergency consultations were detected. A significant decrease was detected in all triage levels of visits and emergency consultations (p < 0.001). Within total ED visits, a significant increase was found in the red (4.32% vs. 4.74%) and yellow (21.66% vs. 33.16%) triage levels visit rates, while the green (74.01% vs. 62.1%) level was decreased. Within total emergency consultations, anesthesiology (0.83% vs. 1.56%) and cardiology (3.17% vs. 3.75%) consultation rates increased, neurology (2.22% vs. 1.15%), orthopedics (3.53% vs. 3.01%), and ophthalmology (2.89% vs. 1.57%) consultation rates decreased, internal medicine (2.45% vs. 2.49%), and general surgery (4.46% vs. 4.64%) consultation rates did not change. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, ED visits at all triage levels decreased. While the rate of critical patient visits increased, non-emergency patient visit rates decreased. The total count of consultations decreased, while the total consultation rates increased.

Comment on “Analysis of Scientific Publications During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Topic Modeling Study”,17.2936,4.9677963,2021-05-20,"OBJECTIVES: Bleeding and thromboembolism are common during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The relative frequency of these complications and their impact on clinical outcomes have not been described, and no randomized trials exist to guide anticoagulation strategies in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Our objective was to examine the relative frequencies of bleeding and thromboembolic events and their associations with survival among a cohort of consecutive patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single academic medical center. PATIENTS: Adult patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and anticoagulation. Eligibility criteria for this analysis were selected to emulate the population that would be recruited for a randomized trial of anticoagulation strategies during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients were excluded if they had active bleeding or thromboembolism prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation, a history of trauma or surgery in the 7 days prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation, an arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannula, or if they received greater than 48 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support at another institution INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes included bleeding and thromboembolic events, duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital survival among 55 patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Bleeding events occurred in 25 patients (45.5%), and thromboembolism occurred in eight patients (14.5%). Bleeding events were associated with longer duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (p = 0.007) and worse in-hospital survival (p = 0.02). Thromboembolic events did not appear to be associated with clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and anticoagulation, bleeding occurred more frequently than thromboembolism and was associated with worse survival. These results highlight the need for randomized trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous IV anticoagulation among patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Stokes, John W.; Gannon, Whitney D.; Sherrill, Wren H.; Armistead, Leslie B.; Bacchetta, Matthew; Rice, Todd W.; Semler, Matthew W.; Casey, Jonathan D.",Crit Care Explor,618,20

Quantitative suspension array technology (qSAT) assays based on the xMAP Luminex platform overcome the limitations of rapid diagnostic tests and ELISA with their higher precision, dynamic range, throughput, miniaturization, cost-efficacy and multiplexing capacity. We developed three qSAT assays to detect IgM, IgA and IgG to a panel of eight SARS-CoV-2 antigens including spike (S), nucleoprotein (N) and membrane (M) protein constructs. The assays were optimized to minimize processing time and maximize signal to noise ratio. We evaluated the performance of the assays using 128 plasmas obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (negative controls) and 115 plasmas from individuals with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (positive controls), of whom 8 were asymptomatic, 58 had mild symptoms and 49 were hospitalized. Pre-existing IgG antibodies recognizing N, M and S2 proteins were detected in negative controls suggestive of cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. The best performing antibody isotype/antigen signatures had specificities of 100% and sensitivities of 94.94% at ≥14 days since the onset of symptoms and 96.08% at ≥21 days since the onset of symptoms, with AUC of 0.992 and 0.999, respectively. Combining multiple antibody markers as assessed by qSAT assays has the highest efficiency, breadth and versatility to accurately detect low-level antibody responses for obtaining reliable data on prevalence of exposure to novel pathogens in a population.

Risk factors and the associated use of health services will also be analysed. METHODS: Observational, descriptive, retrospective case series study. The study was performed at two Primary Care Health Centres located in Madrid, Spain. The subjects studied were all PCR SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases older than 18 years, diagnosed from the beginning of the community transmission (March 13) until April 15, 2020. We collected sociodemographic, clinical, health service utilization and clinical course variables during the following months. All data was gathered by their own attending physician, and electronic medical records were reviewed individually. Statistical analysis: A descriptive analysis was carried out and a Poisson regression model was adjusted to study associated factors to Health Services use. RESULTS: Out of the 499 patients studied from two health centres, 55.1% were women and mean age was 58.2 (17.3). 25.1% were healthcare professionals. The most frequent symptoms recorded related to COVID-19 were cough (77.9%; CI 95% 46.5–93.4), fever (77.7%; CI95% 46.5–93.4) and dyspnoea (54.1%, CI95% 46.6–61.4). 60.7% were admitted to hospital. 64.5% first established contact with their primary care provider before going to the hospital, with a mean number of 11.4 Healthcare Providers Encounters with primary care during all the follow-up period. The number of visit-encounters with primary care was associated with being male [IRR 1.072 (1.013, 1.134)], disease severity {from mild respiratory infection [IRR 1.404 (1.095, 1.801)], up to bilateral pneumonia [IRR 1.852 (1.437,2.386)]}, and the need of a work leave [IRR 1.326 (1.244, 1.413]. CONCLUSION: Symptoms and risk factors in our case series are similar to those in other studies. There was a high number of patients with atypical unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. Care for COVID has required a high use of healthcare resources such as clinical encounters and work leaves.","Rogero-Blanco, Eloisa; González-García, Vera; García, Rodrigo Medina; Muñoz-Molina, Pilar; Machin-Hamalainen, Santiago; López-Rodríguez, Juan A.",BMC Fam Pract,618,20

Due to the restrictions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations, the educational landscape for surgical residents is rapidly changing. In addition, the time course of these changes is undefined. METHODS: We attempt to define the scope of the problem of maintaining surgical resident education while maintaining the safety of residents, educators, and patients. Within the basic framework of limiting in-person gatherings, postponing or canceling elective operations in hospitals, and limiting rotations between sites, we propose innovative solutions to maintain rigorous education. RESULTS: We propose several innovative solutions including the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing in place of in-person lectures, involving residents in telemedicine clinics, procedural simulation, and the facilitated use of surgical videos. Although there is no substitute for hands-on learning through operative experience and direct patient care, these may be ways to mitigate the loss of learning exposure during this time. CONCLUSIONS: These innovative solutions utilizing technology may help to bridge the educational gap for surgical residents during this unprecedented circumstance. The support of national organizations may be beneficial in maintaining rigorous surgical education.","Chick, Robert Connor; Clifton, Guy Travis; Peace, Kaitlin M.; Propper, Brandon W.; Hale, Diane F.; Alseidi, Adnan A.; Vreeland, Timothy J.",J Surg Educ,618,24

However data regarding the prognostic role of the LUS in nursing home residents, one of the most affected populations by COVID-19, are not still available. Design Retrospective. Settings and participants Nursing home residents, affected by COVID-19, were followed-up with a LUS from 08th April to 14th May 2020 in Chioggia, Venice. Methods COVID-19 was diagnosed through a nasopharyngeal swab. LUS results were scored using a 12-zone method. For each of the 12 zones (two posterior, two anterior, two lateral), the possible score ranged from 0 to 3 (1= presence of B lines separated, < 50% of space from the pleural line; 2= presence of B lines separated, > 50% of space from the pleural line; 3= lung thickening with tissue-like aspect). The total score ranged from 0 to 36. Mortality was assessed using administrative data. Data regarding accuracy (and related parameters) were reported. Results Over 175 nursing home residents, 48 (mean age: 84.1 years; mainly females) were affected by COVID-19. Twelve died during the follow-up period. The mean LUS score was 3. The area under the curve of LUS in predicting mortality was 0.603 (95% confidence intervals: 0.419-0.787) and increase to 0.725 (95% CIs: 0.41-0.99) after including follow-up LUS controls. Taking a LUS score > 4 as exposure variable and mortality as outcome, the sensitivity was 58.33%, specificity 63.89%, a positive likelihood ratio of 1.62 and a negative of 0.65. Conclusions and implications LUS is able to significantly predict mortality in nursing home residents affected by COVID-19, suggesting that this simple tool can be routinely used in this setting instead of more invasive techniques available only in hospital.","Veronese, Nicola; Sbrogiò, Luca Gino; Valle, Roberto; Marin, Laura; Fiore, Elena Boscolo; Tiozzo, Andrea",J Am Med Dir Assoc,618,1

Therefore, here, we evaluated whether the stoppage due to the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) lockdown influenced physical performance compared to the start of LaLiga(TM) in terms of high-intensity efforts. Using a semi-automatic, multiple-camera system, running activities during 22 matches were analyzed. We compared the first 11 matches of the season (pre-lockdown) with the 11 matches just after the restart of LaLiga™ (post-lockdown). The results showed higher (p < 0.05) performance in the pre-lockdown period compared with the post-lockdown period, including in medium-speed running (14.1–21 km/h), high-speed running (21.1–24 km/h), and sprinting speed running distances (>24 km/h). However, the number of accelerations/min and decelerations/min were significantly higher during the post-lockdown period. Therefore, we conclude that the stoppage due to the COVID-19 lockdown generated lower physical performance in the post-lockdown period compared with the pre-lockdown period, most likely due to the accumulation of matches (congested schedules).","García-Aliaga, Abraham; Marquina, Moisés; Cordón-Carmona, Antonio; Sillero-Quintana, Manuel; de la Rubia, Alfonso; Refoyo Román, Ignacio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,618,21

The Marseille-4 variant caused an epidemic that started in August and is still ongoing. Materials and methods The 1,038 SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences obtained in our laboratory by next-generation sequencing with Illumina technology were analyzed using Nextclade and nextstrain/ncov pipelines and IQ-TREE. A Marseille-4-specific qPCR assay was implemented. Demographic and clinical features were compared between patients with Marseille-4 and earlier strains. Results Marseille-4 harbors 13 hallmark mutations. One leads to S477 N substitution in the spike receptor binding domain targeted by current vaccines. Using a specific qPCR, we observed that Marseille-4 caused 12-100% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Marseille from September 2020, being involved in 2,106 diagnoses. This variant was more frequently associated with hypoxemia than clade 20A strains before May 2020. It caused re-infection in eleven patients SARS-CoV-2-diagnosed with different strains before June 2020, suggesting either short-term protective immunity or lack of cross-immunity. Discussion/conclusion Marseille-4 should be considered as a major SARS-CoV-2 variant. Its sudden appearance points toward an animal reservoir, possibly minks. The protective role of past-exposure and current vaccines against this variant should be evaluated.","Fournier, Pierre-Edouard; Colson, Philippe; Levasseur, Anthony; Devaux, Christian A.; Gautret, Philippe; Bedotto, Marielle; Delerce, Jeremy; Brechard, Ludivine; Pinault, Lucile; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Fenollar, Florence; Raoult, Didier",Int J Infect Dis,618,2

The major effect on health-care workers and the vulnerable populations they serve has been of particular concern. Near-complete lockdown has been a common strategy to reduce the spread of the pandemic in environments such as live-in care facilities. Robotics is a promising area of research that can assist in reducing the spread of covid-19, while also preventing the need for complete physical isolation. The research presented in this paper demonstrates a speech-controlled, self-sanitizing robot that enables the delivery of items from a visitor to a resident of a care facility. The system is automated to reduce the burden on facility staff, and it is controlled entirely through hands-free audio interaction in order to reduce transmission of the virus. We demonstrate an end-to-end delivery test, and an in-depth evaluation of the speech interface. We also recorded a speech dataset with two conditions: the talker wearing a face mask and the talker not wearing a face mask. We then used this dataset to evaluate the speech recognition system. This enabled us to test the effect of face masks on speech recognition interfaces in the context of autonomous systems.","Grasse, Lukas; Boutros, Sylvain J.; Tata, Matthew S.",Front Robot AI,618,23

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is also regularly used to determine the local virus production and immune effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the lower respiratory tract. However, the potential interference of those two diagnostic modalities with each other is unknown in non-human primates. The current study investigated the effect and duration of BAL on computed tomography (CT) in both healthy and experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). In addition, the effect of subsequent BALs was reviewed. Thorax CTs and BALs were obtained from four healthy animals and 11 experimentally SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. From all animals, CTs were obtained just before BAL, and 24 hours post-BAL. Additionally, from the healthy animals, CTs immediately after and four hours post-BAL were obtained. Thorax CTs were evaluated for alterations in lung density, measured in Hounsfield units, and a visual semi-quantitative scoring system. An increase in the lung density was observed on the immediately post-BAL CT but resolved within 24 hours in the healthy animals. In the infected animals, a significant difference in both the lung density and CT score was still found 24 hours after BAL. Furthermore, the differences between timepoints in CT score were increased for the second BAL. These results indicate that the effect of BAL on infected lungs is not completed within the first 24 hours. Therefore, it is of importance to acknowledge the interference between BAL and CT in rhesus macaques.","Maaskant, Annemiek; Meijer, Lisette; Bakker, Jaco; van Geest, Leo; Zijlmans, Dian G.M.; Langermans, Jan A.M.; Verschoor, Ernst J.; Stammes, Marieke A.",bioRxiv,618,13

However, reported VTE‐rates differ substantially. OBJECTIVES: We aimed at evaluating available data and estimating the prevalence of VTE in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, WHO COVID‐19 database) to identify studies reporting VTE‐rates in COVID‐19 patients. Studies with suspected high risk of bias were excluded from quantitative synthesis. Pooled outcome rates were obtained within a random effects meta‐analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed for different settings (intensive care unit (ICU) vs. non‐ICU hospitalization and screening vs. no screening) and the association of D‐dimer levels and VTE‐risk was explored. RESULTS: Eighty‐six studies (33,970 patients) were identified and 66 (28,173 patients, mean age: 62.6 years, 60% men, 20% ICU‐patients) were included in quantitative analysis. The overall VTE‐prevalence estimate was 14.1% (95%CI 11.6‐16.9), 40.3% (95%CI 27.0‐54.3) with ultrasound‐screening and 9.5% (95%CI 7.5‐11.7) without screening. Subgroup analysis revealed high heterogeneity, with a VTE‐prevalence of 7.9% (95%CI 5.1‐11.2) in non‐ICU and 22.7% (95%CI 18.1‐27.6) in ICU patients. Prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in non‐ICU and ICU patients was 3.5% (95%CI 2.2‐5.1) and 13.7% (95%CI 10.0‐17.9). Patients developing VTE had higher D‐dimer levels (weighted mean difference 3.26 µg/ml (95%CI 2.76‐3.77) than non‐VTE patients. CONCLUSION: VTE occurs in 22.7% of patients with COVID‐19 in the ICU, but VTE risk is also increased in non‐ICU hospitalized patients. Patients developing VTE had higher D‐dimer levels. Studies evaluating thromboprophylaxis strategies in patients with COVID‐19 are needed to improve prevention of VTE.","Nopp, Stephan; Moik, Florian; Jilma, Bernd; Pabinger, Ingrid; Ay, Cihan",Res Pract Thromb Haemost,618,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the imminent risk of contamination creates a logical need for self-surveillance and hygiene habits. However, this kind of information can have drastic implications for subjects with OCD, since cognitive distortions and compensatory strategies (cleansing rituals) are no longer irrational or oversized – rather, these ideas become legitimate and socially accepted, generating plausible validation for the intensification of compulsive cleaning rituals. Patients who presented remission of OCD symptoms would be more likely to have a relapse, and subclinical patients may scale up and ultimately be diagnosed with OCD due to the reinforcement of their habits, emotions and thoughts.","Ornell, Felipe; Braga, Daniela Tusi; Bavaresco, Daniela Vicente; Francke, Ingrid Davila; Scherer, Juliana Nichterwitz; von Diemen, Lisia; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,618,26

However, attempts to engage Sheds in structured health promotion programmes must respect the ethos of Sheds as highly variable, autonomous, non-structured spaces. This paper captures the key methodologies used in “Sheds for Life’ (SFL), a men’s health initiative tailored to the Shed setting. METHODS: A hybrid effectiveness-implementation study design is used to test effectiveness and implementation outcomes across multiple levels (participant, provider, organisational and systems levels). A dynamic, iterative and collaborative process seeks to address barriers and translation into the real world context. Using a community-based participatory research approach and guided by established implementation frameworks, Shed members (‘Shedders’) assume the role of key decision makers throughout the evaluation process to promote the systematic uptake of SFL across Shed settings. The protocols pertaining to the development, design and implementation of SFL and the evaluation of impact on participants’ health and wellbeing outcomes up to 12 months are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dynamic interplay between the intervention characteristics of SFL and the need to assess and understand the diverse contexts of Sheds and the wider implementation environment. A pragmatic and context-specific design is therefore favoured over a tightly controlled efficacy trial. Documenting the protocols used to evaluate and implement a complex multi-level co-developed intervention such as SFL helps to inform gender-specific, community-based men’s health promotion and translational research more broadly.

METHODS: We described a COVID-19 symptom to isolation cascade and barriers among symptomatic persons who tested polymerase chain reaction positive for severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) at a low-barrier testing site serving a low-income Latinx community in San Francisco. Steps in the cascade are defined as days from symptom onset to test, test to result, and result to counseling on self-isolation. We examined SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold (Ct) values to assess the likelihood of infectiousness on the day of testing and during missed isolation days. RESULTS: Among 145 persons, 97% were Latinx and 81% had an income of <$50( )000. The median time from symptom onset to isolation (interquartile range [IQR]) was 7 (5–10) days, leaving a median (IQR) of 3 (0–6) days of isolation. Eighty-three percent had moderate to high levels of virus (Ct <33), but by disclosure 23% were out of their isolation period. The longest intervals were symptom onset to test (median [IQR], 4 [2–9] days) and test to results notification (median [IQR], 3 [2–4] days). Access to a test site was the most common barrier to testing, and food and income loss was the most common barrier to isolation. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of the 10-day isolation period passed by the time of disclosure, and over a fifth of people were likely outside the window of infectiousness by the time they received results.

Adverse maternal exposures are associated with cognitive consequences in the offspring that are characteristics of NDDs and simultaneous neuroimmune changes that may underlie NDD risk. In both animal models and human studies the association between prenatal environmental exposure and NDD risk has been shown to be complex. Maternal overnutrition/obesity and opioid use are two different examples of complex exposure epidemics, each with their own unique comorbidities. This review will examine maternal obesity and maternal opioid use separately, illustrating the pervasive comorbidities with each exposure to argue a need for animal models of compound prenatal exposures. Many of these comorbidities can impact neuroimmune function, warranting systematic investigation of combined exposures to begin to understand this complexity. While traditional approaches in animal models have focused on modeling a single prenatal exposure or second exposure later in life, a translational approach would begin to incorporate the most prevalent co-occurring prenatal exposures. Long term follow-up in humans is extremely challenging, so animal models can provide timely insight into neurodevelopmental consequences of complex prenatal exposures. Animal models that represent this translational context of comorbid exposures behind maternal obesity or comorbid exposures behind maternal opioid use may reveal potential synergistic neuroimmune interactions that contribute to cognitive consequences and NDD risk. Finally, translational co-exposure models can identify concerning exposure combinations to guide treatment in complex cases, and identify high risk children starting in the prenatal period where early interventions improve prognosis.","Smith, Brittany L.",Brain Behav Immun Health,618,16

In this work we developed and characterized a series of new mouse monoclonal antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, with a specific clone, mBG86, targeting only SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. The monoclonal antibodies were validated in ELISA, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analyses.

Our results suggest that virtual patients with low production rates of infected cell derived IFN subsequently experienced highly inflammatory disease phenotypes, compared to those with early and robust IFN responses. In these in silico patients, the maximum concentration of IL-6 was also a major predictor of CD8(+) T cell depletion. Our analyses predicted that individuals with severe COVID-19 also have accelerated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation mediated by increased IL-6 and reduced type I IFN signalling. Together, these findings suggest biomarkers driving the development of severe COVID-19 and support early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation.","Jenner, Adrianne L.; Aogo, Rosemary A.; Alfonso, Sofia; Crowe, Vivienne; Deng, Xiaoyan; Smith, Amanda P.; Morel, Penelope A.; Davis, Courtney L.; Smith, Amber M.; Craig, Morgan",PLoS Pathog,618,1

This led to the emergence of numerous variants, some of them recently being labeled “variants of concern” (VOC), due to their potential impact on transmission, morbidity/mortality, and the evasion of neutralization by antibodies elicited by infection, vaccination, or therapeutic application. The potential to evade neutralization is the result of diversity of the target epitopes generated by the accumulation of mutations in the spike protein. While three globally recognized VOCs (Alpha or B.1.1.7, Beta or B.1.351, and Gamma or P.1) remain sensitive to neutralization albeit at reduced levels by the sera of convalescent individuals and recipients of several anti-COVID19 vaccines, the effect of spike variability is much more evident on the neutralization capacity of monoclonal antibodies. The newly recognized VOC Delta or lineage B.1.617.2, as well as locally accepted VOCs (Epsilon or B.1.427/29-US and B1.1.7 with the E484K-UK) are indicating the necessity of close monitoring of new variants on a global level.

FIP is characterized by the overexpression of an acute phase protein, the α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). In humans, AGP is a heavily glycosylated protein that undergoes several modifications of its glycan moiety during acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies. We studied the changes in AGP glycosylation in the course of FIP. Specifically, we focussed our attention on the degree of sialylation, fucosylation and branching. This study presents a purification method for feline AGP (fAGP) from serum, using an ion exchange chromatography strategy. The glycosylation pattern was analyzed in detail by means of interaction of purified fAGP with specific lectins. In particular, Sambucus nigra agglutinin I and Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectins were used to detect sialic acid residues, Aleuria aurantia lectin was used to detect l-fucose residues and Concanavalin A was used to evaluate the branching degree. By this method we showed that fAGP did not present any l-fucose residues on its surface, and that its branching degree was very low, both in normal and in pathological conditions. In contrast, during FIP disease, fAGP underwent several modifications in the sialic acid content, including decreased expression of both α(2–6)-linked and α(2–3)-linked sialic acid (76 and 44%, respectively when compared to non-pathological feline AGP).","Ceciliani, Fabrizio; Grossi, Claudia; Giordano, Alessia; Pocacqua, Vanessa; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,618,33

The aim of this study was to evaluate if non-invasive ventilatory supports can provide a good therapeutic alternative to invasive ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and a DNI. Data were collected from four centres in three European countries. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection were included. We emulated a hypothetical target trial in which outcomes were compared in patients with a DNI order treated exclusively by non-invasive respiratory support with patients who could be intubated if necessary. We set up a propensity score and an inverse probability of treatment weighting to remove confounding by indication. Four-hundred patients were included: 270 were eligible for intubation and 130 had a DNI order. The adjusted risk ratio for death among patients eligible for intubation was 0.81 (95% CI 0.46 to 1.42).

Levels of sense of smell perception were determined when the participants detected, recognized, or identified all (normosmia), 1–3 (hyposmia), or none (anosmia) of the odorants. Associated factors of olfactory dysfunction were identified by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 95%CI). RECENT FINDINGS: Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent disorder affecting up to 20% of the general population. In addition to viral infection, including COVID-19, a number of other causes and factors may also be involved. SUMMARY: 1,956 surveys were conducted and 1,921 were analyzed. Most of the participants (62.1%) were women. The general prevalence of olfactory dysfunction, regarding detection, was 7.2% (7.1% hyposmia, 0.1% anosmia). Age-related olfactory deterioration was observed in both sexes from the 5th decade of life (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050). Women showed better olfactory identification (OR 0.73, p = 0.0010). Obesity (OR 1.97, p = 0.0070), low educational level, bad/very bad self-perceived olfactory function (OR 2.74, p = 0.0050), olfactory loss for less than one week (OR 1.35, p = 0.0030), exposure to toxics/irritants (OR 1.31, p = 0.0030), active smoking (OR 1.58, p < 0.0010), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (OR 2.68, 95%CI 1.74–4.10, p < 0.0001) were identified as factors associated with olfactory dysfunction. These results in a Mexican population suggest better olfactory identification (verbalization) in females. Age was a determining factor in the olfactory deterioration process and obesity and diabetes mellitus were also associated with olfactory disorders. Finally, these findings reinforce the differential diagnosis with other potential causes of sense of smell loss, during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Castillo-López, Irma Yolanda; Govea-Camacho, Luis Humberto; Rodríguez-Torres, Iván Alejandro; Recio-Macías, Denisse Alejandra; Alobid, Isam; Mullol, Joaquim",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,618,1

We examine the relationship between OUD and subsequent hospitalization, length of stay, risk for invasive ventilator dependence (IVD), and COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Multivariable logistic and exponential regression models using electronic health records data from the Cerner COVID-19 De-Identified Data Cohort from January through June 2020. FINDINGS: Out of 52,312 patients with COVID-19, 1.9% (n=1,013) had an OUD. COVID-19 patients with an OUD had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=3.44, 95% CI=2.81–4.21), maximum length of stay ([Formula: see text] =1.16, 95% CI=1.09–1.22), and odds of IVD (aOR=1.26, 95% CI=1.06–1.49) than patients without an OUD, but did not differ with respect to COVID-19 mortality. However, OUD patients under age 45 exhibited greater COVID-19 mortality (aOR=3.23, 95% CI=1.59–6.56) compared to patients under age 45 without an OUD. OUD patients using opioid agonist treatment (OAT) exhibited higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=5.14, 95% CI=2.75–10.60) and higher maximum length of stay ([Formula: see text] =1.22, 95% CI=1.01–1.48) than patients without OUDs; however, risk for IVD and COVID-19 mortality did not differ. OUD patients using naltrexone had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=32.19, 95% CI=4.29–4,119.83), higher maximum length of stay ([Formula: see text] =1.59, 95% CI=1.06–2.38), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=3.15, 95% CI=1.04–9.51) than patients without OUDs, but mortality did not differ. OUD patients who did not use treatment medication had higher odds of hospitalization (aOR=4.05, 95% CI=3.32–4.98), higher maximum length of stay ([Formula: see text] =1.14, 95% CI=1.08–1.21), and higher odds of IVD (aOR=1.25, 95% CI=1.04–1.50) and COVID-19 mortality (aOR=1.31, 95% CI=1.07–1.61) than patients without OUDs.

Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. METHODS: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage. RESULTS: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9–17.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the <1 year and 1–3 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0–7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8–2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4–6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8–10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5–9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing’s disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. DISCUSSION: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds. The information from this study could enable the creation of strategies for preventing diseases and enable the identification of health problems for more effective disease management in companion dogs.","Kim, Eunju; Choe, Changyong; Yoo, Jae Gyu; Oh, Sang-Ik; Jung, Younghun; Cho, Ara; Kim, Suhee; Do, Yoon Jung",PeerJ,618,23

The agent is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented single-stranded negative-sense genome. The viral genome encodes 8 structural and 2 non-structural proteins. Important structural proteins include the fusion (F) protein and the attachment (G) protein which are essential for viral penetration and attachment to the host cells. Both proteins are important in development of immune responses. The virus is estimated to cause 3000 to 4000 deaths annually. Primary infections are as a rule symptomatic. The spectrum of clinical manifestations ranges from mild upper tract illness, infection in middle ear which progresses to acute otitis media, croup, to apnoea in premature infants, pneumonia and bronchiolitis. Premature babies born at 30–35 weeks of gestation, infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease, HIV-infected subjects, and patients on intensive immunosuppressive therapy especially after bone marrow transplant are considered to be at risk for increased mortality and morbidity during RSV infection. The virus does not normally replicate outside of the bronchopulmonary tree and the infection is exquisitely restricted to the respiratory mucosa. However, development of extrapulmonary disease has been observed in certain T and B cell immunodeficiency states. The association of RSV with asthma and reversible reactive airway disease in early childhood has attracted significant attention. Recurrent wheezing for up to 5 to 7 years of age and established airway disease has been observed in a significant number of children with a strong family history of allergy, after primary infection or reinfection with RSV. Immune response to primary infection is relatively small but on reinfection, a significant booster effect with sustained immunologic reactivity is observed in serum and respiratory mucosa. Both CD4- and CD8-specific as well as Th1- and Th2-cell specific immune responses have been observed during human infection. In addition, proinflammatory as well as immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines are induced in the respiratory tract after natural and induced (in vitro) infection. Significant progress has been made in understanding the role of Th1 vs. Th2, IgE, viral induced cytokines and chemokines in the mechanisms of pathogenesis of the disease, development of wheezing and in the prevention and treatment of the infection and its sequelae. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the commonest human viral infections, and virtually every child is infected by the third birthday. Because of its restricted mucosal immunopathology, and frequent association with bronchial hyperreactivity and development of wheezing, RSV has served as an important model to investigate mechanisms of mucosal immune responses and development of mucosal disease following infection. The importance of RSV in bronchopulmonary disease and development of bronchial hyperreactivity has been the focus of several recent symposia [Kimpen JL, Simoes EAF. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2001; 163:S1–S6]. This brief report will only summarise, based on selected references, the historical landmarks of its discovery and current understanding of the mechanisms of immunity, and their possible role in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary disease.","Ogra, Pearay L.",Paediatric Respiratory Reviews,618,16

Local Shelter-in-Place Orders and Coronavirus Case Growth,17.16962,4.6865654,2020-11-06,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) will be key players in any response to pandemic influenza, and will be in the front line of exposure to infection. Responding effectively to a pandemic relies on the majority of medical, nursing, laboratory and hotel services staff continuing to work normally. Planning assumes that during a pandemic normal healthcare service levels will be provided, although it anticipates that as caseloads increase only essential care will be provided. The ability of the NHS to provide expected service levels is entirely dependent upon HCWs continuing to work as normal. METHODS/DESIGN: This study is designed as a two-phase multi-method study, incorporating focus groups and a questionnaire survey. In phase one, qualitative methods will be used to collect the views of a purposive sample of HCWs, to determine the range of factors associated with their responses to the prospect of working through pandemic influenza. In phase two, the findings from the focus groups, combined with the available literature, will be used to inform the design of a survey to determine the generalisability of these factors, enabling the estimation of the likely proportion of HCWs affected by each factor, and how likely it is that they would be willing and/or able to continue to work during an influenza pandemic. DISCUSSION: There are potentially greater than normal health risks for some healthcare workers working during a pandemic, and these workers may be concerned about infecting family members/friends. HCWs will be as liable as other workers to care for sick family members and friends. It is vital to have information about how motivated HCWs will be to continue to work during such a crisis, and what factors might influence their decision to work/not to work. Through the identification and subsequent management of these factors it may be possible to implement strategies that will alleviate the concerns and fears of HCWs and remove potential barriers to working.","Draper, Heather; Wilson, Sue; Ives, Jonathan; Gratus, Christine; Greenfield, Sheila; Parry, Jayne; Petts, Judith; Sorell, Tom",BMC Public Health,618,12

If citizens are informed about their government’s efforts to combat these diseases, will they reward incumbents who have performed well and punish those who have done poorly at this task? Electoral sanctioning requires that combatting disease be a sufficiently salient concern, which, in turn, is likely to depend upon subjective perceptions of the risks posed by particular illnesses. Epidemics typically prompt stronger risk perceptions than endemic diseases, but where both types circulate jointly, the more familiar endemic disease may determine public reactions. The salience of health threats also varies among individuals; those with a self-interest in prevention or a personal connection to the effects of mosquito-borne illnesses may react more strongly. This study presents the results of a face-to-face survey experiment in Pernambuco, Brazil, informing subjects about their mayor’s use of federal funds to combat mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue (an endemic disease) and Zika and chikungunya (both epidemics). We examine the effect of this information on intended vote for the mayor’s reelection. For the full sample, the treatment has no significant effect. However, we find a large and significant punishment effect among voters who know someone affected by microcephaly or the Zika virus. Drawing on survey and focus group evidence, we argue that most voters fail to act upon our treatment information because mosquito control is a low-salience concern primarily associated with endemic rather than epidemic diseases. Our study constitutes the first experimental evidence as to whether informing citizens about government public health efforts affects voting behavior. Our results suggests that, where similar epidemic and endemic diseases circulate together, informational campaigns aiming to induce electoral accountability should also seek to boost the salience of the information by educating the public about the difference between familiar and newer threats.","Boas, Taylor C.; Hidalgo, F.

It is characterised by a state of persistent fever, inflammation and organ dysfunction following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. It shares similar clinical features to Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and macrophage activation syndrome. Like adult COVID-19 infection, profound inflammatory response significantly increases the risk of thromboembolism, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. In this review we share our experience, observation and prevention strategy with regard to thromboembolism in PIMS-TS. Method: Between the period of 14th March 2020 to 31st May 2020, Evelina London Children's Hospital admitted 68 patients with PIMS-TS from the South Thames Network. Patients were broadly treated with a combination of high dose aspirin and immunomodulation in the initial period. Realising its pro-thrombotic potential, from 1st May 2020, treatment strategy was changed to incorporate prophylactic subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (dalteparin 100units/kg once daily) in combination with low dose aspirin (5mg/kg once daily, maximum 75mg) when a working diagnosis of PIMS-TS was made. We retrospectively collected data to understand the prevalence and pattern of thromboembolism in this cohort of patients. Results: Five patients (7.4%) developed thromboembolic complications during their acute illness with 6 recorded events overall. (Table 1) Three events happened without prophylactic anticoagulation cover. Four (5.9%) were cardiovascular/arterial events and 2 (2.9%) were venous thromboembolism. Those who required ventilation support and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were associated with higher thrombotic rate using 2-tailed Fisher's exact test (ventilation: p=0.02; ECMO: p=0.004). One ischaemic cerebrovascular event resulted in death. Two bleeding events were recorded whilst on anticoagulation. One was iatrogenic following arterial line insertion and another a haemorrhagic transformation from an ischaemic stroke. Coagulation markers (fibrinogen and D-dimer) followed the overall pattern observed in inflammatory markers (ferritin and C-reactive protein) on admission, at peak values and at 2-week follow up, suggesting a connection between the degree of inflammation and hypercoagulability and inferring immunothrombosis. (Table 2) Peak ferritin and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the group with thromboembolism using 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test (ferritin: p=0.038; D-dimer: p=0.034). Conclusion: Thromboembolism needs to be considered as a significant complication in patients with a diagnosis of PIMS-TS. We observed more cardiovascular/arterial events than venous events, which coincided with the fact that PIMS-TS patients commonly develop cardiac involvement and coronary abnormalities. In addition to rapid correction of hyper-inflammatory state using immunomodulation, we suggest the consideration of low dose aspirin (5mg/kg once daily, maximum 75mg) and prophylactic dalteparin (100units/kg once daily) to prevent both arterial and venous thrombosis after careful individual assessment and exclusion of co-existing factors that can cause increased bleeding risk. This may be especially relevant in those with already raised ferritin and D-dimer levels on admission.

This study aimed to determine the bioactive contents of Auricularia auricular-judae mushroom and evaluate the antimicrobial potential of its protein extract against some selected human bacterial and fungal pathogens which could serve as a lead to the discovery of new antimicrobial agents. METHODS: The constituents of the A. auricular-judae were evaluated by standard phytochemical analysis methods. The agar well diffusion, micro-broth dilution, and time-kill kinetic assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, yeast (Candida albicans), and dermatophytic pathogens. RESULTS: The preliminary phytochemical analysis of the extracts revealed the presence of carbohydrate (43.15%; 38.30%) proteins (23.75%; 23.75%), flavonoids (1.20%; 0.80%), alkaloids (0.60%; 1.00%), Saponin (6.00%; 2.40% ), Tannin (1.65%; 1.57%), Cyanide (0.24%; 0.40%), Ash (12.40%; 10.40%), moisture (6.00%;6.00%), lipids( 6.00%;6.00%), and fiber (8.70%; 6.45%) for the Tris buffer and warm aqueous extracts, respectively. The Tris and warm aqueous protein extracts showed antimicrobial effects toward all the human bacterial pathogens and two fungal isolates.

This study aimed to examine the adjusted risk of COVID-19 related hospitalsation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality in patients with vs. without asthma or COPD. Methods: A systematic review of major databases was undertaken for studies published between 1/12/2019 and 19/4/2021. Studies reporting the adjusted (for one or more confounder) risks of either hospitalsation, ICU admission, or mortality in asthmatics or COPD patients (control group = no asthma or no COPD) were identified. Risk of bias was determined via the QUIPS tool. A random effect meta-analysis was undertaken. Findings: 37 studies were eligible for analysis, with a total of 1,678,992 participants. The pooled ORs of COVID-19 hospitalsation in subjects with asthma and COPD was 0.91 (95% CI 0.76–1.09) and 1.37 (95% CI 1.29–1.46), respectively. For ICU admission, OR in subjects with asthma and COPD was 0.89 (95% CI 0.74–1.07) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.04–1.42), respectively. For mortality, ORs were 0.88 (95% CI 0.77–1.01) and 1.25 (95% CI 1.08–1.34) for asthma and COPD, respectively. Further, the pooled risk of mortality as measured via Cox regression was 0.93 (95% CI 0.87–1.00) for asthma and 1.30 (95% CI 1.17–1.44) for COPD. All of these findings were of a moderate level of certainty. Interpretation: COPD was significantly associated with COVID-19 related hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality. Asthma was not associated with negative COVID-19 related health outcomes. Individuals with COPD should take precautions to limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure to negate these potential outcomes. Limitations include differing population types and adjustment for differing cofounding variables. Practitioners should note these findings when dealing with patients with these comorbidities.

Currently available PEDV vaccine strains have limited protective effects against PEDV variant strains. METHODS: In this study, the highly virulent epidemic virus strain CT was serially passaged in Vero cells for up to 120 generations (P120). Characterization of the different passages revealed that compared with P10 and P64, P120 had a higher viral titer and more obvious cytopathic effects, thereby demonstrating better cell adaptability. RESULTS: Pathogenicity experiments using P120 in piglets revealed significant reductions in clinical symptoms, histopathological lesions, and intestinal PEDV antigen distribution; the piglet survival rate in the P120 group was 100%. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing identified 13 amino acid changes in P120, which might be responsible for the attenuated virulence of P120. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, an attenuated strain was obtained via cell passaging and that this strain could be used in preparing attenuated vaccines.","Wu, Yu; Li, Wei; Zhou, Qingfeng; Li, Qunhui; Xu, Zhichao; Shen, Hanqin; Chen, Feng",Virol J,618,2

It is a low grade pathogen, present almost world-wide in a number of serotypes varying in their virulence and tissue tropism, which may allow for serotype specific vaccine targeting. PAdV is species specific having only been isolated from swine, reducing the possibility of its spread to other animals or man following administration. When engineered to contain a foreign gene, recombinant PAdV (rPAdV) can be grown to high titres in tissue culture cells making it cheap to produce. Knowledge of the complete nucleotide sequence of the PAdV genome has enabled rationally directed insertions of foreign genes which remain stably inserted in the genome and can be expressed at high levels following delivery to the target host. Importantly, recombinant PAdV can be administered by injection or by the oral route in feed or drinking water. We have delivered a range of antigens and immunomodulatory molecules to commercially available pigs using rPAdV and found it to be a very effective delivery system. Significantly, recombinant PAdV serotype 3 is highly effective as a delivery vehicle even when administered in the face of high levels of artificially induced serotype specific neutralising antibody to the vector.","Hammond, Jef M.; Johnson, Michael A.",Vet J,618,28

These senescent cells showed increased viral entry/binding, gene/protein expression, and dsRNA replication. The use of a replicon system showed that pharmacologically induced senescence did not enhance the effects on viral protein translation. By examining viral receptor expression, we found increased expression of CD209 (DC-SIGN) in the senescent cells. Interleukin (IL)-10 was aberrantly produced at high levels by the senescent cells, and the expression of the DENV receptor DC-SIGN was increased in these senescent cells, partially via IL-10-mediated regulation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.

METHODS: Prospective comparison of surgical cases during the pandemic from December 2019 to May 2020 to the correlating time frame from December 2018 to May 2019. RESULTS: A significant decline in case volume was not appreciated until the United States declared a national state of emergency, allowing patients with cancer to continue to undergo curative tumor resection until then (428.3 ± 51.5 vs 166.6 ± 59.8 cases/week; P < .001). The decrease was consistent with the mean case volume during the holidays (213.8 ± 76.8 vs 166.6 ± 59.8 case/week; P = .648). Evaluation of surgical subspecialties demonstrated a significant decrease for all subspecialties with the greatest decline in sarcoma (P = .002) and endocrine (P = .001) surgeries, while vascular (P = .004) and thoracic (P = .011) surgeries had the least.

SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins. S1 and RBD-based EIA results had a strong correlation with microneutralization test (MNT) results. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that a combination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD and N proteins and analysis of sera in IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes provide an excellent basis for specific and sensitive serological diagnostics of COVID-19.","Jalkanen, Pinja; Pasternack, Arja; Maljanen, Sari; Melén, Krister; Kolehmainen, Pekka; Huttunen, Moona; Lundberg, Rickard; Tripathi, Lav; Khan, Hira; Ritvos, Mikael A; Naves, Rauno; Haveri, Anu; Österlund, Pamela; Kuivanen, Suvi; Jääskeläinen, Anne J; Kurkela, Satu; Lappalainen, Maija; Rantasärkkä, Kaisa; Vuorinen, Tytti; Hytönen, Jukka; Waris, Matti; Tauriainen, Sisko; Ritvos, Olli; Kakkola, Laura; Julkunen, Ilkka",J Infect Dis,618,20

Italy is one of the European countries most affected by the COVID-19 disease, and it has registered high COVID-19 death rates and the death toll. In this article, we analyzed different Italian COVID-19 data at the regional level for the period February 24 to March 29, 2020. The analysis pipeline includes the following steps. After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices (reported in Supplementary file). Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behaviour. Then, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behaviour. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e. how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","Milano, M.; Cannataro, M.",,618,16

Instead, policymakers have prioritised rapid action in response to the pandemic emergency, with no assessment of value for money. As COVID-19 vaccination coverage increases and healthcare systems begin to recover, HTA agencies will be expected to assess technologies for COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the key challenges when assessing therapeutic and diagnostic technologies for COVID-19, from the perspective of HTA agencies, and identify whether there is a case for novel HTA methods and/or processes to address them. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods approach, by conducting an online survey of HTA agencies, to collect data about the challenges faced when assessing or planning to assess diagnostic and therapeutic technologies for COVID-19. The online survey was followed by a ‘roundtable’ workshop of HTA agencies’ representatives to discuss the results and to elaborate on their responses. RESULTS: We received 21 completed surveys (response rate of 45%) and 11 of the respondents joined the roundtable discussion. Five themes emerged from the responses: assessing clinical effectiveness (44%), assessing cost effectiveness (19%), practical (19%), political (11%), and decision making (11%) challenges. At the roundtable, attendees elaborated on the challenges and identified two additional themes: how HTA agencies have responded to the pandemic to date, and how their role might change over time. CONCLUSION: HTA agencies face both methodological and logistical challenges when assessing or planning to assess technologies for COVID-19. An interim best-practice HTA framework to address the key challenges would be valuable.

MR-proADM, as a surrogate of adrenomedullin system dysruption leading to endothelial damage, has been reported as a promising biomarker for short-term prognosis. We evaluated the role of MR-proADM in the mid-term mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Prospective, observational study enrolling COVID-19 patients from August to October 2020. A blood sample for laboratory test analysis was drawn on arrival to emergency department. The primary endpoint was 90-day mortality. Area under the curve (AUC) and Cox regression analysis were used to assess its discriminatory ability and association with the endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 359 patients were enrolled and 90-day mortality rate was 8.9%. ROC AUC for MR-proADM predicting 90-day mortality was 0.832. An optimal cut-off of 0.80 nmol/L showed a sensitivity of 96.9% and a specificity of 58.4%, with a negative predictive value of 99.5%. Circulating MR-proADM levels (inverse transformed), after adjusting by a propensity score including 11 potential confounders, were a independent predictor of 90-day mortality (HR: 0.162 [95% CI: 0.043-0.480]) CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirms that MR-proADM has a role for mid-term prognosis of COVID-19 patients and might assist to physicians for risk stratification.","de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis García; Martínez, Monica Martínez; Mulero, María Dolores Rodríguez; Torrella, Patricia Esteban; Olivo, Marta Hernández; García, María José Alcaraz; Campos-Rodríguez, Valerio; Sancho-Rodríguez, Natalia; Martínez, María Galindo; Alcaraz, Antonia; Braquehais, María Salome Ros; Perez-Crespo, Carlos Báguena; Arenas, Verónica Ramos; Jiménez, Cristina Tomás; Consuegra-Sánchez, Luciano; Conesa-Hernandez, Andrés; Piñera-Salmerón, Pascual; Bernal-Morell, Enrique",Int J Infect Dis,618,20

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of statins on COVID-19 severity for people who have been taking statins before COVID-19 infection. The examined research patients include people that had taken three types of statins consisting of Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, and Rosuvastatin. The case study includes 561 patients admitted to the Razi Hospital in Ghaemshahr, Iran, during February and March 2020. The illness severity was encoded based on the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic pressure, and diastolic pressure in five categories: mild, medium, severe, critical, and death. Since 69.23% of participants were in mild severity condition, the results showed the positive effect of Simvastatin on COVID-19 severity for people that take Simvastatin before being infected by the COVID-19 virus. Also, systolic pressure for this case study is 137.31, which is higher than that of the total patients. Another result of this study is that Simvastatin takers have an average of 95.77 mmHg O(2)Sat; however, the O(2)Sat is 92.42, which is medium severity for evaluating the entire case study. In the rest of this paper, we used machine learning approaches to diagnose COVID-19 patients' severity based on clinical features. Results indicated that the decision tree method could predict patients' illness severity with 87.9% accuracy. Other methods, including the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, support vector machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes classifier, and discriminant analysis, showed accuracy levels of 80%, 68.8%, 61.1%, and 85.1%, respectively.","Davoudi, Alireza; Ahmadi, Mohsen; Sharifi, Abbas; Hassantabar, Roshina; Najafi, Narges; Tayebi, Atefeh; Kasgari, Hamideh Abbaspour; Ahmadi, Fatemeh; Rabiee, Marzieh",Biomed Res Int,618,16

METHODS: We compared antigen testing, PCR testing, and clinical judgment alone for diagnosing symptomatic COVID-19 in an outpatient setting (10% COVID-19 prevalence among the patients tested, 3-day PCR turnaround) and a hospital setting (40% prevalence, 24-hour PCR turnaround). We simulated transmission from cases and contacts, and relationships between time, viral burden, transmission, and case detection. We compared diagnostic approaches using a measure of net benefit that incorporated both clinical and public health benefits and harms of the intervention. RESULTS: In the outpatient setting, we estimated that using antigen testing instead of PCR to test 200 individuals could be equivalent to preventing all symptomatic transmission from one person with COVID-19 (one “transmission-equivalent”). In a hospital, net benefit analysis favored PCR and testing 25 patients with PCR instead of antigen testing achieved one transmission-equivalent of benefit. In both settings, antigen testing was preferable to PCR if PCR turnaround time exceeded 2 days. Both tests provided greater net benefit than management based on clinical judgment alone unless intervention carried minimal harm and was provided equally regardless of diagnostic approach. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19, we estimated that the speed of diagnosis with antigen testing is likely to outweigh its lower accuracy compared with PCR, wherever PCR turnaround time is 2 days or longer. This advantage may be even greater if antigen tests are also less expensive.","Kendall, Emily A.; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Sacks, Jilian A.; Manabe, Yukari C.; Dittrich, Sabine; Schumacher, Samuel G.; Dowdy, David W.",Epidemiology,618,23

The impacts of political ideology, environmental value, and belief in climate science on message effect are also examined. Based on the results of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression, we found that compared with the economy frame, the public health frame led to greater polarization in risk perception and policy support between liberals and conservatives, and these relationships were mediated by environmental value and belief in climate science.

In addition, dentists and dental staff after working for hours need to hydrate or eat. Removing the mask makes them vulnerable to the risk of contamination. For those cases, a prophylactic decontamination protocol could be useful as an adjunct to the most recommended biosecurity protocols. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the published evidence about the use of povidone–iodine (PVP-I) against SARS-CoV-2 and to propose a prophylactic protocol for dental attention using PVP-I during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search in Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Scielo databases was performed up to July 24, 2020, to identify relevant literature focusing on Povidone Iodine, SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS-COV, MERS, antiviral mouthwashes, and oral cavity. RESULTS: Clinical studies on the virucidal effectiveness of PVP-I against SARS‐CoV‐2 have not yet been reported. We identify a recent in vitro study showing PVP-I effectiveness at 0.5, 1, and 1.5% within 15s of contact. Moreover, another in vitro study has shown ≥99.99% virucidal activity as 1% mouthwash and 0.45% throat spray. The only study in SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patients reported a significant 3h drop in viral load after rinsing with 15 mL of 1% PVP-I for 1min. CONCLUSIONS: Although no clinical trials have reported the efficacy of PVP-I on SARS-CoV-2, recent studies in patients with positive PCR to SARS-CoV-2 found a significant 3-h drop in viral load. We believe that an oral prophylactic protocol with PVP-I for dental healthcare workers and patients as an adjunct to the current biosecurity protocol could minimize the transmission risk during COVID-19 pandemic.","Castro-Ruiz, Carmen; Vergara-Buenaventura, Andrea",J Int Soc Prev Community Dent,618,27

In Australia, nationwide restrictions included staying at home, unless seeking medical care, providing care, purchasing food, undertaking exercise, or attending work in an essential service. All undergraduate university classes transitioned to online, mostly home-based learning. This disruption to daily life may have consequences for eating and physical activity patterns. Methods: In this observational study, we examined the effect of isolation measures, during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (March/April), on diet (24-hour diet recall, ASA-24) and physical activity (Active Australia Survey) patterns among third-year biomedical students in Brisbane, Australia. Findings were compared to students enrolled in the same course in the previous two years. Results: In females, energy intake was ~20% greater in 2020 compared with 2018 and 2019, and the frequency of snacking and energy density of consumed snacks were also increased. In males, there was no difference in energy intake or snacking behaviour. Physical activity was impacted for both sexes, whereby fewer students undertook any walking activity and, of those that did, time spent doing so was less compared with 2018 and 2019. The proportion of students reporting any vigorous activity was not different for males or females but, among males who participated in this level of activity, the duration was less in 2020 compared with previous years. The proportion of male and female students achieving sufficient levels of activity, defined by at least 150 mins over at least 5 sessions, was ~30% less in 2020. Indeed, the majority of students reported as having undertaken less physical activity than usual. Conclusions: Increased energy intake for females and reduced physical activity for males and females demonstrate impacts of isolation measures that may have deleterious consequences for physical and mental wellbeing, with the potential to affect long-term nutrition and activity patterns.","Gallo, L.

Understanding the trend of COVID-19 is crucial to establishing the appropriate precautionary measures to mitigate the epidemic spread. The aim of this paper was to modifying and enhancing the mathematical modeling to guide health authority and assist in an early assessment of the epidemic outbreak and can be utilised to monitor non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Both ARIMA model and Logistic growth model were developed to study the trend and to provide short and long-term forecasting of the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and dynamics. The data analyzed in this study covered the period between 2nd March and 21st June 2020. Two different scenarios were developed to predict the epidemic fluctuating trends and dynamics. The first scenario covered the period between 2nd March and 28th May when the first peak was observed and immediately declined. The analysis projected that the COVID-19 epidemic to reach a peak by 17th May with a total number of 58,534 infected cases and to end on the 4th August, if lockdown were not interrupted and folks followed the recommended personal and social safety guidelines. The second scenario was simulated because of the sudden sharp spike witnessed in the trend of the new confirmed cases on the last week of May and continue to escalate till the time of current writing-21st June. In the 2nd scenario, the analysis estimated the epidemic to peak on 15th June with a total number of 146,004 infected cases and to end on 29th September, 2020 with a final size of 209,607 (185,757 to 244,310) infected cases, assuming that the NPIs will be maintained while new normal life is resumed carefully. ARIMA and Logistic growth models showed excellent performance in projecting the epidemic prevalence, trends and dynamics at different phases. In conclusion, the analysis presented in this paper will assist policy-makers and health care authorities to evaluate the effect of the NPIs applied and to size the resources needed to manage different phases and cope with the final size of the epidemic estimates and to impose extra precautions.","Elhassan, T.; Gaafar, A.",,618,29

We compared the reactivity of T cells to ZIKV peptides in convalescent mothers infected during pregnancy. The child’s clinical outcome (i.e., born with or without CZS) was taken to be the variable. The cells were stimulated in vitro with ZIKV peptides and evaluated using the ELISPOT and flow cytometry assays. After in vitro stimulation with ZIKV peptides, we observed a tendency toward a higher Interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-producing T cell responses in mothers who had asymptomatic children and a higher CD107a expression in T cells in mothers who had children with CZS. We found a higher frequency of T cells expressing CD107a+ and co-expressing CX3CR1+CCR5+, which is much clearer in the T cells of mothers who had CZS children.

METHODS: During the pandemic, 80 participants (25 patients with small fibre neuropathy (SFN), 42 patients with chronic migraine (CM) and 13 patients’ healthy family members (HFM)) were asked to evaluate their COVID-19 complains, changes in habits and clinical management, behaviour, mood, loneliness, quality of life (QoL), physical and mental health and coping strategies. Data were analysed by Spearman rho correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Patients had lower QoL, lower physical health and higher catastrophizing attitude towards pain than HFM. During the pandemic, SFN patients referred greater decline in clinical symptoms, worries about contagion and discomfort for disease management changes than CM patients. In the SFN group, the higher levels of disability were associated with suffering from changes in neurologist-patient relationship. CM patients complained of agitation/anxiety that was related to feelings of loneliness, depressive mood and catastrophism. DISCUSSION: Despite similar complains of change in habits and worries about COVID-19 pandemic, SFN and CM patients had distinct reactions. In SFN patients, pandemic distress impacted on physical health with worsening of clinical conditions, especially suffering from changes in their care. In CM patients, pandemic distress affected behaviour, mainly with psychological frailty. This suggests the need to customize public health care for patients with distinct chronic pain conditions.","Consonni, Monica; Telesca, Alessandra; Grazzi, Licia; Cazzato, Daniele; Lauria, Giuseppe",Neurol Sci,618,20

In March 2020, our institution adopted the ESMO expert consensus guidelines for radiotherapy management of rectal cancer during the pandemic. Here we present short-term oncological outcomes of this approach compared to the same period in 2018. Methods: Patients who underwent neoadjuvant (chemo) radiotherapy for rectal cancer between 1st March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were identified from a research ethics committee (REC)-approved research database for cancer patients (Guy’s Cancer Cohort). Patient demographics and treatment characteristics were extracted and compared with a control cohort treated in the same period in 2018. The definition of local response was based on identification of downstaging on re-staging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) post neoadjuvant treatment (mrT3c/d-4 to mrT0-2 and mrT2 to mrT0-1) and classified in a binary format (response vs no response). In addition, in patients who underwent total mesorectal excision (TME), neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score was calculated, as described previously, and classified into low (&lt;8), intermediate (&gt;=8&lt;=16) and high (&gt;16). The frequency of MRI and pathological response was compared using non-parametric Fisher exact test. Results: Thirty patients were treated in the three-month period in 2020 as compared with 21 in 2018 (43% increase). No statistically significant differences were observed in baseline tumour characteristics. The use of neoadjuvant short-course radiotherapy (SCRT) treatment increased significantly from 19% of cases in 2018 to 50% during the pandemic, which was reflected in reduced radiotherapy-related hospital footfall (median 15 appointments in 2020 vs 25 appointments in 2018). While the use of concomitant fluoropyrimidines was lower (47 vs 71%), the use of induction chemotherapy was higher (30 vs 19%) in 2020 compared to 2018, which may reflect more prevalent use of total neoadjuvant treatment. There was no difference in the proportion of MRI responders between cohorts (52% in 2020 vs 38% in 2018). In patients who underwent TME, there was no difference in the proportion of R1 resection (0 in 2020 vs 9% in 2018), median NAR scores (8 (1-30) in 2020 v 15 (range 4-50) in 2018) or NAR score categories (22% good responders, 64% intermediate and 14% non-responders during Covid-19 vs 9% good responders, 55% intermediate and 36% non-responders in 2018). Conclusions: Changes in radiotherapy treatment of rectal cancer during Covid-19 pandemic, including more frequent use of SCRT (often in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy), did not seem to have negatively impacted short-term oncological outcomes, as measured by MRI downstaging rates and NAR scores following TME. The effect of the pandemic on medium and long-term oncological outcomes is still awaited. Legal entity responsible for the study: The author.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, generally lacked quantitative measurements, and were mostly restricted to data from single countries. Here, we report the development, implementation and initial results of a multi-lingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in three distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, 8 other, ages 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change {+/-}100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7{+/-}28.7, mean{+/-}SD), taste (-69.0{+/-}32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3{+/-}36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell, but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.","Parma, V.; Ohla, K.; Veldhuizen, M. G.; Nim, M.

One primary research focus area is the identification of bio-markers that not only identify stress but also predict the conditions (or tasks) that cause stress. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) have been used for a long time to study and identify bio-markers. While these bio-markers have successfully predicted stress in EEG studies for binary conditions, their performance is suboptimal for multiple conditions of stress. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we propose using latent based representations of the bio-markers, which have been shown to significantly improve EEG performance compared to traditional bio-markers alone. We evaluated three commonly used EEG based bio-markers for stress, the brain load index (BLI), the spectral power values of EEG frequency bands (alpha, beta and theta), and the relative gamma (RG), with their respective latent representations using four commonly used classifiers. Results: The results show that spectral power value based bio-markers had a high performance with an accuracy of 83%, while the respective latent representations had an accuracy of 91%.",,IEEE J Transl Eng Health Med,618,28

The present study aimed to evaluate the rhythm disruptions of life, work, and entertainment, and their associations with the psychological impacts during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted from the 10(th) to 17(th) March 2020 in China. A structured e-questionnaire containing general information, the Chinese version of Brief Social Rhythm Scale, and Zung’s self-rating scales of depression and anxiety (SDS and SAS) was posted and collected online through a public media (i.e. EQxiu online questionnaire platform). Scores in sleeping, getting up, and socializing (SGS) rhythm and eating, physical practice, and entertainment (EPE) rhythm were compared among and between participants with different sociodemographic backgrounds including gender, age, education, current occupation, annual income, health status, and chronic disease status. Correlations of SDS and SAS with SGS-scale and EPE-scale were also analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, 5854 participants were included. There were significant differences in the scores of SGS-scale and EPE-scale among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds. The scores were significantly higher in the groups with female gender, low education level, lower or higher than average income, poor health status, ages of 26–30 years or older than 61 years, nurses and subjects with divorce or widow status. There were also significant differences in SAS and SDS scores among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds (all P< 0.05). The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety was 24.3% and 12.6%, respectively, with nurses having the highest rates of depression (32.94%) and anxiety (18.98%) among the different occupational groups. SGS-scale was moderately correlated with SDS and SAS, and disruption of SGS rhythm was an independent risk factor for depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: Social rhythm disruption was independently associated with depression and anxiety. Interventions should be applied to people vulnerable to the rhythm disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Min; He, Ping; Xu, Xiaoming; Li, Dan; Wang, Jing; Wang, Yanjun; Wang, Bin; Wang, Wo; Zhao, Mei; Lin, Hui; Deng, Mingming; Deng, Tianwei; Kuang, Li; Chen, Dongfeng",PLoS One,618,20

Few cases of coronary stent thrombosis associated with COVID-19 have been reported. CASE SUMMARY : In this report, we describe the case of a 65-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction revealing a very late dual coronary stent thrombosis of the left anterior descending and posterior descending arteries. Ten days prior to admission, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and treated with dexamethasone, which led to rapid clinical improvement. After resuscitation, coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion in the two previous drug-eluting stents (implanted in 2010 and 2018), with a high thrombus burden. He was successfully treated by percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient did not present any further complications during his hospital stay and was transferred to a cardiac rehabilitation centre. DISCUSSION : Dual stent thrombosis is an exceptional event highlighting the high procoagulant state promoted by coronavirus 19.

We conducted a prospective evaluation that included repeated site visits and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 112 people with direct knowledge of project activities, accomplishments, failures, and challenges. Using outcome harvesting and qualitative analysis methods, we observed that over the 18-month implementation period, local advocacy efforts contributed to enhanced political will on the part of duty bearers for ensuring equitable access to HIV care, increases in the availability of affirming resources, improved access to existing resources, and changes in normative institutional practices to enable access to HIV care.

Dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, has significant protective benefits for the heart and kidney. We aimed to see whether this agent might provide organ protection in patients with COVID-19 by affecting processes dysregulated during acute illness. METHODS: DARE-19 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor (ie, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease). Patients critically ill at screening were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to dapagliflozin (10 mg daily orally) or matched placebo for 30 days. Dual primary outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population: the outcome of prevention (time to new or worsened organ dysfunction or death), and the hierarchial composite outcome of recovery (change in clinical status by day 30). Safety outcomes, in patients who received at least one study medication dose, included serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and adverse events of interest. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04350593. FINDINGS: Between April 22, 2020 and Jan 1, 2021, 1250 patients were randomly assigned with 625 in each group. The primary composite outcome of prevention showed organ dysfunction or death occurred in 70 patients (11·2%) in the dapagliflozin group, and 86 (13·8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·80, 95% CI 0·58–1·10; p=0·17). For the primary outcome of recovery, 547 patients (87·5%) in the dapagliflozin group and 532 (85·1%) in the placebo group showed clinical status improvement, although this was not statistically significant (win ratio 1·09, 95% CI 0·97–1·22; p=0·14). There were 41 deaths (6·6%) in the dapagliflozin group, and 54 (8·6%) in the placebo group (HR 0·77, 95% CI 0·52–1·16). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (10·6%) of 613 patients treated with dapagliflozin and in 82 (13·3%) of 616 patients given the placebo. INTERPRETATION: In patients with cardiometabolic risk factors who were hospitalised with COVID-19, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a statistically significant risk reduction in organ dysfunction or death, or improvement in clinical recovery, but was well tolerated.

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to July 12, 2021. RCTs comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of JAK inhibitors with a placebo or standard care in treating COVID-19 patients were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality rate at day 28. RESULTS: Three RCTs were included in this meta-analysis. The all-cause mortality rate at day 28 was lower among the patients receiving JAK inhibitors than among the controls (4.1% [28/647] versus 7.0% [48/684], OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36–0.92, I(2) = 0).

Additionally, the use of JAK inhibitors was associated with a shorter time to recovery than among the controls (MD, −2.84; 95% CI, −5.56 to −0.12; I(2) = 50%). The rate of invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was lower in the patients who used JAK inhibitors than among the controls.

Whether lasting differences exist between infection and vaccination boosted immunity is yet to be known. The answer to this question will determine key issues such as the reliability of individual and herd immunity or the need of sanitary restrictions or periodical revaccination. The aim of this study was to determine how long total anti SARS-CoV2 antibodies due to past infection persist in peripheral blood and whether sex, age or haematological features can influence their lasting. Material and Methods: A total of 2432 donations SARS-CoV-2 from 662 repeat donors from April 2020 to February 2021 were analysed. Donors were 69.7% males and their average age was 46. An automated chemilumiscence immunoassay for total antibodies recognizing N protein of SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma was performed. Results and discussion: In 97.6% donors with follow-up, anti SARS-CoV-2 protein N total antibodies remained positive up to 46 weeks after first positive determination. Blood group was not related to antibody waning. Lower lymphocyte counts and higher neutrophils and as well higher seric IgA would help predict future negativization of antibodies. The vast majority of donors keep their total immunoglobulins anti SARS-CoV-2 positive for longer than 10 months. Ageing might have a protective effect against antibody waning but, given the small number of cases that become negative, more studies, or larger cohorts would be needed to confirm these facts.","Martin, M.

AIMS: This bibliometric analysis seeks to quantify the growth, trends, and applications of technology in psychotherapeutic interventions over the last 40 years. METHODS: Searches were conducted in the Web of Science (WOS) database for all existing technology-psychotherapy-related publications from 1981 to October 2020. Search terms were refined using a systematic screening strategy, based upon Cochrane protocol, generating 52 technology terms. Analyses across 40 years and by decade from 1981 to 2020 were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 13,934 peer-reviewed articles were identified. Yearly publication rate has increased from one in 1981 to 1902 by October 2020. The growth rate of publications across decades consistently tripled in size (762.50% from the 1980s to 1990s, 539.71% from the 1990s to 2000s, and 337.24% from the 2000s to 2010s). The author, country, journal, and institution with the most publications were Andersson, G., USA, Journal of Medical Internet Research, and Karolinska Institute, respectively. The most frequent technology search term across all four decades was “internet*.” The trends in percentages of peer-reviewed publications within each decade showed: 1) a declining trend for the term “computer,” 2) an upward trend for the combined terms, “internet,” “online,” and “web,” 3) and a steady but smaller proportion of publications for other terms (“cell phone,” “phone/telephone,” “technology,” “video,” “virtual reality or VR,” “apps,” “digital,” “machine learning,” “electronic,” “robo,” and “telehealth”). DISCUSSION: The rapid growth and trends identified in technology and psychotherapy publications can inform related policies addressing the role of technology in mental health. Moreover, pattern analyses may provide direction for a standard nomenclature to address terminology usage inconsistencies across the field.","Zale, Arya; Lasecke, Meagan; Baeza-Hernandez, Katerina; Testerman, Alanna; Aghakhani, Shirin; Muñoz, Ricardo F.; Bunge, Eduardo L.",Internet Interv,618,5

Understanding the immune cell states shared between COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases with established therapies may help nominate immunomodulatory therapies. Using an integrative strategy, we built a reference by meta-analyzing > 300,000 immune cells from COVID-19 and 5 inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), lupus, and interstitial lung disease. Our cross-disease analysis revealed that an FCN1+ inflammatory macrophage state is common to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, RA synovium, CD ileum, and UC colon. We also observed that a CXCL10+ CCL2+ inflammatory macrophage state is abundant in severe COVID-19, inflamed CD and RA, and expresses inflammatory genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and IL1B. We found that the CXCL10+ CCL2+ macrophages are transcriptionally similar to blood-derived macrophages stimulated with TNF-α and IFN-γ ex vivo. Our findings suggest that IFN-γ, alongside TNF-α, might be a key driver of this abundant inflammatory macrophage phenotype in severe COVID-19 and other inflammatory diseases, which may be targeted by existing immunomodulatory therapies.","Zhang, Fan; Mears, Joseph R.; Shakib, Lorien; Beynor, Jessica I.; Shanaj, Sara; Korsunsky, Ilya; Nathan, Aparna; Donlin, Laura T.; Raychaudhuri, Soumya",bioRxiv,618,20

METHODS: In this cross‐sectional study, we studied patients with COVID‐19 who were referred to our hospital from February 16 to November 1, 2020. Patients with either a real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test that was positive for COVID‐19 or high clinical suspicion based on the World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance were enrolled. A parallel systematic review/meta‐analysis (in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 504 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients were included in this study, among which 101 (20.04%) patients died during hospitalization, and 372 (73.81%) patients were categorized as severe cases. At a multivariable level, lower PNI, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and higher D‐dimer levels were independent risk indicators of in‐hospital mortality. Additionally, patients with a history of diabetes, lower PNI, and higher LDH levels had a higher tendency to develop severe disease. The meta‐analysis indicated the PNI as an independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.80; P < .001) and disease severity (OR = 0.78; P = .009). CONCLUSION: Our results emphasized the predictive value of the PNI in the prognosis of patients with COVID‐19, necessitating the implementation of a risk stratification index based on PNI values in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.","Rashedi, Sina; Keykhaei, Mohammad; Pazoki, Marzieh; Ashraf, Haleh; Najafi, Atabak; Kafan, Samira; Peirovi, Niloufar; Najmeddin, Farhad; Jazayeri, Seyed Aboozar; Kashani, Mehdi; Moharari, Reza Shariat; Montazeri, Mahnaz",Nutr Clin Pract,618,1

An online survey was conducted between 4 March and 10 April 2021 among professional associations and providers of health and social services. Data sets of n = 3401 participants were analyzed. Of these, 62% stated that they had already been vaccinated at least once. A further 22% wanted to be vaccinated, while 6.6% were still hesitant and 9% refused to be vaccinated. Preference was given to predominantly mRNA-based vaccines. Altogether, there was a high vaccination rate and a great willingness to be vaccinated (>80%) across all professional groups and fields of work. Among nursing staff, the total figure was 83.5%. The percentage was highest in geriatric care at 87.5%.

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed clinical, epidemiological and virological data from the three patients. RT-PCR, viral culture and sequencing were conducted for determination of causative pathogen. RESULTS: The index case presented developed pneumonia with fever after exposure to chicken in a poultry farm. Case A presented pneumonia with high fever on day 3 after she shared a hospital room with the index case. Case B, the father of the index case, presented pneumonia with high fever on day 15 after he took care of the index case. H7N9 virus circulated in the local farm to which the index case was exposed. Full genomic sequence of virus showed 99.8–100% identity shared between the index case and case A or case B. Compared to the earliest virus of Anhui, a total of 29 amino acid variation sites were observed in the 8 segments.

Adjuvants that enhance and shape adaptive immune responses that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants will be pivotal for long-term protection as drift variants continue to emerge. We developed an intranasal, rationally designed adjuvant integrating a nanoemulsion (NE) that activates TLRs and NLRP3 with an RNA agonist of RIG-I (IVT DI). The combination adjuvant with spike protein antigen elicited robust responses to SARS-CoV-2 in mice, with markedly enhanced T(H)1-biased cellular responses and high virus-neutralizing antibody titers towards both homologous SARS-CoV-2 and a variant harboring the N501Y mutation shared by B1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 variants. Furthermore, passive transfer of vaccination-induced antibodies protected naive mice against heterologous viral challenge. NE/IVT DI enables mucosal vaccination, and has the potential to improve the immune profile of a variety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates to provide effective cross-protection against future drift variants.","Jangra, Sonia; Landers, Jeffrey J.; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; O’Konek, Jessica J.; Janczak, Katarzyna W.; Cascalho, Marilia; Kennedy, Andrew A.; Tai, Andrew W.; Baker, James R.; Schotsaert, Michael; Wong, Pamela T.",Front Immunol,618,17

While it remains to be formally proven, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is thought to play a positive role in the efficacy of this treatment. Indeed, neutralizing titers of ≥1:160 have been recommended in some convalescent plasma trials for inclusion. Here, we performed repeated analyses at 1-month intervals on 31 convalescent individuals to evaluate how the humoral responses against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike glycoprotein, including neutralization, evolve over time. We observed that the levels of receptor-binding-domain (RBD)-specific IgG and IgA slightly decreased between 6 and 10 weeks after the onset of symptoms but that RBD-specific IgM levels decreased much more abruptly. Similarly, we observed a significant decrease in the capacity of convalescent plasma to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing wild-type SARS-CoV-2 S or its D614G variant.

Here we compare per-patient imaging utilization, characterized by imaging studies and work relative value units (wRVUs), in an emergency department (ED) during a COVID-19 surge to the same period in 2019. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients presenting to the ED from April 1–May 1, 2020 and 2019. Patients were stratified into three primary subgroups: all patients (n = 9580, n = 5686), patients presenting with respiratory complaints (n = 1373, n = 2193), and patients presenting without respiratory complaints (n = 8207, n = 3493). The primary outcome was imaging studies/patient and wRVU/patient. Secondary analysis was by disposition and COVID status. Comparisons were via the Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-squared tests. RESULTS: The total patients, imaging exams, and wRVUs during the 2020 and 2019 periods were 5686 and 9580 (−41%), 6624 and 8765 (−24%), and 4988 and 7818 (−36%), respectively, and the percentage patients receiving any imaging was 67% and 51%, respectively (p < .0001). In 2020 there was a 170% relative increase in patients presenting with respiratory complaints. In 2020, patients without respiratory complaints generated 24% more wRVU/patient (p < .0001) and 33% more studies/patient (p < .0001), highlighted by 38% more CTs/patient.

In 2008 a coronavirus (Fr‐TCoV 080385d) was isolated in France from turkey poults exhibiting clinical signs compatible with this syndrome. In the present study, the median infectious dose (ID (50))(,) transmission kinetics and pathogenicity of Fr‐TCoV were investigated in 10‐day‐old SPF turkeys. Results revealed a titre of 10(4.88) ID (50)/ml with 1 ID (50)/ml being beyond the limit of genome detection using a well‐characterized qRT‐PCR for avian coronaviruses. Horizontal transmission of the virus via the airborne route was not observed however, via the oro‐faecal route this proved to be extremely rapid (one infectious individual infecting another every 2.5 hr) and infectious virus was excreted for at least 6 weeks in several birds. Histological examination of different zones of the intestinal tract of the Fr‐TCoV‐infected turkeys showed that the virus had a preference for the lower part of the intestinal tract with an abundance of viral antigen being present in epithelial cells of the ileum, caecum and bursa of Fabricius. Viral antigen was also detected in dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages in these areas, which may indicate a potential for Fr‐TCoV to replicate in antigen‐presenting cells. Together these results highlight the importance of good sanitary practices in turkey farms to avoid introducing minute amounts of virus that could suffice to initiate an outbreak, and the need to consider that infected individuals may still be infectious long after a clinical episode, to avoid virus dissemination through the movements of apparently recovered birds.","Brown, Paul A.; Courtillon, Céline; Weerts, Erik A.

We aimed to evaluate the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the level of preparedness among HCWs in the oPt. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire distributed through convenient sampling between March 30, 2020 and April 12, 2020. Outcomes were availability of PPE, healthcare workers (HCWs) preparedness in oPt for COVID-19 pandemic, and regional and hospital differences in oPt in terms of availability of PPE and HCWs preparedness. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were used in this study. RESULTS: Of 138 respondents, only 38 HCWs (27.5%) always had access to facemasks and 15 (10.9%) always had access to isolation gowns. Most HCWs did not find eye protection (n = 128, 92.8%), N95 respirators (n = 132, 95.7%), and face shields (n = 127, 92%) always available. Compared to HCWs in West Bank, those in the Gaza Strip were significantly less likely to have access to alcohol sanitizers (p = 0.03) and gloves (p < 0.001). On average, governmental hospitals were significantly less likely to have all appropriate PPE than non-governmental institutions (p = 0.001).

Covid‐19 became a global pandemic, which led to a harmful impact on the world. Many predictive models of Covid‐19 are being proposed by academic researchers around the world to take the foremost decisions and enforce the appropriate control measures. Due to the lack of accurate Covid‐19 records and uncertainty, the standard techniques are being failed to correctly predict the epidemic global effects. To address this issue, we present an Artificial Intelligence (AI)‐based meta‐analysis to predict the trend of epidemic Covid‐19 over the world. The powerful machine learning algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Regression were applied on real time‐series dataset, which holds the global record of confirmed, recovered, deaths and active cases of Covid‐19 outbreak. Statistical analysis has also been conducted to present various facts regarding Covid‐19 observed symptoms, a list of Top‐20 Coronavirus affected countries and a number of coactive cases over the world. Among the three machine learning techniques investigated, Naïve Bayes produced promising results to predict Covid‐19 future trends with less Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The less value of MAE and MSE strongly represent the effectiveness of the Naïve Bayes regression technique. Although, the global footprint of this pandemic is still uncertain. This study demonstrates the various trends and future growth of the global pandemic for a proactive response from the citizens and governments of countries.

Rapid antigen test could be a supplement to the standard-of-care Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT). The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the BD Veritor SARS-CoV-2 antigen test as a screening instrument in a hospital setting. METHODS A cohort of prospective samples were collected from hospital staff and patients at the Emergency, Infectious Diseases and Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine departments at Hvidovre Hospital. All samples were collected using oropharyngeal swabs, and BD Veritor Antigen test results were paired with routine NAAT test results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the antigen test were calculated using NAAT as reference. RESULTS Overall, 809 samples from 674 individuals were included (average age 45 years, range 0-98 years). Among all samples, 8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive by NAAT testing and 5.3% by BD Veritor. The sensitivity of the antigen test was 63.1% and specificity 99.7%. The positive predictive value was 95.3%. False-positive rate was 4%. The cycle threshold value was significantly higher among individuals with false negative antigen tests compared to true positives. CONCLUSION The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive values show that the BD Veritor antigen test from oropharyngeal collected specimens performs well.

Due to this high thrombotic potential, prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended in all hospitalized patients. However, the optimal dosage of anticoagulation is still debated. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of knowledge about COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and discuss clinical therapeutic consequences.","Nopp, Stephan; Ay, Cihan",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,618,24

AIMS: To investigate myopia incidence, spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and lifestyle changes among schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two separate longitudinal cohorts of children aged 6–8 years in Hong Kong were included. The COVID-19 cohort was recruited at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas the pre-COVID-19 cohort was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic. All children received ocular examinations, and answered a standardised questionnaire relating to their lifestyle, including time spent on outdoor activities and near work, both at baseline and at follow-up visits. RESULTS: A total of 1793 subjects were recruited, of whom 709 children comprised the COVID-19 cohort with 7.89±2.30 months of follow-up, and 1084 children comprised the pre-COVID-19 cohort with 37.54±3.12 months of follow-up. The overall incidence was 19.44% in the COVID-19 cohort, and 36.57% in pre-COVID-19 cohort. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the change in SER and axial length was –0.50±0.51 D and 0.29±0.35 mm, respectively; the time spent on outdoor activities decreased from 1.27±1.12 to 0.41±0.90 hours/day (p<0.001), while screen time increased from 2.45±2.32 to 6.89±4.42 hours/day (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We showed a potential increase in myopia incidence, significant decrease in outdoor time and increase in screen time among schoolchildren in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results serve to warn eye care professionals, and also policy makers, educators and parents, that collective efforts are needed to prevent childhood myopia—a potential public health crisis as a result of COVID-19.","Zhang, Xiujuan; Cheung, Stephanie S L; Chan, Hei-Nga; Zhang, Yuzhou; Wang, Yu Meng; Yip, Benjamin H; Kam, Ka Wai; Yu, Marco; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Young, Alvin L; Kwan, Mike Y W; Ip, Patrick; Chong, Kelvin Kam-Lung; Tham, Clement C; Chen, Li Jia; Pang, Chi-Pui; Yam, Jason C S",Br J Ophthalmol,618,24

However, conventional prediction models based on complex mathematical modelling rely on the estimation of model parameters, which yields unreliable and unsustainable results. Herein, we proposed a simple model for predicting the epidemic transmission dynamics based on nonlinear regression of the epidemic growth rate and iterative methods, which is applicable to the progression of the COVID-19 outbreak under the strict control measures of the Chinese government. Our model yields reliable and accurate results as confirmed by the available data: we predicted that the total number of infections in mainland China would be 91 253, and the maximum number of beds required for hospitalised patients would be 62 794. We inferred that the inflection point (when the growth rate turns from positive to negative) of the epidemic across China would be mid-February, and the end of the epidemic would be in late March. This model is expected to contribute to resource allocation and planning in the health sector while providing a theoretical basis for governments to respond to future global health crises or epidemics.","Shang, Chenjing; Yang, Yang; Chen, Gui-Ying; Shang, Xiao-Dong",Epidemiol Infect,618,16

This is less common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), including in India, where mental health is under-researched relative to its disease burden. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of two questionnaires for measuring population mental health in a mobile phone survey. We adapt the Kessler-6 screening questionnaire and the World Health Organization’s Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) for a mobile phone survey in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand and Maharashtra. The questionnaires differ in the symptoms they measure and in the number of response options offered. Questionnaires are randomly assigned to respondents. We consider a questionnaire to perform well if it identifies geographic and demographic disparities in mental health that are consistent with the literature and does not suffer from selective non-response. Both questionnaires measured less mental distress in Maharashtra than in Bihar and Jharkhand, which is consistent with Maharashtra’s higher human development indicators. The adapted SRQ, but not the adapted Kessler-6, identified women as having worse mental health than men in all three states. Conclusions about population mental health based on the adapted Kessler-6 are likely to be influenced by low response rates (about 82% across the three samples). Respondents were different from non-respondents: non-respondents were less educated and more likely to be female. The SRQ’s higher response rate (about 94% across the three states) may reflect the fact that it was developed for use in LMICs and that it focuses on physical, rather than emotional, symptoms, which may be less stigmatized.","Coffey, Diane; Hathi, Payal; Khalid, Nazar; Thorat, Amit",Health Policy Plan,618,1

Risk of severe infection and mortality increases with age, male sex, and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and chronic pulmonary disease. We review clinical and neuroradiological findings in five patients with COVID-19 who suffered severe neurological disease and illustrate the pathological findings in a 7-year-old boy with COVID-19-induced encephalopathy whose brain tissue sample showed angiocentric mixed mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate. We summarize the structural and functional properties of the virus including the molecular processes that govern the binding to its membrane receptors and cellular entry. In addition, we review clinical and experimental evidence in patients and animal models that suggests coronaviruses enter into the central nervous system (CNS), either via the olfactory bulb or through hematogenous spread. We discuss suspected pathophysiological mechanisms including direct cellular infection and associated recruitment of immune cells and neurovirulence, at least in part, mediated by cytokine secretion. Moreover, contributing to the vascular and neurological injury, coagulopathic disorders play an important pathogenic role. We survey the molecular events that contribute to the thrombotic microangiopathy. We describe the neurological complications associated with COVID-19 with a focus on the potential mechanisms of neurovascular injury.

While providing keen insights about the role of ABMs in studying urban food environments, these studies underutilize real-world data on individual behavior in their models. This study provides a unique contribution to the ABM and food access literature by utilizing survey data to develop an empirically-rich spatially-explicit ABM of food access. This model is used to simulate and scrutinize individual travel behavior associated with accessing food in low-income neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment in Detroit (Michigan), U.S. In particular, the relationship between trip frequencies, mode of travel, store choice, and distances traveled among individuals grouped into strata based on selected sociodemographic characteristics, including household income and age, is examined. Results reveal a diversified picture of not only how income and age shape food shopping travel but also the different thresholds of tolerance for non-motorized travel to stores. Younger and poorer population subgroups have a higher propensity to utilize non-motorized travel for shopping than older and wealthier subgroups. While all groups tend to travel considerable distances outside their immediate local food environment, different sociodemographic groups maintain unique spatial patterns of grocery-shopping behavior throughout the city and the suburbs. Overall, these results challenge foundational tenets in urban planning and design, regarding the specific characteristics necessary in the built environment to facilitate accessibility to urban amenities, such as grocery stores. In neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment, sociodemographic conditions play a more important role than the built environment in shaping food accessibility and ultimately travel behavior.","Vojnovic, Igor; Ligmann-Zielinska, Arika; LeDoux, Timothy F.",PLoS One,618,26

To assess the differences and dynamic changes of blood coagulation function in COVID-19 patients with different severity. A total of 261 COVID-19 patients from January 24 to March 25, 2020 in Huangshi, Hubei Province were enrolled. We designed a retrospective observational study. Clinical information, including age, blood routine and blood coagulation function, were collected. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) that issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, patients were divided into 3 subgroups: 186 ordinary, 45 severe and 30 critical ones. We compared the differences in blood coagulation factors among groups. Average age in critical group (71.47 ± 11.48 years) was the oldest of 3 subgroups. At admission, statistically differences could be observed among ordinary, severe and critical patients in D-dimer (0.18 ± 0.33, 0.63 ± 1.13 and 1.16 ± 1.58 mg/L), fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP) (3.11 ± 5.30, 9.82 ± 23.91 and 21.94 ± 40.98 μg/ml), platelet [(169 ± 62.85), (188 ± 71.56) and (117 ± 38.31) × 10(9)/L)] and lymphocyte count [(1.18 ± 0.46), (0.82 ± 0.35) and (0.75 ± 0.39) × 10(9)/L)], respectively (P < .05). During hospitalization, the peak values of coagulation and valley values of blood routine were monitored. There were significant differences among ordinary, severe and critical patients in D-dimer (0.26 ± 0.46, 1.39 ± 1.51 and 2.89 ± 1.68 mg/L), FDP (3.29 ± 5.52, 23.68 ± 39.07 and 56.11 ± 49.94 μg/ml), platelet [(164 ± 55.53), (171 ± 69.96) and (84 ± 57.80) × 10(9)/L)] and lymphocyte count [(1.10 ± 0.46), (0.65 ± 0.35) and (0.55 ± 0.31) × 10(9)/L)], respectively (P < .001). D-dimer and FDP in the course of disease in severe/critical groups showed a first upward and then downward trend. We concluded that coagulation function indexes such as D-dimer and FDP could be served as markers to estimate COVID-19 patients condition. Close monitoring of coagulation function may be helpful for early diagnosis of severe patients and guidance of treatments.","Chen, Nian; Li, Yuwen; Fan, Haozhi; Tian, Anran; Yuan, Hui; Jiang, Zhengyi; Yu, Yunxi; Ruan, Lili; Hu, Pingping; Yue, Ming; Li, Jun; Zhu, Chuanlong",Medicine (Baltimore),618,20

However, the effect of holding such beliefs is unclear. We therefore propose that these beliefs affect people differently depending on their BMI. When confronted with negative, self-related feedback, people’s coping strategies are often reflected in the ways they relate to their self. We examine three such self-to-self relations (i.e., reassured, inadequate, and hated self). Extending prior research, we predict that weight controllability beliefs are related to positive self-to-self relations for adults with a low, and to negative self-to-self relations for adults with a high BMI. Accordingly, we expected that weight controllability beliefs would be associated with defensive avoidance among people with a high, but not with a low BMI. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 348 adults who participated in an online survey. Weight controllability beliefs were associated with increased defensive avoidance in people with high BMI, and with decreased defensive avoidance in adults with a low BMI. Forms of self-to-self relating fully mediated this association, demonstrating positive effects on adults with a low, and negative effects on adults with a high BMI. Additionally, in an open ending section, we found seven social settings that deprive people from satisfying their need to belong and to be accepted due to their weight. We discuss our findings against a call for a less moralized public discourse about overweight and obesity that is particularly relevant in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Täuber, Susanne; Flint, Stuart W.; Gausel, Nicolay",Front Psychol,618,23

Studies suggest a hyperinflammatory response is a major cause of disease severity and death. Identitfying COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation may identify subgroups who could benefit from targeted immunomodulatory treatments. Analysis of cytokine levels at the point of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection can identify patients at risk of deterioration. METHODS: We used a multiplex cytokine assay to measure serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1β, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-33 and IFN-γ in 100 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 at admission to University Hospital Southampton (UK). Demographic, clinical and outcome data were collected for analysis. RESULTS: Age > 70 years was the strongest predictor of death (OR 28, 95% CI 5.94, 139.45). IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1β and IL-33 were significantly associated with adverse outcome. Clinical parameters were predictive of poor outcome (AUROC 0.71), addition of a combined cytokine panel significantly improved the predictability (AUROC 0.85).

OP is frequently observed subsequent to viral-induced lung damage and is associated with a diverse range of clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We included 210 patients (mean age: 55.8 ± 16.5 years old; 61% male) with mild Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) from 25 February to 22 April, 2020. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence (n = 103) or absence of typical OP-like pattern (n =107) on initial chest CT. The extent of lung involvement and final outcome was compared across the two groups. Serial changes in imaging were also evaluated in 36 patients in the OP-group with a second CT scan. RESULTS: Duration from symptom onset to presentation was significantly higher in the OP group (7.07 ± 3.71 versus 6.13 ± 4.96 days, p = 0.008). A higher COVID-19-related mortality rate was observed among patients with OP-like pattern (17.5% vs 3.7%, p = 0.001).There was no significant difference in the overall involvement of the lungs (p = 0.358), but lower lobes were significantly more affected in the OP group (p < 0.001). Of the 36 patients with follow-up imaging (mean duration of follow-up = 8.3 ± 2.1 days), progression of infiltration was seen in more than 61% of patients while lesions had resolved in only 22.2% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our observation indicates that physicians should carefully monitor for the presence of OP-like pattern on initial CT as it is associated with a poor outcome. Furthermore, we recommend interval CT to evaluate the progression of infiltrations in these patients.","Raoufi, Masoomeh; Kahkooei, Shahram; Haseli, Sara; Robatjazi, Farzaneh; Bahri, Jamileh; Khalili, Nastaran",Adv. respir. med.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between PM(2.5) and CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]<45 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) in the Twin-Cities area in Minnesota using a large electronic health care database (2012–2019). METHODS: We estimated the previous 1-year average PM(2.5) from the first eGFR (measured with the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation using the first available creatinine measure during the baseline period [2012–2014]) using Environmental Protection Agency downscaler modeling data at the census tract level. We evaluated the spatial relative risk and clustering of CKD prevalence using a K-function test statistic. We assessed the prevalence ratio of the PM(2.5) association with CKD incidence using a mixed effect Cox model, respectively. RESULTS: Patients (n = 20,289) in the fourth (PM(2.5) > 10.4), third (10.3 < PM(2.5) < 10.8) and second quartile (9.9 < PM(2.5) < 10.3) vs. the first quartile (<9.9 μg/m(3)) had a 2.52[2.21, 2.87], 2.18[1.95, 2.45], and 1.72[1.52, 1.97] hazard rate of developing CKD in the fully adjusted models, respectively. We identified spatial heterogeneities and evidence of CKD clustering across our study region, but this spatial variation was accounted for by air pollution and individual covariates. SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure to higher PM(2.5) is associated with a greater risk for incident CKD. Improvements in air quality, specifically at hotspots, may reduce CKD.","Ghazi, Lama; Drawz, Paul E.; Berman, Jesse D.",J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol,618,21

To address the unmet medical need, the regulations are made flexible and convenient without any relaxation in drug safety reporting. The pharmacovigilance activities, especially adverse event reporting regardless of clinical trials or clinical practice should continue as usual because patient safety is the priority. The exposure to experimental drugs with limited evidence of risk - benefit makes it more crucial to adapt robust safety monitoring, accuracy in adverse event reporting, and timely assessment. With the current restriction on physical contact, travel and free movements, isolation, quarantine, and huge clinical workload during pandemic, causality assessment will be more challenging. It may not be possible to capture details of all adverse events, thereby affecting completeness and quality of safety reports. A substantial number of COVID 19 patients will receive investigational drugs along with multiple other medications for clinical manifestations and drug therapy for lifestyle diseases. Causality assessment will be a challenge due to overlapping toxicities, multiple confounding, contributory factors, and insufficient data on safety and risk profile of combining drugs. Assessment will be unable to precisely determine the causality as certain or unlikely, although, it will be valuable in categorizing the causal association as “possible” adverse drug reactions and their scientific basis. Several of these detailed reports, when collated, can identify risk factors for possibilities of prevention or avoid harm. In the current situation of pandemic and uncertainty of experimental new and old repurposed drugs, causation needs to be viewed for the study drug with a public health perspective. After all, this is the best time tested approach to generate evidence and drug evaluation to prevent damage to prospective patients.","Desai, Mira K",Perspect Clin Res,618,24

In this narrative review, based on a selective literature search in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar and ClinicalTrials.gov, we have examined the emerging evidence on the possible treatment of CARDS. Although numerous pharmacologic therapies to improve clinical outcomes in CARDS have been studied also in clinical trials, none have shown efficacy and there is great uncertainty about their effectiveness. There is not yet any recommendation for the therapeutic use of any particular agent to treat CARDS because no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale trials.

In Texas, Latinx populations are overly represented among construction workers, and thus have elevated rates of exposure that are compounded by prevalent high-risk comorbidities and lack of access to health care. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between construction work during the COVID-19 pandemic and hospitalization rates for construction workers and the surrounding community. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This decision analytical model used a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, stratified by age and risk group, with construction workers modeled explicitly. The model was based on residents of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, with a population of 2.17 million. Based on 500 stochastic simulations for each of 15 scenarios that varied the size of the construction workforce and level of worksite transmission risk, the association between continued construction work and hospitalizations was estimated and then compared with anonymized line-list hospitalization data from central Texas through August 20, 2020. EXPOSURES: Social distancing interventions, size of construction workforce, and level of disease transmission at construction worksites. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For each scenario, the total number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and the relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers was projected and then compared with relative risks estimated from reported hospitalization data. RESULTS: Allowing unrestricted construction work was associated with an increase of COVID-19 hospitalization rates through mid-August 2020 from 0.38 per 1000 residents to 1.5 per 1000 residents and from 0.22 per 1000 construction workers to 9.3 per 1000 construction workers. This increased risk was estimated to be offset by safety measures (such as thorough cleaning of equipment between uses, wearing of protective equipment, limits on the number of workers at a worksite, and increased health surveillance) that were associated with a 50% decrease in transmission. The observed relative risk of hospitalization among construction workers compared with other occupational categories among adults aged 18 to 64 years was 4.9 (95% CI, 3.8-6.2). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that unrestricted work in high-contact industries, such as construction, is associated with a higher level of community transmission, increased risks to at-risk workers, and larger health disparities among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.","Pasco, Remy F.; Fox, Spencer J.; Johnston, S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical record review of all patients assigned a diagnosis code of COVID-19 (DB342A or DB972A) at six Danish departments of infectious diseases from February 27 through May 4, 2020. Confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as either: 1) definite, a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a respiratory sample combined with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19: 2) probable, clinical presentation of COVID-19 without detection of SARS-CoV-2 and no alternative diagnoses considered more likely; or 3) possible, clinical presentation of COVID-19 without detection of SARS-CoV-2, and the patient was discharged or deceased before further investigations were carried out. We computed the PPV with 95% confidence intervals (CI) as the number of patients with confirmed (i.e., definite, probable, and possible) COVID-19 divided by the number of patients assigned a diagnosis code for COVID-19. RESULTS: The study included 710 patients with a median age of 61 years (interquartile range [IQR] 47–74) and 285/710 (40%) were female. COVID-19 was confirmed in 706/710 (99%) with 705/710 (99%) categorized as definite, 1/710 (0.1%) as probable, and 0 patients as possible COVID-19. The diagnosis was disproven in 4/710 (0.6%) patients who were hospitalized due to bacterial pneumonia (n = 2), influenza (n = 1), and urinary tract infection (n = 1). The overall PPV for COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI 99–100) and remained consistently high among all subgroups including sex, age groups, calendar period, and stratified by diagnosis code and department of infectious diseases (range 97–100%). CONCLUSION: The overall PPV of diagnosis codes for COVID-19 in Denmark was high and may be suitable for future registry-based prognosis studies of COVID-19.","Bodilsen, Jacob; Leth, Steffen; Nielsen, Stig Lønberg; Holler, Jon Gitz; Benfield, Thomas; Omland, Lars Haukali",Clin Epidemiol,618,22

DESIGN: An explorative, qualitative design was used. SETTING: Prehospital major incidents in Sweden. Data were collected between December 2019 and August 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Prehospital major incident commanders (n=15) with real-life experiences from major events, such as fires, bus accidents, a bridge collapse and terrorist attacks, were included. All but one had participated in 2-day training focusing on the prehospital management of major incidents. In addition, about half of the participants had participated in simulation exercises, academic courses and other training in the management of major incidents. METHODS: Data from two-session individual interviews were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The conformity between real-life major incidents and preparations was good regarding prehospital major incident commanders’ knowledge of the operational procedures applied in major incidents. However, the preparations did not allow for the complexities and endurance strategies required in real-life incidents. Personal preparations, such as mental preparedness or stress management, were not sufficiently covered in the preparations. To some extent, professional experience (such as training) could compensate for the lack of formal preparations. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified perceived gaps between preparations and real-life experiences of being a prehospital major incident commander. To minimise the gaps between demands and expectations on perceived control and to better prepare individuals for being prehospital major incident commanders, the training and other preparations should reflect complexities of real-life incidents. Preparations should develop both technical skills required, such as principles and methodology used, and personal preparedness. Personal preparations should include improving one’s mental preparedness, self-knowledge and professional self-confidence required to successfully act as a prehospital incident commander. Since little is known about what pedagogical methods that should be used to enhance this, further research is needed.","Hugelius, Karin; Edelbring, Samuel; Blomberg, Karin",BMJ Open,618,23

Besides other problems, this is associated with the lack of knowledge concerning distribution of tidal volume and the patients' individual respiratory system mechanics. In this study we used two simple hand-manufactured adaptors to connect physical models of two adult respiratory systems to one ventilator. The artificial lungs were ventilated in the pressure-controlled mode and we investigated if disconnecting one lung from the ventilation circuit for several breaths would allow to determine reliably the other lung's tidal volume and compliance. Compliances and volumes were measured both with the ventilator and external sensors corresponded well. However, tidal volumes measured via the ventilator were smaller compared to the tidal volumes measured via the external sensors with an absolute error of 5.3 +/- 2.5%. The tidal volumes of the individual artificial lungs were distributed in proportion to the compliances and did not differ relevantly when both artificial lungs were connected to when one was disconnected. We conclude that in case of emergency, ventilation of two patients with one ventilator requires two simple hand-crafted tubes as adaptors and available standard breathing circuit components. In such a setting, respiratory system mechanics and tidal volume of each individual patient can be reliably measured during short term clamping of the tracheal tube of the respective other patient.","Reinacher, P.

The consequences of this pandemic for oncology are really heavy, as the entire healthcare system got reorganized. Both oncologists and cancer patients are experiencing rescheduling of treatments and disruptions of appointments with a concurrent surge of fear and stress. In this review all the up-to-date findings, concerning the association between COVID-19 and cancer, are reported. A remaining very debated question regards the use of an innovative class of anti-cancer molecules, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), given their modulating effects on the immune system. For that reason, administration of ICIs to cancer patients represents a question mark during this pandemic, as its correlation with COVID-19-associated risks is still under investigation.

A clear description of local RSV molecular epidemiology, evolution, and transmission requires detailed sequence data and can inform new strategies for virus control and vaccine development. We have generated 27 complete or nearly complete genomes of RSV from hospitalized children attending a rural coastal district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, over a 10-year period using a novel full-genome deep-sequencing process. Phylogenetic analysis of the new genomes demonstrated the existence and cocirculation of multiple genotypes in both RSV A and B groups in Kilifi. Comparison of local versus global strains demonstrated that most RSV A variants observed locally in Kilifi were also seen in other parts of the world, while the Kilifi RSV B genomes encoded a high degree of variation that was not observed in other parts of the world. The nucleotide substitution rates for the individual open reading frames (ORFs) were highest in the regions encoding the attachment (G) glycoprotein and the NS2 protein. The analysis of RSV full genomes, compared to subgenomic regions, provided more precise estimates of the RSV sequence changes and revealed important patterns of RSV genomic variation and global movement.

It has been associated with hypercoagulability causing life-threatening cardiovascular and neurovascular complications. The pathogenesis of this predisposition is not well understood, and one of its consequences is an increased risk of stroke. Patients with patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial fibrillation, previous history of stroke, and elderly patients with uncontrolled hypertension, may be at a higher risk of developing strokes with COVID-19. We present a rare case of acute multiple cerebral watershed infarctions in a COVID-19 patient. CASE PRESENTATION: 38 year-old obese male with past medical history of hypertension presented with confusion, left sided weakness, right lower extremity weakness, and right gaze preference. MRI brain demonstrated multiple patchy small areas of acute ischemic infarcts bilaterally consistent with watershed infarcts. An echocardiogram with bubble study was negative for PFO. Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasound was negative for DVT. Telemetry didn't record any arrhythmias. Laboratory work-up ruled out autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and vasculitis including: antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-factor Xa, Anti-thrombin, Protein S and C, and rapid plasma regain. The patient was screened for COVID-19 due to increased reports of stroke in young patients nationwide, and surprisingly, the test was positive. Aspirin, clopidogrel, high-intensity statins, along with enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis were initiated. DISCUSSION: Evidence increasingly shows that COVID-19 it is not always confined to the respiratory tract but can also induce neurologic diseases with increased risk of stroke in young patients. The reported incidence of stroke in COVID-19 positive patients is about 1-6%. The plausible proposed mechanisms include: viral neurotropism, coagulopathy from systemic inflammation and cytokine storm, and endothelial dysfunction leading to angiopathic thrombosis. There are handful of cases linking COVID-19 to large vessel macrothrombosis and antiphospholipid syndrome. We herein report an even more unusual case that presented with multiple focal neurologic symptoms and was found to have watershed infarctions secondary to COVID-19 with only mild respiratory symptoms, without typical vascular risk factors, PFO or arrhythmia, after excluding autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulability diseases, and vasculitis, shedding the light on the importance of suspecting this devastating disease in an otherwise healthy young patient who presents with focal neurological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients with mild respiratory symptoms, a low threshold for investigation for stroke should be adopted with any new neurological symptoms.

However, there is significant variability in the impact of this crisis on individual healthcare workers, which can be best explained through an appreciation of the construct of resilience. Broadly speaking, resilience refers to the ability to successfully adapt to stressful or traumatic events, and thus plays a key role in determining mental health outcomes following exposure to such events. A proper understanding of resilience is vital in enabling a shift from a reactive to a proactive approach for protecting and promoting the mental well-being of healthcare workers. Research in the past decade has identified six areas that provide promising leads in understanding the biological basis of individual variations in resilience. These are: (1) the key role played by the monoamines noradrenaline and serotonin, (2) the centrality of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in influencing stress vulnerability and resilience, (3) the intimate links between the immune system and stress sensitivity, (4) the role of epigenetic modulation of gene expression in influencing the stress response, (5) the role played by certain neuropeptides as a natural “brake” mechanism in the face of stress, and (6) the neurobiological mechanisms by which environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, and social support, influence resilience to subsequent life events. Though much of this research is still in its early stages, it has already provided valuable information on which strategies – including dietary changes, lifestyle modification, environmental modification, psychosocial interventions, and even pharmacological treatments – may prove to be useful in fostering resilience in individuals and groups. This paper examines the above evidence more closely, with a specific focus on the challenges faced by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provides suggestions regarding how it may be translated into real-world interventions, as well as how the more tentative hypotheses advanced in this field may be tested during this critical period.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Front Psychol,618,24

Although the type I interferon (IFN) system has a critical role in restricting the dissemination of viral infection, suppression of IFN receptor signals by SARS-CoV-2 constitutes a checkpoint that plays an important role in the immune escape of the virus. Environmental pollution not only facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection but also increases infection-associated fatality risk, which arises due to Systemic Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) Activation Syndrome. The intracellular accumulation of endogenous kynurenic acid due to overexpression of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by AhR activation induces AhR-interleukin-6 (IL-6)- signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway.

People were required to stay at home and go out only to satisfy basic needs. Several risk models have postulated a link among online searching behavior, affect, anxiety, and complaints by individuals toward government restrictions (GR), which emerged as also related to an increased perception of knowledge toward risk. However, to date, no study has addressed how these key risk-related aspects (i.e., affect, anxiety, perceived knowledge on risk, and risk dimensions) can act jointly to orient online health information-seeking behavior, and people’s complaints toward GR imposed during the lockdown. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying online health information-seeking behavior and people’s complaints toward the government’s restrictions during a COVID-19 emergency in the Italian population. Drawing from the health belief model (HBM), which postulates a link between sociodemographic variables, risk, and affect dimensions in emergency, we assumed risk factors as predictors of affect and anxiety, which, in turn, were posited as mediators between risk dimensions, online health information-seeking behavior, and complaints toward GR. Participants (1,031) were involved during the first week of the quarantine (March 11–18) and completed an online survey composed of (i) an adapted version of the Italian Risk Perception Questionnaire; (ii) the Italian Positive (PA) and Negative Affect (NA) Schedule (PANAS-10); (iii) the State Anxiety Scale (STAI-Y1); (iv) ad hoc personal knowledge measure about novel coronavirus; (v) ad hoc item measuring information search behavior regarding the novel coronavirus; (vi) ad hoc measure of the complains regarding GR; and (vii) sociodemographic questions. General linear models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were carried out to test the model. Sociodemographic and cognitive factors predicted the participants’ affect and anxiety, which, in turn, motivated and fully mediated both information search behavior and complaint toward GR.

Quarantines, travel bans, regulatory changes, social distancing, and “lockdown” measures have affected drug and alcohol supply chains and subsequently their availability, price, and use patterns, with possible downstream effects on presentations of SUDs and demand for treatment. Given the lack of multicentric epidemiologic studies, we conducted a rapid global survey within the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM) network in order to understand the status of substance-use patterns during the current pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Worldwide. Participants: Starting on April 4, 2020 during a 5-week period, the survey received 185 responses from 77 countries. Measurements: To assess addiction medicine professionals' perceived changes in drug and alcohol supply, price, use pattern, and related complications during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Participants reported (among who answered “decreased” or “increased”) a decrease in drug supply (69.0%) and at the same time an increase in price (95.3%) globally. With respect to changes in use patterns, an increase in alcohol (71.7%), cannabis (63.0%), prescription opioids (70.9%), and sedative/hypnotics (84.6%) use was reported, while the use of amphetamines (59.7%), cocaine (67.5%), and opiates (58.2%) was reported to decrease overall. Conclusions: The global report on changes in the availability, use patterns, and complications of alcohol and drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered in making new policies and in developing mitigating measures and guidelines during the current pandemic (and probable future ones) in order to minimize risks to people with SUD.","Farhoudian, Ali; Radfar, Seyed Ramin; Mohaddes Ardabili, Hossein; Rafei, Parnian; Ebrahimi, Mohsen; Khojasteh Zonoozi, Arash; De Jong, Cornelis A.

In Rwanda, national regulations to reduce COVID-19 altered population mobility and resource allocations. This study evaluated epidemiological trends and care among injured patients preceding and during the COVID-19 pandemic at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK) in Kigali, Rwanda. METHODS: This prospective interrupted cross-sectional study enrolled injured adult patients (≥15 years) presenting to the CHUK emergency department (ED) from January 27th-March 21st (pre-COVID-19 period) and June 1st-28th (intra-COVID-19 period). Trained study personnel continuously collected standardized data on enrolled participants through the first six-hours of ED care. The Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) was calculated as a metric of injury severity. Case characteristics prior to and during the pandemic were compared, statistical differences were assessed using χ(2) or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Data were collected from 409 pre-COVID-19 and 194 intra-COVID-19 cases. Median age was 32, with a male predominance (74.3%). Road traffic injuries (RTI) were the most common injury mechanism pre-COVID-19 (47.8%) and intra-COVID-19 (53.6%) (p = 0.27). There was a significant increase in the number of transfer cases during the intra-COVID-19 period (52.1%) versus pre-COVID-19 (41.3%) (p = 0.01). KTS was significantly lower among intra-COVID-19 patients (p = 0.04), indicating higher severity of presentation. In the intra-COVID-19 period, there was a significant increase in the number of surgery consultations (40.7%) versus pre-COVID-19 (26.7%) (p < 0.001). The number of hospital admissions increased from 35.5% pre-COVID-19 to 46.4% intra-COVID-19 (p = 0.01). There was no significant mortality difference pre-COVID-19 as compared to the intra-COVID-19 period among injured patients (p = 0.76). CONCLUSION: Emergency injury care showed increased injury burden, inpatient admission and resource requirements during the pandemic period. This suggests the spectrum of disease may be more severe and that greater resources for injury management may continue to be needed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Rwanda and other similar settings.","Uwamahoro, Chantal; Marques, Catalina Gonzalez; Beeman, Aly; Mutabazi, Zeta; Twagirumukiza, Francois Regis; Jing, Ling; Ndebwanimana, Vincent; Uwamahoro, Doris; Nkeshimana, Menelas; Tang, Oliver Y.; Naganathan, Sonya; Jarmale, Spandana; Stephen, Andrew; Aluisio, Adam R.",Afr J Emerg Med,618,16

Therefore, it is essential to monitor and characterize patient profiles, variants, symptoms, geographic locations, and treatment responses to analyze and evaluate infectious disease patterns among humans. This research proposes the Evolutionary tree analysis (ETA) for the molecular evolutionary genetic analysis to reduce medical risk factors. Furthermore, The Maximum likelihood tree method (MLTM) has been used to analyze the selective pressure, which is examined to identify a mutation that may influence the infectious disease transmission pattern’s clinical progress. This study also utilizes ETA with Markov Chain Bayesian Statistics (MCBS) approach to reconstruct transmission trees with sequence information. The experimental shows that the proposed ETA-MCBS method achieves a 97.55% accuracy, prediction of 99.56%, and 98.55% performance compared to other existing methods.","Mahmoud, Nourelhoda M.; Mahmoud, Mohamed H.; Alamery, Salman; Fouad, Hassan",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,618,20

However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors' published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids. OBJECTIVE: The present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model. METHODS: After receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON, eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low dose Icaritin group (L-ICT; n = 28; 5 mg·kg(− 1)·day(− 1)), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT; n = 28; 10 mg·kg(− 1)·day(− 1)), and control vehicle group (CON; n = 28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stem cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression. RESULTS: The ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p < 0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICT group was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group. CONCLUSION: Icaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dose-dependent effect on reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition. Suppression of the up-regulated PPARgamma expression for extravascular adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and protection from activated oxidative stress for intravascular endothelium injury were found to be involved in the underlying mechanisms.","Zhang, Ge; Qin, Ling; Sheng, Hui; Wang, Xin-Luan; Wang, Yi-Xiang; Yeung, David Ka-Wai; Griffith, James F.; Yao, Xin-Sheng; Xie, Xin-Hui; Li, Zi-Rong; Lee, Kwong-Man; Leung, Kwok-Sui",Bone,618,21

The epidemiologic relevance of such disorders justifies the increasing interest in further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the inflammatory process occurring in such chronic diseases to provide potential novel pharmacological approaches. The most common and effective therapies for controlling inflammation are glucocorticoids; however, a variety of other molecules have been demonstrated to have an anti-inflammatory potential, including neuropeptides. In recent years, the oxytocinergic system has seen an explosion of scientific studies, demonstrating its potential to contribute to a variety of physiological processes including inflammation. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to understand the role of oxytocin in the modulation of inflammation occurring in different chronic diseases. The criterion we used to select the diseases was based on the emerging literature showing a putative involvement of the oxytocinergic system in inflammatory processes in a variety of pathologies including neurological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and obesity. The evidence reviewed here supports a beneficial role of oxytocin in the control of both peripheral and central inflammatory response happening in the aforementioned pathologies. Although future studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanistic details underlying such regulation, this review supports the idea that the modulation of the endogenous oxytocinergic system might represent a new potential pharmacological approach for the treatment of inflammation.","Friuli, Marzia; Eramo, Barbara; Valenza, Marta; Scuderi, Caterina; Provensi, Gustavo; Romano, Adele",Int J Mol Sci,618,1

Amid the different biosensors, electrochemical biosensors are unparalleled and ideal for the design and manufacture of such flexible and wearable sensors because of their various benefits, including convenient operation, quick response, portability, and inherent miniaturization. A number of studies on flexible and wearable electrochemical biosensors have been reported in recent years for invasive/non-invasive and real-time monitoring of biologically relevant molecules such as glucose, lactate, dopamine, cortisol, and antigens. To attain this, novel two-dimensional nanomaterials and their hybrids, various substrates, and detection methods have been explored to fabricate flexible conductive platforms that can be used to develop flexible electrochemical biosensors.

Therefore, it is urgently required to study wearable/flexible electrochemical biosensors based on two-dimensional nanomaterials for health care monitoring and clinical analysis. In this review, we described recently reported flexible electrochemical biosensors based on two-dimensional nanomaterials. We classified them into specific groups, including enzymatic/non-enzymatic biosensors and affinity biosensors (immunosensors), recent developments in flexible electrochemical immunosensors based on polymer and plastic substrates to monitor biologically relevant molecules. This review will discuss perspectives on flexible electrochemical biosensors based on two-dimensional materials for the clinical analysis and wearable biosensing devices, as well as the limitations and prospects of the these electrochemical flexible/wearable biosensors.

More recently, as concern has risen about the potential impacts of climate variability and change on human mobility, development cooperation actors have begun to design projects that intentionally address the drivers of migration, including climate impacts on livelihoods. However, to date, we know little about the development cooperation’s role and function in responding to climate related mobility and migration. As such, the main aim of this paper is to outline the policy frameworks and approaches shaping development cooperation actors’ engagement and to identify areas for further exploration and investment. First, we frame the concept of climate mobility and migration and discuss some applicable policy frameworks that govern the issue from various perspectives; secondly, we review the toolbox of approaches that development cooperation actors bring to climate mobility; and third, we discuss the implications of the current Covid-19 pandemic and identify avenues for the way forward. We conclude that ensuring safe and orderly mobility and the decent reception and long-term inclusion of migrants and displaced persons under conditions of more severe climate hazards, and in the context of rising nationalism and xenophobia, poses significant challenges. Integrated approaches across multiple policy sectors and levels of governance are needed. In addition to resources, development cooperation actors can bring data to help empower the most affected communities and regions and leverage their convening power to foster more coordinated approaches within and across countries.","Stojanov, Robert; Rosengaertner, Sarah; de Sherbinin, Alex; Nawrotzki, Raphael",Popul Environ,618,8

We tested the utility of matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to classify and predict the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We used MALDI-TOF MS to analyse the serum peptidome from 72 COVID-19 patients (training cohort), clinically classified as mild (28), severe (23) and critical (21), and 20 healthy controls. The resulting matrix of peak intensities was used for Machine Learning (ML) approaches to classify and predict COVID-19 severity of 22 independent patients (validation cohort). Finally, we analysed all sera by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) to identify the most relevant proteins associated to disease severity. RESULTS: We found a clear variability of the serum peptidome profile depending on COVID-19 severity. Forty-two peaks exhibited a log fold change ≥ 1 and 17 were significantly different and at least four-fold more intense in the set of critical patients than in the mild ones. ML approach classified clinical stable patients according to their severity with a 100% of accuracy and predicted correctly the evolution of the non-stable patients in all cases. LC MS/MS identified five proteins that were significantly upregulated in the critical patients. They included the serum amyloid protein A2, which probably yielded the most intense peak detected by MALDI-TOF MS. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the potential of the MALDI-TOF MS as a bench to bedside technology to aid clinicians in their decisions on COVID-19 patients.","Gomila, Rosa M; Martorell, Gabriel; Fraile-Ribot, Pablo A; Doménech-Sánchez, Antonio; Albertí, Miguel; Oliver, Antonio; García-Gasalla, Mercedes; Albertí, Sebastián",Open Forum Infect Dis,618,1

Patients with cardiovascular disease are at risk of poor outcomes from deferral of healthcare during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Little is known about recovery of cardiovascular hospitalizations or procedural volume following the COVID-19 surges. We sought to examine the cardiovascular diagnoses requiring healthcare utilization surrounding the first and second COVID-19 waves and characterize trends in return to pre-pandemic levels at a tertiary care center in Massachusetts. METHODS: : Using electronic health records and administrative claims data, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiovascular procedures and admitted to inpatient cardiology services throughout the first two COVID surges. ICD-10 codes were used to categorize admissions. RESULTS: : Patients who presented for care during the initial COVID-19 surge were younger, had higher comorbidity burden, and longer length-of-stay compared with pre- and post-surge. Marked declines in admissions in the first wave (to 29% of pre-surge levels) followed eventually by complete recovery were noted across all cardiac diagnoses, with smaller declines seen in the second wave. Cardiac procedural volume declined significantly during the initial surge but quickly rebounded post-surge, eventually eclipsing pre-COVID. CONCLUSIONS: : There was a gradual but initially incomplete recovery to pre-surge levels of hospitalizations and procedures during the reopening phase, which eventually rebounded to meet or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. To the extent that this reflects deferred or foregone essential care, it may adversely affect long-term cardiovascular outcomes. These results should inform planning for cardiovascular care delivery during future pandemic surges.","Diamond, Jamie E.; McIlvaine, Susan; Korjian, Serge; Cruden, Patrick; Dechen, Tenzin; Piatkowski, Gail; Kazi, Dhruv S.; Gavin, Michael",Am J Med Sci,618,32

The genesis of this virus is still unknown. To elucidate its molecular evolution and regulation of gene expression, the knowledge of codon usage is a pre-requisite. In this study, an attempt was made to document the genome-wide codon usage profile and the various factors influencing the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in human and dog. The SARS-CoV-2 genome showed relative abundance of A and U nucleotides and relative synonymous codon usage analysis revealed that the preferred synonymous codons mostly end with A/U. The analysis of ENc-GC3s, Neutrality and Parity rule 2 plots indicated that natural selection and other undefined factors dominate the overall codon usage bias in SARS-CoV-2 whereas the impact of mutation pressure is comparatively minor. The codon adaptation index and relative codon deoptimization index of SARS-CoV-2 deciphered that human is more favoured host for adaptation compared to dog. These results enhance our understanding of the factors involved in evolution of the novel human SARS-CoV-2 and its adaptability in dog.","Dutta, Rupam; Buragohain, Lukumoni; Borah, Probodh",Virus Res,618,24

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current literature as it relates to etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of pancreatitis in cats and to arrive at clinically relevant suggestions for veterinary clinicians that are based on evidence, and where such evidence is lacking, based on consensus of experts in the field. ANIMALS: None. METHODS: A panel of 8 experts in the field (5 internists, 1 radiologist, 1 clinical pathologist, and 1 anatomic pathologist), with support from a librarian, was formed to assess and summarize evidence in the peer reviewed literature and complement it with consensus clinical recommendations. RESULTS: There was little literature on the etiology and pathogenesis of spontaneous pancreatitis in cats, but there was much in the literature about the disease in humans, along with some experimental evidence in cats and nonfeline species. Most evidence was in the area of diagnosis of pancreatitis in cats, which was summarized carefully. In contrast, there was little evidence on the management of pancreatitis in cats. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Pancreatitis is amenable to antemortem diagnosis by integrating all clinical and diagnostic information available, and recognizing that acute pancreatitis is far easier to diagnose than chronic pancreatitis. Although both forms of pancreatitis can be managed successfully in many cats, management measures are far less clearly defined for chronic pancreatitis.","Forman, Marnin A.; Steiner, Joerg M.; Armstrong, P.

This had repercussions on healthcare workers, stemming, in particular, from a lack of clear guidelines, adequate protective equipment, and professional preparedness. Such conditions were especially prevalent in Northern Italy. Objectives: This study aimed to examine COVID-19-related professional and psychoemotional stress among nurses and doctors in two hospitals in Northern Italy, along with the worst critical incidents affecting healthcare personnel. A parallel objective was to elicit healthcare professionals' opinions about what changes are needed in the healthcare system's operations, as well as about the relational/emotional skills that are needed to better manage relationships with patients in emergency situations. Participants: Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants and yielded 17 hospital professionals: six nurses (five female and one male) and 11 doctors (seven male and four female). Three of these professionals worked in intensive care and the others in different wards. All had close contact with COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews of ~60 min each that were conducted via Skype video calls. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, then analysed. The qualitative analysis employed mixed methods to identify the most relevant and recursive themes from the interviews. Results: Four fundamental themes emerged from our analysis of the interview texts: (1) disorganisation and psychoemotional stress; (2) urgency and critical incidents; (3) everything surreal; and (4) disruptions in empathetic relationships with patients. Conclusions: Through our analysis of the interview narratives, we found that systematic and in-depth psychological training is needed to prepare professionals for (1) altered relationships with patients in emergencies; (2) use of exceptional medical equipment; (3) elaboration of new bioethical models suitable for disasters and pandemics; and (4) engagement with the themes of death and dying.","Testoni, Ines; Franco, Chiara; Gallo Stampino, Enrica; Iacona, Erika; Crupi, Robert; Pagano, Claudio",Front Psychol,618,24

Here, we link the activity of the mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 and global mitochondrial acetylation status to host antiviral responses via regulation of both mitochondrial structural integrity and metabolism during HCMV infection. We establish that SIRT3 deacetylase activity is necessary for suppressing virus production, and that SIRT3 maintains mitochondrial pH and membrane potential during infection. By defining the temporal dynamics of SIRT3-substrate interactions during infection, and overlaying acetylome and proteome information, we find altered SIRT3 associations with the mitochondrial fusion factor OPA1 and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 (ACAA2), concomitant with changes in their acetylation levels. Using mutagenesis, microscopy, and virology assays, we determine OPA1 regulates mitochondrial morphology of infected cells and inhibits HCMV production. OPA1 acetylation status modulates these functions, and we establish K834 as a site regulated by SIRT3. Control of SIRT3 protein levels or enzymatic activity is sufficient for regulating mitochondrial filamentous structure. Lastly, we establish a virus restriction function for ACAA2, an enzyme involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Altogether, we highlight SIRT3 activity as a regulatory hub for mitochondrial acetylation and morphology during HCMV infection and point to global acetylation as a reflection of mitochondrial health.","Sheng, Xinlei; Cristea, Ileana M.",PLoS Pathog,618,3

This analysis quantifies the changes in mortality for selected causes of death during the COVID-19 pandemic up to December 31, 2020, and investigates whether the levels of excess mortality varied by age group. The data comprise national-level monthly death counts by age group and selected causes of death from January 1999 to December 2020 combined with annual mid-year population estimates over the same period. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate monthly cause-specific excess mortality during 2020 controlling for the pre-pandemic mortality patterns by age, calendar year, and season. To determine whether excess mortality varied by age, we tested interactions between broad age groups and dichotomous indicators for the pre-pandemic (January-February) and the pandemic (March-December) portions of 2020. In relative terms, excess all-cause mortality (including COVID-19) peaked in December at ages 25–44 (RR=1.58 relative to 2019, 95% CI=1.50–1.68). Excluding COVID-19, all of the excess mortality occurred between ages 15 and 64, peaking in July among those aged 25–44 (RR=1.45, 95% CI 1.37–1.53). We find notable excess mortality during March-December 2020 for many causes (i.e., influenza/pneumonia, other respiratory diseases, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, kidney disease, and external causes), but almost exclusively among young and midlife (aged 25–74) Americans. For those aged 75 and older, there was little excess mortality from causes other than COVID-19 except from Alzheimer’s disease. Excess non-COVID mortality may have resulted, at least partly, from incorrectly classified COVID-19 deaths, but neither misclassification nor an atypical flu season that disproportionately affected younger people is likely to explain the increase in mortality from external causes, which was evident even during January-February 2020. Exploratory analyses suggest that drug-related mortality may be driving the early rise in external mortality. The growth in drug overdoses well before there was any hint of a pandemic suggests it is probably not solely an indirect effect of COVID-19, although the pandemic may have exacerbated the problem.","Glei, Dana A.",medRxiv,618,1

OBJECTIVE: To describe the assessment and immunization of highly allergic individuals with the BNT162b2 vaccine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In a prospective cohort study from December 27, 2020, to February 22, 2021, 8102 patients with allergies who applied to the COVID 19 vaccine referral center at the Sheba Medical Center underwent risk assessment using an algorithm that included a detailed questionnaire. High-risk patients (n = 429) were considered “highly allergic” and were immunized under medical supervision. EXPOSURES: Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) COVID-19 vaccine. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Allergic and anaphylactic reactions after the first and second doses of BNT162b2 vaccine among highly allergic patients. RESULTS: Of the 429 individuals who applied to the COVID-19 referral center and were defined as highly allergic, 304 (70.9%) were women and the mean (SD) age was 52 (16) years. This highly allergic group was referred to receive immunization under medical supervision. After the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine, 420 patients (97.9%) had no immediate allergic event, 6 (1.4%) developed minor allergic responses, and 3 (0.7%) had anaphylactic reactions. During the study period, 218 highly allergic patients (50.8%) received the second BNT162b2 vaccine dose, of which 214 (98.2%) had no allergic reactions and 4 patients (1.8%) had minor allergic reactions. Other immediate and late reactions were comparable with those seen in the general population, except for delayed itch and skin eruption, which were more common among allergic patients. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The rate of allergic reactions to BNT162b2 vaccine, is higher among patients with allergies, particularly among a subgroup with a history of high-risk allergies. This study suggests that most patients with a history of allergic diseases and, particularly, highly allergic patients can be safely immunized by using an algorithm that can be implemented in different medical facilities and includes a referral center, a risk assessment questionnaire, and a setting for immunization under medical supervision of highly allergic patients.

The application of this combination of methodologies permitted us to generate human single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against two proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP) and thioredoxin (Trx) in a short time, using as low as 5 μg of purified protein. These scFvs showed specific reactivity against their respective targets and worked well by ELISA and western blot. The scFvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot.

Amino acid metabolism, in particular, contains significant clues in terms of the development and prevention of many diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to compare amino acid profile of COVID-19 and healthy subject. In this study, the amino acid profiles of patients with asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe/critical SARS-CoV-2 infection were scanned with LC–MS/MS. The amino acid profile encompassing 30 amino acids in 142 people including 30 control and 112 COVID-19 patients was examined. 20 amino acids showed significant differences when compared to the control group in COVID-19 patient groups with different levels of severity in the statistical analyses conducted. It was detected that the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) changed in correlation with one another, and l-2-aminobutyric acid and l-phenylalanine had biomarker potential for COVID-19. Moreover, it was concluded that l-2-aminobutyric acid could provide prognostic information about the course of the disease. We believe that a new viewpoint will develop regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis as a result of the evaluation of the serum amino acid profiles of COVID-19 patients. Determining l-phenylalanine and l-2-aminobutyric levels can be used in laboratories as a COVID-19-biomarker.

After 200 years of bioengineering progress, artificial lungs are closer than ever before to meet this demand which has risen exponentially due to the COVID-19 crisis. In this review, the critical advances in the historical development of artificial lungs are detailed. The current state of affairs regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, intravascular lung assists, pump-less extracorporeal lung assists, total artificial lungs, and microfluidic oxygenators are outlined.","Syed, Ahad; Kerdi, Sarah; Qamar, Adnan",Bioengineering (Basel),618,5

We aim to decipher SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types, the consequent host immune response and their interplay in the lung of COVID-19 patients. Design: We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of lung samples from 17 subjects (6 severe COVID-19 patients, 3 mild patients who recovered and 8 healthy controls). The expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) was examined among different cell types in the lung. The immune cells infiltration patterns, their gene expression profiles, and the interplay of immune cells and SARS-CoV-2 target cells were further investigated. Results: Compared to healthy controls, the overall ACE2 (receptor of SARS-CoV-2) expression was significantly higher in lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients, in particular in ciliated cell, club cell and basal cell. Comparative transcriptome analysis of these lung epithelial cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection activated pro-inflammatory signaling including interferon pathway and cytokine signaling. Moreover, we identified dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19. In severe COVID-19 patients, significantly higher neutrophil, but lower T and NK cells in lung were observed along with markedly increased cytokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL7, CCL3L1 and CCL4L2) compared with healthy controls as well as mild patients who recovered. The cytotoxic phenotypes were shown in lung T and NK cells of severe patients as evidenced by enhanced IFN{gamma}, Granulysin, Granzyme B and Perforin expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection altered the community interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells: the interaction between epithelial cells with macrophage, T and NK cell was stronger, but their interaction with neutrophils was lost in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection activates pro-inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells expressing ACE2 and causes dysregulation of immune response to release more pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection breaks the interplay of lung epithelial cells and immune cells.","Chen, H.; Liu, W.; Liu, D.; Zhao, L.; Yu, J.",,618,24

METHODS: A nationwide study was conducted online among 5,039 adults in all 31 provinces in mainland China between March 1 and March 16, 2020. Bivariate analysis and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to explore the related factors of high perceived stress. RESULTS: Among all respondents, 36.0% reported a high level of stress. Respondents in Hubei province (the epicenter) were more likely to report high stress levels than those in low epidemic areas. Respondents who went outside every day or every other day reported greater odds of experiencing a high level of stress than those who went outside every 8–14 days. People with higher risk perceptions were more prone to report high stress levels. Respondents aged 16–35 were more likely to report high stress than respondents aged 46 or older. Lower household income and lower health literacy were related to increased odds of reporting high stress levels. LIMITATIONS: We used a convenience sample and self-reported survey data. CONCLUSIONS: We identified risk factors for high stress levels related to the epidemic (epidemic intensity in residential areas, risk perception, and frequency of going outside) and other vulnerabilities (younger age, low household income, low health literacy). Our findings can directly inform interventions and policies for mitigating stress among the general population for this or future epidemics.","Xu, Jiayao; Wang, Xiaomin; Xuan, Ziming; Lin, Leesa; Sun, Kai Sing; Zhou, Yiyi; Jiang, Fangyuan; Han, Weiqi; Zhou, Xudong",J Affect Disord,618,32

This situation needs to be changed through the retirement of fossil fuels and the implementation of alternative fuels and vehicles such as biofuels, battery electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles fuelled by hydrogen. Nevertheless, the environmental suitability of alternative fuels is conditioned by how they are produced. Through the case study of Spain, this article prospectively assesses – from a techno-economic and carbon footprint perspective– the production technology mix of alternative fuels from 2020 to 2050. The proposed energy systems optimisation model includes a large number of production technologies regarding biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel, synthetic diesel/gasoline, and hydrotreated vegetable oil), electricity, and hydrogen. The combined study of these fuels provides a relevant framework to discuss the targets established for the road transport sector with a high level of detail not only regarding fuel type but also technology breakdown. The results show the relevance of second-generation biofuel production technologies in fulfilling the future biofuel demand. Regarding the extra electricity demand associated with the penetration of electric vehicles, the results suggest a key role of wind- and solar-based technologies in meeting such a need. Concerning hydrogen as an option to decarbonise the transport system, even though steam methane reforming is the most mature and cost-competitive production technology, hydrogen production would be satisfied through electrolysis in order to avoid relying on fossil resources as the main feedstock. Overall, this integrated approach to the long-term production technology mix of alternative fuels for road transport is expected to be relevant to a wide range of decision-makers willing to prospectively assess road transport systems from a technology perspective.","Navas-Anguita, Zaira; García-Gusano, Diego; Iribarren, Diego",Energy Convers Manag,618,29

Physician-delivered messages may increase adherence to these behaviors. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether messages delivered by physicians improve COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors and to assess the differential effectiveness of messages tailored to the Black community. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial of self-identified White and Black adults with less than a college education was conducted from August 7 to September 6, 2020. Of 44 743 volunteers screened, 30 174 were eligible, 5534 did not consent or failed attention checks, and 4163 left the survey before randomization. The final sample had 20 460 individuals (participation rate, 68%). Participants were randomly assigned to receive video messages on COVID-19 or other health topics. INTERVENTIONS: Participants saw video messages delivered either by a Black or a White study physician. In the control groups, participants saw 3 placebo videos with generic health topics. In the treatment group, they saw 3 videos on COVID-19, recorded by several physicians of varied age, gender, and race. Video 1 discussed common symptoms. Video 2 highlighted case numbers; in one group, the unequal burden of the disease by race was discussed. Video 3 described US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention social distancing guidelines. Participants in both the control and intervention groups were also randomly assigned to see 1 of 2 American Medical Association statements, one on structural racism and the other on drug price transparency. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Knowledge, beliefs, and practices related to COVID-19, demand for information, willingness to pay for masks, and self-reported behavior. RESULTS: Overall, 18 223 participants (9168 Black; 9055 White) completed the survey (9980 [55.9%] women, mean [SD] age, 40.2 [17.8] years). Overall, 6303 Black participants (34.6%) and 7842 White participants (43.0%) were assigned to the intervention group, and 1576 Black participants (8.6%) and 1968 White participants (10.8%) were assigned to the control group. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had smaller gaps in COVID-19 knowledge (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.87-0.91]) and greater demand for COVID-19 information (IRR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.11]), willingness to pay for a mask (difference, $0.50 [95% CI, $0.15-$0.85]). Self-reported safety behavior improved, although the difference was not statistically significant (IRR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.01]; P = .08).

An update from Italy before flu season starts,17.244108,5.0955777,2020-05-14,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a major risk factor for mortality and morbidity in critical care hospitals around the world. Lung epithelial type II cells play a major role in several physiological processes, including recognition and clearance of respiratory viruses as well as repair of lung injury in response to environmental toxicants. Gene expression profiling of lung epithelial type II-specific genes led to the identification of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 3 (LAMP3). Intracellular locations of LAMP3 include plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes. These intracellular organelles are involved in vesicular transport and facilitate viral entry and release of the viral RNA into the host cell cytoplasm. In this study, regulation of LAMP3 expression in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses and type I interferon signaling was investigated. Coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 significantly induced LAMP3 expression in lung epithelial cells within 24 hours after infection that required the presence of ACE2 viral entry receptor. Time-course experiments revealed that the induced expression of LAMP3 by SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with the induced expression of interferon-beta1 (IFNB1) and signal transducers and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mRNA levels. LAMP3 was also induced by direct IFN-beta treatment or by infection with influenza virus lacking the non-structural protein1(NS1) in NHBE bronchial epithelial cells. LAMP3 expression was induced in human lung epithelial cells by several respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3). Location in lysosomes and endosomes as well as induction by respiratory viruses and type I Interferon suggests that LAMP3 may have an important role in inter-organellar regulation of innate immunity and a potential target for therapeutic modulation in health and disease. Furthermore, bioinformatics revealed that a subset of lung type II cell genes were differentially regulated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients.","Ramana, Chilakamarti V.",bioRxiv,618,1

We studied the case of France, where the independent Scientific Council on COVID-19 was appointed by President Macron on March 12, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey on a representative sample of the French adult population. METHODS: Our data were collected by the French Institute of Public Opinion using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 1016 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and so on. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (Pandas—SciPy—Statsmodels) with Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS: Intense media coverage has given the council a very high public profile, with three respondents out of four (73%) having heard about it. Perceptions are positive but complex. French citizens expect science to be important in political decision-making. Four of five (81.5%) want political decisions, in general, to be based on scientific knowledge. But one in two (55%) says that the government has not relied enough on science and only 36% are satisfied with the government's crisis management to date. Although most feel that the council has a legitimate advisory role even in situations of uncertainty (only 15% disagree), it is not perceived as fully independent. Only 44% think that it directly represents the scientific community, and only one of three people considers it completely independent from the government (39%) and the pharmaceutical industry (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that while the transparency of scientific advice is important, it alone cannot ensure public confidence in political decision-making. We suggest that efforts made today to instill a ‘science-savvy’ public culture—one that allows the complex articulation between scientific knowledge, uncertainty, and political decision-making to be understood and accounted for would greatly benefit evidence-based policy in future crises.","Schultz, É.; Ward, J.K.",Public Health,618,3

In order for medical student education to continue, virtual and online electives were designed and implemented expeditiously. We created a virtual curriculum that taught quality improvement (QI) skills within the context of the global pandemic. METHODS: This 4-week curriculum enrolled 16 students. Students completed the revised QI knowledge application tool (QIKAT-R) before and after the course to assess QI knowledge. Students completed prereading, online modules, and received lectures on QI and incident command systems. Each group designed their own QI project related to our hospital system's response to the pandemic. Finally, groups presented their projects at a peer symposium and completed peer evaluations. RESULTS: Students' QIKAT-R scores improved throughout the course from a mean of 5.5 (SD = 1.3) to a mean of 7.5 (SD = 1.1; p < 0.001). Students reported that the virtual learning experience delivered the material effectively, and all students agreed that they would participate in QI work in the future. DISCUSSION: Patient safety and QI topics are content areas for multiple medical licensing examinations. Virtual learning is an effective way to deliver QI content to medical students and residents, especially when projects are trainee-led, QI-trained faculty serve as mentors, and the projects harmonize with institutional goals. Our virtual pandemic-focused curriculum has demonstrated efficacy in increasing medical student QI knowledge.","Donohue, Katelyn E.; Farber, Dara L.; Goel, Nidhi; Parrino, Christopher R.; Retener, Norman F.; Rizvi, Syedmehdi; Dittmar, Philip C.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,618,21

This virus rapidly spread around the world causing disease ranging from minimal symptoms to severe pneumonia, which was termed coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID). Postmortem examination is a valuable tool for studying the pathobiology of this new infection. METHODS: We report the clinicopathologic findings from 32 autopsy studies conducted on patients who died of COVID-19 including routine gross and microscopic examination with applicable special and immunohistochemical staining techniques. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR in 31 cases (97%) and by immunohistochemical staining for SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein in the lung in the remaining 1 case (3%). The ethnically diverse cohort consisted of 22 males and 10 females with a mean age of 68 years (range: 30–100). Patients most commonly presented with cough (17 [55%]), shortness of breath (26 [81%]), and a low-grade fever (17 [55%]). Thirty-one (97%) of the patients had at least 1 comorbidity (mean = 4).

METHOD: a comprehensive systematic review of useful interventions for easing the BPSD burden in patients with dementia (PwD) and their caregivers in the context of COVID-19 quarantine was performed from January 2010 to March 2020. RESULTS: From a total of 187 articles retrieved from electronic databases (MEDLINE, LILACS, Cochrane and SCOPUS), 43 studies were eligible for this review. Most of the psychosocial and psychoeducational interventions described were person-centered strategies based on the cognitive-behavioral approach or informational tools to enhance care providers’ knowledge of dementia. Most studies achieved successful results in handling BPSD and mood-anxiety symptoms of care providers, contributing to an overall improvement in dyad life quality. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the last few years suggest that low-cost techniques, tailored to the dyad well-being, with increasing use of technology through friendly online platforms and application robots, can be an alternative to conventional assistance during COVID-19 Pandemic. Nevertheless, the world’s current experience regarding the duration of the COVID-19 Pandemic and its effects on the cognition, behavior, and life quality of PwD will demand research on preventive and protective factors of dementia and the pursue of efficient interventions in different scenarios.","Alves, Gilberto Sousa; Casali, Maria Eduarda; Veras, André Barciela; Carrilho, Carolina Gomes; Bruno Costa, Eriko; Rodrigues, Valeska Marinho; Dourado, Marcia Cristina Nascimento",Front Psychiatry,618,16

These health benefits are mediated in large part through cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength. As most individuals have not had an assessment of their personal cardiorespiratory fitness or muscular strength we investigated if measurements of cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular strength would influence an individual’s subsequent self-reported exercise and physical activity. METHODS: Volunteer subjects at a State Fair were randomized in 1:1 parallel fashion to control and intervention groups. The baseline Exercise Vital Sign (EVS) and type of physical activity were obtained from all subjects. The intervention group received estimated maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2)max) using a step test and muscular strength using a hand grip dynamometer along with age-specific norms for both measurements. All subjects were provided exercise recommendations. Follow up surveys were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months regarding their EVS and physical activity. RESULTS: One thousand three hundred fifteen individuals (656 intervention, 659 control) were randomized with 1 year follow up data obtained from 823 subjects (62.5%). Baseline mean EVS was 213 min/week. No change in EVS was found in either group at follow-up (p = 0.99). Subjects who were less active at baseline (EVS < 150) did show an increase in EVS (86 to 146) at 6 months (p < 0.05). At 3 months the intervention group increased resistance training (29.1 to 42.8%) compared to controls (26.3 to 31.4%) (p < 0.05). Lifestyle physical activity increased in the intervention group at 3 months (27.7 to 29.1%) and 6 months (25%) whereas it declined in the control group at 3 months (24.4 to 20.1%) and 6 months (18.7%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Providing VO(2)max estimates and grip strength did not produce an increase in overall physical activity. The EVS and exercise recommendations did however produce an increase in physical activity in less active individuals. In a very active population the VO(2)max estimate and measured grip strength did increase lifestyle activity and resistance training. Wider adoption of these measures could be effective in promoting physical activity and resistance training.

In addition to polyprotein 1ab(1), polyprotein 1a and the four genes coding for major structural proteins spike (S), small envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), six to eight additional proteins have been predicted depending upon the strain analyzed. Their lengths range between 61 and 274 amino acids. Our method also suggests that polyprotein 1ab, polyprotein 1a, S, M and N are proteins of viral origin and others are of prokaryotic. Putative functions of all predicted protein-coding genes have been suggested using conserved peptides present in their open reading frames.

Based on bioinformatics and deep learning, this study was designed to identify the genomic variability of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide and predict the impending mutation rate. Analysis of 259044 SARS-CoV-2 isolates identify 3334545 mutations (14.01 mutations per isolate), suggesting a high mutation rate. Strains from India showed the highest no. of mutations (48) followed by Scotland, USA, Netherlands, Norway, and France having up to 36 mutations. Besides the most prominently occurring mutations (D416G, F106F, P314L, and UTR:C241T), we identify L93L, A222V, A199A, V30L, and A220V mutations which are in the top 10 most frequent mutations. Multi-nucleotide mutations GGG>AAC, CC>TT, TG>CA, and AT>TA have come up in our analysis which are in the top 20 mutational cohort.

A total of 595 community pharmacies from 11 districts were investigated in Guangzhou, China. We used binary logistic regression to evaluate the factors associated with the non-prescription sale of antibiotics. RESULTS: The proportion of non-prescription dispensing of antibiotics was 63.1% in Guangzhou, China, with a higher incidence of antibiotic dispensing without prescription in outer districts (69.3%). Cephalosporin (44.1%) and Amoxicillin (39.0%) were sold more often than other antibiotics. Chain pharmacies had better performance on the prescription sale of antibiotics and service quality. Traditional Chinese medicine was commonly recommended by pharmacy staff. CONCLUSION: Since the non-prescription sale of antibiotics is prevalent in Guangzhou, effective solutions should be determined.

However, the adverse events associated with vaccination have not been fully investigated. Of concern are some serious cardiovascular events such as myocarditis, pericarditis or perimyocarditis development post-vaccination. In this report, we present an unusual case of acute perimyocarditis and pericardial effusion 10 days following the second dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccination in Qatar. At the time of presentation, the patient presented with non-specific symptoms of headache, diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy and dehydration. COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was negative. Once admitted to the emergency department, she started to deteriorate with very low blood pressure readings reaching 40/33 mmHg which was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. After 5.5 liters of intravenous fluids, echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were performed. Findings were consistent with pericardial effusion, signs of impending cardiac tamponade and acute perimyocarditis. Cardiac biomarkers including troponin T and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were elevated. Hospital course was complicated with cardiac arrest, acute kidney injury, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and hemodynamic instability. Eventually, the patient recovered after a three-week hospital stay and was discharged on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAIDs).

As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of ~7% and recovery rate of ~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1 genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.","Alsamman, Alsamman M.; Zayed, Hatem",bioRxiv,618,22

Retailers’ ups and downs during the COVID-19 outbreak,17.328611,4.702957,2020-05-21,"Background: Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist commonly used to treat opioid and alcohol dependence. The use of low dose naltrexone (LDN) was found to have anti-inflammatory properties for treatment of diseases such as fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis and regional pain syndromes. Related to its anti-neuroinflammatory properties, the mechanism of action is possibly mediated via Toll-like receptor 4 antagonism, which is widely expressed on microglial cells. The aim of the present study was to assess the immunometabolic effects of naltrexone on microglia cells in in vitro conditions. Methods: All experiments were performed in the BV-2 microglial cell line. The cells were treated with naltrexone at 100 μM concentrations corresponding to low dose for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed for every drug dose. To induce additional activation, the cells were pretreated with LPS and IFN-γ. Immunofluorescence was used to analyse the classical microglial activation markers iNOS and CD206, while Seahorse was used for real-time cellular metabolic assessments. mTOR activity measured over the expression of a major direct downstream target S6K was assessed using western blot. Results: LDN induced a shift from highly activated pro-inflammatory phenotype (iNOS(high)CD206(low)) to quiescent anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (iNOS(low)CD206(high)) in BV-2 microglia cells. Changes in the inflammatory profile were accompanied by cellular metabolic switching based on the transition from high glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). LDN-treated cells were able to maintain a metabolically suppressive phenotype by supporting OXPHOS with high oxygen consumption, and also maintain a lower energetic state due to lower lactate production. The metabolic shift induced by transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative metabolism was more prominent in cells pretreated with immunometabolic modulators such as LPS and IFN-γ. In a dose-dependent manner, naltrexone also modulated mTOR/S6K expression, which underlies the cell metabolic phenotype regulating microglia immune properties and adaptation. Conclusion: By modulating the phenotypic features by metabolic switching of activated microglia, naltrexone was found to be an effective and powerful tool for immunometabolic reprogramming and could be a promising novel treatment for various neuroinflammatory conditions.","Kučić, Natalia; Rački, Valentino; Šverko, Roberta; Vidović, Toni; Grahovac, Irena; Mršić-Pelčić, Jasenka",Int J Mol Sci,618,1

Patients with PD have multiple gait impairments that result in an increased risk of falls and diminished quality of life. Therefore, gait measurement is important for the management of PD. OBJECTIVE: We previously developed a smartphone-based dual-task gait assessment that was validated in healthy adults. The aim of this study was to test the validity of this gait assessment in people with PD, and to examine the association between app-derived gait metrics and the clinical and functional characteristics of PD. METHODS: Fifty-two participants with clinically diagnosed PD completed assessments of walking, Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (UPDRS III), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A), and Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) rating scale tests. Participants followed multimedia instructions provided by the app to complete two 20-meter trials each of walking normally (single task) and walking while performing a serial subtraction dual task (dual task). Gait data were simultaneously collected with the app and gold-standard wearable motion sensors. Stride times and stride time variability were derived from the acceleration and angular velocity signal acquired from the internal motion sensor of the phone and from the wearable sensor system. RESULTS: High correlations were observed between the stride time and stride time variability derived from the app and from the gold-standard system (r=0.98-0.99, P<.001), revealing excellent validity of the app-based gait assessment in PD. Compared with those from the single-task condition, the stride time (F(1,103)=14.1, P<.001) and stride time variability (F(1,103)=6.8, P=.008) in the dual-task condition were significantly greater. Participants who walked with greater stride time variability exhibited a greater UPDRS III total score (single task: β=.39, P<.001; dual task: β=.37, P=.01), HAM-A (single-task: β=.49, P=.007; dual-task: β=.48, P=.009), and HAM-D (single task: β=.44, P=.01; dual task: β=.49, P=.009). Moreover, those with greater dual-task stride time variability (β=.48, P=.001) or dual-task cost of stride time variability (β=.44, P=.004) exhibited lower MoCA scores. CONCLUSIONS: A smartphone-based gait assessment can be used to provide meaningful metrics of single- and dual-task gait that are associated with disease severity and functional outcomes in individuals with PD.","Su, Dongning; Liu, Zhu; Jiang, Xin; Zhang, Fangzhao; Yu, Wanting; Ma, Huizi; Wang, Chunxue; Wang, Zhan; Wang, Xuemei; Hu, Wanli; Manor, Brad; Feng, Tao; Zhou, Junhong",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,618,1

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our ability to create personalized neonatal models of fetal brain immune programming enables non-invasive insights into fetal brain development and potential childhood neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities for a range of maternal exposures, including COVID-19.","Sheridan, Steven D.; Thanos, Jessica M.; De Guzman, Rose M.; McCrea, Liam T.; Horng, Joy E.; Fu, Ting; Sellgren, Carl M.; Perlis, Roy H.; Edlow, Andrea G.",Transl Psychiatry,618,11

To assess the potential for differences in the definition of fever to characterize nursing home residents with COVID‐19 infections as symptomatic, pre‐symptomatic, or asymptomatic, we conducted a retrospective study on a national cohort of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Community Living Center (CLC) residents tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. METHODS: Residents with positive SARS‐CoV‐2 tests were classified as asymptomatic if they did not experience any symptoms, and as symptomatic or pre‐symptomatic if the experienced a fever (>100.4°F) before or following a positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test, respectively. All‐cause 30‐day mortality was assessed as was the influence of a lower temperature threshold (>99.0°F) on classification of residents with positive SARS‐CoV‐2 tests. RESULTS: From March 2020 through November 2020, VA CLCs tested 11,908 residents for SARS‐CoV‐2 using RT‐PCR, with a positivity of rate of 13% (1557). Among residents with positive tests and using >100.4°F, 321 (21%) were symptomatic, 425 (27%) were pre‐symptomatic, and 811 (52%) were asymptomatic. All‐cause 30‐day mortality among residents with symptomatic and pre‐symptomatic COVID‐19 infections was 24% and 26%, respectively, while those with an asymptomatic infection had mortality rates similar to residents with negative SAR‐CoV‐2 tests (10% and 5%, respectively). Using >99.0°F would have increased the number of residents categorized as symptomatic at the time of testing from 321 to 773. CONCLUSIONS: All‐cause 30‐day mortality was similar among VA CLC residents with symptomatic or pre‐symptomatic COVID‐19 infection, and lower than rates reported in non‐VA nursing homes. A lower temperature threshold would increase the number of residents recognized as having symptomatic infection, potentially leading to earlier detection and more rapid implementation of therapeutic interventions and infection prevention and control measures.","Bej, Taissa; Kothadia, Sonya; Wilson, Brigid M.; Song, Sunah; Briggs, Janet M.; Banks, Richard E.; Donskey, Curtis J.; Perez, Federico; Jump, Robin L.

Each of the three peripheral HR2 helices shows prominent contacts with the hydrophobic surface of the central HR1 coiled‐coil. The concerted protein–protein interactions among the HR helices are responsible for the fusion event that leads to the release of the SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid into the target host‐cell. In this investigation, we applied recombinant protein and synthetic peptide‐based biophysical assays to characterize the biological activities of the HR helices. In a parallel experiment, we employed a HIV‐luc/SARS pseudotyped virus entry inhibition assay to screen for potent inhibitory activities on HR peptides derived from the SARS‐CoV S protein HR regions and a series of other small‐molecule drugs. Three HR peptides and five small‐molecule drugs were identified as potential inhibitors. ADS‐J1, which has been used to interfere with the fusogenesis of HIV‐1 onto CD4(+) cells, demonstrated the highest HIV‐luc/SARS pseudotyped virus‐entry inhibition activity among the other small‐molecule drugs. Molecular modeling analysis suggested that ADS‐J1 may bind to the deep pocket of the hydrophobic groove on the surface of the central coiled‐coil of SARS‐CoV S HR protein and prevent the entrance of the SARS‐CoV into the host cells.

HIV-1 has recently been shown to package non-lysyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in addition to the tRNA(Lys) needed for priming reverse transcription and integration of the HIV-1 genome. By comparing the codon usage of HIV-1 genes with that of its human host, we found that tRNAs decoding codons that are highly used by HIV-1 but avoided by its host are overrepresented in HIV-1 virions. In particular, tRNAs decoding A-ending codons, required for the expression of HIV's A-rich genome, are highly enriched. Because the affinity of Gag-Pol for all tRNAs is nonspecific, HIV packaging is most likely passive and reflects the tRNA pool at the time of viral particle formation. Codon usage of HIV-1 early genes is similar to that of highly expressed host genes, but codon usage of HIV-1 late genes was better adapted to the selectively enriched tRNA pool, suggesting that alterations in the tRNA pool are induced late in viral infection. If HIV-1 genes are adapting to an altered tRNA pool, codon adaptation of HIV-1 may be better than previously thought.","van Weringh, Anna; Ragonnet-Cronin, Manon; Pranckeviciene, Erinija; Pavon-Eternod, Mariana; Kleiman, Lawrence; Xia, Xuhua",Mol Biol Evol,618,33

Therefore, the investigation of psychopathologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and emergency response is critical. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 scale, insomnia severity index-7, and brief resilient coping scale were administered to participants. The collected data was then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical procedures were employed to describe the various psychopathologies. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value <0.05 was declared as statistically significant. RESULTS: A significant proportion of individuals living with disability had psychopathologies; 46.2% for depression symptoms, 48.1% for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and 71% for insomnia symptoms. Nearly 45.7% of participants were low resilient copers to their psychopathology. Depression was significantly higher in divorced/widowed/separated (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.28–8.92, P-value = 0.006), non-educated (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.90, P-value = 0.001), and unemployed (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.11, P-value = 0.005) as well as a daily laborer (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.20, 4.89, P-value = 0.014) subjects. Generalized anxiety disorder was also significantly higher in young age (<40 years) (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.98, P-value = 0.02), single (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.3, P-value = 0.011), widowed/divorced/separated (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.78, P-value = 0.032), preparatory school completed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.46, P-value = 0.001), daily laborer (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.23, P-value = 0.003), and unemployed (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.78, P-value = 0.005) participants. Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, P-value = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), unemployed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.03, P-value = 0.001), blind (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.42, 6.35, P-value = 0.001), and deaf (AOR = 10.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 35.33, P-value = 0.002) participants. CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent among individuals with a disability during the COVID-19 period. Multiple sociodemographic and disability-related factors were associated with this high psychopathology. Attention has to be given by the government and other stakeholders to intervene in psychopathology and its associated factors.","Necho, Mogesie; Birkie, Mengesha; Gelaye, Habitam; Beyene, Abeba; Belete, Asmare; Tsehay, Mekonnen",PLoS One,618,1

Such misclassifications may incur dubious outcome in case of disease diagnosis and other critical applications. Hence, it is a hot topic for the researchers to tackle the class imbalance issue. We present a novel hybrid approach for handling such datasets. We utilize simulated annealing algorithm for undersampling and apply support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor and discriminant analysis for the classification task. We validate our technique in 51 real-world datasets and compare it with other recent works. Our technique yields better efficacy than the existing techniques and hence it can be applied in imbalance datasets to mitigate the misclassification.","Desuky, Abeer S.; Hussain, Sadiq",Arab J Sci Eng,618,24

Sixteen features (for example, Total_cases_per_million and Total_deaths_per_million) related to significant factors, such as testing, death, positivity rate, active cases, stringency index, and population density are considered for the COVID-19 reproduction rate prediction. These 16 features are ranked using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBOOST feature selection algorithms. Seven features are selected from the 16 features according to the ranks assigned by most of the above mentioned feature-selection algorithms. Predictions by historical statistical models are based solely on the predicted feature and the assumption that future instances resemble past occurrences. However, techniques, such as Random Forest, XGBOOST, Gradient Boosting, KNN, and SVR considered the influence of other significant features for predicting the result. The performance of reproduction rate prediction is measured by mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R-Squared, relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative squared error (RRSE) metrics. The performances of algorithms with and without feature selection are similar, but a remarkable difference is seen with hyperparameter tuning. The results suggest that the reproduction rate is highly dependent on many features, and the prediction should not be based solely upon past values. In the case without hyperparameter tuning, the minimum value of RAE is 0.117315935 with feature selection and 0.0968989 without feature selection, respectively. The KNN attains a low MAE value of 0.0008 and performs well without feature selection and with hyperparameter tuning. The results show that predictions performed using all features and hyperparameter tuning is more accurate than predictions performed using selected features.","Kaliappan, Jayakumar; Srinivasan, Kathiravan; Mian Qaisar, Saeed; Sundararajan, Karpagam; Chang, Chuan-Yu; C, Suganthan",Front Public Health,618,16

DESIGN Observational cohort study from March 6, 2020, to January 31, 2021. SETTING ICUs at four hospitals within an academic health center network in Atlanta, GA. PATIENTS Adults greater than or equal to 18 years with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to an ICU during the study period (i.e., Surge 1: March to April, Lull 1: May to June, Surge 2: July to August, Lull 2: September to November, Surge 3: December to January). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 1,686 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to an ICU during the study period, all-cause hospital mortality was 29.7%. Mortality differed significantly over time: 28.7% in Surge 1, 21.3% in Lull 1, 25.2% in Surge 2, 30.2% in Lull 2, 34.7% in Surge 3 (p = 0.007). Mortality was significantly associated with 1) preexisting risk factors (older age, race, ethnicity, lower body mass index, higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, admission from a nursing home); 2) clinical status at ICU admission (higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, higher D-dimer, higher C-reactive protein); and 3) ICU interventions (receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy, inhaled vasodilators). After adjusting for baseline and clinical variables, there was a significantly increased risk of mortality associated with admission during Lull 2 (relative risk, 1.37 [95% CI = 1.03-1.81]) and Surge 3 (relative risk, 1.35 [95% CI = 1.04-1.77]) as compared to Surge 1. CONCLUSIONS Despite increased experience and evidence-based treatments, the risk of death for patients admitted to the ICU with coronavirus disease 2019 was highest during the fall and winter of 2020. Reasons for this increased mortality are not clear.","Auld, Sara C; Harrington, Kristin R V; Adelman, Max W; Robichaux, Chad J; Overton, Elizabeth C; Caridi-Scheible, Mark; Coopersmith, Craig M; Murphy, David J",Critical care medicine,618,19

Psychological Functioning of Hospital Staff After the Announcement of COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic,17.36748,4.881767,2020-12-23,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of pneumonia with severe respiratory distress and outbreaks in Wuhan, China. The rapid and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier during the pandemic, there were limited genetic viral variations. As millions of people became infected, multiple single amino acid substitutions emerged. Many of these substitutions have no consequences. However, some of the new variants show a greater infection rate, more severe disease, and reduced sensitivity to current prophylaxes and treatments. Of particular importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are mutations that occur in the Spike (S) protein, the protein on the viral outer envelope that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2). Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 441,168 individual virus sequences isolated from humans throughout the world. From the individual sequences, we identified 3540 unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. Analysis of these different variants in the S protein pinpointed important functional and structural sites in the protein. This information may guide the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics to help arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pokhrel, Suman; Kraemer, Benjamin R.; Burkholz, Scott; Mochly-Rosen, Daria",Sci Rep,618,6

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific experiments textit{per se}. Rather, we intend to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown model parameters to a desired precision - all set within the complex context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Armstrong, E.; Gerardin, J.; Runge, M.",,618,30

ORF3a assemblies as homotetramers, which are stabilized by residue C133. A recent cryoEM structure of a homodimeric complex of ORF3a has been released. A lower-resolution cryoEM map of the tetramer suggests two dimers form it, arranged side by side. The dimer’s cryoEM structure revealed that each protomer contains three transmembrane helices arranged in a clockwise configuration forming a six helices transmembrane domain. This domain’s potential permeation pathway has six constrictions narrowing to about 1 Å in radius, suggesting the structure solved is in a closed or inactivated state. At the cytosol end, the permeation pathway encounters a large and polar cavity formed by multiple beta strands from both protomers, which opens to the cytosolic milieu. We modeled the tetramer following the arrangement suggested by the low-resolution tetramer cryoEM map. Molecular dynamics simulations of the tetramer embedded in a membrane and solvated with 0.5 M of KCl were performed. Our simulations show the cytosolic cavity is quickly populated by both K+ and Cl-, yet with different dynamics. K+ ions moved relatively free inside the cavity without forming proper coordination sites. In contrast, Cl- ions enter the cavity, and three of them can become stably coordinated near the intracellular entrance of the potential permeation pathway by an inter-subunit network of positively charged amino acids. Consequently, the central cavity’s electrostatic potential changed from being entirely positive at the beginning of the simulation to more electronegative at the end.","Marquez-Miranda, Valeria; Rojas, Maximiliano; Duarte, Yorley; Diaz-Franulic, Ignacio; Holmgren, Miguel; Cachau, Raul E.; Gonzalez-Nilo, Fernando D.",bioRxiv,618,24

Virus entry of HCoV-229E is mediated by its spike (S) protein, where the S1 domain facilitates attachment to host cells and the S2 domain is involved in subsequent fusion of the virus and host membranes. During the fusion process, two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, in the S2 domain assemble into a six-helix membrane-fusion structure termed the fusion core. Here, the complete fusion-core structure of HCoV-229E has been determined at 1.86 Å resolution, representing the most complete post-fusion conformation thus far among published human alphacoronavirus (α-HCoV) fusion-core structures. The overall structure of the HCoV-229E fusion core is similar to those of SARS, MERS and HCoV-NL63, but the packing of its 3HR1 core differs from those of SARS and MERS in that it contains more noncanonical ‘x’ and ‘da’ layers. Side-by-side electrostatic surface comparisons reveal that the electrostatic surface potentials are opposite in α-HCoVs and β-HCoVs at certain positions and that the HCoV-229E surface also appears to be the most hydrophobic among the various HCoVs. In addition to the highly conserved hydrophobic interactions between HR1 and HR2, some polar and electrostatic interactions are also well preserved across different HCoVs. This study adds to the structural profiling of HCoVs to aid in the structure-based design of pan-coronavirus small molecules or peptides to inhibit viral fusion.","Yan, Lei; Meng, Bing; Xiang, Jiangchao; Wilson, Ian A.; Yang, Bei",Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol,618,1
