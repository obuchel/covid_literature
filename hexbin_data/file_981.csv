366555,ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement,2020,"Dysregulation of the immune system undoubtedly plays an important and, perhaps, determining role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. While the main treatment of the COVID-19 intoxication is focused on neutralizing the excessive inflammatory response, it is worth considering an equally significant problem of the immunosuppressive conditions including immuno-paralysis, which lead to the secondary infection. Therefore, choosing a treatment strategy for the immune-mediated complications of coronavirus infection, one has to pass between Scylla and Charybdis, so that, in the fight against the “cytokine storm,” it is vital not to miss the point of the immune silence that turns into immuno-paralysis.","Kiselevskiy, Mikhail; Shubina, Irina; Chikileva, Irina; Sitdikova, Suria; Samoylenko, Igor; Anisimova, Natalia; Kirgizov, Kirill; Suleimanova, Amina; Gorbunova, Tatyana; Varfolomeeva, Svetlana",Pharmaceuticals,,981

366584,ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement,2020,"There continues to be no approved drugs for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Despite a number of candidate drugs showing limited efficacy in vitro and/or in non-human primate studies, EVD continues to plaque certain areas of Africa without any efficacious treatments yet available. Recently, we have been exploring the potential for anti-malarial drugs to inhibit an in vitro model of Ebola Zaire replication using a transcription-competent virus-like particle (trVLP) assay. We examined the efficacy of chloroquine, amodiaquine and 36 novel anti-parasite quinoline derivatives at inhibiting Ebola virus replication. Drug efficacy was tested by trVLP assay and toxicity by MTT assay. Both chloroquine and amodiaquine were effective for inhibition of Ebola virus replication without significant toxicity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of chloroquine and amodiaquine to inhibit Ebola virus replication were IC 50, Chl = 3.95 µM and IC 50, Amo = 1.45 µM, respectively. Additionally, three novel quinoline derivatives were identified as having inhibitory activity and low toxicity for Ebola trVLP replication, with 2NH2Q being the most promising derivative, with an IC 50 of 4.66 µM. Quinoline compounds offer many advantages for disease treatment in tropical climates as they are cheap to produce, easy to synthesize and chemically stable. In this report, we have demonstrated the potential of anti-parasite quinolines for further investigation for use in EVD.","Goyal, Shawn; Binnington, Beth; McCarthy, Stephen D S; Desmaële, Didier; Férrié, Laurent; Figadère, Bruno; Loiseau, Philippe M; Branch, Donald R",F1000Res,,981
366597,ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement,2020,"We experienced two cases of post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis (PILS) occurring in patients after acute coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 in a relatively narrow time period. The patients required mechanical ventilation for 9 days in one and 28 days in the other. In both cases, the patients were discharged but later developed symptoms of cough and dyspnea, which were later diagnosed as PILS. Persistent cough and dyspnea are common symptoms in both PILS and the recovery phase of severe COVID-19. For this reason, PILS should be considered in the differential diagnosis post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, the prevalence of PILS may be greater than that of other critical diseases in severe COVID-19 patients.","Miwa, Maki; Nakajima, Mikio; H Kaszynski, Richard; Hamada, Syoichiro; Nakano, Tomotsugu; Shirokawa, Masamitsu; Goto, Hideaki; Yamaguchi, Yoshihiro",Intern Med,,981
366612,ACR Convergence 2020 Abstract Supplement,2020,"Advances in digital health have enabled clinicians to move away from a reliance on face to face consultation methods towards making use of modern video and web-based conferencing technology. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote telecommunication methods have become much more common place in mental health settings. The current study sought to investigate whether remote telecommunication methods are preferable to face to face consultations for adults referred to an Autism and ADHD Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, whether there are any differences in preferred consultation methods between adults who were referred for an assessment of Autism as opposed to ADHD. 117 service users who undertook assessment by the ADHD and Autism Service at South West Yorkshire NHS Partnership Foundation Trust from April to September 2020 completed an adapted version of the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Results demonstrated that service users found remote telecommunication to be useful, effective, reliable and satisfactory. Despite this, almost half of service users stated a general preference for face to face consultations. There was no difference in the choice of methods of contact between Autism and ADHD pathways. Remote telecommunication methods were found to be an acceptable medium of contact for adults who undertook an assessment of Autism and ADHD at an NHS Service during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adamou, Marios; Jones, Sarah L; Fullen, Tim; Galab, Nazmeen; Abbott, Karl; Yasmeen, Salma",PLoS One,,981
