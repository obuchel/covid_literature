453,Segmented Helical Structure of the Neck Region of the Glycan-Binding Receptor DC-SIGNR,2009-12-11,"Carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) in the glycan-binding receptors DC-SIGN (dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 1-grabbing nonintegrin; CD209) and DC-SIGNR (DC-SIGN-related receptor, also known as L-SIGN and variously designated CD209L and CD299) are projected from the membrane surface by extended neck domains containing multiple repeats of a largely conserved 23-amino-acid sequence motif. Crystals of a fragment of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR containing multiple repeats in which each molecule extends through multiple unit cells, such that the observed crystallographic asymmetric unit represents one repeat averaged over six repeats of the protein, have been obtained. The repeats are largely α-helical. Based on the structure and arrangement of the repeats in the crystal, the neck region can be described as a series of four-helix bundles connected by short, non-helical linkers. Combining the structure of the isolated neck domain with a previously determined overlapping structure of the distal end of the neck region with the CRDs attached provides a model of the almost-complete extracellular portion of the receptor. The results are consistent with previous characterization of the extended structure for the isolated neck region and the extracellular domain. The organization of the neck suggests how CRDs may be disposed differently in DC-SIGN compared with DC-SIGNR and in variant forms of DC-SIGNR assembled from polypeptides with different numbers of repeats in the neck domain.","Feinberg, Hadar; Tso, Cynthia K.W.; Taylor, Maureen E.; Drickamer, Kurt; Weis, William I.",J Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2971551/,187
592,A Brief Review on Diagnosis of Foot-and-Mouth Disease of Livestock: Conventional to Molecular Tools,2011-07-06,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the highly contagious diseases of domestic animals. Effective control of this disease needs sensitive, specific, and quick diagnostic tools at each tier of control strategy. In this paper we have outlined various diagnostic approaches from old to new generation in a nutshell. Presently FMD diagnosis is being carried out using techniques such as Virus Isolation (VI), Sandwich-ELISA (S-ELISA), Liquid-Phase Blocking ELISA (LPBE), Multiplex-PCR (m-PCR), and indirect ELISA (DIVA), and real time-PCR can be used for detection of antibody against nonstructural proteins. Nucleotide sequencing for serotyping, microarray as well as recombinant antigen-based detection, biosensor, phage display, and nucleic-acid-based diagnostic are on the way for rapid and specific detection of FMDV. Various pen side tests, namely, lateral flow, RT-LAMP, Immunostrip tests, and so forth. are also developed for detection of the virus in field condition.","Longjam, Neeta; Deb, Rajib; Sarmah, A.

696,Normal variation in thermal radiated temperature in cattle: implications for foot-and-mouth disease detection,2011-11-21,"BACKGROUND: Thermal imagers have been used in a number of disciplines to record animal surface temperatures and as a result detect temperature distributions and abnormalities requiring a particular course of action. Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions. RESULTS: The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10°C to 36°C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation.","Gloster, John; Ebert, Katja; Gubbins, Simon; Bashiruddin, John; Paton, David J",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3235061/,187

1005,Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus,2012-12-11,"Theoretically, homogeneous environments favor the evolution of specialists whereas heterogeneous environments favor generalists. Canine distemper is a multi-host carnivore disease caused by canine distemper virus (CDV). The described cell receptor of CDV is SLAM (CD150). Attachment of CDV hemagglutinin protein (CDV-H) to this receptor facilitates fusion and virus entry in cooperation with the fusion protein (CDV-F). We investigated whether CDV strains co-evolved in the large, homogeneous domestic dog population exhibited specialist traits, and strains adapted to the heterogeneous environment of smaller populations of different carnivores exhibited generalist traits. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the SLAM binding region revealed higher similarity between sequences from Canidae species than to sequences from other carnivore families. Using an in vitro assay, we quantified syncytia formation mediated by CDV-H proteins from dog and non-dog CDV strains in cells expressing dog, lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from dog strains produced significantly higher values with cells expressing dog SLAM than with cells expressing lion or cat SLAM. CDV-H proteins from strains of non-dog species produced similar values in all three cell types, but lower values in cells expressing dog SLAM than the values obtained for CDV-H proteins from dog strains. By experimentally changing one amino acid (Y549H) in the CDV-H protein of one dog strain we decreased expression of specialist traits and increased expression of generalist traits, thereby confirming its functional importance. A virus titer assay demonstrated that dog strains produced higher titers in cells expressing dog SLAM than cells expressing SLAM of non-dog hosts, which suggested possible fitness benefits of specialization post-cell entry. We provide in vitro evidence for the expression of specialist and generalist traits by CDV strains, and fitness trade-offs across carnivore host environments caused by antagonistic pleiotropy. These findings extend knowledge on CDV molecular epidemiology of particular relevance to wild carnivores.","Nikolin, Veljko M.; Osterrieder, Klaus; von Messling, Veronika; Hofer, Heribert; Anderson, Danielle; Dubovi, Edward; Brunner, Edgar; East, Marion L.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3519774/,187
1122,Citrus tristeza virus: Evolution of Complex and Varied Genotypic Groups,2013-04-23,"Amongst the Closteroviridae, Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is almost unique in possessing a number of distinct and characterized strains, isolates of which produce a wide range of phenotype combinations among its different hosts. There is little understanding to connect genotypes to phenotypes, and to complicate matters more, these genotypes are found throughout the world as members of mixed populations within a single host plant. There is essentially no understanding of how combinations of genotypes affect symptom expression and disease severity. We know little about the evolution of the genotypes that have been characterized to date, little about the biological role of their diversity and particularly, about the effects of recombination. Additionally, genotype grouping has not been standardized. In this study we utilized an extensive array of CTV genomic information to classify the major genotypes, and to determine the major evolutionary processes that led to their formation and subsequent retention. Our analyses suggest that three major processes act on these genotypes: (1) ancestral diversification of the major CTV lineages, followed by (2) conservation and co-evolution of the major functional domains within, though not between CTV genotypes, and (3) extensive recombination between lineages that have given rise to new genotypes that have subsequently been retained within the global population. The effects of genotype diversity and host-interaction are discussed, as is a proposal for standardizing the classification of existing and novel CTV genotypes.","Harper, S.

1139,The Transient Nature of Bunyamwera Orthobunyavirus NSs Protein Expression: Effects of Increased Stability of NSs Protein on Virus Replication,2013-05-08,"The NSs proteins of bunyaviruses are the viral interferon antagonists, counteracting the host's antiviral response to infection. During high-multiplicity infection of cultured mammalian cells with Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus (BUNV), NSs is rapidly degraded after reaching peak levels of expression at 12hpi. Through the use of inhibitors this was shown to be the result of proteasomal degradation. A recombinant virus (rBUN4KR), in which all four lysine residues in NSs were replaced by arginine residues, expresses an NSs protein (NSs4KR) that is resistant to degradation, confirming that degradation is lysine-dependent. However, despite repeated attempts, no direct ubiquitylation of NSs in infected cells could be demonstrated. This suggests that degradation of NSs, although lysine-dependent, may be achieved through an indirect mechanism. Infection of cultured mammalian cells or mice indicated no disadvantage for the virus in having a non-degradable NSs protein: in fact rBUN4KR had a slight growth advantage over wtBUNV in interferon-competent cells, presumably due to the increased and prolonged presence of NSs. In cultured mosquito cells there was no difference in growth between wild-type BUNV and rBUN4KR, but surprisingly NSs4KR was not stabilised compared to the wild-type NSs protein.","van Knippenberg, Ingeborg; Fragkoudis, Rennos; Elliott, Richard M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3648540/,187
1201,Picornavirus uncoating intermediate captured in atomic detail,2013-06-03,"It remains largely mysterious how the genomes of non-enveloped eukaryotic viruses are transferred across a membrane into the host cell. Picornaviruses are simple models for such viruses, and initiate this uncoating process through particle expansion, which reveals channels through which internal capsid proteins and the viral genome presumably exit the particle, although this has not been clearly seen until now. Here we present the atomic structure of an uncoating intermediate for the major human picornavirus pathogen CAV16, which reveals VP1 partly extruded from the capsid, poised to embed in the host membrane. Together with previous low-resolution results, we are able to propose a detailed hypothesis for the ordered egress of the internal proteins, using two distinct sets of channels through the capsid, and suggest a structural link to the condensed RNA within the particle, which may be involved in triggering RNA release.","Ren, Jingshan; Wang, Xiangxi; Hu, Zhongyu; Gao, Qiang; Sun, Yao; Li, Xuemei; Porta, Claudine; Walter, Thomas S.; Gilbert, Robert J.; Zhao, Yuguang; Axford, Danny; Williams, Mark; McAuley, Katherine; Rowlands, David J.; Yin, Weidong; Wang, Junzhi; Stuart, David I.; Rao, Zihe; Fry, Elizabeth E.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3709478/,187
1436,The Expanding Functions of Cellular Helicases: The Tombusvirus RNA Replication Enhancer Co-opts the Plant eIF4AIII-Like AtRH2 and the DDX5-Like AtRH5 DEAD-Box RNA Helicases to Promote Viral Asymmetric RNA Replication,2014-04-17,"Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on recruited host factors that aid several critical steps during replication. Several of the co-opted host factors bind to the viral RNA, which plays multiple roles, including mRNA function, as an assembly platform for the viral replicase (VRC), template for RNA synthesis, and encapsidation during infection. It is likely that remodeling of the viral RNAs and RNA-protein complexes during the switch from one step to another requires RNA helicases. In this paper, we have discovered a second group of cellular RNA helicases, including the eIF4AIII-like yeast Fal1p and the DDX5-like Dbp3p and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and AtRH5 DEAD box helicases, which are co-opted by tombusviruses. Unlike the previously characterized DDX3-like AtRH20/Ded1p helicases that bind to the 3′ terminal promoter region in the viral minus-strand (−)RNA, the other class of eIF4AIII-like RNA helicases bind to a different cis-acting element, namely the 5′ proximal RIII(−) replication enhancer (REN) element in the TBSV (−)RNA. We show that the binding of AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases to the TBSV (−)RNA could unwind the dsRNA structure within the RIII(−) REN. This unique characteristic allows the eIF4AIII-like helicases to perform novel pro-viral functions involving the RIII(−) REN in stimulation of plus-strand (+)RNA synthesis. We also show that AtRH2 and AtRH5 helicases are components of the tombusvirus VRCs based on co-purification experiments. We propose that eIF4AIII-like helicases destabilize dsRNA replication intermediate within the RIII(−) REN that promotes bringing the 5′ and 3′ terminal (−)RNA sequences in close vicinity via long-range RNA-RNA base pairing. This newly formed RNA structure promoted by eIF4AIII helicase together with AtRH20 helicase might facilitate the recycling of the viral replicases for multiple rounds of (+)-strand synthesis, thus resulting in asymmetrical viral replication.","Kovalev, Nikolay; Nagy, Peter D.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990711/,187
1596,Graph-distance distribution of the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA secondary structures,2014-09-11,"BACKGROUND: Large RNA molecules are often composed of multiple functional domains whose spatial arrangement strongly influences their function. Pre-mRNA splicing, for instance, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium harbors useful information on the shape of the molecule that in turn can give insights into the interplay of its functional domains. RESULT: Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between a fixed pair of nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. While a naïve implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n(6)D(5)) for sequence length n and D distinct distance values, it is possible to reduce this to O(n(4)) for practical applications in which predominantly small distances are of of interest. Further reductions, however, seem to be difficult. Therefore, we introduced sampling approaches that are much easier to implement. They are also theoretically favorable for several real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The graph-distance distribution can be computed using a dynamic programming approach. Although a crude approximation of reality, our initial results indicate that the graph-distance can be related to the smFRET data.

1661,"Molecular Detection, Phylogenetic Analysis, and Identification of Transcription Motifs in Feline Leukemia Virus from Naturally Infected Cats in Malaysia",2014-11-17,"A nested PCR assay was used to determine the viral RNA and proviral DNA status of naturally infected cats. Selected samples that were FeLV-positive by PCR were subjected to sequencing, phylogenetic analysis, and motifs search. Of the 39 samples that were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 87.2% (34/39) were confirmed positive with nested PCR. FeLV proviral DNA was detected in 38 (97.3%) of p27-antigen negative samples. Malaysian FeLV isolates are found to be highly similar with a homology of 91% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates divided into two clusters, with a majority (86.2%) sharing similarity with FeLV-K01803 and fewer isolates (13.8%) with FeLV-GM1 strain. Different enhancer motifs including NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID are found to occur either in single, duplicate, triplicate, or sets of 5 in different positions within the U3-LTR-gag region. The present result confirms the occurrence of FeLV viral RNA and provirus DNA in naturally infected cats. Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly similar, and a majority of them are closely related to a UK isolate. This study provides the first molecular based information on FeLV in Malaysia. Additionally, different enhancer motifs likely associated with FeLV related pathogenesis have been identified.","Bande, Faruku; Arshad, Siti Suri; Hassan, Latiffah; Zakaria, Zunita",Vet Med Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251355/,187
1809,Postnatal Persistent Infection with Classical Swine Fever Virus and Its Immunological Implications,2015-05-04,"It is well established that trans-placental transmission of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) during mid-gestation can lead to persistently infected offspring. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of CSFV to induce viral persistence upon early postnatal infection. Two litters of 10 piglets each were infected intranasally on the day of birth with low and moderate virulence CSFV isolates, respectively. During six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the piglets remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the serum. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral and cellular immune response. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was a severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from the persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both, specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells. These results suggested the development of a state of immunosuppression in these postnatally persistently infected pigs. However, IL-10 was undetectable in the sera of the persistently infected animals. Interestingly, CSFV-stimulated PBMCs from the persistently infected piglets produced IL-10. Nevertheless, despite the addition of the anti-IL-10 antibody in the PBMC culture from persistently infected piglets, the response of the IFN-γ producing cells was not restored. Therefore, other factors than IL-10 may be involved in the general suppression of the T-cell responses upon CSFV and mitogen activation. Interestingly, bone marrow immature granulocytes were increased and targeted by the virus in persistently infected piglets. Taken together, we provided the first data demonstrating the feasibility of CSFV in generating a postnatal persistent disease, which has not been shown for other members of the Pestivirus genus yet. Since serological methods are routinely used in CSFV surveillance, persistently infected pigs might go unnoticed. In addition to the epidemiological and economic significance of persistent CSFV infection, this model could be useful for understanding the mechanisms of viral persistence.","Muñoz-González, Sara; Ruggli, Nicolas; Rosell, Rosa; Pérez, Lester Josué; Frías-Leuporeau, Maria Teresa; Fraile, Lorenzo; Montoya, Maria; Cordoba, Lorena; Domingo, Mariano; Ehrensperger, Felix; Summerfield, Artur; Ganges, Llilianne",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418595/,187

In this study, Lactobacillus plantarum strains NC8 and WCFS1 were used as oral delivery vehicles containing a pSIP411-VP1 recombinant plasmid to initiate mucosal and systemic immune responses in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were orally vaccinated (three doses) with NC8-pSIP411, NC8-pSIP411-VP1, WCFS1-pSIP411, WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 or milk. Animals immunized with NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 developed high levels of antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA, IgM, mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA) and neutralizing antibodies, and revealed stronger cell-mediated immune responses and enhanced protection against FMDV challenge compared with control groups.

2081,Anti-foot-and-mouth disease virus effects of Chinese herbal kombucha in vivo,2015-12-01,"The foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) is sensitive to acids and can be inactivated by exposure to low pH conditions. Spraying animals at risk of infection with suspensions of acid-forming microorganisms has been identified as a potential strategy for preventing FMD. Kombucha is one of the most strongly acid-forming symbiotic probiotics and could thus be an effective agent with which to implement this strategy. Moreover, certain Chinese herbal extracts are known to have broad-spectrum antiviral effects. Chinese herbal kombucha can be prepared by fermenting Chinese herbal extracts with a kombucha culture. Previous studies demonstrated that Chinese herbal kombucha prepared in this way efficiently inhibits FMDV replication in vitro. To assess the inhibitory effects of Chinese herbal kombucha against FMDV in vitro, swine challenged by intramuscular injection with 1000 SID(50) of swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 after treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha were partially protected against infection, as demonstrated by a lack of clinical symptoms and qRT-PCR analysis. In a large scale field trial, spraying cattle in an FMD outbreak zone with kombucha protected against infection.

2141,Classical Swine Fever Virus vs. Classical Swine Fever Virus: The Superinfection Exclusion Phenomenon in Experimentally Infected Wild Boar,2016-02-26,"Two groups with three wild boars each were used: Group A (animals 1 to 3) served as the control, and Group B (animals 4 to 6) was postnatally persistently infected with the Cat01 strain of CSFV (primary virus). The animals, six weeks old and clinically healthy, were inoculated with the virulent strain Margarita (secondary virus). For exclusive detection of the Margarita strain, a specific qRT-PCR assay was designed, which proved not to have cross-reactivity with the Cat01 strain. The wild boars persistently infected with CSFV were protected from superinfection by the virulent CSFV Margarita strain, as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs and the absence of Margarita RNA detection in serum, swabs and tissue samples. Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms.","Muñoz-González, Sara; Pérez-Simó, Marta; Colom-Cadena, Andreu; Cabezón, Oscar; Bohórquez, José Alejandro; Rosell, Rosa; Pérez, Lester Josué; Marco, Ignasi; Lavín, Santiago; Domingo, Mariano; Ganges, Llilianne",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768946/,187

Biopolymers are no exceptions: knots have long been known to occur in proteins as well as in encapsidated viral DNA. The rapidly growing number of RNA structures has recently made it possible to investigate the incidence of physical knots in this type of biomolecule, too. Strikingly, no knots have been found to date in the known RNA structures. In this Point of View Article we discuss the absence of knots in currently available RNAs and consider the reasons why knots in RNA have not yet been found, despite the expectation that they should exist in Nature.

2329,Genome-Wide Analysis of Codon Usage Bias in Epichloë festucae,2016-07-15,"Analysis of codon usage data has both practical and theoretical applications in understanding the basics of molecular biology. Differences in codon usage patterns among genes reflect variations in local base compositional biases and the intensity of natural selection. Recently, there have been several reports related to codon usage in fungi, but little is known about codon usage bias in Epichloë endophytes. The present study aimed to assess codon usage patterns and biases in 4870 sequences from Epichloë festucae, which may be helpful in revealing the constraint factors such as mutation or selection pressure and improving the bioreactor on the cloning, expression, and characterization of some special genes. The GC content with 56.41% is higher than the AT content (43.59%) in E. festucae. The results of neutrality and effective number of codons plot analyses showed that both mutational bias and natural selection play roles in shaping codon usage in this species. We found that gene length is strongly correlated with codon usage and may contribute to the codon usage patterns observed in genes. Nucleotide composition and gene expression levels also shape codon usage bias in E. festucae. E. festucae exhibits codon usage bias based on the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values of 61 sense codons, with 25 codons showing an RSCU larger than 1. In addition, we identified 27 optimal codons that end in a G or C.","Li, Xiuzhang; Song, Hui; Kuang, Yu; Chen, Shuihong; Tian, Pei; Li, Chunjie; Nan, Zhibiao",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4964511/,187
2394,Changes in serum proteins after endotoxin administration in healthy and choline-treated calves,2016-09-20,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the possible serum protein changes after endotoxin administration in healthy and choline-treated calves using proteomics. These results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of endotoxemia and the beneficial effect of choline administration in this clinical situation. METHODS: Healthy-calves (n = 20) were divided into 4 groups: Control, Choline treated (C), Lipopolysaccharide administered (LPS), and LPS + C. Control calves received 0.9 % NaCl injection. Calves in C and LPS + C groups received choline chloride (1 mg/kg/iv). Endotoxin (LPS) was injected (2 μg/kg/iv) to the calves in LPS and LPS + C groups. Serum samples were collected before and after the treatments. Differentially expressed proteins (> 1.5 fold-change relative to controls) were identified by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS: After LPS administration, 14 proteins increased, and 13 proteins decreased within 48 h as compared to controls. In the LPS group, there were significant increases in serum levels of ragulator complex protein (189-fold) and galectin-3-binding protein (10-fold), but transcription factor MafF and corticosteroid binding globulin were down regulated (≥ 5 fold). As compared with the LPS group, in LPS + C group, fibrinogen gamma-B-chain and antithrombin were up-regulated, while hemopexin and histone H4 were down-regulated. Choline treatment attenuated actin alpha cardiac muscle-1 overexpression after LPS. CONCLUSIONS: LPS administration produces changes in serum proteins associated with lipid metabolism, immune and inflammatory response, protein binding/transport, cell adhesion, venous thrombosis, cardiac contractility and blood coagulation. The administration of choline is associated with changes in proteins which can be related with its beneficial effect in this clinical situation.

The study herds were selected from farrow-to-finish herds (n=99) that entered in the PigINFO system between July 2013 and March 2015. From 1 April to 30 June 2014 (PED epidemic), any herds with clinical signs of PED and feces positive for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) on polymerase chain reaction analysis and/or immunohistochemical staining were defined as PED-positive (n=38). They were further classified into those with long PED periods (L-PED-positive; n=28) and those with short PED periods (S-PED-positive; n=10). Herds with no clinical signs of PED were classified as PED-negative (n=61). Herd-level production data, including preweaning mortality (%; PRWM), postweaning mortality (%; POWM), pigs weaned per litter (PWL), pigs born alive per litter, litters per mated female per year and pigs marketed per sow (MP), were calculated every 3 months during study period. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than PED-negative herds, and L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL. During October–December 2014, L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than PED-negative herds. The PED outbreak increased mortality and consequently reduced the numbers of marketed pigs.

Due to advances in conventional sequencing and the development of high throughput technologies, the field of sequence determination is in the process of being revolutionized. Platforms for sharing sequence information and providing standardized tools for phylogenetic analyses are becoming increasingly important. The database (DB) of the European Union (EU) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Reference Laboratory for classical swine fever offers one of the world’s largest semi-public virus-specific sequence collections combined with a module for phylogenetic analysis. The classical swine fever (CSF) DB (CSF-DB) became a valuable tool for supporting diagnosis and epidemiological investigations of this highly contagious disease in pigs with high socio-economic impacts worldwide. The DB has been re-designed and now allows for the storage and analysis of traditionally used, well established genomic regions and of larger genomic regions including complete viral genomes. We present an application example for the analysis of highly similar viral sequences obtained in an endemic disease situation and introduce the new geographic “CSF Maps” tool. The concept of this standardized and easy-to-use DB with an integrated genetic typing module is suited to serve as a blueprint for similar platforms for other human or animal viruses.","Postel, Alexander; Schmeiser, Stefanie; Zimmermann, Bernd; Becher, Paul",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127016/,187
3360,Comprehensive Analysis of Codon Usage on Rabies Virus and Other Lyssaviruses,2018-08-14,"Rabies virus (RABV) and other lyssaviruses can cause rabies and rabies-like diseases, which are a persistent public health threat to humans and other mammals. Lyssaviruses exhibit distinct characteristics in terms of geographical distribution and host specificity, indicative of a long-standing diversification to adapt to the environment. However, the evolutionary diversity of lyssaviruses, in terms of codon usage, is still unclear. We found that RABV has the lowest codon usage bias among lyssaviruses strains, evidenced by its high mean effective number of codons (ENC) (53.84 ± 0.35). Moreover, natural selection is the driving force in shaping the codon usage pattern of these strains. In summary, our study sheds light on the codon usage patterns of lyssaviruses, which can aid in the development of control strategies and experimental research.","Zhang, Xu; Cai, Yuchen; Zhai, Xiaofeng; Liu, Jie; Zhao, Wen; Ji, Senlin; Su, Shuo; Zhou, Jiyong",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121662/,187
3384,Isolation of avian nephritis virus from chickens showing enteric disorders,2018-09-18,"Runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) is one of the diseases associated with many detected viruses. In Brazil, there were reports of several enteric disease outbreaks in chickens in which avian nephritis virus (ANV) was detected; however, the role of ANV in the outbreaks and whether the virus was a causative agent of these cases of enteric diseases were not determined. The aim of this study was to isolate ANV in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryonated eggs (CEE) from the enteric contents of chickens showing signs of RSS. For this purpose, 22 samples of chicken enteric contents that were positive only for ANV were inoculated into 7 and 14-day-old SPF-CEE via the yolk sac route and incubated for 5 d, with a total of 3 passages. Virus isolation was confirmed by the presence of embryo injuries, detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR, and visualization of viral particles using electron microscopy. Therefore, the 7-day-old inoculated embryos showed dwarfism, gelatinous consistency, hemorrhage, and edema in the embryos, whereas the 14-day-old did not show any alteration. Viral RNA was detected in the embryos of both ages of inoculation, and the same viral particles were visualized. The embryos from the mock group showed no alteration and were negative for all the tests. The viral cDNA was sequenced, and the molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Brazilian isolates are more related with the ANV-1 serotype group; the sequences of these isolates showed a high percentage of nucleotide (86.4 to 94.9%) and amino acid (92.3 to 98.7%) similarity with other sequences from China, Japan, Australia, and the United States that belong to this serotype previously classified group. In this study, we isolated 8 samples of ANV in SPF-CEE from enteric content samples from chickens with RSS. In doing so, we showed the pathological injuries to the embryo caused by the virus and the molecular characterization of a part of the ORF 1b gene of the virus.","Nuñez, Luis Fabian N; Parra, Silvana H Santander; De la Torre, David; Catroxo, Marcia H; Buim, Marcos R; Chacon, Ruy V; Ferreira, Claudete S Astolfi; Piantino Ferreira, Antonio J",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6142861/,187
3458,An Alanine-to-Valine Substitution in the Residue 175 of Zika Virus NS2A Protein Affects Viral RNA Synthesis and Attenuates the Virus In Vivo,2018-10-07,"The recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV), its association with Guillain–Barré syndrome and fetal abnormalities, and the lack of approved vaccines and antivirals, highlight the importance of developing countermeasures to combat ZIKV disease. In this respect, infectious clones constitute excellent tools to accomplish these goals. However, flavivirus infectious clones are often difficult to work with due to the toxicity of some flavivirus sequences in bacteria. To bypass this problem, several alternative approaches have been applied for the generation of ZIKV clones including, among others, in vitro ligation, insertions of introns and using infectious subgenomic amplicons. Here, we report a simple and novel DNA-launched approach based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate a cDNA clone of Rio Grande do Norte Natal ZIKV strain. The sequence was identified from the brain tissue of an aborted fetus with microcephaly. The BAC clone was fully stable in bacteria and the infectious virus was efficiently recovered in Vero cells through direct delivery of the cDNA clone. The rescued virus yielded high titers in Vero cells and was pathogenic in a validated mouse model (A129 mice) of ZIKV infection. Furthermore, using this infectious clone we have generated a mutant ZIKV containing a single amino acid substitution (A175V) in the NS2A protein that presented reduced viral RNA synthesis in cell cultures, was highly attenuated in vivo and induced fully protection against a lethal challenge with ZIKV wild-type. This BAC approach provides a stable and reliable reverse genetic system for ZIKV that will help to identify viral determinants of virulence and facilitate the development of vaccine and therapeutic strategies.","Márquez-Jurado, Silvia; Nogales, Aitor; Ávila-Pérez, Ginés; Iborra, Francisco J.; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis; Almazán, Fernando",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212934/,187
3560,Preparation and Evaluation of Ribonuclease-Resistant Viral HIV RNA Standards Based on Armored RNA Technology,2018-11-11,"BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is an infectious viral agent that gradually extinguishes the immune system, resulting in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The aim of this study was to construct an RNA-positive control based on armored (AR) RNA technology, using HIV-1 RNA as a model. METHODS: The MS2 maturase, a coat protein gene (at positions 1765 to 1787) and HIV-1 pol gene were cloned into pET-32a plasmid. The prepared plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL2 (DE3), and the expression of the construct was induced by 1 mM of isopropyl-L-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at 37 °C for 16 h to obtain the fabricated AR RNA. The AR RNA was precipitated and purified using polyethylene glycol and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. RESULTS: The stability of AR RNA was evaluated by treatment with DNase I and RNase A and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and gel agarose electrophoresis. Tenfold serial dilution of AR RNA from 10(1) to 10(5) was prepared. Real-time PCR assays had a range of detection between 10(1) and 10(5). In addition, R(2) value was 0.998, and the slope of the standard curve was -3.33. CONCLUSION: Prepared AR RNA, as a positive control, could be used as a basis for launching an in-house HIV-1 virus assay and other infectious agents. It can be readily available to laboratories and HIV research centers. The AR RNA is non-infectious and highly resistant to ribonuclease enzyme and can reduce the risk of infection in the clinical laboratory.","Gholami, Mohammad; Ravanshad, Mehrdad; Baesi, Kazem; Samiee, Siamak M.; Rozbahani, Negin Hosseini; Mohraz, Minoo",Iran Biomed J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305816/,187
3627,Expanding Repertoire of Plant Positive-Strand RNA Virus Proteases,2019-01-15,"Many plant viruses express their proteins through a polyprotein strategy, requiring the acquisition of protease domains to regulate the release of functional mature proteins and/or intermediate polyproteins. Positive-strand RNA viruses constitute the vast majority of plant viruses and they are diverse in their genomic organization and protein expression strategies. Until recently, proteases encoded by positive-strand RNA viruses were described as belonging to two categories: (1) chymotrypsin-like cysteine and serine proteases and (2) papain-like cysteine protease. However, the functional characterization of plant virus cysteine and serine proteases has highlighted their diversity in terms of biological activities, cleavage site specificities, regulatory mechanisms, and three-dimensional structures. The recent discovery of a plant picorna-like virus glutamic protease with possible structural similarities with fungal and bacterial glutamic proteases also revealed new unexpected sources of protease domains. We discuss the variety of plant positive-strand RNA virus protease domains. We also highlight possible evolution scenarios of these viral proteases, including evidence for the exchange of protease domains amongst unrelated viruses.","Mann, Krin S.; Sanfaçon, Hélène",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6357015/,187
3631,A radical form of nitric oxide inhibits porcine circovirus type 2 replication in vitro,2019-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causal agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), causing large economical losses of the global swine industry. Nitric oxide (NO), as an important signaling molecule, has antiviral activity on some viruses. To date, there is little information on the role of NO during PCV2 infection. RESULTS: We used indirect fluorescence assay (IFA), TCID(50), real-time RT-qPCR and western blot assay to reveal the role of NO in restricting PCV2 replication. PCV2 replication was inhibited by a form of NO, NO(•), whereas PCV2 was not susceptible to another form of NO, NO(+). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the form of NO(•) has a potential role in the fight against PCV2 infection.","Xue, Tao; Li, Jizong; Liu, Chuanmin",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6359798/,187
3878,Novel insights into endogenous RNA viral elements in Ixodes scapularis and other arbovirus vector genomes,2019-06-18,"Many emerging arboviruses are not transmitted by traditional mosquito vectors, but by lesser-studied arthropods such as ticks, midges, and sand flies. Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways are the main antiviral defence mechanism for arthropods, which lack adaptive immunity. Non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) are one potential source of sRNAs which comprise these pathways. NIRVS are remnants of past germline RNA viral infections, where viral cDNA integrates into the host genome and is vertically transmitted. In Aedes mosquitoes, NIRVS are widespread and produce PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). These are hypothesised to target incoming viral transcripts to modulate viral titre, perhaps rendering the organism a more efficient arbovirus vector. To explore the NIRVS landscape in alternative arbovirus vectors, we validated the NIRVS landscape in Aedes spp. and then identified novel NIRVS in six medically relevant arthropods and also in Drosophila melanogaster. We identified novel NIRVS in Phlebotomus papatasi, Culicoides sonorensis, Rhipicephalus microplus, Anopheles gambiae, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Ixodes scapularis. Due to their unexpected abundance, we further characterised NIRVS in the blacklegged tick I. scapularis (n = 143). Interestingly, NIRVS are not enriched in R. microplus, another hard tick, suggesting this is an Ixodes-specific adaptation. I. scapularis NIRVS are enriched in bunya- and orthomyxo-like sequences, reflecting that ticks are a dominant host for these virus groups. Unlike in mosquitoes, I. scapularis NIRVS are more commonly derived from the non-structural region (replicase) of negative-sense viruses, as opposed to structural regions (e.g. glycoprotein). Like other arthropods, I. scapularis NIRVS preferentially integrate into genomic piRNA clusters, and serve as a template for primary piRNA production in the commonly used embryonic I. scapularis ISE6 cell line. Interestingly, we identified a two-fold enrichment of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons, in genomic proximity to NIRVS, contrasting with studeis in Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are instead associated with NIRVS formation. We characterised NIRVS phylogeny and integration patterns in the important vector, I. scapularis, revealing they are distinct from those in Aedes spp. Future studies will explore the possible antiviral mechanism conferred by NIRVS to I. scapularis,which may help the transmission of pathogenic arboviruses. Finally, this study explored NIRVS as an untapped wealth of viral diversity in arthropods.","Russo, Alice G; Kelly, Andrew G; Enosi Tuipulotu, Daniel; Tanaka, Mark M; White, Peter A",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6580184/,187
3914,African Swine Fever Virus Armenia/07 Virulent Strain Controls Interferon Beta Production through the cGAS-STING Pathway,2019-05-29,"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex, cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus that is currently expanding throughout the world. Currently, circulating virulent genotype II Armenia/07-like viruses cause fatal disease in pigs and wild boar, whereas attenuated strains induce infections with various levels of chronic illness. Sensing cytosolic dsDNA, mainly by the key DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), leads to the synthesis of type I interferon and involves signaling through STING, TBK1, and IRF3. After phosphorylation, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment and to the perinuclear region, acting as an indispensable adaptor connecting the cytosolic detection of DNA to the TBK1-IRF3 signaling pathway. We demonstrate here that attenuated NH/P68, but not virulent Armenia/07, activates the cGAS-STING-IRF3 cascade very early during infection, inducing STING phosphorylation and trafficking through a mechanism involving cGAMP. Both TBK1 and IRF3 are subsequently activated and, in response to this, a high level of beta interferon (IFN-β) was produced during NH/P68 infection; in contrast, Armenia/07 infection generated IFN-β levels below those of uninfected cells. Our results show that virulent Armenia/07 ASFV controls the cGAS-STING pathway, but these mechanisms are not at play when porcine macrophages are infected with attenuated NH/P68 ASFV. These findings show for the first time the involvement of the cGAS-STING-IRF3 route in ASFV infection, where IFN-β production or inhibition was found after infection by attenuated or virulent ASFV strains, respectively, thus reinforcing the idea that ASFV virulence versus attenuation may be a phenomenon grounded in ASFV-mediated innate immune modulation where the cGAS-STING pathway might play an important role. IMPORTANCE African swine fever, a devastating disease for domestic pigs and wild boar, is currently spreading in Europe, Russia, and China, becoming a global threat with huge economic and ecological consequences. One interesting aspect of ASFV biology is the molecular mechanism leading to high virulence of some strains compared to more attenuated strains, which produce subclinical infections. In this work, we show that the presently circulating virulent Armenia/07 virus blocks the synthesis of IFN-β, a key mediator between the innate and adaptive immune response. Armenia/07 inhibits the cGAS-STING pathway by impairing STING activation during infection. In contrast, the cGAS-STING pathway is efficiently activated during NH/P68 attenuated strain infection, leading to the production of large amounts of IFN-β. Our results show for the first time the relationship between the cGAS-STING pathway and ASFV virulence, contributing to uncover the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence and to the rational development of ASFV vaccines.","García-Belmonte, Raquel; Pérez-Núñez, Daniel; Pittau, Marco; Richt, Juergen A.; Revilla, Yolanda",J Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6613762/,187

This study aimed to determine the occurrence of one or both viruses, the risk factors associated with infection, and to develop further recommendations. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Veterinary Faculty of Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique, between March and December 2017, in 145 cats. From each of 145 cats, we took 1.5 ml of blood by jugular puncture for detection of antibodies to FIV and FeLV antigens in whole blood using a commercial test kit, DFV Test FeLV/FIV. RESULTS: We found an overall prevalence of 11.0% and 14.5% for FIV antibodies and FeLV antigens, respectively, with four (2.8%) cats coinfected by both pathogens. Male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV (odds ratio [OR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3–4.0) compared with female cats. Clinically ill cats were more likely to have a positive result for FeLV antigen infection (OR 18.8, 95% CI 5.2–68.3). Moreover, cats living in suburban areas have a greater chance of a positive result for FeLV infection (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4–9.6) compared with cats living in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: FIV and FeLV occur in cats from Maputo and possibly all over the country. Further studies should be conducted in Mozambique and other African countries to define the burden of both pathogens in cats, coinfection with other zoonotic pathogens and the possible role played by the cats on the transmission of zoonotic and opportunistic diseases to humans.","Tchamo, Cesaltina CLM; De Rugeriis, Mónica; Noormahomed, Emília V",JFMS Open Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6737869/,187
4096,siRNAs Derived from Cymbidium Mosaic Virus and Odontoglossum Ringspot Virus Down-modulated the Expression Levels of Endogenous Genes in Phalaenopsis equestris,2019-10-01,"Interplay between Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV)/Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) and its host plant Phalaenopsis equestris remain largely unknown, which led to deficiency of effective measures to control disease of P. equestris caused by infecting viruses. In this study, for the first time, we characterized viral small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) profiles in P. equestris co-infected with CymMV and ORSV through small RNA sequencing technology. CymMV and ORSV small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) demonstrated several general and specific/new characteristics. vsiRNAs, with A/U bias at the first nucleotide, were predominantly 21-nt long and they were derived predominantly (90%) from viral positive-strand RNA. 21-nt siRNA duplexes with 0-nt overhangs were the most abundant 21-nt duplexes, followed by 2-nt overhangs and then 1-nt overhangs 21-nt duplexes in infected P. equestris. Continuous but heterogeneous distribution and secondary structures prediction implied that vsiRNAs originate predominantly by direct Dicer-like enzymes cleavage of imperfect duplexes in the most folded regions of the positive strand of both viruses RNA molecular. Furthermore, we totally predicted 54 target genes by vsiRNAs with psRNATarget server, including disease/stress response–related genes, RNA interference core components, cytoskeleton-related genes, photosynthesis or energy supply related genes. Gene Ontology classification showed that a majority of the predicted targets were related to cellular components and cellular processes and performed a certain function. All target genes were down-regulated with different degree by vsiRNAs as shown by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Taken together, CymMV and ORSV siRNAs played important roles in interplay with P. equestris by down modulating the expression levels of endogenous genes in host plant.","Lan, Han-hong; Wang, Cui-mei; Chen, Shuang-shuang; Zheng, Jian-ying",Plant Pathol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788414/,187
4435,Recombinant cold shock domain containing protein is a potential antigen to detect specific antibody during early and late infections of Haemonchus contortus in goat,2020-02-03,"BACKGROUND: Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus) is one of the most important parasites that cause huge economic losses to small ruminant industry worldwide. Effective prognosis and treatment depend upon the early diagnosis of H. contortus infection. To date, no widely-approved methods for the identification of prepatent H. contortus infection are available to identify prepatent H. contortus infection properly. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of recombinant cold shock H. contortus protein (rHc-CS) during early and late infections of H. contortus in goat. RESULTS: Purified rHc-CS exhibited a clear band, with a molecular weight about 38 kDa. H. contortus eggs were not detected by fecal egg count technique from feces collected at 0 to 14 days post infection (D.P.I). However, eggs were detected at 21, 28 and 35 D.P.I. Hence, results of immunoblotting assay showed specific anti rHc-CS antibody detection in all goat sera collected at early stage (14 D.P.I) and late stage (21–103 D.P.I) of H. contortus infection. Furthermore, no cross reactivity was observed against Trichinella spiralis, Fasciola hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii or uninfected goats. Among several evaluated rHc-CS indirect-ELISA format variables, favorable antigen coating concentration was found 0.28 μg/well at 37 °C 1 h and overnight at 4 °C. Moreover, optimum dilution ratio of serum and rabbit anti-goat IgG was recorded as 1:100 and 1:4000, respectively. The best blocking buffer was 5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) while the best time for blocking, serum incubation and TMB reaction were recorded as 60, 120 and 10 min, respectively. The cut-off value for positive and negative interpretation was determined as 0.352 (OD(450)). The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of the rHc-CS, both were recorded as 100%.

The Anakinra for Pustular psoriasis: Response in a Controlled Trial (APRICOT) aims to determine the efficacy of anakinra in the treatment of PPP. This article describes the statistical analysis plan for the final analysis of this two-staged trial, which was determined prior to unblinding and database lock. This is an update to the published protocol and stage one analysis plan. METHODS: APRICOT is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of anakinra versus placebo, with two stages and an adaptive element. Stage one compared treatment arms to ensure proof-of-concept and determined the primary outcome for stage two of the trial. The primary outcome was selected to be the change in Palmoplantar Pustulosis Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI) at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include other investigator-assessed efficacy measures of disease severity, participant-reported measures of efficacy and safety measures. This manuscript describes in detail the outcomes, sample size, general analysis principles, the pre-specified statistical analysis plan for each of the outcomes, the handling of missing outcome data and the planned sensitivity and supplementary analyses for the second stage of the APRICOT trial. DISCUSSION: This statistical analysis plan was developed in compliance with international trial guidelines and is published to increase transparency of the trial analysis.

4916,Elevation of the intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during in vitro infection of transmissible gastroenteritis virus,1973,"Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) is a novel virus that has been found widely distributed in the swine population in recent years. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus.","Zhang, Zhicheng; Dai, Wei; Wang, Yang; Lu, Chengping; Fan, Hongjie",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086873/,187

We have analyzed the possible fold of facilitators and water channels of the MIP family based on structural predictions, on findings about the topology of CHIP28, and on the biophysical characteristics of water channels. We developed predictions for the following proteins: MIP26, NOD26, GLP, BIB, γ-TIP, FA-CHIP, CHIP28k, WCH-CD1, and CHIP28. We utilized Kyte Doolittle hydrophobicity, Eisenberg's amphiphilicity, Chou-Fasman-Prevelige propensities, and our own Union algorithm. We found that hydrophobic amphiphilic segments likely to be transmembrane were consistently shorter than required for α-helical segments, but of the correct length for β-strands. Turn propensity was high at frequent intervals, consistent with transmembrane β-strands. We propose that these proteins fold as porin-like 16-stranded antiparallel β-barrels. In water channels, from the size of molecules excluded, an extramembrane loop(s) would enter the pore and restrict it to a bottleneck with a width 4 Å ⩽w ⩽5 Å.

5917,A canine distemper virus epidemic in Serengeti lions (Panthera leo),1996,"OBJECTIVE: A pathogenic interaction between Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has recently been demonstrated. In addition, experimental and clinical studies identified Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization as a risk factor for P. aeruginosa pneumonia. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of antifungal treatment on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheobronchial colonization due to P. aeruginosa. DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective observational case–control study conducted in a 30-bed ICU during a 1-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and two patients intubated and ventilated for longer than 48 h with tracheobronchial colonization by Candida spp. Routine screening for Candida spp. and P. aeruginosa was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Antifungal treatment was based on medical staff decisions. Patients with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were matched (1:2) with patients without P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. In case and control patients, risk factors for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (35%) received antifungal treatment. Nineteen patients (18%) developed a P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization, and all were successfully matched. Antifungal treatment [31% vs 60%; p = 0.037, OR (95% CI) = 0.67 (0.45–0.90)], and duration of antifungal treatment (7 ± 11 vs 14 ± 14 days; p = 0.045, in case and control patients respectively) were significantly associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization. Antifungal treatment was the only variable independently associated with P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.49–0.90, p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: In patients with Candida spp. tracheobronchial colonization, antifungal treatment may be associated with reduced risk for P. aeruginosa VAP or tracheobronchial colonization.

7112,Membrane vesiculation induced by proteins of the dengue virus envelope studied by molecular dynamics simulations,2017-12-20,"A new computational methodology for the accurate numerical calculation of the Cauchy stress tensor, stress invariants, principal stress components, von Mises and Tresca tensors is developed. The methodology is based on the atomic stress approach which permits the calculation of stress tensors, widely used in continuum mechanics modeling of materials properties, using the output from the MD simulations of discrete atomic and [Formula: see text] -based coarse-grained structural models of biological particles. The methodology mapped into the software package TensorCalculator was successfully applied to the empty cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) shell to explore the evolution of mechanical stress in this mechanically-tested specific example of a soft virus capsid. We found an inhomogeneous stress distribution in various portions of the CCMV structure and stress transfer from one portion of the virus structure to another, which also points to the importance of entropic effects, often ignored in finite element analysis and elastic network modeling. We formulate a criterion for elastic deformation using the first principal stress components. Furthermore, we show that von Mises and Tresca stress tensors can be used to predict the onset of a viral capsid’s mechanical failure, which leads to total structural collapse. TensorCalculator can be used to study stress evolution and dynamics of defects in viral capsids and other large-size protein assemblies.","Kononova, Olga; Maksudov, Farkhad; Marx, Kenneth A; Barsegov, Valeri",J Phys Condens Matter,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104887/,187
7162,Combined adjuvant effect of ginseng stem-leaf saponins and selenium on immune responses to a live bivalent vaccine of Newcastle disease virus and infectious bronchitis virus in chickens,2019-04-25,"The process of inferring phylogenetic trees from molecular sequences almost always starts with a multiple alignment of these sequences but can also be based on methods that do not involve multiple sequence alignment. Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf+py). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from k-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.","Höhl, Michael; Ragan, Mark A.",Syst Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107264/,187

The development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), measurement of viral load, and availability of prophylactic medications to prevent certain opportunistic infections have dramatically altered the management of HIV infection. A total of 14 antiretroviral agents have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, 10 of which have been approved for use in pediatrics. Several new drugs are in various stages of development.

7584,Influence of the probiotic Bacillus cereus var. toyoi on the intestinal immunity of piglets,2007-12-15,"OBJECTIVE: Information on surges in critical care services including mechanical ventilator use during seasonal influenza outbreaks is limited. To potentially facilitate preparedness plans for future pandemics, we retrospectively quantitated surges in all-cause mechanical ventilator use during peak influenza for 12 consecutive years in all certified hospitals in Maryland. METHODS: Influenza testing data obtained for the Centers for Disease Control and Protection, Health and Human Services region 3, included defined peak influenza outbreak periods (PIOP), non-influenza time periods (non-ITP), and proportions of circulating influenza types for all study years. Procedure codes for mechanical ventilator use and diagnostic codes for medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI) were reviewed for every Maryland hospitalization. Daily counts of hospitalizations associated with ventilator use or MAARI during PIOP compared to non-ITP were analyzed using Poisson regression adjusted for month and year. RESULTS: Ventilator use increased during PIOP by 7% (95% CI, 5-10) over non-ITP (P < .0001) for all study years. These annual surges correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by MAARI-related hospitalizations (correlation coefficient = 0.91, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Surges in ventilator use were temporally associated with PIOP and were positively correlated with influenza season intensity, as measured by hospitalizations associated with acute respiratory illness. This information may assist resource planning for future pandemics.

This mode of inheritance was investigated by matting pigs, resistant and susceptible to the disease, and examining the offspring. Weaned piglets were repeatedly inoculated orally with 5 × 10(5) CFU per pig per day of a streptomycin resistant strain of E. coli serotype O139:K12(B):H1:F(107) and susceptibility determined by daily semiquantitative cultural examination of rectal swabs. Using results obtained from offspring. 5 boars were retrospectively assigned the genotype ss, 1 was assigned Ss, and 2 were assigned SS. Nine sows were designated ss, 8 classified Ss and 4 SS. Ninety two pigs resulted from matings regarded as ss×ss; 89 (97%) of these were resistant to colonization and oedema disease. Of the 168 pigs from Ss×ss matings, 83 (49%) were resistant, while only 13 (9%) of 146 pigs from matings with at least one SS parent were classified resistant. The results are compatible with inheritance being controlled by one locus and with susceptibility dominating resistance to oedema disease.","Bertschinger, H.U.; Stamm, M.; Vögeli, P.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117197/,187

7648,Seroepidemiology of Breda virus in cattle using ELISA,2002-11-13,"The causative agent (TGEV) of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a positive, single-stranded RNA genome. Important progress has recently been made concerning the molecular biology of TGEV. The research work of our group has been focused on two main aspects: genome structure and functional domains of the envelope proteins. TGEV genomic RNA is organised into seven regions. The sequence of six of them, i.e. the 3′ most 8300 nucleotides, has been established from cDNA clones. Three genes encoding the structural proteins, the peplomer protein E2, the transmembrane protein E1 and the nucleoprotein, have been identified. Additional open reading frames allowed for the prediction of four non-structural polypeptides, the role of which remains to be discovered. The remaining part of the genome (estimated length 20 kb) is thought to encode the polymerase. Expression of TGEV genes involves the production of six subgenomic mRNAs, which together with the virion RNA, form a 3′ terminal nested set. The peplomer glycoprotein E2 (220 kDa) is 1431 residues long and highly glycosylated. Several domains were identified, including a C-terminal anchoring region and at least four major antigenic sites, which cluster in the amino half part of the molecule. Two sites containing most of the critical neutralisation determinants are highly conserved among TGEV strains. The glycoprotein E1 (29kDa) is mostly embedded in the membrane and plays a crucial role in the virion architecture. However, a short N-terminal domain protruding out of the particle mediates complement-dependent neutralisation, and induces alpha interferon synthesis, likely through a direct interaction with the lymphocyte membrane.","Laude, Hubert; Rasschaert, Denis; Delmas, Bernard; Godet, Murielle; Gelfi, Jacqueline; Charley, Bernard",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117338/,187

The study indicated no increased risk of PRRS seropositivity for herds using artificial insemination with semen from PRRS seropositive AI-stations. Also the herd-size was non-related to the risk of PRRS seropositivity, indicating that air-borne spread of PRRS may not have been a predominant feature in Denmark. Introduction of replacement breeding animals from seropositive breeding- and multiplying herds significantly increased the risk of a herd being PRRS seropositive, as did introduction of 25 kg pigs for feeding. PRRS seropositivity was in the farmers' opinions associated with abortions in sows, early farrowing, high postweaning mortality and low weight gain in fattening pigs. However, the reported frequencies of problems were relatively low.","Mousing, J.; Permin, A.; Mortensen, S.; Bøtner, A.; Willeberg, P.",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117460/,187

Based on this finding, a sensitive, practical assay method for the virus was developed. When DEAE-dextran was incorporated in the agar overlay medium, 67N virus formed plaques in ESK cell monolayers. The cytopathic effect as well as the plaque formation were specifically inhibited by antisera against the virus. Neutralization tests were developed on the basis of these findings.

We investigated the ability of murine glial cells of different ages to stimulate clones of allospecific T lymphocytes. We also investigated the effects of supernatants from cultures of activated T cells on the immunologic recognition of MHC antigens on murine glial cells. Lymphocyte clones specific for Class I, Class II and non-MHC, background antigens were obtained from C57B1/6J-anti-DBA/2 mixed lymphocyte cultures. Glial cell cultures were prepared from newborn syngeneic (C57B1/6J) and allogeneic (DBA/2) mouse brains. Glial cultures 1–4 weeks of age were able to stimulate α-Class I-specific clones. No stimulation of α-Class II or α-background clones was noted. Incubation of glial cells with supernatants from cultures of alloantigen-activated spleen cells (C57131/0-anti-DBA/2) resulted in a decreased ability of glial cells to stimulate a-Class I responses. In contrast supernatant-treated cultures acquired the capacity to stimulate a-Class II-specific clones. No responses were noted in clones responsive to non-MHC antigens. The ability to stimulate α-Class II-specific clones was most prominent with one-week-old glial cultures and was lost by four weeks of culture. The increased susceptibility of younger glial cultures to the modulatory effects of lymphokines from activated T cells may be a factor in the increased susceptibility of the immature central nervous system to persistent viral infections and the development of autoimmune phenomena.","Birnbaum, Gary; Clinchy, Birgitta; Widmer, Michael B.",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119635/,187

Tissue chambers made of sialistic rubber tubing were surgically implanted in the subcutaneous tissue and samples of tissue chamber fluid (TCF) and inflammatory cells were collected by aspiration with a syringe. To evaluate the model for local cytokine production, two cytokine inducers, polyribinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) and fixed Aujeszky's disease virus infected PK15 cells (ADV-PK15), were injected into the tissue chambers and samples of TCF were collected 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h post injection. Poly I:C injections induced local production of interferon-α (IFN-α) as well as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the TCF but kinetic differences in the production of the cytokines were noted. Poly I:C also induced an increase in cell numbers in the TCF, mainly due to increased neutrophil numbers. Injections of ADV-PK15 induced local IFN-α production in the TCF as long as the pigs were serologically negative to ADV. Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization techniques could be applied for characterization of TCF cells. Moreover, cells recovered from the tissue chambers were viable and could be used in functional in vitro tests.

We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by (51)Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked (51)Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) (51)Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of (51)Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 ± 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc + APC (12 ± 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 ± 2.8%). Surface expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was expressed on the surface of the target oligos during this in vitro cytotoxic reaction. This may explain our previously observed MHC restriction in this reaction.

A two-colour immunofluorescence technique which combines antibodies to diverse CNS cell markers and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to the non-polymorphic region of HLA molecules was used throughout this study. In control cultures, only astrocytes expressed MHC class I, but after incubation with either IFN-γ or TNF-α oligodendrocytes acquired class I expression. Surprisingly, astrocytes became spontaneously class II positive in culture and this was greatly enhanced by IFN-γ. Other agents such as IL-2, epidermal growth factor, phorbolmyristate acetate and lectins had no effect. The expression of HLA molecules in the cells of the CNS both in basal conditions and in response to lymphokines is therefore selective and highly heterogenous, thus reflecting their intrinsic biological diversity. These findings may help to explain the features of the immunopathology of MS and also of latent viral infections of neural cells.","Mauerhoff, Thekla; Pujol-Borrell, Ricardo; Mirakian, Rita; Bottazzo, Gian Franco",J Neuroimmunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119889/,187
8025,Possible immunoenhancement of persistent viremia by feline leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein vaccines in challenge-exposure situations where whole inactivated virus vaccines were protective,2002-11-12,"Oxymatrine is one of the alkaloids extracted from Chinese herb Sophora japonica (Sophora flavescens Ait.) with activities of anti-inflammation, inhibiting immune reaction, antivirus, protecting hepatocytes and antihepatic fibrosis. However, the effect of oxymatrine on acute lung injury (ALI) has not been known yet. In this study, the effect of oxymatrine on ALI was investigated using an oleic acid-induced ALI mouse model. Morphological findings showed that the oleic acid group demonstrated a marked lung injury represented by prominent atelectasis, intraalveolar and interstitial patchy hemorrhage, edema, thickened alveolar septum, formation of hyaline membranes and the existence of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaces. While in the oxymatrine/dexamethasone group, these changes were less severe and in the vicinity of the control group. Furthermore, pretreatment with oxymatrine significantly alleviated oleic acid-induced lung injury accompanied by reduction of lung index and wet-to-dry weight ratio, decreases in serum TNF-α level and inhibition of phosphorylated p38 MAPK. These findings suggest that oxymatrine has a beneficial effect on acute lung injury induced by oleic acid in mice and may inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, by means of the inhibition of p38 MAPK.","Xu, G.L.; Yao, L.; Rao, S.Y.; Gong, Z.N.; Zhang, S.Q.; Yu, S.Q.",J Ethnopharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125571/,187

8088,Sequencing of prototype viruses in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis antigenic complex,1999-09-23,"Several groups of viruses may infect persons after ingestion and then are shed via stool. Of these, the norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are currently recognised as the most important human foodborne pathogens with regard to the number of outbreaks and people affected in the Western world. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and may lead to widespread outbreaks. The clinical manifestation of NoV infection, however, is relatively mild. Asymptomatic infections are common and may contribute to the spread of the infection. Introduction of NoV in a community or population (a seeding event) may be followed by additional spread because of the highly infectious nature of NoV, resulting in a great number of secondary infections (50% of contacts). Hepatitis A is an increasing problem because of the decrease in immunity of populations in countries with high standards of hygiene. Molecular-based methods can detect viruses in shellfish but are not yet available for other foods. The applicability of the methods currently available for monitoring foods for viral contamination is unknown. No consistent correlation has been found between the presence of indicator microorganisms (i.e. bacteriophages, E. coli) and viruses. NoV and HAV are highly infectious and exhibit variable levels of resistance to heat and disinfection agents. However, they are both inactivated at 100 °C. No validated model virus or model system is available for studies of inactivation of NoV, although investigations could make use of structurally similar viruses (i.e. canine and feline caliciviruses). In the absence of a model virus or model system, food safety guidelines need to be based on studies that have been performed with the most resistant enteric RNA viruses (i.e. HAV, for which a model system does exist) and also with bacteriophages (for water). Most documented foodborne viral outbreaks can be traced to food that has been manually handled by an infected foodhandler, rather than to industrially processed foods. The viral contamination of food can occur anywhere in the process from farm to fork, but most foodborne viral infections can be traced back to infected persons who handle food that is not heated or otherwise treated afterwards. Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. If viruses are present in food preprocessing, residual viral infectivity may be present after some industrial processes. Therefore, it is key that sufficient attention be given to good agriculture practice (GAP) and good manufacturing practice (GMP) to avoid introduction of viruses onto the raw material and into the food-manufacturing environment, and to HACCP to assure adequate management of (control over) viruses present during the manufacturing process. If viruses are present in foods after processing, they remain infectious in most circumstances and in most foods for several days or weeks, especially if kept cooled (at 4 °C). Therefore, emphasis should be on stringent personal hygiene during preparation. For the control of foodborne viral infections, it is necessary to: • Heighten awareness about the presence and spread of these viruses by foodhandlers; • Optimise and standardise methods for the detection of foodborne viruses; • Develop laboratory-based surveillance to detect large, common-source outbreaks at an early stage; and • Emphasise consideration of viruses in setting up food safety quality control and management systems (GHP, GMP, HACCP).","Koopmans, Marion; Duizer, Erwin",Int J Food Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7127053/,187

8553,Pathogenesis of Theiler's Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus,2008-04-10,"Picornaviruses are small naked icosahedral viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. According to current taxonomy, the family includes four genera: Enterouirus (polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses), Rhinovirus, Curdiouirus [encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), mengovirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)], and Aphthouirus [foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDV)]. There are also some, as yet, unclassified picornaviruses [e.g., hepatitis A virus (HAW] that should certainly be assessed as a separate genus. Studies on the molecular biology of picornaviruses might be divided into two periods: those before and after the first sequencing of the poliovirus genome. The 5'-untranslated region (5-UTR) of the viral genome was one of the unexpected problems. This segment proved to be immensely long: about 750 nucleotides or ∼10% of the genome length. There were also other unusual features (e.g., multiple AUG triplets preceding the single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes the viral polyprotein). This chapter shows that the picornaviral 5-UTRs are not only involved in such essential events as the synthesis of viral proteins and RNAs that could be expected to some extent, although some of the underlying mechanisms appeared to be quite a surprise, but also may determine diverse biological phenotypes from the plaque size or thermosensitivity of reproduction to attenuation of neurovirulence. Furthermore, a close inspection of the 5-UTR structure unravels certain hidden facets of the evolution of the picornaviral genome. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the experiments with the picornaviral5-UTRs provide important clues for understanding the functional capabilities of the eukaryotic ribosomes.","Agol, Vadim I.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130636/,187

The best known of these are subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There are a number of naturally occurring virus infections of animals that involve demyelination and many of these serve as instructive models for human demyelinating diseases. In addition to the naturally occurring diseases, many viruses have been shown to be capable of producing demyelination in experimental situations. In discussing virus-associated demyelinating disease, the chapter reviews the architecture and functional organization of the CNS and considers what is known of the interaction of viruses with CNS cells. It also discusses the immunology of the CNS that differs in several important aspects from that of the rest of the body. Experimental models of viral-induced demyelination have also been considered. Viruses capable of producing demyelinating disease have no common taxonomic features; they include both DNA and RNA viruses, enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. The chapter attempts to summarize the important factors influencing viral demyelination, their common features, and possible mechanisms.","Fazakerley, John K.; Buchmeiert, Michael J.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131186/,187

Twenty 2-day-old calves, divided into four groups, were orally inoculated with 1 × 10(6) oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum. The infected control group was unmedicated whereas the three other groups were medicated with the drug at 30, 60 and 120 μg kg(−1) day(−1), respectively, for 7 days, from Day (D) 2 to D8 post-inoculation (D 0 was inoculation day). The calves were weighed twice weekly and disease development and drug efficacy were assessed daily from D0 to D30 from consistency of feces, shedding of oocysts and mortality. Experimental C. parvum infection caused a severe clinical disease with profuse watery diarrhea, high oocyst shedding and mortality (3 out of 5) in the unmedicated group. The results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of halofuginone lactate in reducing the severity of clinical cryptosporidiosis. This efficacy was dose-dependent. The lowest dose (30 μg kg(−1) day(−1)) was not able to prevent clinical disease and mortality (3 out of 5). No clinical signs were observed with the 60 and 120 μg kg(−1) day(−1) doses, but the animals shed oocysts after drug withdrawal. This shedding was more delayed the higher the dose of drug administered, but the delayed shedding had no effect on the growth of the animals.","Naciri, Muriel; Mancassola, Roselyne; Yvoré, P.; Peeters, J.E.",Vet Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7131353/,187

This chapter examines the polio virus in regard to its virology, disease, and prevention by vaccines and chemoprophylaxis. Polio has been well controlled in most developed countries using live or inactivated vaccines. Research work has intensified using genetic engineering techniques to produce live attenuated viruses with defined and stable mutations so as to prevent reversion to virulence, and also to produce immunogenic oligopeptides or proteins for a new generation of inactivated polio vaccines. Chemotherapy is therefore not required for polio infections. In contrast, neither vaccines have been developed against rhinovirus infections, nor are the vaccines thought to have a use, unless broadly reacting antigenic determinants can be located. Several interesting but only weakly effective antiviral compounds have been selected against rhinoviruses and this is a major research area at present. Studies continue also with interferon, but because of toxicity problems these look less interesting at present. Sequence and biochemical data is now available for several additional enterovirus strains and this could open new possibilities both with antivirals or vaccines (for example synthetic peptides) in the near future.",,Perspect Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134062/,187

9791,Crystallization and preliminary X‐ray diffraction studies of the influenza C virus glycoprotein,2007-09-27,"BACKGROUND: Loss of vascular tone is a key pathophysiological feature of septic shock. Combination of gradual diastolic hypotension and tachycardia could reflect more serious vasodilatory conditions. We sought to evaluate the relationships between heart rate (HR) to diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) ratios and clinical outcomes during early phases of septic shock. METHODS: Diastolic shock index (DSI) was defined as the ratio between HR and DAP. DSI calculated just before starting vasopressors (Pre-VPs/DSI) in a preliminary cohort of 337 patients with septic shock (January 2015 to February 2017) and at vasopressor start (VPs/DSI) in 424 patients with septic shock included in a recent randomized controlled trial (ANDROMEDA-SHOCK; March 2017 to April 2018) was partitioned into five quantiles to estimate the relative risks (RR) of death with respect to the mean risk of each population (assumed to be 1). Matched HR and DAP subsamples were created to evaluate the effect of the individual components of the DSI on RRs. In addition, time-course of DSI and interaction between DSI and vasopressor dose (DSI*NE.dose) were compared between survivors and non-survivors from both populations, while ROC curves were used to identify variables predicting mortality. Finally, as exploratory observation, effect of early start of vasopressors was evaluated at each Pre-VPs/DSI quintile from the preliminary cohort. RESULTS: Risk of death progressively increased at gradual increments of Pre-VPs/DSI or VPs/DSI (One-way ANOVA, p < 0.001). Progressive DAP decrease or HR increase was associated with higher mortality risks only when DSI concomitantly increased. Areas under the ROC curve for Pre-VPs/DSI, SOFA and initial lactate were similar, while mean arterial pressure and systolic shock index showed poor performances to predict mortality. Time-course of DSI and DSI*NE.dose was significantly higher in non-survivors from both populations (repeated-measures ANOVA, p < 0.001). Very early start of vasopressors exhibited an apparent benefit at higher Pre-VPs/DSI quintile. CONCLUSIONS: DSI at pre-vasopressor and vasopressor start points might represent a very early identifier of patients at high risk of death. Isolated DAP or HR values do not clearly identify such risk. Usefulness of DSI to trigger or to direct therapeutic interventions in early resuscitation of septic shock need to be addressed in future studies.","Ospina-Tascón, Gustavo A.; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Hernandez, Glenn; Alvarez, Ingrid; Sánchez-Ortiz, Alvaro I.; Calderón-Tapia, Luis E.; Manzano-Nunez, Ramiro; Quiñones, Edgardo; Madriñan-Navia, Humberto J.; Ruiz, Juan E.; Aldana, José L.; Bakker, Jan",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7160223/,187

10402,"A rapid, quantitative assay for titration of bovine virus diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus()",2002-11-13,"Although viruses are widely distributed in fungi, their biological significance to their hosts is still poorly understood. A large number of fungal viruses are associated with latent infections of their hosts. With the exception of the killer-immune character in the yeasts, smuts, and hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus, fungal properties that can specifically be related to virus infection are not well defined. Mycoviruses are not known to have natural vectors; they are transmitted in nature intracellularly by hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryosis, and are disseminated via spores. Because fungi have a potential for plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange during extended periods of their life cycles and because they produce many types of propagules (sexual and asexual spores), often in great profusion, mycoviruses have them accessible to highly efficient means for transmission and spread. It is no surprise, therefore, that fungal viruses are not known to have an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Although extracellular transmission of a few fungal viruses have been demonstrated, using fungal protoplasts, the lack of conventional methods for experimental transmission of these viruses have been, and remains, an obstacle to understanding their biology. The recent application of molecular biological approaches to the study of mycoviral dsRNAs and the improvements in DNA-mediated fungal transformation systems, have allowed a clearer understanding of the molecular biology of mycoviruses to emerge. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the genome organization and expression strategies of the yeast L-A virus and the unencapsidated RNA virus associated with hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus. These recent advances in the biochemical and molecular characterization of the genomes of fungal viruses and associated satellite dsRNAs, as they relate to the biological properties of these viruses and to their interactions with their hosts are the focus of this chapter.","Ghabrial, Said A.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172821/,187
10432,The Morphology of Virus-Antibody Interaction,2008-06-18,"Like other enveloped viruses, La Crosse virus is capable of inducing membrane fusion after exposure to mild acid. This function is known to have biological significance at the level of the whole organism, since it has been related to infection in a mouse model. In this report the process of fusion-from-within (FFWI) for LAC and other members of the California serogroup of Bunyaviruses is characterized. Like fusion-from-without, FFWI is dependent on pH, temperature, and number of virus particles present in the supernatant of fusing cells. Electron micrographs demonstrate that LAC mediated cell membrane fusion is a rapid, multi-point event, and that other than fusion of their plasma membranes, the cells do not show any morphological change. In agreement with theory, lysosomotropic agents were capable of inhibiting La Crosse virus infection. This inhibition was not due to non-specific toxic effects on infected cells. Finally, fusion studies of other California serogroup members revealed minor differences in the pH of fusion induction in some strains. These differences were consistent with the known subtyping within the serogroup.","Pobjecky, Nadine; Smith, Jonathan; Gonzalez-Scarano, Francisco",Microb Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173064/,187

The assay is based upon detection of R-MuLV encoded p30 protein production in virus infected murine cells. The assay reagents are readily available and the assay system is amenable to automated data collection systems. Cytotoxicity evaluations are conducted in parallel to the Rauscher MuLV ELISA assay in order to assess drug-induced reductions in cell viability. Cytotoxicity evaluations are important to interpretation of the ELISA results since reductions in cell viability reduce viral protein production which would indicate an antiviral drug effect.

However, control by chemotherapy might be promising for persistent virus infections, where, owing to the slow progression of the disease, sufficient time for treatment is available. Although there are various ways in which viruses can persist in their hosts, comparative studies in vitro and in vivo reveal common features that shall be briefly reviewed. Animal models with persistent virus infections are usually difficult to experiment with because of the varying length of the incubation period brought about by the complex relationship among virus replication, immune reactions, and disease.","Streissle, G.",Adv Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173277/,187

METHODS: Women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAIs were randomized to either estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Vaginal maturation, vaginal pH, and total and individual scores of symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy were assessed at baseline and at weeks 3 and 12; sexual functioning was also evaluated using the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) questionnaire, as well as circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). RESULTS: Sixty-one women with a mean age of 59 years were included: 50 received 0.005% estriol vaginal gel and 11 received placebo. Active treatment significantly improved maturation value and pH, vaginal dryness and global scores of symptoms and signs. Active treatment also increased the total FSFI score and all the FSFI domains, with the exception of pain. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, which remained within the postmenopausal range. Estriol levels increased initially and normalized by week 12, and estradiol and estrone remained mostly undetectable throughout the study. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel showed efficacy in improving the symptoms and signs of vulvovaginal atrophy. These results, together with minimal oscillations in hormonal levels throughout the treatment, support the use of ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel as a treatment option for vulvovaginal atrophy in women with breast cancer receiving NSAIs with an indication for treatment with vaginal estrogens.","Hirschberg, Angelica Lindén; Sánchez-Rovira, Pedro; Presa-Lorite, Jesús; Campos-Delgado, Miriam; Gil-Gil, Miguel; Lidbrink, Elisabet; Suárez-Almarza, Javier; Nieto-Magro, Concepción",Menopause,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188038/,187

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of prospectively identified CDH-infants at our centre. Data from medical records and critical information systems were obtained. Baseline data included mode of delivery and infant condition. Outcome data included 24-h, 28-day, and 1 year mortality rates and management data included intensive care treatment, length of stay in the intensive care unit, time of discharge from hospital, and surgical intervention. Descriptive analyses were performed for all variables. Survivors and non-survivors were compared for baseline and treatment data. RESULTS: Ninety-five infants were identified (44% female). Of these, 77% were left-sided hernias, 52% were diagnosed prenatally, and 6.4% had concurrent malformations. The 28-day mortality rate was 21.1%, and the 1 year mortality rate was 22.1%. Of the 21 non-survivors, nine died within the first 24 h, and 10 were sufficiently stabilised to undergo surgery. A statistically significant difference was observed between survivors and non-survivors regarding APGAR score at 1 and 5 min., prenatal diagnosis, body length at birth, and delivery at OUH. CONCLUSIONS: Our outcome results were comparable to published data from other centres, including centres using ECMO.","Larsen, Ulla Lei; Jepsen, Søren; Strøm, Thomas; Qvist, Niels; Toft, Palle",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204041/,187

METHODS: We identified patients newly diagnosed with decompensated cirrhosis at a single veterans health center and followed up them for 2 years or until death. We piloted measurement of PC-ESLD QIs in all patients confirmed to have ESLD using a chart abstraction tool. RESULTS: Out of 167 patients identified using at least one sampling strategy, 62 were confirmed to meet ESLD criteria with chart abstraction. Ninety-eight percent of veterans in the cohort were male, mean age at diagnosis was 61 years, and 74% were White. The overall QI pass rate was 68% (64% for information care planning QIs and 76% for supportive care QIs). Patients receiving specialty palliative care consultation were more likely to receive information care planning QIs (67% vs. 37%, p = 0.02). The best performing sampling strategy had a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 60%. CONCLUSION: Measuring the quality of palliative care for patients with ESLD is feasible in the veteran population. Our single-center data suggest that the quality of palliative care is inadequate in the veteran population with ESLD, though patients offered specialty palliative care consultation and those affected by homelessness, drug, and alcohol abuse may receive better care. Our combination of ICD-9 codes can be used to identify a cohort of patients with ESLD, though better sensitivity and specificity may be needed.","Patel, Arpan; Asch, Steven; Antonio, Anna Liza; Kanwal, Fasiha; Lorenz, Karl; Riopelle, Deborah; Dickey, Anna; Larkin, Jennifer; Lee, Martin; Walling, Anne",Dig Dis Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223418/,187

12187,Glycoprotein gene truncation in avian metapneumovirus subtype C isolates from the United States,2008-07-29,"Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) alditol oxidase (AldO) is a soluble monomeric flavoprotein in which the flavin cofactor is covalently linked to the polypeptide chain. AldO displays high reactivity towards different polyols such as xylitol and sorbitol. These characteristics make AldO industrially relevant, but full biotechnological exploitation of this enzyme is at present restricted by laborious and costly purification steps. To eliminate the need for enzyme purification, this study describes a whole-cell AldO biocatalyst system. To this end, we have directed AldO to the periplasm or cell surface of Escherichia coli. For periplasmic export, AldO was fused to endogenous E. coli signal sequences known to direct their passenger proteins into the SecB, signal recognition particle (SRP), or Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. In addition, AldO was fused to an ice nucleation protein (INP)-based anchoring motif for surface display. The results show that Tat-exported AldO and INP-surface-displayed AldO are active. The Tat-based system was successfully employed in converting xylitol by whole cells, whereas the use of the INP-based system was most likely restricted by lipopolysaccharide LPS in wild-type cells. It is anticipated that these whole-cell systems will be a valuable tool for further biological and industrial exploitation of AldO and other cofactor-containing enzymes.","van Bloois, Edwin; Winter, Remko T.; Janssen, Dick B.; Fraaije, Marco W.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2690846/,187
12370,Corrigendum: Optogenetic dissection of ictal propagation in the hippocampal–entorhinal cortex structures,2016-06-14,"The genetics of eye colour has been extensively studied over the past few years, and the identified polymorphisms have been applied with marked success in the field of Forensic DNA Phenotyping. A picture that arises from evaluation of the currently available eye colour prediction markers shows that only the analysis of HERC2-OCA2 complex has similar effectiveness in different populations, while the predictive potential of other loci may vary significantly. Moreover, the role of gender in the explanation of human eye colour variation should not be neglected in some populations. In the present study, we re-investigated the data for 1020 Polish individuals and using neural networks and logistic regression methods explored predictive capacity of IrisPlex SNPs and gender in this population sample. In general, neural networks provided higher prediction accuracy comparing to logistic regression (AUC increase by 0.02–0.06). Four out of six IrisPlex SNPs were associated with eye colour in the studied population. HERC2 rs12913832, OCA2 rs1800407 and SLC24A4 rs12896399 were found to be the most important eye colour predictors (p < 0.007) while the effect of rs16891982 in SLC45A2 was less significant. Gender was found to be significantly associated with eye colour with males having ~1.5 higher odds for blue eye colour comparing to females (p = 0.002) and was ranked as the third most important factor in blue/non-blue eye colour determination. However, the implementation of gender into the developed prediction models had marginal and ambiguous impact on the overall accuracy of prediction confirming that the effect of gender on eye colour in this population is small. Our study indicated the advantage of neural networks in prediction modeling in forensics and provided additional evidence for population specific differences in the predictive importance of the IrisPlex SNPs and gender.","Pośpiech, Ewelina; Karłowska-Pik, Joanna; Ziemkiewicz, Bartosz; Kukla, Magdalena; Skowron, Małgorzata; Wojas-Pelc, Anna; Branicki, Wojciech",Int J Legal Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4912978/,187

12990,Metabolic Dysregulation in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,2020-08-07,"Global pandemic management represents a serious issue for health systems. In some cases, repurposing of existing medications might help find compounds that have the unexpected potential to combat microorganisms. In the same way, changing cell–drug interaction by nanotechnology could represent an innovative strategy to fight infectious diseases. Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most alarming worldwide infectious diseases and there is an urgent need for new drugs and treatments, particularly for the emergence and spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. New nanotechnologies based on carbon nanomaterials are now being considered to improve anti-TB treatments, and graphene oxide (GO) showed interesting properties as an anti-TB drug. GO, which preferentially accumulates in the lungs and is degraded by macrophagic peroxidases, can trap Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mtb in a dose-dependent manner, reducing the entry of bacilli into macrophages. In this paper, combinations of isoniazid (INH), amikacin (AMK) and linezolid (LZD) and GO anti-mycobacterial properties were evaluated against Mtb H37Rv by using a checkerboard assay or an in vitro infection model. Different GO effects have been observed when incubated with INH, AMK or LZD. Whereas the INH and AMK anti-mycobacterial activities were blocked by GO co-administration, the LZD bactericidal effect increased in combination with GO. GO-LZD significantly reduced extracellular mycobacteria during infection and was able to kill internalized bacilli. GO-LZD co-administration is potentially a new promising anti-TB treatment at the forefront in fighting emerging antibiotic-resistant Mtb strains where LZD administration is suggested. This innovative pharmacological approach may lead to reduced treatment periods and decreased adverse effects. More importantly, we demonstrate how nanomaterials–drugs combinations can represent a possible strategy to quickly design drugs for pandemics treatment.","De Maio, Flavio; Palmieri, Valentina; Santarelli, Giulia; Perini, Giordano; Salustri, Alessandro; Palucci, Ivana; Sali, Michela; Gervasoni, Jacopo; Primiano, Aniello; Ciasca, Gabriele; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; De Spirito, Marco; Delogu, Giovanni; Papi, Massimiliano",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7466666/,187

The emergence of methicillin-resistant (MRSA), as well as vancomycin-resistant (VRSA) strains of S. aureus, poses a massive threat to human health. The tenacity of S. aureus to acquire resistance against numerous antibiotics in a very short duration makes the effort towards developing new antibiotics almost futile. S. aureus owes its destructive pathogenicity to the plethora of virulent factors it produces among which a majority of them are moonlighting proteins. Moonlighting proteins are the multifunctional proteins in which a single protein, with different oligomeric conformations, perform multiple independent functions in different cell compartments. Peculiarly, proteins involved in key ancestral functions and metabolic pathways typically exhibit moonlighting functions. Pathogens mainly employ those proteins as virulent factors which exhibit high structural conservation towards their host counterparts. Consequentially, the host immune system counteracts these invading bacterial virulent factors with minimal protective action. Additionally, many moonlighting proteins also play multiple roles in various stages of pathogenicity while augmenting the virulence of the bacterium. This has necessitated elaborative studies to be conducted on moonlighting proteins of S. aureus that can serve as drug targets. This review is a small effort towards understanding the role of various moonlighting proteins in the pathogenicity of S. aureus.","Hemmadi, Vijay; Biswas, Malabika",Arch Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7551524/,187

The present study investigated how the accuracy of self-reported body weight in adolescent girls is affected by overweight/obesity, race/ethnicity, and mental health factors. Methods: In a cohort of girls who participated in the Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls at ages 11 and 17 (n = 588), self-reported and measured weight were compared, and linear regression models were fitted to model the over- or underreporting. The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to calculate depressive symptom subscales for negative affect, anhedonia and somatic symptoms. Results: Allowing 3% difference between self-reported and measured weight for the correct reporting of body weight, 59.2% of girls reported their weight correctly, 30.3% underreported (−5.8 ± 4.8 kg), and 10.5% overreported (4.3 ± 3.5 kg). The average difference between self-reported and measured body weight was −1.5 ± 4.3 kg (p < 0.001). Factors for misreporting body weight were overweight (β ± SE − 2.60 ± 0.66%), obesity (β ± SE − 2.41 ± 0.71%), weight change between ages 11 and 17 (β ± SE − 0.35 ± 0.04% for each kg), height change between ages 11 and 17 (β ± SE 0.29 ± 0.10% for each cm), and negative affect (β ± SE − 0.18 ± 0.08% for each score unit).

The standard analyses used for their detection have significant limitations regarding cost, special facilities and equipment, highly trained staff, and a long procedural time that can be crucial for foodborne pathogens with high hospitalization and mortality rates, such as Listeria monocytogenes. This study aimed to develop a biosensor that could detect L. monocytogenes rapidly and robustly. For this purpose, a cell-based biosensor technology based on the Bioelectric Recognition Assay (BERA) and a portable device developed by EMBIO Diagnostics, called B.EL.D (Bio Electric Diagnostics), were used. Membrane engineering was performed by electroinsertion of Listeria monocytogenes homologous antibodies into the membrane of African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells. The newly developed biosensor was able to detect the pathogen’s presence rapidly (3 min) at concentrations as low as 10(2) CFU mL(−1), demonstrating a higher sensitivity than most existing biosensor-based methods. In addition, lack of cross-reactivity with other Listeria species, as well as with Escherichia coli, was shown, thus, indicating biosensor’s significant specificity against L. monocytogenes.","Hadjilouka, Agni; Loizou, Konstantinos; Apostolou, Theofylaktos; Dougiakis, Lazaros; Inglezakis, Antonios; Tsaltas, Dimitrios",Biosensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7698059/,187

Type I interferons (IFNs) that exert their antiviral functions by interacting with the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) play a central role in host cellular responses to viruses. Given that virus-induced excessive toxic inflammatory responses are associated with aberrant IFNAR signaling and considering MCs are an early source of inflammatory cytokines during viral infections, we sought to determine whether IFNAR signaling plays a role in antiviral cytokine responses of MCs. IFNAR-intact, IFNAR-blocked, and IFNAR-knockout (IFNAR(−/−)) bone-marrow-derived MCs (BMMCs) were treated in vitro with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSVΔm51) to assess cytokine production by these cells. All groups of MCs produced the cytokines interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in response to rVSVΔm51. However, production of the cytokines was lowest in IFNAR-intact cells as compared with IFNAR(−/−) or IFNAR-blocked cells at 20 h post-stimulation. Surprisingly, rVSVΔm51 was capable of infecting BMMCs, but functional IFNAR signaling was able to protect these cells from virus-induced death. This study showed that BMMCs produced pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to rVSVΔm51 and that IFNAR signaling was required to down-modulate these responses and protect the cells from dying from viral infection.","Darzianiazizi, Maedeh; Mehrani, Yeganeh; Chan, Lily; Mould, Robert C.; Kulkarni, Raveendra R.; Sharif, Shayan; Bridle, Byram W.; Karimi, Khalil",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7729593/,187

Unlike solid state transducers, reagents related to molecular recognition and signal amplification can be incorporated into the lipid grating ink volume prior to fabrication. Here we describe a strategy for functionalizing lipid multilayer gratings with a DNA aptamer for the protein thrombin that allows label-free analyte detection. A double cholesterol-tagged, double-stranded DNA linker was used to attach the aptamer to the lipid gratings. This approach was found to be sufficient for binding fluorescently labeled thrombin to lipid multilayers with micrometer-scale thickness. In order to achieve label-free detection with the sub-100 nm-thick lipid multilayer grating lines, the binding affinity was improved by varying the lipid composition. A colorimetric image analysis of the light diffracted from the gratings using a color camera was then used to identify the grating nanostructures that lead to an optimal signal. Lipid composition and multilayer thickness were found to be critical parameters for the signal transduction from the aptamer functionalized lipid multilayer gratings.","Prommapan, Plengchart; Brljak, Nermina; Lowry, Troy W.; Van Winkle, David; Lenhert, Steven",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762078/,187

Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) acquired nearest to the HRCT were collected. Images were analyzed by two radiologists using a qualitative method, based on HRCT fibrosis visual score, and using a quantitative method, based on histogram-based analysis. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between HRCT fibrosis score and PFTs; in addition, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationships between HRCT fibrosis score and quantitative index and between quantitative indexes and PFTs.

15191,Molecular detection and genotyping of bovine viral diarrhea virus in Western China,2021-02-02,"Due to the continued high incidence and mortality rate worldwide, there is a need to develop new strategies for the quick, precise, and valuable recognition of presenting injury pattern in traumatized and poly-traumatized patients. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been shown to facilitate intercellular communication processes between cells in close proximity as well as distant cells in healthy and disease organisms. miRNAs and proteins transferred by EVs play biological roles in maintaining normal organ structure and function under physiological conditions. In pathological conditions, EVs change the miRNAs and protein cargo composition, mediating or suppressing the injury consequences. Therefore, incorporating EVs with their unique protein and miRNAs signature into the list of promising new biomarkers is a logical next step. In this review, we discuss the general characteristics and technical aspects of EVs isolation and characterization. We discuss results of recent in vitro, in vivo, and patients study describing the role of EVs in different inflammatory diseases and traumatic organ injuries. miRNAs and protein signature of EVs found in patients with acute organ injury are also debated.","Weber, Birte; Franz, Niklas; Marzi, Ingo; Henrich, Dirk; Leppik, Liudmila",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7856451/,187
15759,A family of ionic supersalts with covalent-like directionality and unconventional multiferroicity,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND: Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that has caused major health problems. Variations in dengue virus (DENV) genes are important features of epidemic outbreaks. However, the associations of DENV genes with epidemic potential have not been extensively examined. Here, we assessed new genotype invasion of DENV-1 isolated from Guangzhou in China to evaluate associations with epidemic outbreaks. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used DENV-1 strains isolated from sera of dengue cases from 2002 to 2016 in Guangzhou for complete genome sequencing. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed to elucidate the genotype characteristics and determine if new genotype invasion was correlated with major outbreaks. In our study, a new genotype invasion event was observed during each significant outbreak period in 2002–2003, 2006–2007, and 2013–2014. Genotype II was the main epidemic genotype in 2003 and before. Invasion of genotype I in 2006 caused an unusual outbreak with 765 cases (relative risk [RR] = 16.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.41–21.25). At the middle and late stages of the 2013 outbreak, genotype III was introduced to Guangzhou as a new genotype invasion responsible for 37,340 cases with RR 541.73 (95% CI 417.78–702.45), after which genotypes I and III began co-circulating. Base mutations occurred after new genotype invasion, and the gene sequence of NS3 protein had the lowest average similarity ratio (99.82%), followed by the gene sequence of E protein (99.86%), as compared to the 2013 strain. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genotype replacement and co-circulation of multiple DENV-1 genotypes were observed. New genotype invasion was highly correlated with local unusual outbreaks. In addition to DENV-1 genotype I in the unprecedented outbreak in 2014, new genotype invasion by DENV-1 genotype III occurred in Guangzhou.

For COPD, the benefit appears to be limited to individuals with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels <25 nmol/L. We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effect that monthly, high-dose vitamin D supplementation (versus placebo) had on older adults with asthma and/or COPD. Specifically, we investigated whether vitamin D supplementation prevented exacerbations of these conditions. Participants were randomly assigned either to an initial oral dose of 200,000 IU vitamin D3 followed by 100,000 IU monthly or to placebo, with an average follow-up period of 3.3 years. Among the 5110 participants, 775 had asthma or COPD at the beginning of the study, and were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Exacerbations were defined by the prescription of a short-burst of oral corticosteroids. The mean age of the participants was 67 years old, and 56% were male. The mean baseline blood 25OHD level was 63 nmol/L; 2.3% were <25 nmol/L. Overall, we found that vitamin D supplementation did not affect the exacerbation risk (hazard ratio 1.08; 95%CI 0.84–1.39). Among those with baseline 25OHD <25 nmol/L, however, the hazard ratio was 0.11 (95%CI 0.02–0.51); p for interaction = 0.001. Although monthly vitamin D supplementation had no overall impact on risk of exacerbations of asthma or COPD, we found evidence of a probable benefit among those with severe vitamin D deficiency.","Camargo, Carlos A.; Toop, Les; Sluyter, John; Lawes, Carlene M.

Targeted gene panel sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in the IKBKB gene of a patient with immune dysregulation and combined T and B cell functional defects. PBMCs from the patient, Ikbkb Y397H mice, and transfected cells were used to elucidate how the Y395H mutation triggers IKKβ deficiency and impairs immune function. Here, we found that cells from both the patient and Ikbkb Y397H mice lacked or showed decreased levels of IKKβ protein, along with impaired lymphocyte function. IKKα and IKKγ protein expression by human PBMCs harboring the Y395H mutation was normal, but degradation of IKKβ protein was accelerated. Binding of human NF-κB to DNA in patient PBMCs fell upon stimulation with TNF-α or LPS. Additionally, a structural model of Y395H revealed loss of the hydrogen bond with D389. These data suggest that IKBKB deficiency induces abnormal IKKβ protein degradation, leading to impaired NF-κB signaling and immune function. We postulate that the Y395H variant in the IKKβ protein lost the hydrogen bond with D389, thereby affecting interaction between Y395 and D389 and increasing protein instability.","Qin, Tao; Jia, Yanjun; Liu, Yuhang; Dai, Rongxin; Zhou, Lina; Okada, Satoshi; Tsumura, Miyuki; Ohnishi, Hidenori; Kato, Zenichiro; Kanegane, Hirokazu; Sun, Xiulian; Zhao, Xiaodong",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7917045/,187

However, it has not been objectively and systematically compared against Illumina short-read sequencers. FINDINGS: By using the same KOREF sample, the Korean Reference Genome, we have compared 7 sequencing platforms including BGISEQ-500, DNBSEQ-T7, HiSeq2000, HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000, HiSeqX10, and NovaSeq6000. We measured sequencing quality by comparing sequencing statistics (base quality, duplication rate, and random error rate), mapping statistics (mapping rate, depth distribution, and percent GC coverage), and variant statistics (transition/transversion ratio, dbSNP annotation rate, and concordance rate with single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] genotyping chip) across the 7 sequencing platforms. We found that MGI platforms showed a higher concordance rate for SNP genotyping than HiSeq2000 and HiSeq4000. The similarity matrix of variant calls confirmed that the 2 MGI platforms have the most similar characteristics to the HiSeq2500 platform. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MGI and Illumina sequencing platforms showed comparable levels of sequencing quality, uniformity of coverage, percent GC coverage, and variant accuracy; thus we conclude that the MGI platforms can be used for a wide range of genomics research fields at a lower cost than the Illumina platforms.","Kim, Hak-Min; Jeon, Sungwon; Chung, Oksung; Jun, Je Hoon; Kim, Hui-Su; Blazyte, Asta; Lee, Hwang-Yeol; Yu, Youngseok; Cho, Yun Sung; Bolser, Dan M; Bhak, Jong",Gigascience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953489/,187

Here, we applied recently-invented library-scale antibody screening technologies to determine comprehensive functional molecular and genetic profiles of naturally elicited human anti-ZIKV antibodies in three convalescent individuals. We leveraged natively paired antibody yeast display and NGS to predict antibody cross-reactivities and coarse-grain antibody affinities, to perform in-depth immune profiling of IgM, IgG, and IgA antibody repertoires in peripheral blood, and to reveal virus maturation state-dependent antibody interactions.

THERAFLEX UV-Platelets, a novel ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based PR technology for platelet concentrates, works without photoactive substances. This randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter, non-inferiority trial was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of UVC-treated platelets to that of untreated platelets in thrombocytopenic patients with hematologic-oncologic diseases. The primary objective was to determine non-inferiority of UVC-treated platelets, assessed by the 1-hour corrected count increment (CCI) in up to eight per-protocol platelet transfusion episodes. Analysis of the 171 eligible patients showed that the defined non-inferiority margin of 30% of UVC-treated platelets was narrowly missed as the mean differences in 1-hour CCI between standard platelets versus UVC-treated platelets for intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were 18.2% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 6.4-30.1) and 18.7% (95% CI: 6.3-31.1), respectively. In comparison to the control, the UVC group had a 19.2% lower mean 24-hour CCI and was treated with an about 25% higher number of platelet units, but the average number of days to the next platelet transfusion did not differ significantly between both treatment groups. The frequency of low-grade adverse events was slightly higher in the UVC group and the frequencies of refractoriness to platelet transfusion, platelet alloimmunization, severe bleeding events, and red blood cell transfusions were comparable between groups. Our study suggests that transfusion of pathogen-reduced platelets produced with the UVC technology is safe but non-inferiority was not demonstrated. (clinicaltrials gov.

ART has a considerable impact on viral replication and host immunity. The production of type I interferon (IFN) is key to the innate immune response to viral infections. The STING and cGAS proteins have proven roles in the antiviral cascade. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of ART on innate immunity, which was represented by STING and cGAS gene expression and plasma IFN-α level. METHODS: This cohort study evaluated a group of 33 individuals who were initially naïve to therapy and who were treated at a reference center and reassessed 12 months after starting ART. Gene expression levels and viral load were evaluated by real-time PCR, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte counts by flow cytometry, and IFN-α level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: From before to after ART, the CD4(+) T cell count and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio significantly increased (p < 0.0001), the CD8(+) T cell count slightly decreased, and viral load decreased to undetectable levels in most of the group (84.85%). The expression of STING and cGAS significantly decreased (p = 0.0034 and p = 0.0001, respectively) after the use of ART, but IFN-α did not (p = 0.1558). Among the markers evaluated, the only markers that showed a correlation with each other were STING and CD4(+) T at the time of the first collection. CONCLUSIONS: ART provided immune recovery and viral suppression to the studied group and indirectly downregulated the STING and cGAS genes. In contrast, ART did not influence IFN-α. The expression of STING and cGAS was not correlated with the plasma level of IFN-α, which suggests that there is another pathway regulating this cytokine in addition to the STING–cGAS pathway.

The anti-viral function of SAMHD1 is associated with its dNTPase activity, which is regulated by several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitination. Our recent studies also demonstrated that the E3 SUMO ligase PIAS1 functions as an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) restriction factor. However, whether SAMHD1 is regulated by PIAS1 to restrict EBV replication remains unknown. RESULTS: In this study, we showed that PIAS1 interacts with SAMHD1 and promotes its SUMOylation. We identified three lysine residues (K469, K595 and K622) located on the surface of SAMHD1 as the major SUMOylation sites. We demonstrated that phosphorylated SAMHD1 can be SUMOylated by PIAS1 and SUMOylated SAMHD1 can also be phosphorylated by viral protein kinases. We showed that SUMOylation-deficient SAMHD1 loses its anti-EBV activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SAMHD1 is associated with EBV genome in a PIAS1-dependent manner.

Up to now, information available on the pharmacology and toxicology of these new substances is very limited, posing a considerable challenge for prevention and treatment. The present in vitro study investigated the possible mechanisms of toxicity of two emerging NPS (i) 4′-methyl-alpha-pyrrolidinoexanophenone (3,4-MDPHP), a synthetic cathinone, and (ii) 2-chloro-4,5-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (2-Cl-4,5-MDMA), a phenethylamine.

Herein, senescence of lung epithelial cells following RT-induced cellular stress, or more precisely the respective altered secretory profile, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), was suggested as a central process for the initiation and progression of pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. We previously reported that abrogation of certain aspects of the secretome of senescent lung cells, in particular, signaling inhibition of the SASP-factor Ccl2/Mcp1 mediated radioprotection especially by limiting endothelial dysfunction. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a combined metformin treatment to protect normal lung tissue from RT-induced senescence and associated lung injury using a preclinical mouse model of radiation-induced pneumopathy. Metformin treatment efficiently limited RT-induced senescence and SASP expression levels, thereby limiting vascular dysfunctions, namely increased vascular permeability associated with increased extravasation of circulating immune and tumor cells early after irradiation (acute effects). Complementary in vitro studies using normal lung epithelial cell lines confirmed the senescence-limiting effect of metformin following RT finally resulting in radioprotection, while fostering RT-induced cellular stress of cultured malignant epithelial cells accounting for radiosensitization. The radioprotective action of metformin for normal lung tissue without simultaneous protection or preferable radiosensitization of tumor tissue might increase tumor control probabilities and survival because higher radiation doses could be used.","Hansel, Christine; Barr, Samantha; Schemann, Alina V.; Lauber, Kirsten; Hess, Julia; Unger, Kristian; Zitzelsberger, Horst; Jendrossek, Verena; Klein, Diana",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268757/,187
19032,Metformin Protects against Radiation-Induced Acute Effects by Limiting Senescence of Bronchial-Epithelial Cells,2021-06-30,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The relationship between melatonin and breast cancer has been widely described. On the other hand, in recent years, an imbalance in the composition of the intestinal bacterial population has been linked as another possible trigger for this disease. Given that changes in the gut microbiota have been observed to stimulate the kinurenine pathway, reducing circulating melatonin levels, in this review, we summarize the relationship between circadian disruption and breast cancer, as well as the connection with dysbiosis as possible causing this pathology due to a series of changes that lead to an increase in circulating estrogen levels. ABSTRACT: In this review we summarize a possible connection between gut microbiota, melatonin production, and breast cancer. An imbalance in gut bacterial population composition (dysbiosis), or changes in the production of melatonin (circadian disruption) alters estrogen levels. On the one hand, this may be due to the bacterial composition of estrobolome, since bacteria with β-glucuronidase activity favour estrogens in a deconjugated state, which may ultimately lead to pathologies, including breast cancer. On the other hand, it has been shown that these changes in intestinal microbiota stimulate the kynurenine pathway, moving tryptophan away from the melatonergic pathway, thereby reducing circulating melatonin levels. Due to the fact that melatonin has antiestrogenic properties, it affects active and inactive estrogen levels. These changes increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Additionally, melatonin stimulates the differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes, which have low estrogen levels due to the fact that adipocytes do not express aromatase. Consequently, melatonin also reduces the risk of breast cancer. However, more studies are needed to determine the relationship between microbiota, melatonin, and breast cancer, in addition to clinical trials to confirm the sensitizing effects of melatonin to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and its ability to ameliorate or prevent the side effects of these therapies.","Laborda-Illanes, Aurora; Sánchez-Alcoholado, Lidia; Boutriq, Soukaina; Plaza-Andrades, Isaac; Peralta-Linero, Jesús; Alba, Emilio; González-González, Alicia; Queipo-Ortuño, María Isabel",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8269379/,187

19850,Identification of a Chitooligosaccharide Mechanism against Bacterial Leaf Blight on Rice by In Vitro and In Silico Studies,2021-07-27,"Psoriasis (PS) is a skin disease with autoimmune features mediated by immune cells, which typically presents inflammatory erythematous plaques, and is associated with many comorbidities. PS exhibits excessive keratinocyte proliferation, and a high number of immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 lymphocytes, and mast cells (MCs). MCs are of hematopoietic origin, derived from bone marrow cells, which migrate, mature, and reside in vascularized tissues. They can be activated by antigen-provoking overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, and release a number of mediators including interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-33. IL-1, released by activated keratinocytes and MCs, stimulates skin macrophages to release IL-36—a powerful proinflammatory IL-1 family member. IL-36 mediates both innate and adaptive immunity, including chronic proinflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. Suppression of IL-36 could result in a dramatic improvement in the treatment of psoriasis. IL-36 is inhibited by IL-36Ra, which binds to IL-36 receptor ligands, but suppression can also occur by binding IL-38 to the IL-36 receptor (IL-36R). IL-38 specifically binds only to IL-36R, and inhibits human mononuclear cells stimulated with IL-36 in vitro, sharing the effect with IL-36Ra. Here, we report that inflammation in psoriasis is mediated by IL-1 generated by MCs—a process that activates macrophages to secrete proinflammatory IL-36 inhibited by IL-38. IL-37 belongs to the IL-1 family, and broadly suppresses innate inflammation via IL-1 inhibition. IL-37, in murine models of inflammatory arthritis, causes the suppression of joint inflammation through the inhibition of IL-1. Therefore, it is pertinent to think that IL-37 can play an inhibitory role in inflammatory psoriasis. In this article, we confirm that IL-38 and IL-37 cytokines emerge as inhibitors of inflammation in psoriasis, and hold promise as an innovative therapeutic tool.","Conti, Pio; Pregliasco, Fabrizio E.; Bellomo, Rosa G.; Gallenga, Carla E.; Caraffa, Alessandro; Kritas, Spyros K.; Lauritano, Dorina; Ronconi, Gianpaolo",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8348737/,187

In recent years, many studies have focused on EVs, with promising results indicating their potential role as biomarkers in MS and helping us better understand the pathogenesis of the disease. Recent evidence suggests that there are novel subpopulations of EVs according to cell origin, with those derived from cells belonging to the nervous and immune systems providing information regarding inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, astrocyte and microglia reaction, blood–brain barrier permeability, leukocyte transendothelial migration, and ultimately synaptic loss and neuronal death in MS. These biomarkers can also provide insight into disease activity and progression and can differentiate patients’ disease phenotype. This information can enable new pathways for therapeutic target discovery, and consequently the development of novel treatments. Recent evidence also suggests that current disease modifying treatments (DMTs) for MS modify the levels and content of circulating EVs. EVs might also serve as biomarkers to help monitor the response to DMTs, which could improve medical decisions concerning DMT initiation, choice, escalation, and withdrawal. Furthermore, EVs could act not only as biomarkers but also as treatment for brain repair and immunomodulation in MS. EVs are considered excellent delivery vehicles. Studies in progress show that EVs containing myelin antigens could play a pivotal role in inducing antigen-specific tolerance of autoreactive T cells as a novel strategy for the treatment as “EV-based vaccines” for MS. This review explores the breakthrough role of nervous and immune system cell-derived EVs as markers of pathological disease mechanisms and potential biomarkers of treatment response in MS. In addition, this review explores the novel role of EVs as vehicles for antigen delivery as a therapeutic vaccine to restore immune tolerance in MS autoimmunity.","Gutiérrez-Fernández, María; de la Cuesta, Fernando; Tallón, Antonio; Cuesta, Inmaculada; Fernández-Fournier, Mireya; Laso-García, Fernando; Gómez-de Frutos, Mari Carmen; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio; Otero-Ortega, Laura",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8396540/,187
20447,Molecular Hydrogen as a Novel Antitumor Agent: Possible Mechanisms Underlying Gene Expression,2021-08-13,"Postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery is typically caused by the patient’s own conjunctival normal bacterial flora. A three-step approach is recommended to prevent endophthalmitis: (1) “border control” to prevent microorganisms from entering the eye by disinfecting the ocular surface is the most important measure; (2) bacteria that have gained access into the anterior chamber are reduced by irrigation; (3) bacteria remaining in the anterior chamber and vitreous at the end of surgery are controlled by antibacterial drugs. We have devised a method, “the Shimada technique”, for irrigating the ocular surface with povidone-iodine, a disinfectant with potent microbicidal effect and established effective and safe concentrations for eye tissues. Povidone-iodine exhibits a bactericidal effect for a wide concentration range of 0.005–10%, but 0.1% povidone-iodine has the highest activity and requires the shortest time of only 15 s to achieve microbicidal effect. When used to irrigate the ocular surface every 20–30 s during cataract surgery, 0.25% povidone-iodine is conceivably diluted to around 0.1%. Irrigation with 0.25% povidone-iodine during cataract surgery significantly reduced bacteria contamination rate in the anterior chamber compared with saline (p = 0.0017) without causing corneal endothelial damage.","Shimada, Hiroyuki; Nakashizuka, Hiroyuki",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8397035/,187

The prevalence of normoglycaemia, eGDM, eDIP, GDM, and DIP was 76.4%, 10.8%, 0.6%, 11.7%, and 0.6%, respectively. With regard to pregnancy outcomes, gestational weight gain (11.5 ± 5.5, 9.0 ± 5.4, 8.3 ± 4.7, 10.4 ± 5.3, and 10.1 ± 5.0 kg, p < 0.0001) and insulin requirement (none, 46.0%, 88.5%, 25.5%, and 51.7%; p < 0.001) differed according to the glycaemic sub-types. eGDM and eDIP were associated with higher rates of infant malformation. After adjustment for confounders, with normoglycaemia as the reference, only GDM was associated with large-for-gestational-age infant (odds ratio 1.34 (95% interval confidence 1.01–1.78) and only DIP was associated with hypertensive disorders (OR 3.48 (1.26–9.57)). To conclude, early-diagnosed hyperglycaemia was associated with an increased risk of malformation, suggesting that it was sometimes present at conception. Women with GDM, but not those with eGDM, had an increased risk of having a large-for-gestational-age infant, possibly because those with eGDM were treated early and therefore had less gestational weight gain. Women with DIP might benefit from specific surveillance for hypertensive disorders.","Cosson, Emmanuel; Bentounes, Sid Ahmed; Nachtergaele, Charlotte; Berkane, Narimane; Pinto, Sara; Sal, Meriem; Bihan, Hélène; Tatulashvili, Sopio; Portal, Jean-Jacques; Carbillon, Lionel; Vicaut, Eric",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432067/,187

Approximately 21–40% of stroke patients sustain permanent aphasia, which progressively worsens one’s quality of life and rehabilitation outcomes. Post-stroke aphasia treatment strategies include speech language therapies, cognitive neurorehabilitation, telerehabilitation, computer-based management, experimental pharmacotherapy, and physical medicine. This review focuses on current evidence of the effectiveness of impairment-based aphasia therapies and communication-based therapies (as well as the timing and optimal treatment intensities for these interventions). Moreover, we present specific interventions, such as constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) and melodic intonation therapy (MIT). Accumulated data suggest that using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is safe and can be used to modulate cortical excitability. Therefore, we review clinical studies that present TMS and tDCS as (possible) promising therapies in speech and language recovery, stimulating neuroplasticity. Several drugs have been used in aphasia pharmacotherapy, but evidence from clinical studies suggest that only nootropic agents, donepezil and memantine, may improve the prognosis of aphasia. This article is an overview on the current state of knowledge related to post-stroke aphasia pharmacology, rehabilitation, and future trends.","Cichon, Natalia; Wlodarczyk, Lidia; Saluk-Bijak, Joanna; Bijak, Michal; Redlicka, Justyna; Gorniak, Leslaw; Miller, Elzbieta",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8432240/,187

21584,Reactive Oxygen Species and Endothelial Ca(2+) Signaling: Brothers in Arms or Partners in Crime?,2021-09-10,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The present review evaluates twenty years (2001 to 2021) of the study of growth and performance in local chicken breeds worldwide. The assessment of methodological approaches and their constraints when intending to fit for data derived from often endangered autochthonous populations was performed. The evaluation of conditioning factors on the impact that publications reporting on research progresses in the field have on the scientific community and how such advances are valued suggests the need to seek new methodological alternatives or statistical strategies. Such strategies must meet the requirements of local populations which are characterized by reduced censuses, a lack of data structure, highly skewed sex ratios, and a large interbreed and variety variability. The sustainable conservation of these populations cannot be approached if scientific knowledge on their productive behaviour is not reinforced in a manner that allows distinctive products to be put on the market and be competitive. ABSTRACT: A review of the scientific advances in the study of the growth and performance in native chicken breeds and varieties over the past 20 years was performed. Understanding the growth patterns of native breeds can only be achieved if the constraints characterizing these populations are considered and treated accordingly. Contextually, the determination of researchers to use the same research methods and study designs applied in international commercial poultry populations conditions the accuracy of the model, variability capturing ability, and the observational or predictive performance when the data of the local population are fitted. Highly skewed sex ratios favouring females, an inappropriate census imbalance compensation and a lack of population structure render models that are regularly deemed effective as invalid to issue solid and sound conclusions. The wider the breed diversity is in a country, the higher the scientific attention paid to these populations. A detailed discussion of the most appropriate models and underlying reasons for their suitability and the reasons preventing the use of others in these populations is provided. Furthermore, the factors conditioning the scientific reception and impact of related publications used to transfer these results to the broad scientific public were evaluated to serve as guidance for the maximization of the success and dissemination of local breed information.","González Ariza, Antonio; Arando Arbulu, Ander; Navas González, Francisco Javier; Nogales Baena, Sergio; Delgado Bermejo, Juan Vicente; Camacho Vallejo, María Esperanza",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8466095/,187

To overcome those limitations, we develop a fluorescent molecular rotor that specifically targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), an established marker for PCa. The probes have picomolar affinity (IC(50 )= 63-118 pM) for PSMA and generate virtually instantaneous onset of robust fluorescent signal proportional to the concentration of the PSMA-probe complex. In vitro and ex vivo experiments using PCa cell lines and clinical samples, respectively, indicate the utility of the probe for biomedical applications, including real-time monitoring of endocytosis and tumor staging. Experiments performed in a PCa xenograft model reveal suitability of the probe for imaging applications in vivo.","Zhang, Jingming; Rakhimbekova, Anastasia; Duan, Xiaojiang; Yin, Qingqing; Foss, Catherine A.; Fan, Yan; Xu, Yangyang; Li, Xuesong; Cai, Xuekang; Kutil, Zsofia; Wang, Pengyuan; Yang, Zhi; Zhang, Ning; Pomper, Martin G.; Wang, Yiguang; Bařinka, Cyril; Yang, Xing",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8443597/,187

The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, BVD can be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL. The disease would comply with the criteria as in Sections 4 and 5 of Annex IV of the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in points (d) and (e) of Article 9(1). The assessment here performed on compliance with the criteria as in Section 3 of Annex IV referred to in point (c) of Article 9(1) is inconclusive.

When using one single cell line, HEp-2, the overall numbers of adenoviruses detected using cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were roughly equal. In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence. The relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present in the sewage concentrates we examined was, on average, 94-fold greater than that of enteroviruses.

We studied the effect of major and minor surgery on potential variations in sVEGF and sVEGFR1 concentrations in vivo and on bacterial antigen‐induced release of sVEGF and sVEGFR1 from whole blood in vitro. Methods: Sixty‐one patients with abdominal diseases undergoing five different surgical procedures were included. Blood samples were drawn from anaesthetized patients before and after the operation. White blood cells and platelets were counted, and plasma sVEGF and sVEGFR1 was determined by an ELISA method. Whole blood from each blood sample was stimulated in vitro with bacteria‐derived antigens (LPS or protein‐A) and sVEGF and sVEGFR1 levels were subsequently determined in the supernatants. Stimulation with isotonic saline served as control assay. Results: Neither sVEGF or sVEGFR1 in plasma changed during surgery. In vitro stimulation of blood samples with bacteria‐derived antigens resulted in a significant increase in sVEGF (P < 0.0001) and a less pronounced but still significant increase in sVEGFR1. Release of sVEGF due to stimulation was significantly higher after the operation (nonsignificant), whereas sVEGFR1 release remained largely unchanged after surgery. Correlation between bacterial antigen‐induced release of sVEGF and neutrophile cell count was highly significant (P < 0.0001). There was no correlation between sVEGF and platelet cell count, and bacterial antigen‐induced sVEGFR1 release did not correlate with counts of neutrophils and platelets. Conclusions: Plasma sVEGF and sVEGFR1 concentrations did not change during surgery. In vitro bacterial stimulation led to increased release of sVEGF and sVEGFR1, which was not significantly amplified during surgery and which may be related to number of circulating neutrophils.","Svendsen, M.

There are few methods to study the influence of communities on social networks among the existing node importance evaluation algorithms, and it is difficult to find nodes that promote information dissemination among communities. In view of this reason, this paper proposes a node importance evaluation algorithm based on community influence (abbreviated as IEBoCI algorithm), which evaluates the importance of the nodes based on the influence degree of the nodes on the communities and the ability to disseminate information the communities to which the nodes are connected. This algorithm firstly calculates the activation probability of nodes to other nodes, which is used to divide communities and evaluate influence. Secondly, the network is divided into communities based on LPA algorithm. Finally, the importance of the node is calculated by combining the influence of the community itself and the influence of the node on the community. Experiments are carried out on real social network data and compared with other community-based methods to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.","He, Gongzhen; Luo, Junyong; Yin, Meijuan",Data Mining and Big Data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7351682/,187

The gold standard for the treatment of catatonia is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, ECT can exacerbate the paroxysms of sympathetic hyperactivity and complicate recovery from DPHL. The treatment of PSH is not well established. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a patient with multiple opiate overdoses who presented with altered mental status. He was diagnosed with catatonia and subsequently treated with ECT. His clinical condition worsened, and a revised diagnosis of PSH was established. The patient’s condition improved with medical management. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the need to distinguish between these two related symptom clusters, as the incidence of DPHL and opioid overdose related neuropsychiatric problems increase. This distinction can greatly influence the course of treatment, and the need to consider alternative treatments.","Hamlin, Dallas Wolfgang; Hussain, Nuzhat; Pathare, Aum",BMC Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7523250/,187

Many instructors, however, have found developing effective online lessons in a very short period of time very stressful and difficult. This study describes how we successfully addressed this crisis by transforming two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes with the help of a cloud-based video conferencing app. As in a conventional flipped course, in a fully online flipped course students are encouraged to complete online pre-class work. But unlike in the conventional flipped approach, students do not subsequently meet face-to-face in physical classrooms, but rather online. This study examines the effect of fully online flipped classrooms on student learning performance in two stages. In Stage One, we explain how we drew on the 5E framework to design two conventional flipped classes. The 5E framework consists of five phases—Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. In Stage Two, we describe how we transformed the two conventional flipped classes into fully online flipped classes. Quantitative analyses of students’ final course marks reveal that the participants in the fully online flipped classes performed as effectively as participants in the conventional flipped learning classes. Our qualitative analyses of student and staff reflection data identify seven good practices for videoconferencing-assisted online flipped classrooms.","Hew, Khe Foon; Jia, Chengyuan; Gonda, Donn Emmanuel; Bai, Shurui",Int J Educ Technol High Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750097/,187

There is limited data on the epidemiology and prognosis of COVID-19 in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis (HD). In this study we describe our experience with 39 such patients who contracted COVID-19 disease. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective hospital cohort study on patients ≥ 18 years old with ESRD on HD and confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted to our hospital between 03/15/2020 and 05/25/2020. Study individuals were recruited if they had a well-defined clinical outcome (discharged alive or expired). Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were reviewed and retrieved. Descriptive analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were employed to describe the demographic and to identify prognostic markers associated with mortality. RESULTS: Out of the 427 confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized patients during the study period, 39 ESRD patients on HD were included in this study, 19 (49%) expired, and 20 (51%) were discharged alive. Demographic analysis was tabulated in Table 1. The non-parametric analysis showed a significant difference in ethnicity, history of COPD, need of mechanical ventilation, ferritin, LDH, lymphocyte-ferritin ratio (LFR), lymphocyte-CRP ratio (LCR) and AST/ALT ratio between survival and non-survival groups (Table 1, 2). Mechanical ventilation is independently associated with mortality in ESRD patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 21.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.00–238.9). In addition, low AST/ALT ratio has an odd of survival in this group of patients (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.19–0.88). Table 1: Demographic Analysis of all ESRD patients with COVID-19.

Those on the cultural and political left supported restrictions hoping to protect the vulnerable, while those on the cultural and political right challenged restrictions citing threats to the economy and liberty. We theorize that libertarian and authoritarian impulses within Christian nationalism undergirded much of the resistance to government restrictions. Analyzing national panel data collected before and during the pandemic, we find Christian nationalism is either the first or second strongest predictor that Americans prioritize the economy and liberty and deprioritize the vulnerable when asked about government restrictions. Religiosity works in the opposite direction, however. Findings underscore the centrality of Christian nationalism as an ideological driver of far-right discourse shaping COVID-19 responses.","Perry, Samuel L; Whitehead, Andrew L; Grubbs, Joshua B",Sociol Relig,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798614/,187

A huge population is still dying using heroin every day. This may happen due to, several reasons like, excessive use of painkiller, lack of awareness etc. It has also inspired mathematical modelers to develop dynamical systems predicting the use of heroin in long run. In this work, the effect of heroin in Europe has been discussed by constructing a suitable mathematical model. Our model describes the process of treatment for heroin users by consolidating a sensible utilitarian structure that speaking to the restricted accessibility of treatment. In the treatment time frame, because of the discretion of the medication clients, some kind of time delay called immunity delay might be found. The effect of immunity delay on the system’s stability has been examined. The existence of positive solution and its boundedness has been established. Also, the local stability of the interior equilibrium point has been studied. Taking the immunity delay as the key parameter, the condition for Hopf-bifurcation has been studied. Using normal form theory and center manifold theorem, we have likewise talked about the direction and stability of delay induced Hopf-bifurcation. The corresponding reaction diffusion system with Dirichlet boundary condition has been considered and the Turing instability has been studied. Obtained solutions have also been plotted by choosing a suitable value of the parameters as the support of our obtained analytical results.","Kundu, Soumen; Kumari, Nitu; Kouachi, Said; Kundu, Piu",Model Earth Syst Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8055444/,187

As observed globally, the region appears to face a steady decline in student interest and achievement in science, resulting in reduced uptake of science subjects in schools and universities. This study aims to provide insight into the attitudes of Tongan senior secondary students toward science, using the validated Test of Scientific Related Attitudes (TOSRA) instrument. The sample population comprised 2636 students of approximately 15–18 years of age, from 26 schools across Tonga. Overall, the mean attitudes of Tongan senior secondary students toward science were lower than that previously observed for Australian secondary students (Grades 7–10) and Fijian senior secondary students. A significant reduction in attitude was found between forms 5 and 6 for female students from rural areas, but not those from urban areas. No significant changes across different form levels were found for male students. The greatest difference between students’ perspectives was found for the normality of scientists, which may be indicative of cultural views toward this topic. Combined with the similar results of previous research in Fijian students, this may point toward broader differences in the attitudes toward science between students in Pacific Island countries more generally.","Sharma, Bibhya; Narayan, Swasti; Khan, M.

53590,MAGEA4 Coated Extracellular Vesicles Are Stable and Can Be Assembled In Vitro,2021-05-14,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a progressive and lethal lung disease of elderly whose incidence has been increasing following the Covid-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). PF immunopathogenesis involves progressive alveolar epithelial cell damage, release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), and extracellular matrix (ECM) injury. We assessed the dynamic role of LMW-hyaluronan (LMW-HA) as DAMP in initiation of host immune TLR-2,4 responses and as determinant in progression of ECM injury to fibrosis. Male Wistar rats were divided into Group I (saline control, n = 24) and Group II (intratracheal bleomycin, 7 U/kg/animal, n = 24). Animals were euthanized on 0, 7, 14, and 28 days. The time course of release of LMW-HA, TLR-2,4 mRNA and protein levels, and NF-κB-p65 levels after bleomycin injury were correlated with the development of parenchymal inflammation, remodelling, and fibrosis. RESULTS: Acute lung injury caused by bleomycin significantly increases the pro-inflammatory LMW-HA levels and elevates TLR-2,4 levels on day 7. Subsequently, TLR-2 upregulation, TLR-4 downregulation, and NF-κB signalling follow on days 14 and 28. This results in progressive tissue inflammation, alveolar and interstitial macrophage accumulation, and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: LMW-HA significantly increases in PF caused by non-infectious and infectious (Covid-19) etiologies. The accumulating HA fragments function as endogenous DAMPs and trigger inflammatory responses, through differential TLR2 and TLR4 signalling, thus promoting inflammation and macrophage influx. LMW-HA are reflective of the state of ongoing tissue inflammation and may be considered as a natural biosensor for fibrotic lung diseases and as potential therapeutic targets.","Pandey, Apoorva; Kulshrestha, Ritu; Bansal, Surendra Kumar",Egypt J Bronchol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8138115/,187
56095,Identification of Amyloidogenic Regions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ribosomal S1 Protein,2021-07-07,"ABSTRACT: The development of natural biomaterials applied for hard tissue repair and regeneration is of great importance, especially in societies with a large elderly population. Self-assembled peptide hydrogels are a new generation of biomaterials that provide excellent biocompatibility, tunable mechanical stability, injectability, trigger capability, lack of immunogenic reactions, and the ability to load cells and active pharmaceutical agents for tissue regeneration. Peptide-based hydrogels are ideal templates for the deposition of hydroxyapatite crystals, which can mimic the extracellular matrix. Thus, peptide-based hydrogels enhance hard tissue repair and regeneration compared to conventional methods. This review presents three major self-assembled peptide hydrogels with potential application for bone and dental tissue regeneration, including ionic self-complementary peptides, amphiphilic (surfactant-like) peptides, and triple-helix (collagen-like) peptides. Special attention is given to the main bioactive peptides, the role and importance of self-assembled peptide hydrogels, and a brief overview on molecular simulation of self-assembled peptide hydrogels applied for bone and dental tissue engineering and regeneration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with PVRP (PVRP group) or standard conservative methods (control group) in a setting of four once-monthly checkups and subsequent follow-up. The treatment outcome was measured with the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12), CPTBCI focus surface area, and CPTBCI symptom-free time after the fourth checkup. RESULTS: Eleven patients from each group completed the trial; 95% of patients suffered from chronically discharging mastoid cavity (the type of CPTBCI). Within four checkups, the COMQ-12 score decreased statistically significantly in the PVRP group (p < 0.001) but not in the control group (p = 0.339). The CPTBCI foci surface area decreased statistically significantly between the first and second checkups (p < 0.0005) but not between other checkups (p > 0.05) in the PVRP group. No statistically significant differences in CPTBCI foci surface area were detected between checkups in the control group (p = 0.152). Nine patients from the PVRP group and three patients from the control group were CPTBCI symptom-free at the fourth checkup. The median symptom-free time was 9.2 months (95% CI [7.4, 11.9]) in the PVRP group. Cumulatively, 49% of patients in the PVRP group remained CPTBCI symptom-free for 12.7 months after the fourth checkup.

For many patients, causes of the disease remain unexplained, despite usage of advanced genetic testing. Although major and common transcription factors were identified two decades ago, we still struggle with identification of rare inborn factors contributing to pituitary function. In this report, we follow up genomic screening of CPHD patient cohort that were previously tested for changes in a coding sequences of genes with the use of the whole exome. We aimed to find contribution of rare copy number variations (CNVs). As a result, we identified genomic imbalances in 7 regions among 12 CPHD patients. Five out of seven regions showed copy gains whereas two presented losses of genomic fragment. Three regions with detected gains encompassed known CPHD genes namely LHX4, HESX1, and OTX2. Among new CPHD loci, the most interesting seem to be the region covering SIX3 gene, that is abundantly expressed in developing brain, and together with HESX1 contributes to pituitary organogenesis as it was evidenced before in functional studies. In conclusion, with the use of broadened genomic approach we identified copy number imbalances for 12 CPHD patients. Although further functional studies are required in order to estimate its true impact on expression pattern during pituitary organogenesis and CPHD etiology.","Budny, Bartłomiej; Karmelita-Katulska, Katarzyna; Stajgis, Marek; Żemojtel, Tomasz; Ruchała, Marek; Ziemnicka, Katarzyna",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796691/,187

However, cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC alterations in MDD remain largely unknown. METHODS 50 patients with MDD and 36 well-matched healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC analyses were performed using the cerebellar seeds previously identified as being involved in the executive, default-mode, affective-limbic, and motor networks. Inter-group differences in the cerebellar dynamic FC and their associations with clinical and cognitive variables were examined. RESULTS Compared to healthy controls, patients with MDD had decreased cerebellar-cerebral dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the executive, default-mode and affective-limbic networks. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregion connecting with the affective-limbic network was related to severity of depression and anxiety symptoms in MDD patients. The dynamic FC of the cerebellar subregions connecting with the default-mode and affective-limbic networks were related to sustained attention and prospective memory in controls, while the correlations were inverse or non-significant in patients. LIMITATIONS The fairly modest sample size and potential medication effect may increase the instability of the results. CONCLUSIONS Our findings provide further evidence for the pivotal role of the cerebellum in the neuropathology of depression, pointing to potential targets of cerebellar-cerebral pathways for alternative intervention or monitoring therapeutic responses.","Zhu, Dao-Min; Yang, Ying; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Chunli; Wang, Yajun; Zhang, Cun; Zhao, Wenming; Zhu, Jiajia",Journal of affective disorders,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734925/,187

We present our experience with filter-induced inferior vena cava occlusion in order to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of endovascular management. Methods A retrospective review of all patients undergoing inferior vena cava filter placement over a 60-month study period was performed. From this cohort, a total of 10 cases of inferior vena cava occlusion after filter placement were identified. Demographics, clinical data, procedures, and outcomes were extracted. Patients were followed to the last clinic visit or until they died. Results One-hundred eighty filters were placed by our group practice during the study period. Of those, a total of 10 patients were identified. Overall, there were 7 males; the mean age was 57.1 years (25-78 years). The median time between inferior vena cava filter placement and filter occlusion was 105 days (range 5-4745 days). All patients were clinically symptomatic at the time of their presentation. Nine out of 10 patients were successfully managed endovascularly. Trellis™-8 thrombectomy was the most common endovascular strategy performed ( n = 9). Four patients had balloon angioplasty, two of those with stent placement for chronically occluded inferior vena cava/iliac veins. No thromboembolic complications developed during a median follow-up period of 233 days (range 4-1083 days).

Further studies evaluating long-term inferior vena cava patency and optimal surveillance regimen after endovascular management of filter-related inferior vena cava occlusion are warranted.","Branco, Bernardino C; Montero-Baker, Miguel F; Espinoza, Eduardo; Gamero, Maria; Zea-Vera, Rodrigo; Labropoulos, Nicos; Leon, Luis R",Vascular,https://doi.org/10.1177/1708538118761398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498327/,187
60810,Crystal structure of the African swine fever virus pS273R protease and implications for inhibitor design.,2020-02-19,"The inflammatory response involves a complex interplay of different cytokines which act in an auto- or paracrine manner to induce the so-called acute phase response. Cytokines are known to crosstalk on multiple levels, for instance by regulating the mRNA stability of targeted cytokines through activation of the p38-MAPK pathway. In our study we discovered a new mechanism that answers the long-standing question how pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental stress restrict immediate signalling of interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines. We show that p38, activated by IL-1beta, TNFalpha or environmental stress, impairs IL-6-induced JAK/STAT signalling through phosphorylation of the common cytokine receptor subunit gp130 and its subsequent internalisation and degradation. We identify MK2 as the kinase that phosphorylates serine 782 in the cytoplasmic part of gp130. Consequently, inhibition of p38 or MK2, deletion of MK2 or mutation of crucial amino acids within the MK2 target site or the di-leucine internalisation motif blocks receptor depletion and restores IL-6-dependent STAT activation as well as gene induction. Hence, a novel negative crosstalk mechanism for cytokine signalling is described, where cytokine receptor turnover is regulated in trans by pro-inflammatory cytokines and stress stimuli to coordinate the inflammatory response.","Radtke, Simone; Wüller, Stefan; Yang, Xiang-ping; Lippok, Barbara E; Mütze, Barbara; Mais, Christine; de Leur, Hildegard Schmitz-Van; Bode, Johannes G; Gaestel, Matthias; Heinrich, Peter C; Behrmann, Iris; Schaper, Fred; Hermanns, Heike M",Journal of cell science,https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.065326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20200229/,187

An MRI in sedation performed at the age of 4.5 months had no diagnostic specificity. By a biopsy at the age of 5 months malignancy could be excluded. Finally at the age of 16 months the tumor which had meanwhile grown to a monstrous size (5 cm of diameter) could be entirely removed by microsurgical technique maintaining the integrity of all intrinsic structures. The diagnosis of myxoid lipoblastoma was confirmed. According to literature, Lipoblastomas often present as connatal rapid growing soft tissue tumors and are benign.

Two Thai PDCoV isolates, P23_15_TT_1115 and P24_15_NT1_1215, were isolated and identified. The full-length genome sequences of the P23_15_TT_1115 and P24_15_NT1_1215 isolates were 25,404 and 25,407 nucleotides in length, respectively, which were relatively shorter than that of US and China PDCoV. The phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length genome demonstrated that Thai PDCoV isolates form a new cluster separated from US and China PDCoV but relatively were more closely related to China PDCoV than US isolates. The genetic analyses demonstrated that Thai PDCoVs have 97.0-97.8 and 92.2-94.0% similarities with China PDCoV at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, but share 97.1-97.3 and 92.5-93.0 similarity with US PDCoV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Thai PDCoV possesses two discontinuous deletions of five amino acids in ORF1a/b region. One additional deletion of one amino acid was identified in P23_15_TT_1115. The variation analyses demonstrated that six regions (nt 1317-1436, 2997-3096, 19,737-19,836, 20,277-20,376, 21,177-21,276, and 22,371-22,416) in ORF1a/b and spike genes exhibit high sequence variation between Thai and other PDCoV.

It exists as a harmless commensal organism and member of the healthy human microbiome, but can cause life-threatening mucosal and systemic infections. A model host to study C. albicans infection and pathogenesis is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans is frequently used as a model host to study microbial-host interactions because it can be infected by many human pathogens and there are also close morphological resemblances between the intestinal cells of C. elegans and mammals, where C. albicans infections can occur. This article outlines a detailed methodology for exploiting C. elegans as a host to study C. albicans infection, including a C. elegans egg preparation protocol and an agar-based C. elegans killing protocol to monitor fungal virulence. These protocols can additionally be used to study C. albicans genetic mutants in order to further our understanding of the genes involved in pathogenesis and virulence in C. albicans and the mechanisms of host-microbe interactions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

This study evaluates the effects of three factors on the fitness and physiology of salmon fry at their emergence, the origin of water (river vs drilling), the type of support in the incubator (support matrix vs plastic sheets) and the type of incubators (Californian vs vertical trays), and compares them to a semi-natural incubation method in river. Key biological functions including nutritional and immune status were compared among experimental conditions using biometric parameters, lipid composition and gene expression analyses. Our findings demonstrated that fry incubated in vertical trays supplied with river water had no significant difference in growth and lipid composition compared to those in semi-natural incubators. Besides, fry incubated on a substrate matrix in Californian trays exhibited phenotypic characteristics closest to those incubated in river. This support matrix improved fish growth, lipid consumption and distribution compared to fry on plastic sheets. Moreover, the large amounts of several PUFAs in these fry could allow a better membrane fluidity ensuring a better adaptation to temperature variation under cold conditions. In addition, drilling water improved the survival rate compared to river water due to lower numbers of fine particles, known to be responsible for the clogging of eggs. To conclude, using a substrate combined with drilling water in artificial incubators could increase fry fitness and its adaption to wild life.","Cornet, Valérie; Geay, Florian; Erraud, Alexandre; Mandiki, Syaghalirwa N M; Flamion, Enora; Larondelle, Yvan; Rollin, Xavier; Kestemont, Patrick",Fish physiology and biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10695-021-00959-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974164/,187

67536,First full-length sequences of the S gene of European isolates reveal further diversity among turkey coronaviruses.,2011,"BACKGROUND A motor-assisted elliptical trainer is being used clinically to help individuals with physical disabilities regain and/or retain walking ability and cardiorespiratory fitness. Unknown is how the device's training parameters can be used to optimize movement variability and regularity. This study examined the effect of motor-assisted elliptical training speed as well as body weight support (BWS) on center of pressure (CoP) movement variability and regularity during training. METHODS CoP was recorded using in-shoe pressure insoles as participants motor-assisted elliptical trained at three speeds (20, 40 and 60 cycles per minute) each performed at four BWS levels (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 %). Separate two-way repeated measures ANOVAs (3 × 4) evaluated impact of training speed and BWS on linear variability (standard deviation) and non-linear regularity (sample entropy) of CoP excursion (anterior-posterior, medial-lateral) for 10 dominant limb strides. FINDINGS Training speed and BWS did not significantly affect the linear variability of CoP in the anterior-posterior or medial-lateral directions. However, sample entropy in both directions revealed the main effect of training speed (p < 0.0001), and a main effect of BWS was observed in the medial-lateral direction (p = 0.004). Faster training speeds and greater levels of BWS resulted in more irregular CoP patterns. INTERPRETATION The finding that speed and BWS can be used to manipulate CoP movement variability when using a motor-assisted elliptical has significant clinical implications for promoting/restoring walking capacity. Further research is required to determine the impact of motor-assisted elliptical speed and BWS manipulations on functional recovery of walking in individuals who have experienced a neurologic injury or illness.","Fallahtafti, Farahnaz; Pfeifer, Chase M; Buster, Thad W; Burnfield, Judith M",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.07.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888552/,187

We hypothesized that multivessel intracranial dolichoectasia may represent a distinct phenotype from single-territory vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. The purpose of this study was to characterize clinical characteristics and angiographic features of this proposed distinct phenotype termed ""diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia"" and compare them with those in patients with isolated vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia and compared their demographics, vascular risk factors, additional aneurysm prevalence, and clinical outcomes with a group of patients with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. ""Diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia"" was defined as aneurysmal dilation of entire vascular segments involving ≥2 intracranial vascular beds. Categoric and continuous variables were compared by using χ2 and Student t tests, respectively. RESULTS Twenty-five patients had diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia, and 139 had vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were older than those with vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia (70.9 ± 14.2 years versus 60.4 ± 12.5 years, P = .0002) and had a higher prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (62.5% versus 14.3%, P = .01), other visceral aneurysms (25.0% versus 0%, P < .0001), and smoking (68.0% versus 15.9%, P < .0001). Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were more likely to have aneurysm growth (46.2% versus 21.5%, P = .09) and rupture (20% versus 3.5%, P = .007) at follow-up. Patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia were less likely to have good neurologic function at follow-up (24.0% versus 57.6%, P = .004) and were more likely to have aneurysm-related death (24.0% versus 7.2%, P = .02). CONCLUSIONS The natural history of patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia is significantly worse than that in those with isolated vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. Many patients with diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia had additional saccular and abdominal aortic aneurysms. These findings suggest that diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia may be a distinct vascular phenotype secondary to a systemic arteriopathy affecting multiple vascular beds.","Brinjikji, W; Nasr, D M; Flemming, K D; Rouchaud, A; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

Through elements of events study and document and critical discourse analysis, this paper investigates the COVID-19 vaccines' regulatory emergency use authorisation and/or conditional marketing authorisation (regulatory authorisation) regimes and the contestations thereof. The key finding is that there was a regulatory authorisation rush, with at least 62, mostly high-income countries, doing so in 40 days from 2 December 2020-10 January 2021. This has led to one senior USA official describing the United Kingdom pioneer regulatory authorisation of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as 'too quick'. Regulatory authorisation regimes took place amid severe civil society contestations and appropriate political pressure.

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20, 2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74×10(9) (0.34×10(9), 0.94×10(9))/L vs. 0.99×10(9) (0.71×10(9), 1.29×10(9))/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) μg/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20)μg/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m(2) vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m(2), P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25 kg/m(2), which was significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors (all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with CVD.

Using a purpose-designed analysis framework and scoring scheme, we analyzed standards of accreditation and practice for 29 regulated, self-regulated and member health professions in Australia to determine the extent and accountability of statements related to interprofessional education and interprofessional collaborative practice. Currently, in Australia, there is a fragmented and inconsistent approach to interprofessional education and interprofessional collaboration evident in accreditation and practice standards and, in general, there are more explicit requirements in standards of the regulated health professions. However, overall the concepts of interprofessional education and interprofessional practice are ill-defined and statements lack accountability and/or outcome measures.

AIM To analyse the advantages and disadvantages of surgical approaches to treating small adrenal tumours. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the period 2002-2011, 31 patients were operated on at Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics for aldosteronomas. Adrenalectomies were performed in the lateral laparoscopic (group A, n = 6), the endoscopic retroperitoneal (group B, n = 20), and the single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and SARA (group C, n = 5) approaches. Seventy five percent of patients were operated on by the same surgeon. The duration of adrenalectomies, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared. The possibility of minimally invasive adrenalectomies was evaluated. RESULTS According to the patients' age, body mass index and tumour size, the groups were equal. The average duration of surgery in group A was shorter than in groups B and C (91 ±23 min vs. 118 ±57 min vs. 144 ±88 min). Right laparoscopic adrenalectomy was longer than the left (105 ±26 min vs. 77 ±6 min), whereas right endoscopic retroperitoneal adrenalectomy was shorter than the left (109 ±50 min vs. 126 ±57 min). The best cosmetic view was in group C. The SARA method was converted into the endoscopic retroperitoneal approach and then into the laparoscopic for one patient. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Evaluating the minimal invasion of the method, its abilities and simplicity of conversion into another type of endoscopic surgical way, the SARA approach should be the first option for removing aldosteronomas.","Beiša, Virgilijus; Kryžauskas, Marius; Simutis, Gintaras; Sileikis, Audrius; Strupas, Kęstutis",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2011.29898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362425/,187

METHODS Women with a second-trimester fetus with OSB were offered intrauterine neurosurgical repair following the protocol from the Management of Myelomeningocele Study (MOMS) trial. Pediatric follow-up with infants reaching 12 and 30 months of life was also reviewed. RESULTS Fifty-eight fetuses with OSB underwent intrauterine repair at an average (±SD) gestational age of 24.8 ± 0.9 weeks. There were 3 (5.1%) intrauterine deaths. The average gestational age at delivery of the remaining 55 cases was 33.3 ± 3.6 weeks, and the average birth weight was 2,172 ± 751 g. Delivery before 30 weeks occurred in 11 cases (20.0%). Two (3.6%) neonatal deaths (<28 days) occurred. At 12 months, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt or an endoscopic third ventriculostomy was required in 25% of the cases. At 30 months, 72.4% of the infants were able to walk. DISCUSSION Prenatal neurosurgical repair of OSB is a complex and challenging intervention. Major complications include perinatal death and severe prematurity. No major maternal complications occurred in our series. A reduction in the need for cerebrospinal fluid diversion and an improved ability to walk seem to be the greatest long-term advantages of this procedure.","Sepulveda, Waldo; Corral, Edgardo; Alcalde, Juan L; Otayza, Felipe; Müller, Jose M; Ravera, Franco; Devoto, Juan C; Tapia, Mirta",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937625/,187

PATIENTS AND METHODS In an observational trial, COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients were enrolled. MR-proADM, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and lactic acid (LA) were measured in all patients at admission (T0), at 24 hours (T1) and in the third (T3) and fifth day (T5) of hospitalization. The aims of this study were to determine the role of MR-proADM to detect patients with high risk of mortality and compare the prognostic value of MR-proADM with commonly used clinical scores (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score - SOFA score, Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II score - APACHE II score, and Simplified Acute Physiological score II - SAPS II score). RESULTS Twenty-one COVID-19 ARDS patients admitted to the Intermediate Care Unit (IMCU) were enrolled. The median MR-proADM values were 2.28, 2.41, 1.96 and 1.89 nmol/L at T0, T1, T3 and T5, respectively. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 52.4%. Mean MR-proADM T0 value was significantly higher in non-survivors compared with survivors (3.5 vs. 1.1 nmol/L, p < 0.05). No significant differences were found for the other inflammatory biomarkers. In terms of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), MR-proADM showed a similar discriminatory power compared with APACHE II, SOFA and SAPS II score (0.81, 0.91, 0.70 and 0.78, respectively). The optimal MR-proADM cut-point cut-off point was 1.07 nmol/L, which corresponds to a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 71%.

COVID-19 is likely to overwhelm an already fragile health-care delivery system and reduce the availability of essential health services. This analysis of data from Somali region of Eastern Ethiopia on health workers knowledge, attitude and practice towards the prevention and control of COVID-19 may be used in planning health education programs about the emerging viral disease. OBJECTIVE This study is aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practice of health workers towards COVID-19 infection. METHODS Cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare workers in three public health facilities in Somali region, Eastern Ethiopia. A self-administered questionnaire was shared to the all-health workers working at the public health facilities. Multiple questions with nominal scale were used to assess Knowledge (15 questions) and practice (6 questions); whereas attitude was assessed using 14 Likert 5-scale questions in negative dimension. Mean scores were calculated and used as a cut point to dichotomize the outcome variables (good knowledge >13.7; good practice <18.8 and favorable attitude <10.5). T-test and ANOVA were used to analyze the mean score differences of knowledge, attitude and practice between the independent variables. Spearman's correlation was used to assess the relationship between mean knowledge and attitude scores. RESULTS Of the 686 HCWs approached, a total of 434 HCWs responded (response rate = 63%). Mean age of participants was 27.6±5.3 years, and majorities (67.5%) of them were male. The mean knowledge score was 13.7± 2.6 and 73% of participants had sufficient knowledge. The mean attitude score was 10.5±4.1 and 55% of the participants) had a good attitude toward COVID-19. The mean practice score was 18.8± 5.8 and 62% of the participants better practiced COVID-19 precautionary measures. There was a negative correlation between knowledge scores, attitude scores (r=-0.295, P<0.001) and practice (r=-0.298, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The overall level of knowledge and practice was relatively better than the attitude. This highlights the need to implement strategies that enhance the positive attitude and safe practice of the healthcare workers for better containment of the pandemic and essential healthcare services.","Mohamed Farah, Alinoor; Yousuf Nour, Tahir; Obsiye, Muse; Akil Adan, Mowlid; Moeline Ali, Omar; Arab Hussein, Muktar; Bedel Budul, Abdullahi; Omer, Muktar; Getnet, Fentabil",JMIR formative research,https://doi.org/10.2196/26980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34477559/,187
77230,Visualizing coronavirus RNA synthesis in time by using click chemistry.,2012,"We present a case of a 51-year-old man with panhypopituarism who developed clinically mild encephalopathy with a lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum, in the setting of acute influenza A infection. The patient's initial presentation included hypernatraemia due to pre-existing iatrogenic central diabetes insipidus. Despite adequate treatment of hypernatraemia, his course was complicated by otherwise unexplained mild encephalopathy. Brain MRI revealed a diffusion restricted lesion in the splenium of the corpus callosum. This presentation was consistent with mild encephalopathy with reversible splenial lesion (MERS). The patient subsequently tested positive for influenza A. This is the first reported case of MERS syndrome due to influenza A infection in an adult patient in the USA. Mild encephalopathy associated with influenza A infection and a reversible splenial lesion of the corpus callosum has a favourable prognosis and resolves spontaneously.","Wang, Jonathan; Stewart, Earl; Dapaah-Afriyie, Kwame; Finn, Arkadiy",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2015-210197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26038383/,187
78661,Detection and characterization of canine astroviruses.,2011,"BACKGROUND Impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is one feature of post cardiac arrest encephalopathy. We studied the incidence and features of CVR by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and associations with outcome and biomarkers of brain injury. METHODS A post-hoc analysis of 120 comatose OHCA patients continuously monitored with NIRS and randomised to low- or high-normal oxygen, carbon dioxide and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) targets for 48 h. The tissue oximetry index (TOx) generated by the moving correlation coefficient between cerebral tissue oxygenation measured by NIRS and MAP was used as a dynamic index of CVR with TOx > 0 indicating impaired reactivity and TOx > 0.3 used to delineate the lower and upper MAP bounds for disrupted CVR. TOx was analysed in the 0-12, 12-24, 24-48 h time-periods and integrated over 0-48 h. The primary outcome was the association between TOx and six-month functional outcome dichotomised by the cerebral performance category (CPC1-2 good vs. 3-5 poor). Secondary outcomes included associations with MAP bounds for CVR and biomarkers of brain injury. RESULTS In 108 patients with sufficient data to calculate TOx, 76 patients (70%) had impaired CVR and among these, chronic hypertension was more common (58% vs. 31%, p = 0.002). Integrated TOx for 0-48 h was higher in patients with poor outcome than in patients with good outcome (0.89 95% CI [- 1.17 to 2.94] vs. - 2.71 95% CI [- 4.16 to - 1.26], p = 0.05). Patients with poor outcomes had a decreased upper MAP bound of CVR over time (p = 0.001), including the high-normal oxygen (p = 0.002), carbon dioxide (p = 0.012) and MAP (p = 0.001) groups. The MAP range of maintained CVR was narrower in all time intervals and intervention groups (p < 0.05). NfL concentrations were higher in patients with impaired CVR compared to those with intact CVR (43 IQR [15-650] vs 20 IQR [13-199] pg/ml, p = 0.042). CONCLUSION Impaired CVR over 48 h was more common in patients with chronic hypertension and associated with poor outcome. Decreased upper MAP bound and a narrower MAP range for maintained CVR were associated with poor outcome and more severe brain injury assessed with NfL.

78870,Molecular characterization of turkey enteric reovirus S3 gene.,2014,"OBJECTIVE To report our experience with a modified procedure for total laparoscopic hysterectomy based on a retrograde and retroperitoneal technique. This surgical approach is analyzed on a consecutive series of patients in a community hospital and theoretical educational advantages are proposed. STUDY DESIGN All patients undergoing hysterectomy from January 2012 to April 2013 were included in the study. A detailed description of the technique is given. As main outcome measures we evaluated: the number and rate of patients excluded from laparoscopic approach, the rate of late complications need readmission, the rate of transfusions, the rate of conversion to laparotomy and the number of minor complications. The main concern of the study was ureteral complications. RESULTS Overall 174 patients underwent hysterectomy in our unit. The rate of patients submitted to laparoscopic hysterectomy was 97.5%. The number of complications needing re-admission was three (2%). The rate of conversion was 2.7%. In the study period, two (1.2%) ureteral complications were observed (late fistulae). There were four bladder lesions but the patients were released on the same day as the patients with no lesion. CONCLUSIONS Opening the retroperitoneum allows rapid control of the main uterine vessels by coagulation, and constant checks on the ureter. Difficult benign situations can be managed. Even in a non-referral center about 94% of hysterectomies can be performed by laparoscopic surgery. This approach is helpful and may be reproducible in gynecological procedures.","Volpi, Eugenio; Bernardini, Luca; Angeloni, Moira; Cosma, Stefano; Mannella, Paolo","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.10.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24315354/,187
82379,Introducing Foldit Education Mode.,2020-08-17,"Viral inclusion bodies (IBs), or replication factories, are unique structures generated by viral proteins together with some cellular proteins as a platform for efficient viral replication, but little is known about the mechanism underlying IB formation and fusion. Our previous study demonstrated that the interaction between the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), an enveloped virus with great medical impact, can form IBs. In this study, we found that small IBs can fuse with each other to form large IBs that enhance viral replication. Furthermore, we found that acetylated α-tubulin interacts with the N-P complex and colocalizes with IBs of HPIV3 but does not interact with the N-P complex of human respiratory syncytial virus or vesicular stomatitis virus and does not colocalize with IBs of human respiratory syncytial virus. Most importantly, enhancement of α-tubulin acetylation using the pharmacological inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA), RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown of the deacetylase enzymes histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), or expression of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (α-TAT1) resulted in the fusion of small IBs into large IBs and effective viral replication. In contrast, suppression of acetylation of α-tubulin by overexpressing HDAC6 and SIRT2 profoundly inhibited the fusion of small IBs and viral replication. Our findings offer previously unidentified mechanistic insights into the regulation of viral IB fusion by acetylated α-tubulin, which is critical for viral replication. IMPORTANCE Inclusion bodies (IBs) are unique structures generated by viral proteins and some cellular proteins as a platform for efficient viral replication. Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) is a nonsegmented single-stranded RNA virus that mainly causes lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children. However, no vaccines or antiviral drugs for HPIV3 are available. Therefore, understanding virus-host interactions and developing new antiviral strategies are increasingly important. Acetylation on lysine (K) 40 of α-tubulin is an evolutionarily conserved modification and plays an important role in many cellular processes, but its role in viral IB dynamics has not been fully explored. To our knowledge, our findings are the first to show that acetylated α-tubulin enhances viral replication by regulating HPIV3 IB fusion.","Zhang, Shengwei; Jiang, Yanliang; Cheng, Qi; Zhong, Yi; Qin, Yali; Chen, Mingzhou",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01802-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881643/,187
85110,Infectious bronchitis virus poly-epitope-based vaccine protects chickens from acute infection.,2016,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE The study aimed to evaluate the effect of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite twice-weekly oral rinse on plaque and gingivitis in patients with minimally treated periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 30 patients with periodontitis, it lasted 3 mo, and it was performed as a randomized, controlled, single-blinded, clinical trial in parallel groups. Fifteen patients rinsed for 30 s with 15 mL of a fresh solution of 0.25% sodium hypochlorite (test) and 15 patients rinsed with 15 mL of water (control). Clorox(®) regular bleach was the source of the sodium hypochlorite. At baseline and at 2 wk, the study patients received professional subgingival irrigation for 5 min with either 0.25% sodium hypochlorite or water, but no subgingival or supragingival scaling. The presence or absence of supragingival plaque on facial and lingual surfaces was determined by visual inspection; each tooth was dried with air and mouth mirror rotation was used to provide light reflection to identify plaque on smooth surfaces and at the tooth line angles. Gingival bleeding within 30 s after probing to full pocket depth was assessed in six sites of each tooth. Adverse events were evaluated by questionnaire and visual examination. RESULTS All 30 patients in the study completed the baseline and the 2 wk parts of the study and a subset of 12 participants completed the 3 mo part of the study. The sodium hypochlorite rinse group and the water rinse group, respectively, showed increases from baseline to 3 mo of 94% and 29% (3.2-fold difference) in plaque-free facial surfaces, of 195% and 30% (6.5-fold difference) in plaque-free lingual surfaces, and of 421% and 29% (14.5-fold difference) in number of teeth with no bleeding on probing. The differences in clinical improvement between the sodium hypochlorite rinse group and the water rinse group were statistically significant. No adverse events were identified in any of the study patients, except for minor complaints about the taste of bleach. CONCLUSION A twice-weekly oral rinse with 0.25% sodium hypochlorite produced marked decreases in dental plaque level and bleeding on probing and may constitute a promising new approach to the management of periodontal disease. Long-term controlled studies on the effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite oral rinse are needed and encouraged.","Galván, M; Gonzalez, S; Cohen, C L; Alonaizan, F A; Chen, C T-L; Rich, S K; Slots, J",Journal of periodontal research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jre.12151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24329929/,187

Data collected through the Extension for Community Health Outcomes- Care Transitions (ECHO-CT) model were used to identify and classify transition-of-care events (TCEs). METHODS The ECHO-CT model employs multidisciplinary videoconferences between a hospital-based team and providers in post-acute care settings; during these conferences, concerns regarding the patient's care transition were identified and recorded. The videoconferences took place from January 2016 to October 2018 and included patients discharged from inpatient medical and surgical services to a total of eight participating post-acute care facilities (skilled nursing facilities or long-term acute care hospitals). RESULTS During the interdisciplinary videoconferences in this period, 675 patients were discussed. A total of 139 TCEs were identified; 58 (41.7%) involved discharge communication or coordination errors and 52 (37.4%) were classified as medication issues. CONCLUSION The TCEs identified in this study highlight areas in which providers can work to reduce issues arising during the course of discharge to post-acute care facilities. Standardized processes to identify, record, and report TCEs are necessary to provide high-quality, safe care for patients as they move across care settings.","Gonzalez, Mariana R; Junge-Maughan, Lauren; Lipsitz, Lewis A; Moore, Amber",Journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496665/,187

BACKGROUND Clinicians at the forefront of care are well positioned to lead on research to improve outcomes and experiences of patients but some professional groups continue to be underrepresented. Inequities persist alongside robust national infrastructures to support Clinical Academic Careers for non-medical health professionals, further highlighting the need to address local infrastructure and leadership to successfully build research capacity. DESIGN An evolving programme of inquiry and analysis was established in one organisation, this included targeted interventions to mitigate barriers and enable research capacity and capability. METHODS An all-staff survey was conducted in 2015 to understand the existing research culture. Interventions were put in place, evaluated through a second survey (2018), and focus group interviews with staff who had accessed interventions. RESULTS Respondents demonstrated high levels of interest and commitment to research at the individual level which were not always harnessed at the organisational level. Inequities between professional groups existed in terms of training, time to undertake research and opportunities and outputs. Follow-up revealed continuing structural barriers at an organisational level, however at an individual level, interventions were reflected in >30 fellowship awards; major concerns were reported about sustaining these research ambitions. CONCLUSIONS Success in building a research-active clinical workforce is multifactorial and all professional groups report increasing challenges to undertake research alongside clinical responsibilities. Individuals report concerns about the depth and pace of cultural change to sustain Clinical Academic Careers and build a truly organisation-wide research hospital ethos to benefit patients. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The achievements of individual nurses and allied health professionals indicate that with supportive infrastructure, capacity, cognisance and capability are not insurmountable barriers for determined clinicians.

This has taken on greater urgency during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Radiation Personal Protective Equipment (RPPE) may contribute to risks of microbial contamination. This possibility was tested in 61 personal or shared-use lead aprons and thyroid collars at Columbia Presbyterian Irving Medical Center. Fifty percent tested positive for either bacterial or fungal contamination, mostly around the neckline of lead vests and thyroid collars. Repeated testing of garments some weeks to months later confirmed continued presence of microbial contamination. The possibility that hospital-approved disinfection agents could degrade the radio-protective features of these garments was also examined. Samples of identical construction to garments in regular use were subjected to either daily or weekly wipes with hypochlorite or alcohol-based hospital-approved cleaning agents for 6 mo. A third group of samples was maintained in contact with the cleaning agents for 6 mo. All samples were fluoroscoped four times during the study. None demonstrated any degradation in radioprotection. All samples were photographed monthly. Physical degradation of the outer plastic covering by concentrated hypochlorite and limited mechanical damage around stitched seams of the samples cleaned daily with alcohol was noted. Based on the high prevalence of microbial contamination, regular cleaning and disinfection protocols should be implemented. Regular cleaning with medical-facility-approved cleaning and disinfecting agents is likely to be effective at reducing the microbial load and unlikely to result in significant reduction in radioprotective properties of these garments.","Balter, Stephen; Rodriguez, Michelle A; Pike, Janett A; Kleiman, Norman J",Health physics,https://doi.org/10.1097/hp.0000000000001387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369969/,187

Currently, the known cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 include myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, and arrhythmias. In this report, we describe a case of pericarditis-an unusual cardiac manifestation observed in a patient with COVID-19. A 63-year-old male presented with history of fever, cough and chest pain. Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated diffuse ST-T wave changes on all the leads, with normal troponin-T levels. Echocardiograph showed mild pericardial effusion without any regional wall motion abnormality. Subsequent chest radiograph and coronary angiography were normal. In view of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, nasopharyngeal swab was performed, which was positive. Detailed etiological workup for pericarditis, including infectious and inflammatory causes were unremarkable.

87784,Dynamic changes of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in spleen and brain of canine distemper virus-infected dogs.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Advanced age and chronic disease comorbidities are indicators of poor prognosis in COVID-19 clinical progression. Fatal outcomes in patients with these characteristics are due to a dysfunctional immune response. Understanding COVID-19's immunopathogenesis helps in designing strategies to prevent and mitigate complications during treatment. OBJECTIVE Describe the main immunopathogenic alterations of COVID-19 in patients of advanced age or with chronic non-communicable diseases. DATA ACQUISITION We carried out a bibliographic search of primary references in PubMed, Elsevier, Science Direct and SciELO. A total of 270 articles met our initial search criteria. Duplicate articles or those unrelated to at least one chronic comorbidity, senescence or inflammation and those that studied only patient clinical characteristics, laboratory tests or treatments were excluded. Finally, our selection included 124 articles for analysis: 10 meta-analyses, 24 original research articles, 67 review articles, 9 editorials, 9 comments, 3 books and 2 websites. DEVELOPMENT Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Risk of developing severe manifestations of the disease, including death, is increased in senescent and obese patients and those with cardiovascular disease, cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Low-grade chronic inflammation is characteristic of all these conditions, reflected in a pro-inflammatory state, endothelial dysfunction, and changes to innate immunity; mainly of the monocyte-macrophage system with changes in polarization, inflammation, cytotoxicity and altered antigenic presentation. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, mechanisms involved in acute inflammation overlap with the patient's pro-inflammatory state, causing immune system dysfunction. SARS-CoV-2 infection amplifies already-existing alterations, causing failures in the immune system's control mechanisms. The resulting cytokine storm causes an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response marked by high serum levels of inflammatory biomarkers and a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile with decompensation of underlying diseases. In asthma, chronic eosinophilic inflammation protects against infection by producing a reduced interferon-mediated response and a reduced number of ACE2 receptors. CONCLUSIONS Low-grade chronic inflammation present in advanced age and chronic diseases-but not in bronchial asthma-produces a pro-inflammatory state that triggers a dysregulated immune response, favoring development of severe forms of COVID-19 and increasing lethality.","Suárez-Reyes, Anamary; Villegas-Valverde, Carlos A",MEDICC review,https://doi.org/10.37757/mr2021.v23.n2.4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974614/,187

Competencies in interprofessional working need developing in undergraduate educational preparation. This paper reports the protocol for a systematic review of self-report instruments to assess interprofessional learning in undergraduate health professionals' education. METHODS We will search PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and ERIC from January 2010 onwards. A combination of search terms for interprofessional learning, health professions, psychometric properties, assessment of learning and assessment tools will be used. Two reviewers will independently screen all titles, abstracts and full-texts. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion. Quantitative and mixed-methods studies evaluating interprofessional learning in undergraduate health professions education (e.g. medicine, nursing, occupational and physical therapy, pharmacy and psychology) will be included. Methodological quality of each reported instrument, underpinning theoretical frameworks, and the effects of reported interventions will be assessed. The overall outcome will be the effectiveness of instruments used to assess interprofessional competence. Primary outcomes will be the psychometric properties (e.g. reliability, discriminant and internal validity) of instruments used. Secondary outcomes will include time from intervention to assessment, how items relate to specific performance/competencies (or general abstract constructs) and how scores are used (e.g. to grade students, to improve courses or research purposes). Quantitative summaries in tabular format and a narrative synthesis will allow recommendations to be made on the use of self-report instruments in practice. DISCUSSION Many studies use self-report questionnaires as tools for developing meaningful interprofessional education activities and assessing students' interprofessional competence. This systematic review will evaluate both the benefits and limitations of reported instruments and help educators and researchers (i) choose the most appropriate existing self-report instruments to assess interprofessional competence and (ii) inform the design and conduct of interprofessional competency assessment using self-report instruments.

The goal of this study was to compare 2 VLs, the Pentax AWS and the McGrath VL, with respect to intubation time and ease of intubation.One hundred forty patients aged 19 to 65 years (American Society of Anesthesiologists classification I or II), who required tracheal intubation for elective surgery, were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 groups: the Pentax AWS (n = 70) or the McGrath VL (n = 70). The primary outcome was time to intubation (TTI) measured by a blind observer. The intubation difficulty scale (IDS), percentage of glottic opening (POGO) scale, glottic grade, use of optimal external laryngeal manipulation (OELM), and ease of intubation were also recorded.The Pentax AWS provided a better laryngeal view than the McGrath VL with respect to the Cormack-Lehane (CL) glottic grade (1/2a/2b) (63/7/0 vs 43/24/3, P < .001) and the POGO scale (median [interquartile range, IQR]) (100 [100-100] vs 100 [80-100], P < .001). The IDS was significantly lower in the Pentax AWS group compared with the McGrath VL group (median [IQR]) (0 [0-0] vs 0 [0-1], P < .001). However, the TTI was similar in both the Pentax AWS and McGrath VL groups (median [IQR]) (30 [27-34] vs 32 [27-35] seconds, P = .440). OELM and ease of intubation were also similar between the 2 groups.The Pentax AWS offered a superior laryngeal view compared with the McGrath VL. There was no significant difference in either the intubation time or ease of intubation using these 2 devices in patients with normal airways.","Lee, Jiyoung; Kwak, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Ji Yeon; Chang, Min Young; Lee, Sook Young; Kim, Jong Yeop",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000008713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29145308/,187
91259,Preserving Cytonemes for Immunocytochemistry of Cultured Adherent Cells.,2020-08-18,"PURPOSE Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common cause of admission to intensive care units (ICUs). Mucoactive agents are medications that promote mucus clearance and are frequently administered in patients with ARF, despite a lack of evidence to underpin clinical decision making. The aim of this systematic review was to determine if the use of mucoactive agents in patients with ARF improves clinical outcomes. METHODS We searched electronic and grey literature (January 2020). Two reviewers independently screened, selected, extracted data and quality assessed studies. We included trials of adults receiving ventilatory support for ARF and involving at least one mucoactive agent compared with placebo or standard care. Outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation. Meta-analysis was undertaken using random-effects modelling and certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. RESULTS Thirteen randomised controlled trials were included (1712 patients), investigating four different mucoactive agents. Mucoactive agents showed no effect on duration of mechanical ventilation (seven trials, mean difference (MD) -1.34, 95% CI -2.97 to 0.29, I2=82%, very low certainty) or mortality, hospital stay and ventilator-free days. There was an effect on reducing ICU length of stay in the mucoactive agent groups (10 trials, MD -3.22, 95% CI -5.49 to -0.96, I2=89%, very low certainty).

91736,Co-localization of constituents of the dengue virus translation and replication machinery with amphisomes.,2009,"The world is facing a medical crisis amid the CoViD-19 pandemic and the role of adequate hygiene and hand sanitisers is inevitable in controlling the spread of infection in public places and healthcare institutions. There has been a great surge in demand for hand sanitisation products leading to shortages in their supply. A consequent increase of substandard products in the market has raised safety concerns. This article, therefore, presents a critical review of hand sanitation approaches and products available on the market in light of the scientific evidence available to date. This review also provides a range of hand sanitisation product formulations, and manufacturing instructions to allow for extemporaneous preparations at the community and hospital pharmacies during this urgent crisis. In addition, this emergent situation is expected to continue, hence hand sanitisers will be in demand for an extended time, and the availability and purchase of substandard products on the market create an ongoing safety concern. Therefore, this article shall also provide various commercial organisations, interested in stepping forward the production and marketing of hand sanitisers, with a guide on the development of products of standardised ingredients and formulations.","Berardi, Alberto; Perinelli, Diego R; Merchant, Hamid A; Bisharat, Lorina; Basheti, Iman A; Bonacucina, Giulia; Cespi, Marco; Palmieri, Giovanni F",International journal of pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461194/,187

We included published observational full-text articles. The mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. The significance level was set as 0.05. Eleven studies (n = 1324) were considered for meta-analysis. Using the bivariate model, the summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity for urea was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.98) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.97), respectively. The summary estimate of sensitivity and specificity for creatinine was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), respectively.

The results of this systematic review showed that the mean of urea and creatinine in the case group was significantly higher than that in the control group and the sensitivity and specificity of creatinine is higher than urea in the diagnosis of PROM.","Malchi, Fatemeh; Abedi, Parvin; Jahanfar, Shayesteh; Talebi, Forough; Faal, Shahla; Zahedian, Maryam",Reproductive sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43032-020-00271-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720249/,187
96801,How RNA viruses maintain their genome integrity.,2010,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is gaining increasing popularity in the treatment of esophageal cancer. In fact, while surgical and oncologic outcomes are not inferior to those achieved through a traditional open approach, patients undergoing MIE benefit from shorter length of stay, lesser pain and prompter recovery. This technique is, however, highly challenging, and the development of a MIE program, even in the setting of a tertiary center, requires time and progressive honing of surgical skills. METHODS We use a minimally invasive Ivor Lewis approach. The abdominal phase of the procedure includes complete celiac lymphadenectomy and tubularization of the stomach, which will constitute the neo-esophagus. The video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery portion of the operation takes place in left lateral decubitus and allows for optimal thoracic lymphadenectomy and anastomosis. RESULTS From October 2011 to January 2015, we treated 52 patients with the above-described procedure. The evolution of our anastomotic technique included a first group of circular stapled anastomosis with Orvil™ and 3.5-mm EEA™ (n = 16 patients), subsequently abandoned in favor of a linear anastomosis (n = 12), before going back to the Orvil™ coupled with 4.8-mm EEA™ (n = 22) in more recent times. There were also an additional two anastomoses that did not fall under any of these categories. We experienced two postoperative deaths. The overall leak rate was 14%, but fell down to 4% in the last group. Median LOS was 9 days. Lymph node retrieval was adequate throughout the whole series. CONCLUSIONS Developing a MIE program requires a significant learning curve before the results plateau. Only once a technique of choice is refined and mastered, the advantages granted by MIE become apparent.","Mungo, Benedetto; Lidor, Anne O; Stem, Miloslawa; Molena, Daniela",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4343-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26123339/,187

97448,Spotlight on the importance of recombinant vector platform technologies in poultry vaccination.,2021-01-19,"IMPORTANCE Intracranial stenosis is one of the most common etiologies of stroke. To our knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have compared balloon-expandable stent treatment with medical therapy in symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the balloon-expandable stent plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis (≥70%). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS VISSIT (the Vitesse Intracranial Stent Study for Ischemic Stroke Therapy) trial is an international, multicenter, 1:1 randomized, parallel group trial that enrolled patients from 27 sites (January 2009-June 2012) with last follow-up in May 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients (N = 112) were randomized to receive balloon-expandable stent plus medical therapy (stent group; n = 59) or medical therapy alone (medical group; n = 53). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE a composite of stroke in the same territory within 12 months of randomization or hard transient ischemic attack (TIA) in the same territory day 2 through month 12 postrandomization. A hard TIA was defined as a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain or retinal ischemia lasting at least 10 minutes but resolving within 24 hours. Primary safety measure: a composite of any stroke, death, or intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days of randomization and any hard TIA between days 2 and 30 of randomization. Disability was measured with the modified Rankin Scale and general health status with the EuroQol-5D, both through month 12. RESULTS Enrollment was halted by the sponsor after negative results from another trial prompted an early analysis of outcomes, which suggested futility after 112 patients of a planned sample size of 250 were enrolled. The 30-day primary safety end point occurred in more patients in the stent group (14/58; 24.1% [95% CI, 13.9%-37.2%]) vs the medical group (5/53; 9.4% [95% CI, 3.1%-20.7%]) (P = .05). Intracranial hemorrhage within 30 days occurred in more patients in the stent group (5/58; 8.6% [95% CI, 2.9%-19.0%]) vs none in the medical group (95% CI, 0%-5.5%) (P = .06). The 1-year primary outcome of stroke or hard TIA occurred in more patients in the stent group (21/58; 36.2% [95% CI, 24.0-49.9]) vs the medical group (8/53; 15.1% [95% CI, 6.7-27.6]) (P = .02). Worsening of baseline disability score (modified Rankin Scale) occurred in more patients in the stent group (14/58; 24.1% [95% CI, 13.9%-37.2%]) vs the medical group (6/53; 11.3% [95% CI, 4.3%-23.0%]) (P = .09).The EuroQol-5D showed no difference in any of the 5 dimensions between groups at 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, the use of a balloon-expandable stent compared with medical therapy resulted in an increased 12-month risk of added stroke or TIA in the same territory, and increased 30-day risk of any stroke or TIA. These findings do not support the use of a balloon-expandable stent for patients with symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis.

99844,Heuristic RNA pseudoknot prediction including intramolecular kissing hairpins.,2011,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell is an effective therapy in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphomas that, due to its unique toxicities, often requires escalation of care to the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin are serum inflammatory markers associated with onset and persistence of CAR T-cell-related toxicity. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) who were divided into two groups: patients requiring admission to the ICU during initial hospitalization (n = 13, 38%) and those who did not (n = 21, 62%). Primary objective was to examine possible relationships between serum ferritin and/or CRP levels with the need for, and length of, ICU stay between these groups. RESULTS All 13 patients admitted to the ICU developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 11 of them also developed neurotoxicity (NT). Of the 21 patients in the non-ICU group, 18 developed CRS and 5 patients developed NT. Grade of CRS and NT were higher in ICU versus non-ICU patients (p = .03 and .001, respectively). There was no correlation between CRP levels at time of ICU admission and length of ICU stay (correlation of 0.41, p = .17). Yet, there was an association between serum ferritin levels and length of ICU stay (R2 = 0.73) which did not reach statistical significance (correlation of 0.21, p = .49). CONCLUSION Notwithstanding the limitations of the small sample size, our study suggests that an elevated ferritin level at the time of escalation of medical care may be possibly indicative of anticipated prolonged ICU hospitalization in patients treated with axi-cel. A large multicenter study is certainly needed to confirm this observation.","Melody, Megan; Rahman, Zaid Abdel; Saunders, Hollie; Diaz, Paula Lengerke; Gannon, Nicole; Rosenthal, Allison; Ayala, Ernesto; Tun, Han W; Murthy, Hemant; Roy, Vivek; Foran, James; Castro, Januario E; Guru, Pramod; Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A",Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hemonc.2020.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069694/,187

We aimed to develop a clinically useful tool to identify patients who are likely to benefit from endovascular therapy. METHODS In a derivation cohort of consecutively treated patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (Grady Memorial Hospital, N=247), independent predictors (p<0.1) of good outcome (90-day modified Rankin scale score (mRS) 0-2) were determined using logistic regression to derive the Pittsburgh Response to Endovascular therapy (PRE) score as a predictor of good outcome. The PRE score was validated in two institutional cohorts (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC): N=393; Unitat d'Ictus Vall d'Hebron: N=204) and its discriminative power for good outcome was compared with other validated tools. Benefit of successful recanalization was assessed in PRE score groups. RESULTS Independent predictors of good outcome in the derivation cohort (age, baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS)) were used in the model: PRE score=age (years)+2×NIHSS-10 × ASPECTS. PRE score was highly predictive of good outcome in the derivation cohort (area under the curve (AUC)=0.79) and validation cohorts (UPMC: AUC=0.79; UIVH: AUC=0.72) with comparable rates of good outcome in all PRE risk quartiles. PRE was superior to Totaled Health Risks In Vascular Events (THRIVE) (p=0.03) and Stroke Prognostication using Age and NIHSS (SPAN) (p=0.007), with a trend towards superiority to Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy 2 (HIAT2) (p=0.06) and iSCORE (p=0.051) in predicting good outcomes. Better outcomes were associated with successful recanalization in patients with PRE scores -24 to +49 but not in patients with PRE scores <-24 or ≥ 50. CONCLUSIONS The PRE score is a validated tool that predicts outcomes and may facilitate patient selection for endovascular therapy in anterior circulation large vessel occlusions.","Rangaraju, Srikant; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Streib, Christopher; Sun, Chung-Huan; Ribo, Marc; Muchada, Marion; Nogueira, Raul; Frankel, Michael; Gupta, Rishi; Jadhav, Ashutosh; Jovin, Tudor G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320054/,187

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee. METHODS Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally. CONCLUSIONS The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.","Hussein, Mohammad; Toraih, Eman; Elshazli, Rami; Fawzy, Manal; Houghton, August; Tatum, Danielle; Killackey, Mary; Kandil, Emad; Duchesne, Juan",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004400; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33214421/,187

103403,Evaluation of a multi-epitope subunit vaccine against avian leukosis virus subgroup J in chickens.,2015,"OBJECTIVE Constructing a framework to evaluate consciousness is an important issue in neuroscience research and clinical practice. However, there is still no systematic framework for quantifying altered consciousness along the dimensions of both level and content. This study builds a framework to differentiate the following states: coma, general anesthesia, minimally conscious state (MCS), and normal wakefulness. METHODS This study analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from frontal channels in patients with disorders of consciousness (either coma or MCS), patients under general anesthesia, and healthy participants in normal waking consciousness (NWC). Four non-linear methods - permutation entropy (PE), sample entropy (SampEn), permutation Lempel-Ziv complexity (PLZC), and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) - as well as relative power (RP), extracted features from the EEG recordings. A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine (GA-SVM) classified the states of consciousness based on the extracted features. A multivariable linear regression model then built EEG indices for level and content of consciousness. RESULTS The PE differentiated all four states of consciousness (p<0.001). Altered contents of consciousness for NWC, MCS, coma, and general anesthesia were best differentiated by the SampEn, and PLZC. In contrast, the levels of consciousness for these four states were best differentiated by RP of Gamma and PE. A multi-dimensional index, combined with the GA-SVM, showed that the integration of PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA had the highest classification accuracy (92.3%). The GA-SVM was better than random forest and neural networks at differentiating these four states. The 'coordinate value' in the dimensions of level and content were constructed by the multivariable linear regression model and the non-linear measures PE, PLZC, SampEn, and DFA. CONCLUSIONS Multi-dimensional measurements, especially the PE, SampEn, PLZC, and DFA, when combined with GA-SVM, are promising methods for constructing a framework to quantify consciousness.","Liang, Zhenhu; Shao, Shuai; Lv, Zhe; Li, Duan; Sleigh, Jamie W; Li, Xiaoli; Zhang, Chongyang; He, Jianghong",IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsre.2020.2964819; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31940541/,187

105781,A27 Using whole genome sequence data and minority variant profiles to elucidate transmission patterns during RSV household outbreaks.,2017,"BACKGROUND Intraoperative awareness with explicit recall is a potentially devastating complication of surgery that has been attributed to low anaesthetic concentrations in the vast majority of cases. Past studies have proposed the determination of an adequate dose for general anaesthetics that could be used to alert providers of potentially insufficient anaesthesia. However, there have been no systematic analyses of appropriate thresholds to develop population-based alerting algorithms for preventing intraoperative awareness. OBJECTIVE To identify a threshold for intraoperative alerting that could be applied for the prevention of awareness with explicit recall. DESIGN Secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial (Michigan Awareness Control Study). SETTING Three hospitals at a tertiary care centre in the USA. PATIENTS Unselected patients presenting for surgery under general anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS Alerts based on end-tidal anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Using case and outcomes data from the primary study, end-tidal anaesthetic concentration and bispectral index values were analysed using Youden's index and c-statistics derived from a receiver operating characteristic curve to determine a specific alerting threshold for the prevention of awareness. RESULTS No single population-based threshold that maximises sensitivity and specificity could be identified for the prevention of intraoperative awareness, using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values. The c-statistic for anaesthetic concentration was 0.431 ± 0.046, and 0.491 ± 0.056 for bispectral index values. CONCLUSION We could not derive a single population-based alerting threshold for the prevention of intraoperative awareness using either anaesthetic concentration or bispectral index values.

METHODS A retrospective review of a prospectively acquired acute stroke intervention database was performed. Primary MAT was carried out with a preference for the largest catheter considered to be trackable into the target occlusive lesion. The catheter was wedged into the thrombus followed by manual aspiration with a 20 ml syringe. RESULTS 112 consecutive patients were evaluated. The median age was 66 years and the median NIH Stroke Scale score was 17. Occlusion locations included the M1 (62%), M2 (8%), internal carotid artery terminus (19%) and the vertebrobasilar artery (11%). Patients with anterior occlusions had tandem extracranial/intracranial occlusive lesions in 18.7% Median time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 267 min, and from groin puncture to recanalization was 70 min. Successful recanalization (defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b/3) with primary MAT was 59% with a median of two passes. 41% of patients required the use of adjunctive therapy yielding an overall recanalization rate of TICI 2b/3 (86%) and TICI 3 (30.6%). Parenchymal hematoma of any type (PH1/PH2) was seen in 9.8% of patients, with symptomatic hemorrhage in 6%. Favorable outcomes (90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2) were 46%. Mortality at 3 months was 31%. Primary MAT was associated with faster procedural times (mean 63 vs 97 min, p<0.0001) but not with higher rates of favorable outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Primary MAT is an alternative endovascular recanalization technique with reasonable first pass efficacy that will likely improve with technology and experience.","Jankowitz, Brian; Grandhi, Ramesh; Horev, Anat; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Jadhav, Ashutosh; Linares, Guillermo; Jovin, Tudor",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24385557/,187

STUDY DESIGN Twenty-two mothers >24 weeks gestation presenting within 4 hours of diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis were randomized with their 24 infants to NAC or saline treatment. Antenatal NAC (100 mg/kg/dose) or saline was given intravenously every 6 hours until delivery. Postnatally, NAC (12.5-25 mg/kg/dose, n = 12) or saline (n = 12) was given every 12 hours for 5 doses. Doppler studies of fetal umbilical and fetal and infant cerebral blood flow, cranial ultrasounds, echocardiograms, cerebral oxygenation, electroencephalograms, and serum cytokines were evaluated before and after treatment, and 12, 24, and 48 hours after birth. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion imaging were performed at term age equivalent. Development was followed for cerebral palsy or autism to 4 years of age. RESULTS Cardiovascular measures, cerebral blood flow velocity and vascular resistance, and cerebral oxygenation did not differ between treatment groups. Cerebrovascular coupling was disrupted in infants with chorioamnionitis treated with saline but preserved in infants treated with NAC, suggesting improved vascular regulation in the presence of neuroinflammation. Infants treated with NAC had higher serum anti-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and lower proinflammatory vascular endothelial growth factor over time vs controls.

Eribulin, a non-taxane tubulin inhibitor, demonstrated improved survival in previous studies and also showed mild toxicity when used in late-line therapy for MBC. We conducted a phase II study to investigate the efficacy of eribulin mesylate as the first-line chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative MBC. This was a phase II, open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial conducted in Japan. Patients with HER2-negative MBC received intravenous eribulin (1.4 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle). The primary efficacy outcome was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included time to treatment failure, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 35 patients were enrolled and received a median of 8 (range 1-21) cycles of eribulin therapy. ORR and clinical benefit rate were 54.3 and 62.9 %, respectively. Median PFS was 5.8 months and median OS was 35.9 months. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 63 % of patients. The majority of non-hematological adverse events were mild in severity. The present trial demonstrated that eribulin has antitumor activity comparable with other key established cytotoxic agents with acceptable safety and tolerability. Thus, eribulin as first-line chemotherapy might be beneficial for patients with HER2-negative MBC.","Takashima, Tsutomu; Tokunaga, Shinya; Tei, Seika; Nishimura, Shigehiko; Kawajiri, Hidemi; Kashiwagi, Shinichiro; Yamagata, Shigehito; Noda, Satoru; Nishimori, Takeo; Mizuyama, Yoko; Sunami, Takeshi; Tezuka, Kenji; Ikeda, Katsumi; Ogawa, Yoshinari; Onoda, Naoyoshi; Ishikawa, Tetsuro; Kudoh, Shinzoh; Takada, Minoru; Hirakawa, Kosei",SpringerPlus,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-1833-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27026861/,187

This review aimed to identify recent advances in care provision for people with respiratory problems and preexisting serious mental illness to ease symptom burden and reduce the risk of premature mortality. RECENT FINDINGS Intervention-based studies in this area are scarce. The evidence reviewed originated from observational studies. Concluding comments from the synthesis suggest there are specific needs for proactive screening of respiratory function as part of routine physical health checks across care settings for people living with serious mental illness, more stringent monitoring of comorbid chronic lung conditions and increased attention in reducing the frequency respiratory infections. Integrated services across care settings are needed to support people with serious mental illness to limit the impact of modifiable lifestyle factors known to be detrimental to respiratory health, such as smoking.

We assessed the incidence, predictors, and implications of cerebrovascular events in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction managed with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention strategy. METHODS AND RESULTS In the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI) trial, 72 of 3602 patients (2.0%) experienced at least 1 cerebrovascular event (stroke: 63 patients; transient ischemic attack: 12 patients) during the 3-year follow-up (40.3% within 30 days, 20.8% between 30 days and 1 year, and 38.9% between 1 and 3 years). Stroke was ischemic in 58 (92.1%) patients and hemorrhagic in 5 (7.9%) patients. More than half of all strokes (52.3%) were disabling. By principal management strategy, cerebrovascular events developed in 2.0%, 14.9%, and 1.9% of patients triaged to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and medical therapy, respectively (P<0.0001). Cerebrovascular events were independently predicted by older age, creatinine clearance <60 mL/min, treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. Cerebrovascular events were associated with significantly increased rates of 3-year mortality (20.5% versus 6.5%; P<0.0001), as well as reinfarction (14.3% versus 3.8%; P=0.0007), ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (22.8% versus 13.0%; P=0.006), and major bleeding (23.5% versus 8.4%; P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS In HORIZONS-AMI, cerebrovascular events within 3 years after ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in patients undergoing a primary percutaneous coronary intervention management strategy occurred in 2.0% of patients and were most frequent after coronary artery bypass grafting. Cerebrovascular events were often disabling and were strongly associated with high rates of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, and major bleeding.

BACKGROUND Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. DESIGN Cross-sectional online survey. METHODS A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. RESULTS Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.","Ruiz-Fernández, María Dolores; Ramos-Pichardo, Juan Diego; Ibáñez-Masero, Olivia; Cabrera-Troya, José; Carmona-Rega, María Inés; Ortega-Galán, Ángela María",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860287/,187

Objective The objective of this study is to estimate the nonparticipation rates among FSWs and its effect on the observed HIV prevalence rate during HSS-2017. Methods The data were collected from FSW sentinel sites located in the states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (Central Zone). The HIV positivity rate among FSWs who participated in HSS-2017 was compared with the HIV positivity rate of those who did not participate. HIV status of the participants was obtained from HSS-2017 data. The master list of participating targeted intervention sites was accessed to obtain the last known HIV status of the eligible nonparticipants. Results Nonparticipation rate of FSWs from the central zone during HSS2017 was 10.8%.

122832,The unexpected roles of eukaryotic translation elongation factors in RNA virus replication and pathogenesis.,2013,"Winnicott's clinical-theoretical matrix constitutes a distinction in underlying basic principles from both the Freudian and Kleinian models. In essence, Winnicott's concept of trauma is entirely related to the vicissitudes of the early psychic parent-infant relationship in which the mother's role is fundamental for the development of the newborn's psyche at the beginning and subsequently. While Winnicott acknowledges the difference between physical and psychic trauma, his focus is on how the interpsychic relationship, psyche to nascent psyche, contributes to the infant's intrapsychic world. Thus, early trauma is caused by psychic transmissions that emanate through and because of the mother's affective states of mind towards her fetus-becoming-an-infant and her infant-becoming-a-child. The earlier that psychic trauma occurs in the nascent psyche, the more severe the outcome of the individual's mental health. This is why Winnicott refers to psychosis as an environmental deficiency disease as distinct from psychotic defences. The author outlines Winnicott's key concepts that are intrinsic to his theory of trauma i.e. the antisocial tendency, fear of breakdown and regression. These concepts are woven into the fabric of Winnicott's theoretical matrix and highlight his perspective on psychoanalysis as a therapeutic treatment for all levels of psychic trauma.","Abram, Jan",The International journal of psycho-analysis,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207578.2021.1932079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196260/,187

127524,Exploring the virome of diseased horses.,2015,"Background. Single-port laparoscopic surgery has recently emerged as a method to improve patient recovery and cosmetic benefits of laparoscopic surgery. The evolution of our technique has led us to move from a periumbilical incision to a transumbilical one, avoiding the use of drain and maintaining a pure single-port approach with intracorporeal anastomosis in order to maintain the incision as smaller as possible. Method. We report a prospective clinical analysis of our first 38 patients. Oncological surgical steps were followed as during the standard laparoscopic approach, performing the anastomosis intracorporeally in all cases. Results. Mean age of 68,39 years old and an average BMI of 27,88%. (range 19,81-41,5). Most lesions were adenocarcinoma (65,8%), while the remaining were polyps (31,5%) and one a mucocele of the appendix. We moved from a periumbilical incision, initial 14 cases, into a transumbilical one, (medium size of the incision 3,25 cm). Average surgical time was 117,42 minutes. Drains was only used in our first 3 cases. Mean hospital stay was 5,2 days, (86,5% stayed less than 5 days). Total morbidity was 13%. Histological exams of the specimens showed that the oncological criteria were preserved. Conclusions. Single-port right hemicolectomy with intracorporeal anastomosis is feasible and safe. The advantages of a total intracorporeal anastomosis include that there is no need to enlarge the umbilical incision and avoid traction of the pedicle of the mesenterium of the transverse colon during the extracorporeal anastomosis. A transumbilical incision offers better cosmetic results, and the use of drains can be avoided, which increase, patient's satisfaction.","Morales-Conde, Salvador; Barranco, Antonio; Socas, María; Méndez, Cristina; Alarcón, Isaias; Cañete, Jesús; Padillo, Francisco J",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/874172; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22567227/,187
128506,The leader proteinase of foot-and-mouth disease virus: structure-function relationships in a proteolytic virulence factor.,2014,"BACKGROUND Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii is a representative probiotic yeast that has been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. However, S. boulardii has not been studied as a microbial cell factory for producing useful substances. Agarose, a major component of red macroalgae, can be depolymerized into neoagarooligosaccharides (NAOSs) by an endo-type β-agarase. NAOSs, including neoagarotetraose (NeoDP4), are known to be health-benefiting substances owing to their prebiotic effect. Thus, NAOS production in the gut is required. In this study, the probiotic yeast S. boulardii was engineered to produce NAOSs by expressing an endo-type β-agarase, BpGH16A, derived from a human gut bacterium Bacteroides plebeius. RESULTS In total, four different signal peptides were compared in S. boulardii for protein (BpGH16A) secretion for the first time. The SED1 signal peptide derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was selected as optimal for extracellular production of NeoDP4 from agarose. Expression of BpGH16A was performed in two ways using the plasmid vector system and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 system. The production of NeoDP4 by engineered S. boulardii was verified and quantified. NeoDP4 was produced by S. boulardii engineered using the plasmid vector system and CRISPR-Cas9 at 1.86 and 0.80 g/L in a 72-h fermentation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on NAOS production using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii. Our results suggest that S. boulardii can be considered a microbial cell factory to produce health-beneficial substances in the human gut.","Jin, Yerin; Yu, Sora; Liu, Jing-Jing; Yun, Eun Ju; Lee, Jae Won; Jin, Yong-Su; Kim, Kyoung Heon",Microbial cell factories,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-021-01644-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407819/,187

The aim of this study was to develop a tomography perfusion source imaging-based assessment of collateral vessel status. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who received intravenous thrombolysis or intra-arterial reperfusion therapy after CTP were retrospectively analyzed. In those with middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery occlusion, CT perfusion source imaging was used to identify the relative filling time delay between the normal MCA Sylvian branches and those in the affected hemisphere. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the association of the relative filling time delay with the 24-hour Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score based on noncontrast CT and the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score. RESULTS There were 217 patients treated in 2009-2011 who had CTP data, of whom 60 had MCA or ICA occlusion and 55 had 90-day mRS data. The intraclass correlation coefficient for relative filling time delay was 0.95. Relative filling time delay was correlated with 24-hour ASPECTS (Spearman ρ=-0.674; P<.001) and 90-day mRS score (ρ=0.516, P<.01). Increased relative filling time delay was associated with poor radiologic outcome (ASPECTS, 0-7) (area under the curve=0.79, P<.001) and poor functional outcome (mRS score, 3-6) (area under the curve=0.77, P=.001). In multivariate logistic regression, the association of longer relative filling time delay with poor outcome remained significant, independent of age, sex, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. CONCLUSIONS Relative filling time delay is a useful independent predictor of clinical outcome after ischemic stroke.","Cao, W; Campbell, B C V; Dong, Q; Davis, S M; Yan, B",AJNR.

Validated symptom measures are fundamental for researchers to understand women's symptom experience of PD and to test symptom interventions. The objective of this paper was to critically review the content and psychometric properties of self-report tools to measure symptoms of PD. Databases including PubMed, PsychoINFO, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Health and Psychosocial Instruments were searched for self-report symptom measures that had been used among women with either PD or perimenstrual symptoms. A total of 15 measures met inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The measures were categorized into generic pain measures, dysmenorrhoea-specific measures, and tools designed to measure perimenstrual symptoms. These measures had varying degrees of comprehensiveness of symptoms being measured, relevance to PD, multidimensionality and psychometric soundness. No single measure was found to be optimal for use, but some dysmenorrhoea-specific measures could be recommended if revised and further tested. Key issues in symptom measurement for PD are discussed. Future research needs to strengthen dysmenorrhoea-specific symptom measures by including a comprehensive list of symptoms based on the pathogenesis of PD, exploring relevant symptom dimensions beyond symptom severity (e.g., frequency, duration, symptom distress), and testing psychometric properties of the adapted tools using sound methodology and diverse samples.","Chen, C X; Kwekkeboom, K L; Ward, S E",European journal of pain,https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25059384/,187
131028,Viral subversion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.,2020-07-22,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, whose progression and stability are modulated, among other factors, by an innate and adaptive immune response. Prodiginines are bacterial secondary metabolites with antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities; however, their effect on the progression or vulnerability of atheromatous plaque has not been evaluated. This study assessed the therapeutic potential of prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin on inflammatory marker expression and atherosclerosis. An in vitro and in vivo study was carried out. Migration, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and angiogenesis assays were performed on cell types involved in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. In addition, male LDL receptor null (Ldlr-/-) C57BL/6J mice were treated with prodigiosin or undecylprodigiosin for 28 days. Morphometric analysis of atherosclerotic plaques, gene expression of atherogenic factors in the aortic sinus and serum cytokine quantification were performed. The treatments applied had slight effects on the in vitro tests performed, highlighting the inhibitory effect on the migration of SMCs (smooth muscle cells). On the other hand, although no significant difference in atherosclerotic plaque progression was observed, gene expression of IL-4 and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (Ccl2) was downregulated. In addition, 50 µg/Kg/day of both treatments was sufficient to inhibit circulating tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in serum. These results suggested that prodigiosin and undecylprodigiosin modulated inflammatory markers and could have an impact in reducing atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability.","Cuevas, Alejandro; Saavedra, Nicolás; Salazar, Luis A; Cavalcante, Marcela F; Silva, Jacqueline C; Abdalla, Dulcineia S P",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899258/,187

RESULTS Of the 43 OBGYN operations, 34 were hysterectomies: 10 open, 10 RA, nine vaginally, and five pure laparoscopic. Nine patients had alternative OBGYN operations: three caesarean sections, three oophorectomies (one open, two laparoscopic), one RA colpopexy, one open pelvic cervical cerclage with mesh and one RA removal of an invasive endometrioma. In all, 49 genitourinary (GU) injuries were sustained: ureteric ligation (26), ureterovaginal fistula (10), ureterocutaneous fistula (one), vesicovaginal fistula (VVF; 10) and cystotomy alone (two). In all, 10 patients (23.3%) underwent immediate urological repair at the time of their OBGYN RA surgery. The mean (range) time between OBGYN injury and definitive delayed repair was 23.5 (1-297) months. Four patients had undergone prior failed repair: two open VVF repairs and two balloon ureteric dilatations with stent placement. In all, 22 ureteric re-implants (11 with ipsilateral psoas hitch) and 15 uretero-ureterostomies were performed. Stents were placed in all ureteric cases for a mean (range) of 32 (1-63) days. In all, 10 VVF repairs and two primary cystotomy closures were performed. Drains were placed in 28 cases (57.1%) for a mean (range) of 4.1 (1-26) days. No case required open conversion. Two patients (4.1%) developed ureteric obstruction after RA repair requiring dilatation and stenting. The mean (range) follow-up of the entire cohort was 16.6 (1-63) months. CONCLUSIONS RA repair of GU injuries during OBGYN surgery is associated with good outcomes, appears safe and feasible, and can be used successfully immediately after injury recognition or as a salvage procedure after prior attempted repair. RA techniques may improve convalescence in a patient population where quick recovery is paramount.","Gellhaus, Paul T; Bhandari, Akshay; Monn, M Francesca; Gardner, Thomas A; Kanagarajah, Prashanth; Reilly, Christopher E; Llukani, Elton; Lee, Ziho; Eun, Daniel D; Rashid, Hani; Joseph, Jean V; Ghazi, Ahmed E; Wu, Guan; Boris, Ronald S",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.12785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24750903/,187

It is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide due to its effects on end organs, and through its associations with chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes mellitus and obesity. Despite current management strategies, many patients do not achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. Hypertension-related cardiovascular mortality rates are rising in tandem with the increasing global prevalence of CKD, diabetes mellitus and obesity. Improving BP control must therefore be urgently prioritised. Strategies include utilising existing antihypertensive agents more effectively, and using treatments developed for co-existing conditions (such as sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors for diabetes mellitus) that offer additional BP-lowering and cardiovascular benefits. Additionally, novel therapeutic agents that target alternative pro-hypertensive pathways and that offer broader cardiovascular protection are under development, including dual angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors. Non-pharmacological strategies such as immunotherapy are also being explored.

METHODS Using a Delphi questionnaire that was developed by integration of the opinions of newly qualified doctors (< 2 years practice), prescribing specialists, and patients using BM, a Delphi method was used to guide an experts' panel into consensus on the different opinions in the questionnaire, and from this, a framework for the use of BM was constructed. RESULTS From the surveys, 76.2% of the newly qualified doctors and 91.7% of the prescribing specialists indicated that they had limited knowledge on the pharmacology of BM, and, respectively, 64.5% and 77.8% admitted that their knowledge on BM was not adequate for prescribing and taking care of patients on BM. Also, 58.3% and 75% of the prescribers indicated that the high cost and the tedious procurement process, respectively, were barriers of access to BM. The Delphi panel reached consensus after 2 rounds, and the resultant framework recommends that, appropriate use of BM requires establishing guidelines for the use of BM, increasing BM content in the medical training programs and information resources used by healthcare professionals, enacting drug regulations and drug policies that will increase availability of BM, offering appropriate patient information and public engagement. CONCLUSION The lack of knowledge on BM by health professionals, together with the high cost and a complex procurement processes are the major impediment to access to BM. A framework for the use of BM in South Africa was successfully developed to address these and other challenges.","Mocke-Richter, Martlie; Walubo, Andrew; van Rooyen, Cornel",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1002/pds.5332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292648/,187

Imaging studies revealed a large hydatid cyst in the right thoracic cavity compressing the spinal cord. The patient was prescribed a 14-day course of albendazole therapy. He underwent laparoscopic transdiaphragmatic deroofing and evacuation of the cyst. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient started showing symptom relief from day 1 of surgery and by day 3, his right leg strength and sensation recovered remarkably. Echinococcal cyst is a zoonotic disease that can affect any part of the body. Vertebral involvement and spinal cord compression is a rare manifestation of echinococcal disease.

This single-institution case series evaluates the safety and efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the management of metastatic HB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between March 2008 and February 2015, RFA was used as part of multidisciplinary management for HB recurrence or metastasis in 5 children (median 5.0 years old) in an attempt to provide locoregional control and preclude additional surgery. Combined local treatments of 38 metachronous metastases included surgical metastasectomy (14 lesions: 7 lung, 7 liver), percutaneous RFA (23 lesions: 21 lung, 1 liver, 1 bone), and stereotactic radiotherapy (1 liver lesion). RESULTS For lesions treated with RFA (median diameter 6 mm, range 3-15 mm), local control was achieved in 22/23 metastases (95.6%) with median follow-up of 30.1 months after RFA (range 18.9-65.7). Median hospitalization was 3 days (2-7), with major complications limited to 1 pneumothorax requiring temporary small-caliber chest tube. Four children remain in complete remission with median follow-up of 67 months (range 41.2-88.8) after primary tumor resection, with mean disease-free survival of 31.7 months after last local treatment. One child succumbed to rapidly progressive disease 12 months after RFA (23.9 months after primary tumor resection). CONCLUSION RFA provides a safe and effective reiterative treatment option in the multidisciplinary management of children with metastatic HB.","Yevich, Steven; Calandri, Marco; Gravel, Guillaume; Fresneau, Brice; Brugières, Laurence; Valteau-Couanet, Dominique; Branchereau, Sophie; Chardot, Christophe; Aerts, Isabelle; de Baere, Thierry; Tselikas, Lambros; Deschamps, Frederic",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-018-2097-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30350173/,187

Here we show that AGGF1 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating p53 when acting inside tumor cells. AGGF1 antagonizes MDM2 function to inhibit p53 ubiquitination, increases the acetylation, phosphorylation, stability and expression levels of p53, activates transcription of p53 target genes, and regulates cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. AGGF1 also interacts with p53 through the FHA domain. Somatic AGGF1 variants in the FHA domain in human tumors, including p.Q467H, p.Y469 N, and p.N483T, inhibit AGGF1 activity on tumor suppression. These results identify a key role for AGGF1 in an AGGF1-MDM2-p53 signaling axis with important functions in tumor suppression, and uncover a novel trans-tumor-suppression mechanism dependent on p53. This study has potential implications in diagnosis and therapies of cancer.","Si, Wenxia; Zhou, Bisheng; Xie, Wen; Li, Hui; Li, Ke; Li, Sisi; Deng, Wenbing; Shi, Pengcheng; Yuan, Chao; Ke, Tie; Ren, Xiang; Tu, Xin; Zeng, Xiaomei; Weigelt, Britta; Rubin, Brian P; Chen, Qiuyun; Xu, Chengqi; Wang, Qing Kenneth",Cancer letters,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2020.10.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069768/,187

METHODS A web-based COVID-19 survey was emailed to 26,045 patients followed in the Division of Rheumatology at a single center in New York City. Women aged 18 to 50 were asked about pregnancy. We compared the COVID-19 experience between pregnant and non-pregnant women, and also explored the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS Of 7,094/26,045 respondents, 1,547 were women aged 18 to 50, with 61 (4%) reporting being pregnant during the pandemic. The prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women (8% vs.9% respectively, p=0.76). Among women with COVID-19, pregnant women had shorter duration of symptoms (p <0.01) and were more likely to experience loss of smell or taste (p=0.02) than non-pregnant women. Approximately three-fourths of women had a systemic rheumatic disease, with no differences when stratified by pregnancy or COVID-19 status. 67% of pregnant women noted changes to prenatal care during the pandemic, and 23% of postpartum women stated the pandemic affected delivery. CONCLUSION Among women followed in the Division of Rheumatology at a major center in New York City, pregnancy was not associated with increased self-reported COVID-19. Pregnancy was associated with a shorter duration of COVID-19 symptoms and a higher prevalence of loss of smell or taste.

The S100A8-S100A9 complex facilitated viral replication in human CD4(+) T lymphocytes latently infected with HIV-1- and S100A8-induced HIV-1 transcriptional activity. Mechanisms inducing the S100 genes and the potential source of these proteins following viral activation are unknown. In this study, we show that S100A8 was induced in murine macrophages, and S100A8 and S100A9 in human monocytes and macrophages, by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, a dsRNA mimetic. Induction was at the transcriptional level and was IL-10 dependent. Similar to LPS-induced S100A8, induction by dsRNA was dependent on p38 and ERK MAPK. Protein kinase R (PKR) mediates antiviral defense and participates in MyD88-dependent/independent signaling triggered by TLR4 or TLR3. Like IL-10, S100 induction by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid and by LPS was inhibited by the specific PKR inhibitor 2-aminopurine, indicating a novel IL-10, PKR-dependent pathway. Other mediators such as IFN-beta, which synergized with dsRNA, may also be involved. C/EBPbeta bound the defined promoter region in response to dsRNA. S100A8 was expressed in lungs of mice infected with influenza virus and was maximal at day 8 with strong immunoreactivity in epithelial cells lining the airways and in mononuclear cells and declined early in the recovery phase, implying down-regulation by mediator(s) up-regulated during resolution of the infection. IL-10 is implicated in viral persistence. Since S100A8/S100A9 levels are likely to be maintained in conditions where IL-10 is raised, these proteins may contribute to viral persistence in patients infected by some RNA viruses.","Endoh, Yasumi; Chung, Yuen Ming; Clark, Ian A; Geczy, Carolyn L; Hsu, Kenneth",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.0802683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201880/,187

One of the strategies is to track and diagnose cases in order to isolate and interrupt the epidemiological chain. Therefore, the aim of this article is to describe the different most used diagnostic tests and analyze their validity and indications for use according to scientific evidence and the main recommendations of scientific societies and reference organizations at national and international level. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the availability of tests has been subject to the conditions of the manufacturing market itself and to the guidelines set in each country. Among the most used types of tests, it is worth highlighting PCR, antibody detection tests (IgG and IGM) and total antibodies (Ab), also known as rapid tests, and tests for the detection of antigens in nasopharyngeal exudate or other upper/lower respiratory samples. For each of these tests, it is necessary to know their recommendations for use and the procedure for taking samples, which is essential to minimize alterations in the results due to poor handling. Likewise, it is necessary to determine the most appropriate moment for taking samples and their adequate interpretation of the results obtained, which must always be considered together with the patient's symptoms for clinical decision-making.","Gestoso-Pecellín, Lidia; García-Flores, Yuneysa; González-Quintana, Pino; Marrero-Arencibia, José Luis",Enfermeria clinica,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629849/,187
148281,Advances in canine distemper virus pathogenesis research: a wildlife perspective.,2017,"Viral vaccine vectors have emerged as an attractive strategy for the development of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine. Recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) stands out as a vaccine vector since it has a proven safety profile in humans, it is a potent inducer of both alpha interferon (IFN-α) and IFN-β) production, and it is a potent inducer of dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Our group has previously generated an rNDV vector expressing a codon-optimized HIV Gag protein and demonstrated its ability to induce a Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell response in mice. In this report we demonstrate that the Gag-specific immune response can be further enhanced by the targeting of the rNDV-encoded HIV Gag antigen to DCs. Targeting of the HIV Gag antigen was achieved by the addition of a single-chain Fv (scFv) antibody specific for the DC-restricted antigen uptake receptor DEC205 such that the DEC205 scFv-Gag molecule was encoded for expression as a fusion protein. The vaccination of mice with rNDV coding for the DC-targeted Gag antigen induced an enhanced Gag-specific CD8(+) T cell response and enhanced numbers of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen relative to vaccination with rNDV coding for a nontargeted Gag antigen. Importantly, mice vaccinated with the DEC205-targeted vaccine were better protected from challenge with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the HIV Gag protein. Here we demonstrate that the targeting of the HIV Gag antigen to DCs via the DEC205 receptor enhances the ability of an rNDV vector to induce a potent antigen-specific immune response.","Maamary, Jad; Array, Frida; Gao, Qinshan; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Steinman, Ralph M; Palese, Peter; Nchinda, Godwin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02036-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21159873/,187

Methods: SEIR dynamics model was used to fit daily onset infections to search the start date of this resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing. The number of cumulative infections from June 12 to July 1 in Beijing were fitted considering different levels of control strength. Results: The current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing probably started between May 22 and May 28 (cumulative probability: 95%), with the highest probability on May 25 (23%). The R(0) of the current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic was 4.22 (95%CI: 2.88-7.02). Dynamic model fitting suggested that by June 11, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reached 99 (95%CI: 77-121), which was in line with the actual situation, and without control, by July 1, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reach 65 090 (95%CI: 39 068-105 037). Since June 12,comprehensive prevention and control measures have been implemented in Beijing, as of July 1,compared with uncontrolled situation, the number of infections had been reduced by 99%, similar to the fitting result of a 95% reduction of the transmission rate. The sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions: For the emergent outbreak of COVID-19, the dynamics model can be used to infer the start time of the transmission and help tracing the source of epidemic. The comprehensive prevention and control measures taken in Beijing have quickly blocked over 95% of the transmission routes and reduced 99% of the infections, containing the sudden epidemic timely and effectively,which have value in guiding the prevention and control of the epidemic in the future.","Wei, Y Y; Guan, J X; Zhao, Y; Shen, S P; Chen, F",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112338-20200706-00927; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736418/,187

For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release.

Seventy-four LC surgeries were performed by surgical residents in the presence of faculty members. A self-assessment of the technical and nontechnical performance of the residents was requested. The self-assessment of residents was compared with observer evaluations using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Gwet AC2 fit coefficient was used to determine the consistency between the observers' and residents' assessments. Bland-Altman plots were generated with 95% limits of agreement to describe the agreement between the total scores of the observers. RESULTS The self-assessment of residents had a statistically significant higher score when compared with observers (faculty and nurses) (P<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the total scores given by the observers (faculty members and nurses) (P>0.05).

We compared response to NAC for T4 BCa in the U.S. and Nigeria to direct future interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-sectional retrospective analysis included all non-metastatic T4 BCa patients treated from 2010-2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, U.S.) and Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (Ile Ife, Nigeria). Pathologic complete response (pCR) and survival were compared and factors contributing to disparities evaluated. RESULTS 308 patients met inclusion criteria: 157 (51%) in the U.S. and 151 (49%) in Nigeria. All U.S. patients received NAC and surgery compared with 93 (62%) Nigerian patients. 56/93 (60%) Nigerian patients completed their prescribed course of NAC. In Nigeria, older age and higher socioeconomic status were associated with treatment receipt. Fewer patients in Nigeria had immunohistochemistry performed (100% U.S. vs. 18% Nigeria). Of those with available receptor subtype, 18% (28/157) of U.S. patients were triple negative vs. 39% (9/23) of Nigerian patients. Overall pCR was seen in 27% (42/155) of U.S. patients and 5% (4/76) of Nigerian patients. Five-year survival was significantly shorter in Nigeria vs. the U.S. (61% vs. 72%). However, among the subset of patients who received multimodality therapy, including NAC and surgery with curative intent, 5-year survival (67% vs. 72%) and 5-year recurrence-free survival (48% vs. 61%) did not significantly differ between countries. CONCLUSION Addressing health system, socioeconomic, and psychosocial barriers is necessary for administration of complete NAC to improve BCa outcomes in Nigeria. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This cross-sectional retrospective analysis of T4 breast cancer patients in Nigeria and the U.S. found a significant difference in pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5% Nigeria vs. 27% U.S.). Five-year survival was shorter in Nigeria, but in patients receiving multimodality treatment, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery with curative intent, 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival did not differ between countries. Capacity-building efforts in Nigeria should focus on access to pathology services to direct systemic therapy, and promoting receipt of complete chemotherapy to improve outcomes.","Romanoff, Anya; Olasehinde, Olalekan; Goldman, Debra A; Alatise, Olusegun I; Constable, Jeremy; Monu, Ngozi; Knapp, Gregory C; Odujoko, Oluwole; Onabanjo, Emmanuella; Adisa, Adewale O; Arowolo, Adeolu O; Omisore, Adeleye D; Famurewa, Olusola C; Anderson, Benjamin O; Gemignani, Mary L; Kingham, T Peter",The oncologist,https://doi.org/10.1002/onco.13814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955123/,187

Little attention has been given to the ability of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT to detect malignant bone lesions and whether this approach is superior to existing bone imaging modalities. AIM To review the existing data of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT for the diagnosis of bone metastases in prostate cancer. METHODS Systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. RESULTS Among 1858 papers in the original search, 37 papers were included in the analysis (six case reports and 31 case series). The vast majority of the studies were low-level evidence studies. Most studies presented data on detection rates without a reference standard. All but two studies were of a retrospective nature. Several cohort studies showed bone metastasis in 5-60% of patients with prostate cancer, including in patients with very low-PSA values. For primary staging, 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT outperformed bone scans, while the superiority of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT compared with bone scans with respect to biochemical recurrence and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains to be demonstrated. CONCLUSION 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT has shown to be a promising technique for use in prostate cancer. 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT shows more lesions than bone scans, but data on diagnostic performance are very limited and indicate improved diagnostic performance in primary staging but not in mCRPC.

In only four of these studies were costs reported by modified Rankin Scale categories. Most studies included direct medical costs only. Societal costs were assessed in two studies. Overall, studies had a high methodological and reporting quality. The heterogeneity in costing methods used in the identified studies prevented meaningful comparison of the reported cost data. Despite this limitation, the costs consistently increased with greater severity (increasing modified Rankin Scale score). Conclusions Few cost studies of stroke include information based on stroke recovery measured by individual modified Rankin Scale categories and the existing data are limited. To reliably capture this information, future studies are needed that preferably apply standardised costing methods to promote greater potential for use in cost-effectiveness analyses whereby direct collection of patient-level resource use has not been possible.","Wilson, Alastair; Bath, Philip Mw; Berge, Eivind; Cadilhac, Dominique A; Cuche, Matthieu; Ford, Gary A; Macisaac, Rachael; Quinn, Terence J; Taylor, Matthew; Walters, Matthew; Wolff, Claudia; Lees, Kennedy R",European stroke journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987316684705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29900405/,187

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of fingolimod 0.5 mg versus intramuscular interferon β-1a (30 μg) on ALC and its relationship with infections in paediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) up to 4 years. METHODS We assessed ALC at baseline, monthly till 3 months, and every 3 months (core phase) and with variable periodicity (extension phase) of Phase 3 PARADIGMS study (N = 215). Incidence rates (IRs) of infection-related adverse events (infAEs)/100 patient-years were analysed by on-study nadir ALC. RESULTS With fingolimod, ALC rapidly reduced to 29.9%-34.4% of baseline values within 2 weeks and remained stable thereafter; no relevant changes observed with interferon. IRs of infAEs were 67.6 with fingolimod and 61.8 with interferon; IR ratios with respect to interferon, overall: 1.09, by nadir ALC 0.2-0.4 × 109/L: 1.13 and >0.4 × 109/L: 0.91. Three patients had a single episode of ALC <0.2 × 109/L (core phase). No opportunistic infections were observed and infection risk did not increase during the extension phase. CONCLUSION In paediatric patients, the overall incidence of infections was comparable between fingolimod and interferon. No association was observed between nadir ALC and infections in POMS, although sample size may have been too small to rule an association.","Chitnis, Tanuja; Banwell, Brenda; Krupp, Lauren; Arnold, Douglas L; Bar-Or, Amit; Brück, Wolfgang; Giovannoni, Gavin; Greenberg, Benjamin; Ghezzi, Angelo; Waubant, Emmanuelle; Rostasy, Kevin; Deiva, Kumaran; Huppke, Peter; Wolinsky, Jerry S; Zhang, Ying; Azmon, Amin; K-Laflamme, Annik; Karan, Rajesh; Gärtner, Jutta",Multiple sclerosis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1352458520936934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633694/,187
160969,Role of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway in degradation of hepatitis C virus envelope proteins and production of virus particles.,2011,"BACKGROUND There are several types of coronaviruses that infect humans and cause disease. The latest is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is an emerging global threat with no current effective treatment. Normal intravenous immunoglobulin (N-IVIG) has been administered to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients to control severe inflammation and the cellular immune response. However, the neutralizing activity of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been fully evaluated. The aim of this study was to determine whether N-IVIG manufactured before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic contained IgG antibodies against the circulating human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that cross-react with the highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been reported in Japan. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The neutralizing and binding activities of N-IVIG against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV 229E, and HCoV OC43 were evaluated. Nine N-IVIG lots manufactured between 2000 and 2018, derived from donors in Japan, were tested. Binding activity was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS None of the N-IVIG lots tested displayed neutralizing or binding activity against SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, or SARS-CoV-2. However, they displayed substantial neutralizing and binding activity against HCoV OC43 and weak neutralizing and substantial binding activity against HCoV 229E. CONCLUSION N-IVIG derived from healthy donors in Japan before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic had no direct effect against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are warranted to determine the effects of N-IVIG manufactured after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic against SARS-CoV-2.","Kubota-Koketsu, Ritsuko; Terada, Yutaka; Yunoki, Mikihiro; Sasaki, Tadahiro; Nakayama, Emi E; Kamitani, Wataru; Shioda, Tatsuo",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33104267/,187

During COVID-19 lockdown, while presential learning stopped and E-learning started. The Ministry of Higher Education has begun E-learning in public and private universities. Therefore, Afghanistan’s universities used Cloud-based Apps in E-learning, but these Apps are not identifying and ranking in the E-learning of Afghanistan. This study aims to identify and rank the Cloud-based Apps in terms of usefulness and effectiveness in E-learning using state-of-the-art, and its usage in public universities of Afghanistan. To get an accurate answer to the defined questions, mixed research was used. Therefore, an online questionnaire was distributed randomly to six public universities in six different parts of Afghanistan. The respondents were divided into two categories (lecturers and students) and asked to respond to Cloud-based Apps usage and effectiveness in E-learning. The responses were analyzed using Chi-Square Tests. The result showed the most, low, and lowest useful Cloud-based Apps in E-learning.

181715,Principles of RNA recruitment to viral ribonucleoprotein condensates in a segmented dsRNA virus,2021-03-22,"Abstract Quality control is an essential process in manufacturing to make the product defect-free as well as to meet customer needs. The automation of this process is important to maintain high quality along with the high manufacturing throughput. With recent developments in deep learning and computer vision technologies, it has become possible to detect various features from the images with near-human accuracy. However, many of these approaches are data intensive. Training and deployment of such a system on manufacturing floors may become expensive and time-consuming. The need for large amounts of training data is one of the limitations of the applicability of these approaches in real-world manufacturing systems. In this work, we propose the application of a Siamese convolutional neural network to do one-shot recognition for such a task. Our results demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used in quality control of steel by identification of defects on the steel surface. This method can significantly reduce the requirements of training data and can also be run in real-time.","Deshpande, Aditya M.; Minai, Ali A.; Kumar, Manish",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315985; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315985,187
181932,"Fast Ion Beam Inactivation of Viruses, Where Radiation Track Structure Meets RNA Structural Biology",2020-09-21,"Big brown bats emit wideband frequency modulated (FM) ultrasonic pulses for echolocation. They perceive target range from echo delay and target size from echo amplitude. Their sounds contain two prominent down-sweeping harmonic sweeps (FM1, ∼55-22 kHz; FM2, ∼100-55 kHz), which are affected differently by propagation out to the target and back to the bat. FM2 is attenuated more than FM1 during propagation. Bats anchor target ranging asymmetrically on the low frequencies in FM1, while FM2 only contributes if FM1 is present as well. These experiments tested whether the bat’s ability to discriminate target size from the amplitude of echoes is affected by selectively attenuating upper or lower frequencies. Bats were trained to perform an echo amplitude discrimination task with virtual echo targets 83 cm away. While echo delay was held constant and echo amplitude was varied to estimate threshold, either lower FM1 frequencies or higher FM2 frequencies were attenuated. The results parallel effects seen in echo delay experiments; bats’ performance was significantly poorer when the lower frequencies in echoes were attenuated, compared to higher frequencies. The bat’s ability to distinguish between virtual targets at the same simulated range from echoes arriving at the same delay indicates a high level of focused attention for perceptual isolation of one and suppression of the other.","Tuninetti, Amaro; Simmons, Andrea Megela; Simmons, James A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.463049,187
182716,Structural and functional studies of retroviral RNA pseudoknots involved in ribosomal frameshifting: nucleotides at the junction of the two stems are important for efficient ribosomal frameshifting.,1995-02-15,"Abstract Surface finish is one of the most important quality characteristics of fabricated components. To complement that, laser polishing (LP) is one of the advanced manufacturing surface finishing techniques that has been recently developed and successfully employed for improving surface quality without deteriorating the overall structural form through surface smoothing by melting and redistributing a thin layer of molten material. This paper proposes a statistical digital twin of the LP process and demonstrates the applicability of amplitude distribution statistical characteristics in the experimental analysis of surface topography formation during LP process. Initially, the thermodynamic transformation of the initial surface topography is considered by means of technical cybernetics and machine learning approaches to describe two of the most critical LP process components, namely: thermodynamic melting and solidification of both solid material and surface topography. To exemplify the effective application of statistical amplitude distribution characteristics, LP experiments were conducted with two different laser powers (25 W and 100 W) on flat and ground initial surfaces and resulting surface topographies were measured. Several amplitude distribution characteristics, such as roughness average value, averaged transverse profile as a W-shape, averaged transverse roughness profile, and probability distribution function were calculated. After that, actual molten material area, volume redistribution and final surface quality were comparatively analyzed. It was shown that the proportion between two components of the LP thermodynamic transformation and surface topography is critically dependent on laser power. As such, during low-power conditions (< 25 W), surface quality is predominantly determined by the thermodynamic transformation of initial surface topography and therefore only this component can be used for statistically reliable LP process modelling and digital identification. In summary, amplitude distribution characteristics have several advantages in building a comprehensive understanding of the molten material redistributing along and across LP line.","Bordatchev, Evgueni V.; Cvijanovic, Srdjan J.; Tutunea-Fatan, Remus O.",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314840; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314840,187

In particular reference to new technological applications and sites that are increasingly used by people for networking and bonding, there is a macro-discourse of being and staying connected through technology. Such platforms assume an easy access or an imagined availability of the other person at all times. Such availability also assumes psychological availability of the person, despite any personal circumstances he/she may be in. Experiencing the compressed space and time has given birth to the debate of quality of life and relations surrounding it vs. the constant flux of technology that restricts the psychological freedom while facilitating a structural freedom to communicate. Technology is an artifact that not only symbolizes values of ease and convenience but also has the potential to affect the deeper assumptions and values people hold about life and relationships. Thus, it mediates our personal, social and organizational realities, pushing us to live in dual worlds.","Tripathi, Swati Bajpai Alka",Technology in Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101706,187

Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life.","Lee, Crystal; Yang, Tanya; Inchoco, Gabrielle; Jones, Graham M.; Satyanarayan, Arvind",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993v1.pdf,187

The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of the global economy. Although this impact is multifaceted, we assess the connections between the number of COVID-19 cases and the energy commodities sector. We analyse these connections by using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method. On this basis, we calculate the similarity measure—the DTW distance between the time series—and use it to group the energy commodities according to their price change. Our analysis also includes finding the time shifts between daily COVID-19 cases and commodity prices in subperiods according to the chronology of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings are that commodities such as ULSD, heating oil, crude oil, and gasoline are weakly associated with COVID-19.

183951,Transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection: a vanishing specter.,2006,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high fatality rates, especially for patients who suffer from underlying health issues. One of the more serious symptoms exhibited from patients suffering from an acute COVID-19 infection is breathing difficulties and shortness of breath, which is largely due to the excessive fluid (cellular leakage and cytokine storm) and mucoid debris that have filled lung alveoli, and reduced the surfactant tension resulting in heavy and stiff lungs. In this paper we propose the use of micro-bubbles filled with exosomes that can be released upon exposure to ultrasound signals as a possible rescue therapy in deteriorating COVID-19 patients. Recent studies have shown that exosomes can be used to repair and treat lung damage for patients who have suffered from the viral infection. We have conducted simulations to show the efficacy of the ultrasound signals that will penetrate through layers of tissues reaching the alveoli that contains the micro-bubbles. Our results have shown that ultrasound signals with low frequencies are required to oscillate and rupture the polymer-based micro-bubbles. Our proposed system can be used for patients who require immediate rescue treatments for lung damage, as well as for recovered patients who may suffer from viral relapse infection, where the micro-bubbles will remain dormant for a temporary therapeutic window until they are exposed to the ultrasound signals. © 2021 IEEE.","Fonseca, B.; Fonseca, C.; Barros, M.; White, M.; Abhyankar, V.; Borkholder, D.

The vaccine effect on infection, while important both as a proxy for transmission and to describe a vaccine's total effects, requires frequent longitudinal sampling to capture all infections. Such sampling may not always be feasible. A logistically easy approach is to collect a sample to test for infection at a regularly scheduled visit. Such point or cross-sectional sampling does not permit estimation of classic vaccine effciacy on infection, as long duration infections are sampled with higher probability. Building on work by Rinta et al 2009, we evaluate proxies of the vaccine effect on transmission at a point in time; the vaccine efficacy on prevalent infection and on prevalent viral load, VE$_{PI}$ and VE$_{PVL}$, respectively. Longer infections with higher viral loads should have more transmission potential and prevalent vaccine efficacy naturally captures this aspect. We apply a proportional hazards model for infection risk and show how these metrics can be estimated using longitudinal or cross-sectional sampling. We also introduce regression models for designs with multiple cross-sectional sampling. The methods are evaluated by simulation and a phase III vaccine trial with PCR cross-sectional sampling for subclinical infection is analyzed.","Follmann, D.; Fay, M.

Accurate prediction of likely efficacy in the clinic requires that these models are reliable and consistent. We assessed this by examining the reporting of experimental conditions and sensitivity to temozolomide in glioma cells lines. Methods: We searched Medline and Embase (Jan 1994-Jan 2021) for studies that evaluated the effect of temozolomide monotherapy on cell viability of at least one malignant glioma cell line. Studies using a drug-resistant cell line or a modified preparation of temozolomide were excluded. Key data items included type of cell lines, temozolomide exposure duration, and cell viability measure (IC50). Results: We included 212 eligible studies from 2,789 non-duplicate records that reported 248 distinct cell lines. The commonest cell line was U87 (60.4%). Only 10.4% studies used a patient-derived cell line. The proportion of studies not reporting each experimental condition ranged from 8.0-27.4%, including base medium (8.0%), serum supplementation (9.9%) and number of replicates (27.4%). In studies reporting IC50 the median value for U87 cell line at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours was 123.9M (IQR 75.3-277.7M), 223.1M (IQR 92.0-590.1M) and 230.0M (IQR 34.1-650.0M), respectively (Figure 2A). The median IC50 at 72 hours for patient-derived cell lines was 220M (IQR 81.1-800.0M). Conclusions: Temozolomide sensitivity reported in comparable studies was not consistent between and within individual malignant glioma cell lines. Drug discovery science performed on these models cannot reliably inform clinical translation.

Several papers have focused on the concerns, healthcare-related behaviors and psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with rheumatic diseases, and specifically on SLE patients, showing a trend towards remarkable psychological distress (2-4). To date, no investigation on the psychological effects of quarantine strategy on SLE patients has been carried out. Objectives: To investigate the psychological impact of the lockdown measures adopted in Italy to contrasting the COVID-19 outbreak, on patients with SLE as compared to the general population. Methods: Patients affected by SLE were given an online questionnaire focused on psychological impact and self-perception during the lockdown measures contrasting the COVID-19 outbreak. The survey was focused on COVID-19 concerns, emotional impact, self-perception and changes in daily living activities and relationships. Results were compared with those of PRESTO (imPact of quaRantine mEasures againST cOvid19) project, an Italian survey, which used the same questionnaire, directed to the general population, with or without chronic diseases.

The SLE subjects live mainly in detached houses (38/64 vs 348/1114, p<0.0001), having access to a private garden (52/64 vs 625/1112, p<0.0001) and also owning a pet (43/64 vs 508/1114, p<0.001), in comparison with the PRESTO sample living mainly in flats. The psychological impact measured by IES-R, GHQ.12, and CEDS scores were not statistically different between patients and the general population, such as globally COVID-19 concerns and feelings. However, patients perceived more difficulty to find some free time and enjoy it (13/60 vs 48/121, p=0.01) and to be able to solve own problems (47/61 vs 71/120, p=0.02). On the contrary, patients felt more able to cope with the problem and less sad or depressed in comparison with the PRESTO group (17/61 vs 13/120, p=0.003). Moreover, patients missed playing sports/exercise less than general population (12/63 vs 46/128, p=0.02), while they felt more the distance from family and relatives (45/63 vs 42/86, p<0.0001). Conclusion: the COVID-19 pandemic didn't unveil a greater psychological fragility of people living with SLE than the others. By contrast, a coping strategy, including the role of the family and the lifestyle, contributes to resilience of SLE in difficult scenarios such as those presented by the pandemic.","De Marchi, G.; Azzolina, D.; Maresio, E.; Colatutto, D.; Binutti, M.; Monte, M.; Gallipoli, S.; Zobec, F.; Palese, A.; Silano, M.; De Vita, S.; Gregori, D.; Quartuccio, L.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.1590,187

We find that there is a reduced home advantage in the first division, whereas no change is observed in the second and third divisions. Our regression analysis indicates that the decrease in the home advantage and the heterogeneity across divisions are not sensitive to a variety of performance, location, and team covariates and are best explained through the lower occupancy rate in the stadia. Hence, the decrease in occupancy to zero at the ghost games has been less dramatic for teams that have been used to low occupancy rates. We cannot find strong evidence for a change in referee behavior or teams? tactics as main impact channels of occupancy rates on the home advantage. Hence, we argue that psychological reasons are of higher importance.","Fischer, Kai Haucap Justus",Journal of Sports Economics,https://doi.org/10.1177/15270025211026552,187
184381,Enterotropic coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus) in mice: influence of host age and strain on infection and disease.,1993,"Stem cells (SCs) are traditionally viewed as rare, slow-cycling cells that follow deterministic rules dictating their self-renewal or differentiation. It was several decades ago, when limbal epithelial SCs (LSCs) that regenerate the corneal epithelium were one of the first sporadic, quiescent SCs ever discovered. However, LSC dynamics, heterogeneity and genetic signature are largely unknown. Moreover, recent accumulating evidence strongly suggested that epithelial SCs are actually abundant, frequently dividing cells that display stochastic behavior. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of the murine limbal epithelium by single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative lineage tracing. The generated data provided an atlas of cell states of the corneal epithelial lineage, and particularly, revealed the co-existence of two novel LSC populations that reside in separate and well-defined sub-compartments. In the “outer” limbus, we identified a primitive widespread population of quiescent LSCs (qLSCs) that uniformly express Krt15/Gpha2/Ifitm3/Cd63 proteins, while the “inner” limbus host prevalent active LSCs (aLSCs) co-expressing Krt15-GFP/Atf3/Mt1-2/Socs3. Analysis of LSC population dynamics suggests that while qLSCs and aLSCs possess different proliferation rates, they both follow similar stochastic rules that dictate their self-renewal and differentiation. Finally, T cells were distributed in close proximity to qLSCs. Indeed, their absence or inhibition resulted in the loss of quiescence and delayed wound healing. Taken together, we propose that divergent regenerative strategies are tailored to properly support tissue-specific physiological constraints. The present study suggests that in the case of the cornea, quiescent epithelial SCs are abundant, follow stochastic rules and neutral drift dynamics.","Altshuler, Anna; Amitai-Lange, Aya; Tarazi, Noam; Dey, Sunanda; Strinkovsky, Lior; Bhattacharya, Swarnabh; Hadad-Porat, Shira; Nasser, Waseem; Imeri, Jusuf; Ben-David, Gil; Tiosano, Beatrice; Berkowitz, Eran; Karin, Nathan; Savir, Yonatan; Shalom-Feuerstein, Ruby",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.179754,187

All elements of the social system have been forced to function in the stress regime in the absence of any basic patterns and tried-and-true methods to solve the arising problem. The overall uncertainty in the organization of the social life and the enforced and, at times, very contentious steps taken at various levels of management have caused polarization of opinions as to the functioning of all social institutions. Special pressure has been put on education, since it is this institution that is mainly responsible for the social system’s stability. In this regard, it has been important and significant to comprehensively study the problems and limitations associated with the functioning of the higher education system in Russia during the pandemic, as well as to analyze the change in tone and attitude both on the part of the public and the teaching corps, as a response to the transition to the new forms of work at higher education institutions. The article was prepared using the materials of two stages of the sociological research “The opinion of teachers of Russia’s higher education institutions on distance learning during the pandemic” conducted in May, June and December 2020. The volume of sample sets made up 3431 people at the first stage, and 6006, at the second. An analysis of research data covers the following areas: organizational problems of transition to distance learning;resources used, organization of lectures and seminars, assessment of the positive and negative aspects of distance learning;perspectives, limitations and trajectories for the implementation of distance learning in Russia’s higher education institutions, as well as a set of social problems aimed at studying social well-being and assessing possible changes in the life and career of teachers. The research data are compared with the data of similar works by Russian and foreign analysts. On the basis of the analysis done and the conclusions obtained, the authors propose practical steps to optimize the work of the higher education system in stressful situations, to use distance technologies in the learning organization. Also, possible forms are considered that combine distance and full-time education, and recommendations are proposed on how to change the tone in perceiving inevitable informational and communication transformations on the part of teachers.

When an increase/decrease was communicated, especially a large one, it was difficult to understand if it was due to a change in the epidemic evolution or if it was a fluctuation due to other reasons, such as an increase in the number of swabs or a delay in the swab processing. The aim of this paper is both to model the main trend of the outbreak evolution in the number of confirmed cases and to describe the daily fluctuations strongly dependent on the daily number of swabs. For our analysis, we propose a nonlinear asymmetric diffusion model, which includes information on the daily number of swabs, to describe daily fluctuations in the number of confirmed cases in addition to the main trend of the outbreak evolution. The proposed model is found to be the more efficient for prediction, as compared to 6 already existing models, including the SIRD and the logistic models.

Are there any genes that are pleiotropically or potentially causally associated with PCOS? Design: We applied the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) method integrating genome-wide association study (GWAS) for PCOS and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data to identify genes that were pleiotropically associated with PCOS. We performed separate SMR analysis using eQTL data in the ovary and whole blood. Results: Although no genes showed significant pleiotropic association with PCOS after correction for multiple testing, some of the genes exhibited suggestive significance. RPS26 showed the strongest suggestive pleiotropic association with PCOS in both SMR analyses ({beta}[SE]=0.10[0.03], PSMR=1.72*10-4 for ovary; {beta}[SE]=0.11[0.03], PSMR=1.40*10-4 for whole blood). PM20D1 showed the second strongest suggestive pleiotropic association with PCOS in the SMR analysis using eQTL data for the whole blood, and was also among the top ten hit genes in the SMR analysis using eQTL data for the ovary. Two other genes, including CTC-457L16.2 and NEIL2, were among the top ten hit genes in both SMR analyses. Conclusion: We identified multiple genes that were potentially involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Our findings provided helpful leads to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying PCOS, and revealed potential therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of PCOS.","Sun, Q.; Gao, Y.; Yang, J.; Lu, J.; Feng, W.; Yang, W.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.29.21259512v1?rss=1,187

Items queried demographic and health-related characteristics, experience with and knowledge of COVID-19, and determinants of decisions to vaccinate. COVID-19 vaccine acceptance groups (acceptors, hesitant, refusers) were defined; an adapted version of the WHO vaccine hesitancy scale was included. The survey demonstrated good reliability (Cronbachs alpha = 0.92 for vaccine hesitancy scale; 0.93 for determinants). General linear and logistic regression methods examined factors which were univariately associated with vaccine hesitancy and vaccine acceptance, respectively. Multivariable models were constructed with stepwise model-building procedures. Race/ethnicity, marital status, job classification, immunocompromised status, flu vaccination and childhood vaccination opinions independently predicted hesitancy scale scores. Gender, education, job classification and BMI independently predicted acceptance, hesitancy and refusal groups. Among hesitant employees, uncertainty was reflected in reports of motivating factors influencing their indecision. Despite a strong employee-support environment and job protection, respondents reported physical and mental health effects. Appreciation of varied reasons for refusing vaccination should lead to culturally sensitive interventions to increase vaccination rates in healthcare workers.","Gatto, N. M.; Lee, J.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) new variants of concern in the communities and investigate vaccine breakthrough cases on our laboratory (Ayass Bioscience LLC) confirmed detection of COVID-19 variants in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Texas. Methods: Epidemiologic study has been performed at our laboratory. We studied the viral whole-genome sequence and genotyping analysis on 166 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 which were randomly selected from nasal swab positive cases assessed from June 1st to August 30th, 2021, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (CT) values. COVID-19 variants were identified to be dominated by B.1.617.2 (89.2%) and followed by AY.3 (1.8%), B.1.1.7 (4.8%), a combination of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2 (3%), B.1.621 (0.6%), and P.2 (0.6%). Result: The CT values showed significant difference among the three age groups: <30 years, 31-60 years, and >60 years by one-way ANOVA (N1: F (2, 118) =4.96, p=0.009; N2: F (2, 118) =4.95, p=0.009). No significant difference was observed by symptom, status of immunization, or vaccine manufacturer. A two-way ANOVA was performed to examine the effect of gender and variant group (Delta and other variants) on the CT values. The analyses revealed a statistically significant interaction between the effect of gender and variant group (N1, F (1.117) = 3.906, p = 0.05; N2, F (1, 117) = 7.402, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Our study shows that Delta, the dominant variant of COVID-19, is spreading in the communities, and vaccine breakthrough cases occurred in the majority of Delta variant (91%) followed by AY.3 (5%), B.1.1.7 (2%) and 2% of the double variant of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2. The incidence of the breakthrough cases was not linked to a specific manufacturer. The CT value is likely to associate with age.

185487,Analysis of canine parvovirus sequences from wolves and dogs isolated in Italy.,2001,"OBJECTIVE: Dog vaccination is a cost-effective approach to preventing human rabies deaths. In Haiti, the 2019 dog vaccination campaign did not include the capital city, and the 2020 campaign was cancelled because of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions and redirection of funds. We estimated the number of human lives that could be saved by resuming dog vaccination in 2021 compared to 2022 and compared the cost-effectiveness of these two scenarios. METHODS: We modified a previously published rabies transmission and economic model to estimate trends in dog and human rabies cases in Haiti from 2005-2025. We compared model outputs to surveillance data on human rabies deaths from 2005-2020 and animal rabies cases from 2018-2020. We then estimated the human health and cost implications of restarting dog vaccination programs in either 2021 or 2022. FINDINGS: Model predictions and animal surveillance data from Haiti both suggest a 5- to 8-fold increase in animal rabies cases has occurred in the capital city between Fall 2019 and Fall 2020. We estimate that restarting dog vaccination in Haiti in 2021 compared to 2022 could save 285 human lives and prevent 6,541 human rabies exposures over a five-year period and may decrease program costs due to reduced need for human post-exposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: A one-year delay in resuming dog vaccination in Haiti, from 2021 to 2022, could cost hundreds of lives over the next 5 years. Interruptions in dog vaccination campaigns before elimination is achieved can lead to significant human rabies epidemics if not promptly resumed.","Kunkel, A.; Jeon, S.; Joseph, H.

Here, we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in ~200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles influence clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations. Identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increase fertility and extend reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicates that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases risks of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms governing ovarian ageing, when they act across the life-course, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.","Ruth, K.

Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most supported modality able to ameliorate USN but underapplied due to several issues. Using immersive virtual reality and depth-sensing camera, we developed the virtual prism adaptation therapy (VPAT) to overcome the limitations in conventional PA. In this study, we investigated whether VPAT can induce behavioral adaptations and which cortical area is most significantly activated. Fourteen healthy subjects participated in this study. The experiment consisted of four sequential phases (pre-VAPT, VPAT-10°, VPAT-20°, and post-VPAT) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy recordings. Each phase consisted of alternating target pointing and resting (or clicking) blocks. To find out the most significantly activated area during pointing in different phases (VPAT-10°, VPAT-20°, and Post-VPAT) in contrast to pointing during the pre-VPAT phase, we analyzed changes in oxyhemoglobin concentration during pointing. The pointing errors of the virtual hand deviated to the right-side during early pointing blocks in the VPAT-10° and VPAT-20° phases. There was a left-side deviation of the real hand to the target in the post-VPAT phase. The most significantly activated channels were all located in the right hemisphere, and possible corresponding cortical areas included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal eye field. In conclusion, VPAT may induce behavioral adaptation with modulation of the dorsal attentional network. Future clinical trials using multiple sessions of a high degree of rightward deviation VPAT over a more extended period are required in stroke patients with unilateral spatial neglect.","Cho, Sungmin; Kim, Won-Seok; Park, Jihong; Lee, Seung Hyun; Lee, Jongseung; Han, Cheol E.; Paik, Nam-Jong",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.438873,187

187170,"RNA-protein interactions: involvement of NS3, NS5, and 3' noncoding regions of Japanese encephalitis virus genomic RNA.",1997,"Thorp and Gallagher first reported that depletion of cholesterol inhibited virus entry and cell-cell fusion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), suggesting the importance of lipid rafts in MHV replication (E. B. Thorp and T. M. Gallagher, J. Virol. 78:2682-2692, 2004). However, the MHV receptor is not present in lipid rafts, and anchoring of the MHV receptor to lipid rafts did not enhance MHV infection; thus, the mechanism of lipid rafts involvement is not clear. In this study, we defined the mechanism and extent of lipid raft involvement in MHV replication. We showed that cholesterol depletion by methyl beta-cyclodextrin or filipin did not affect virus binding but reduced virus entry. Furthermore, MHV spike protein bound to nonraftraft membrane at 4 degrees C but shifted to lipid rafts at 37 degrees C, indicating a redistribution of membrane following virus binding. Thus, the lipid raft involvement in MHV entry occurs at a step following virus binding. We also found that the viral spike protein in the plasma membrane of the infected cells was associated with lipid rafts, whereas that in the Golgi membrane, where MHV matures, was not. Moreover, the buoyant density of the virion was not changed when MHV was produced from the cholesterol-depleted cells, suggesting that MHV does not incorporate lipid rafts into the virion. These results indicate that MHV release does not involve lipid rafts. However, MHV spike protein has an inherent ability to associate with lipid rafts. Correspondingly, cell-cell fusion induced by MHV was retarded by cholesterol depletion, consistent with the association of the spike protein with lipid rafts in the plasma membrane. These findings suggest that MHV entry requires specific interactions between the spike protein and lipid rafts, probably during the virus internalization step.","Choi, Keum S; Aizaki, Hideki; Lai, Michael M C",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16014947/,187
187239,The mutation rate and variability of eukaryotic viruses: an analytical review.,1987,"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, has been shown to undergo a high frequency of RNA recombination both in tissue culture and in animal infection. So far, RNA recombination has been demonstrated only between genomic RNAs of two coinfecting viruses. To understand the mechanism of RNA recombination and to further explore the potential of RNA recombination, we studied whether recombination could occur between a replicating MHV RNA and transfected RNA fragments. We first used RNA fragments which represented the 5' end of genomic-sense sequences of MHV RNA for transfection. By using polymerase chain reaction amplification with two specific primers, we were able to detect recombinant RNAs which incorporated the transfected fragment into the 5' end of the viral RNA in the infected cells. Surprisingly, even the anti-genomic-sense RNA fragments complementary to the 5' end of MHV genomic RNA could also recombine with the MHV genomic RNAs. This observation suggests that RNA recombination can occur during both positive- and negative-strand RNA synthesis. Furthermore, the recombinant RNAs could be detected in the virion released from the infected cells even after several passages of virus in tissue culture cells, indicating that these recombinant RNAs represented functional virion RNAs. The crossover sites of these recombinants were detected throughout the transfected RNA fragments. However, when an RNA fragment with a nine-nucleotide (CUUUAUAAA) deletion immediately downstream of a pentanucleotide (UCUAA) repeat sequence in the leader RNA was transfected into MHV-infected cells, most of the recombinants between this RNA and the MHV genome contained crossover sites near this pentanucleotide repeat sequence. In contrast, when exogenous RNAs with the intact nine-nucleotide sequence were used in similar experiments, the crossover sites of recombinants in viral genomic RNA could be detected at more-downstream sites. This study demonstrated that recombination can occur between replicating MHV RNAs and RNA fragments which do not replicate, suggesting the potential of RNA recombination for genetic engineering.","Liao, C L; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1326662/,187

This disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant mortality especially among the older age population and those with health co-morbidities. In contrast, children are relatively spared of this potentially ravaging disease that culminates in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and death. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces exuberant release of pro-inflammatory mediators, causing a ""cytokine storm"" and hypercoagulable states that underlie these complications. The SARS-CoV-2 infection median incubation is 5.1 days, with most developing symptoms by 11.5 days. It is highly infectious, spreading via the horizontal mode of transmission, but there is yet very limited evidence of vertical transmission to the newborn infant occurring either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. This said, various immune factors during childhood may modulate the expression of COVID-19, with the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) at the severe end of the disease spectrum.

To develop serological assays for bovine noroviruses (BoNVs) and to determine the cross-reactivity of BoNV with human noroviruses, we generated two recombinant baculoviruses, rCV186-OH and rJNCV, to express the capsid genes of Bo/CV186-OH/00/US (Norovirus genogroup III [GIII], genotype 2 [GIII/2]). rCV186-OH expressed the expected 57-kDa capsid protein, but rJNCV expressed a truncated capsid protein of 35 kDa. Sequence analysis of rJNCV identified a single nucleotide deletion in the P domain of the capsid gene, which introduced a stop codon at amino acid 323. The recombinant capsid protein produced by rCV186-OH but not that produced by rJNCV self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) similar to native BoNV. An antibody-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and antigen-capture ELISA (Ag-ELISA) detected serum antibody and antigen, respectively, from calves infected with Bo/CV186-OH/00/US but not antibodies or antigens to other enteric viruses. In other tests of the GIII/2 BoNV Ag-ELISA, no cross-reactivity was observed with VLPs from one GI and four GII human noroviruses and porcine sapovirus Cowden strain. Because, like human noroviruses, BoNVs do not grow in cell culture, the BoNV VLPs will be useful in the serological assays described for the detection of BoNV antibody and antigen. Consistent with the phylogenetic analysis of the capsid genes of bovine and human noroviruses (M. G. Han, J. R. Smiley, C. Thomas, and L. J. Saif, J. Clin. Microbiol. 42:5214-5224, 2004), the results suggest that GIII/2 BoNV does not share significant antigenic relationships with the five characterized human noroviruses tested.","Han, M G; Wang, Q; Smiley, J R; Chang, K O; Saif, L J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15695679/,187

Obviously, pregnant and lactating women will also be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Pregnant women, however, are a risk population for developing severe respiratory infections. Currently, the knowledge on potential risks and consequences of COVID-19 during pregnancy and lactation is limited. Available data show that pregnant women suffer from similar symptoms compared to non-pregnant patients. There is no evidence as yet that COVID-19 has a more serious course during pregnancy. Although pregnant women might suffer from a wide variety of symptoms, most of them are asymptomatic. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection might lead to adverse neonatal outcomes, such as prematurity or respiratory symptoms. There is currently no conclusive evidence of absence of intrauterine transmission of the virus; the virus has not been detected in breastmilk in most studies, although passage into breastmilk cannot be completely excluded.","Ceulemans, M; Cuppers, B; de Vries, L; Allegaert, K; Duvekot, J J; van Puijenbroek, E P",Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560604/,187

METHODS According to the epidemic strength of SARS, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, Hangzhou were selected to be the research areas, and convenience sampling was used to identify 200 city residents, 200 country residents and 400 occupational populations from each area. The uniform and self-made questionnaire was carried out by about 2400 residents. RESULTS All 2424 subjects completed the questionnaire. The correlation coefficient of scores of health related behavior during and after SARS was 0.782 (P < 0.01). And 39.3% subjects were considered as under the health risked stress by CPSS. Multiple linear regression indicated that the scores of health related behavior were significantly related to the perceived stress, demographic characteristics and recognition of SARS. CONCLUSIONS The public health related behavior should be developing in the SARS, and part of health related behavior had been kept after SARS and part been decreased. Behavior change should depends on the prevalence of the disease, cultural heritage and behavior variability. More attention should be paid to induce the public psychology and behavior and enhance the degree of recognition on related knowledge through health education as to relieving the stress in populations when we conduct to cope with the emergent public health hazards.","Tian, Ben-chun; Yang, Ting-zhong; Lü, Shu-hong; Chen, Ding-wan",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959042/,187

A prime candidate is ORF6, which encodes a 63-amino-acid membrane-associated peptide that can dramatically increase the lethality of an otherwise attenuated JHM strain of murine coronavirus (L. Pewe, H. Zhou, J. Netland, C. Tangudu, H. Olivares, L. Shi, D. Look, T. Gallagher, and S. Perlman, J. Virol. 79:11335-11342, 2005). To discern virulence mechanisms, we compared the in vitro growth properties of rJ.6, a recombinant JHM expressing the SARS peptide, with isogenic rJ.6-KO, which has an inactive ORF containing a mutated initiation codon and a termination codon at internal position 27. The rJ.6 infections proceeded rapidly, secreting progeny about 1.5 h earlier than rJ.6-KO infections did. The rJ.6 infections were also set apart by early viral protein accumulation and by robust expansion via syncytia, a characteristic feature of JHM virus dissemination. We found no evidence for protein 6 operating at the virus entry or assembly stage, as virions from either infection were indistinguishable. Rather, protein 6 appeared to operate by fostering viral RNA and protein synthesis, as RNA quantifications by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR revealed viral RNA levels in the rJ.6 cultures that were five to eight times higher than those lacking protein 6. Furthermore, protein 6 coimmunoprecipitated with viral RNAs and colocalized on cytoplasmic vesicles with replicating viral RNAs. The SARS coronavirus encodes a novel membrane protein 6 that can accelerate replication of a related mouse virus, a property that may explain its ability to increase in vivo virus virulence.","Tangudu, Chandra; Olivares, Heidi; Netland, Jason; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Thomas",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17108045/,187

In addition, the results were compared with Escherichia coli, yeast and human’s codon usage frequency. The results showed that GC3 content is significantly lower than GC1 and GC2content,and less than 50%.It indicates that the third position of codons prefers to A or T.ENC value is 50.59,which implies codon usage bias is a little slight in MERS-Co V genome. According to the neutral drawing analysis and ENC-plot analysis, codon bias is mainly affected by selection pressure in the MERS-Co V genome. It is found that codon usage frequency of MERS-Co V is more close to yeast, compared with other three kinds of biological codon usage frequency.Finally,19 codons are defined as the major preference codons in MERS-Co V.

Both are synthesized as one precursor protein and stay noncovalently attached after cleavage. In this study, we determined the oligomeric state of the LCMV GP and expressed it in two different conformations suitable for structural analysis. Sequence analysis of GP-2 identified a trimeric heptad repeat pattern containing an N-terminal alpha-helix. An alpha-helical peptide matching this region formed a stable oligomer as revealed by gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering. In contrast, a second alpha-helical peptide corresponding to a predicted C-terminal alpha-helix within GP-2 did not oligomerize. Refolding of the complete GP-2 ectodomain revealed trimeric all-alpha complexes probably representing the six-helix bundle state that is considered a hallmark of class I viral fusion proteins. Based on these results, we generated a construct consisting of the complete uncleavable LCMV GP ectodomain fused C-terminally to the trimeric motif of fibritin. Gel filtration analysis of the secreted fusion protein identified two complexes of approximately 230 and approximately 440 kDa. Both complexes bound to a set of conformational and linear antibodies. Cross-linking confirmed the 230-kDa complex to be a trimer. The 440-kDa complexes were found to represent disulfide-linked pairs of trimers, since partial reduction converted them to a complex species migrating at 250 kDa. By electron microscopy, the 230-kDa complexes appeared as single spherical particles and showed no signs of rosette formation. Our results clearly demonstrate that the arenavirus GP is a trimer and must be considered a member of the class I viral fusion protein family.","Eschli, Bruno; Quirin, Katharina; Wepf, Alexander; Weber, Jacqueline; Zinkernagel, Rolf; Hengartner, Hans",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16731928/,187

The nonstructural protein encoded in the N-terminal region of the first open reading frame (ORF1) of the Norwalk virus genome is analogous in gene order to proteins 2A and 2B of the picornaviruses; the latter is known for its membrane-associated activities. Confocal microscopy imaging of cells transfected with a vector plasmid that provided expression of the entire Norwalk virus N-terminal protein (amino acids 1 to 398 of the ORF1 polyprotein) showed colocalization of this protein with cellular proteins of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, this colocalization was characteristically associated with a visible disassembly of the Golgi complex into discrete aggregates. Deletion of a predicted hydrophobic region (amino acids 360 to 379) in a potential 2B-like (2BL) region (amino acids 301 to 398) near the C terminus of the Norwalk virus N-terminal protein reduced Golgi colocalization and disassembly. Confocal imaging was conducted to examine the expression characteristics of fusion proteins in which the 2BL region from the N-terminal protein of Norwalk virus (a genogroup I norovirus) or MD145 (a genogroup II norovirus) was fused to the C terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Expression of each fusion protein in cells showed evidence for its colocalization with the Golgi apparatus. These data indicate that the N-terminal protein of Norwalk virus interacts with the Golgi apparatus and may play a 2BL role in the induction of intracellular membrane rearrangements associated with positive-strand RNA virus replication in cells.","Fernandez-Vega, Virneliz; Sosnovtsev, Stanislav V; Belliot, Gaël; King, Adriene D; Mitra, Tanaji; Gorbalenya, Alexander; Green, Kim Y",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15078964/,187

As female patients usually experience longer delays before diagnosis and treatment, we assessed whether women were more affected by the dramatic drop in hospital admissions for ACS during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical and angiographic characteristics of consecutive patients who were admitted for ACS at 15 hospitals in Northern Italy comparing men and women data. The study period was defined as the time between the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Italy (February 20, 2020) and March 31, 2020. We compared hospitalization rates between the study period and two control periods: the corresponding period during the previous year (February 20 to March 31, 2019) and the earlier period during the same year (January 1 to February 19, 2020). Incidence rate ratios comparing the study period with each of the control periods were calculated with the use of Poisson regression. RESULTS Of the 547 patients who were hospitalized for ACS during the study period, only 127 (23%) were females, accounting for a mean of 3.1 admissions per day, while ACS hospitalized males were 420, with a mean of 10.2 admissions per day. There was a significant decrease driven by a similar reduction in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) diagnosis in both sexes compared to the control periods. A trend toward a greater reduction in admitted females was shown in the intra-year control period (46% admission reduction in females vs 37% in males, with females accounting for 26% of ACS, P=0.10) and a significant reduction when compared to the previous year control period (40% admission reduction in females vs 23% in males, with females accounting for 28% of ACS, P=0.03), mainly related to Unstable Angina diagnosis. CONCLUSION The Covid-19 pandemic period closed the gap between men and women in ACS, with similar rates of reduction of hospitalized STEMI and NSTEMI and a trend toward greater reduction in UA admission among women. Furthermore, many typical differences between males and females regarding ischemic heart disease presentations and vessel distribution were leveled.","Barbero, Umberto; Moncalvo, Cinzia; Trabattoni, Daniela; Pavani, Marco; Amoroso, Gisella Rita; Bocchino, Pier Paolo; Truffa Giachet, Alessandra; Saglietto, Andrea; Monticone, Silvia; Secco, Gioel Gabrio; Campo, Gianluca; Verardi, Roberto; Iannaccone, Mario; Galvani, Marcello; Ugo, Fabrizio; Infantino, Vincenzo; Olivotti, Luca; Mennuni, Marco; Vercellino, Matteo; Gili, Sebastiano; Zucchetti, Ottavio; Casella, Gianni; Giammaria, Massimo; De Benedictis, Michele; Tolomeo, Paolo; Doronzo, Baldassarre; Grosso Marra, Walter; Rognoni, Andrea; Montefusco, Antonio; Patti, Giuseppe; Mancone, Massimo; De Ferrari, Gaetano Maria; D'Ascenzo, Fabrizio",American journal of cardiovascular disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224602/,187

We report this novel method that allowed for repeated angiography within minutes with a low risk of complications due to catheter placement from the STA. The STA was secured at the edge of the standard skin incision during cerebral aneurysm surgery. A 3 Fr catheter was inserted approximately 5 cm to 10 cm into the STA. After manual injection of 5 ml of 20 times diluted 10% fluorescein sodium (fluorescein), fluorescein reached the intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) through the common carotid artery or anastomoses between the ECA and ICA. Fluorescence emission from the cerebral arteries, capillaries, and veins was clearly observed through the microscope and results were recorded. Quick dye clearance makes it possible to reexamine within 1 minute. In addition, we made a graph of the fluorescence emission intensity in the arteries, capillaries, and veins using fluorescence analysis software. With intravenous fluorescence angiography, dye remains in the vessels for a long time. When repeated examinations are necessary, intervals of approximately 10 minutes are required. There were some cases we could not correctly evaluate with intravenous injection due to weak fluorescence emission. Fluorescence angiography with intra-arterial injection from a catheter inserted into the carotid artery or another major vessel, like conventional angiography, has a risk of procedure-related complications.

The presence and transmission of PRRSV by boar semen has been demonstrated by using a swine bioassay. In this assay, 4- to 8-week-old pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with semen from PRRSV-infected boars. Seroconversion of these piglets indicated the presence of PRRSV in semen. Seroconversion in gilts has also been demonstrated following artificial insemination with semen from PRRSV-infected boars. These methods of detecting PRRSV in boar semen are time-consuming, laborious, and expensive. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable and sensitive PCR assay to directly detect PRRSV in boar semen. Primers from open reading frames 1b and 7 of the PRRSV genome were used in nested PCRs. Virus was detected at concentrations as low as 10 infectious virions per ml in PRRSV-spiked semen. Specificity was confirmed by using a nested PCR and a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. The primers did not react with related arteriviruses or other swine viruses. The PCR assay showed good correlation with the swine bioassay, and both methods were superior to virus isolation. To consistently identify PRRSV in boar semen, the cell fraction was separated by centrifugation at 600 x g for 20 min, a lysis buffer without a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol) was used, and nondiluted and 1:20-diluted cell fractions were evaluated by PCR.

190029,Swollen-head syndrome in broiler chickens.,1984,"AIM The study aimed to assess the efficacy of using WhatsApp instant messages in enhancing the oral hygiene in patients with gingivitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three systemically healthy male dental patients with gingivitis were recruited consecutively and randomly divided into two groups: WhatsApp group (n = 24) and a control group (n = 19). At baseline visit, the participants were educated and motivated about oral health and given a folio on instructions about the oral hygiene preventive measures. The participants in the study group further received WhatsApp messages about the dental care at weekly intervals throughout the study (3 months). Plaque index (PI) and gingival index (GI) were measured at baseline and after 1 and 3 months. RESULTS The averages of PI and GI were not significantly different between both groups at any time point of measurement (baseline, after one, and three months; p value >0.05). Intragroup comparisons revealed that the reductions in PI were highly significant after 1 and 3 months (-0.26 ± 0.26 and -0.57 ± 0.35, respectively, for WhatsApp group, and -0.24 ± 0.27 and -0.64 ± 0.4. respectively, for the control group; p value range: 0.001 to <0.001).

CONCLUSION Implementing WhatsApp instant messages does not appear to add extrabenefit to the traditional motivation and education on oral hygiene practices in terms of changes in PI and GI over time in patients with gingivitis.

190544,Two distinct size classes of immature and mature subviral particles from tick-borne encephalitis virus.,2003,"The folding and oligomerization of coronavirus spike protein were explored using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Chemical cross-linking and sedimentation experiments showed that the spike of transmissible gastroenteritis virus is a homotrimer of the S membrane glycoprotein. The spike protein was synthesized as a 175,000-apparent-molecular-weight (175K) monomer subunit that is sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. Assembly of monomers into a trimeric structure was found to occur on a partially trimmed polypeptide and to be a rate-limiting step, since large amounts of monomers failed to trimerize 1 h after completion of synthesis. Terminal glycosylation of newly assembled trimers, resulting in the biosynthesis of three 220K oligomers, occurred with a half time of approximately 20 min. Monomeric (230K to 240K) processed forms were also observed in cells and in virions. The 175K monomeric form expressed four major antigenic sites previously localized within the amino-terminal half of the S polypeptide chain; however, two classes of trimer-restricted epitopes (borne by three 220K and/or three 175K oligomers) were identified. The S glycoprotein of coronavirus might be a valuable model system for discovering new aspects of the maturation of membrane glycoproteins.","Delmas, B; Laude, H",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2170676/,187

190755,A new strategy in design of +RNA virus infectious clones enabling their stable propagation in E. coli.,2001,"BACKGROUND The interactive roles of cytokines, endotoxins, superoxide (O(2)(*-) ) and nitric oxide (NO) in the pathogenesis of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have not been fully elucidated. The effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the role of NO and the endothelium in mediating O(2)(*-) formation were therefore investigated in intact porcine pulmonary arteries in vitro. METHODS Intrapulmonary artery (PA) segments were obtained from White Landrace pigs (25-35 kg) and incubated with LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha and O(2)(*-) release was measured by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. The source of O(2)(*-) formation was determined using a number of enzyme inhibitors. The role of NO was explored using NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and the distribution of NOS isoforms and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-), an index of NO-O(2)(*-) interactions) assessed by immunocytochemistry. RESULTS LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha promoted the formation of O(2)(*-) from PA compared with untreated controls in a time and dose dependent manner, an effect markedly enhanced by removal of the endothelium but completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI). L-NAME and the eNOS inhibitor N(5)-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO) enhanced O(2)(*-) formation from PA (with endothelium) in response to IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha but had no effect on LPS mediated O(2)(*-) formation, whereas L-NAME and the iNOS inhibitor L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl)-lysine-HCl (L-NIL) enhanced O(2)(*-) formation only in response to LPS. CONCLUSIONS LPS, IL-1alpha, and TNF-alpha promote O(2)(*-) formation through an upregulation of NADPH oxidase activity which is augmented by removal of the endothelium, as well as the inhibition of eNOS (in the case of cytokines) and iNOS (in the case of LPS). The concomitant expression of NOS isoforms (and NO formation) with that of NADPH oxidase may therefore constitute a protective system designed to remove O(2)(*-) through the formation of ONOO(-). If this is so, the integrity of the endothelium may be axiomatic in the progression and severity of ARDS.","Muzaffar, S; Jeremy, J Y; Angelini, G D; Stuart-Smith, K; Shukla, N",Thorax,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12832676/,187

The NCDCV inocula were prepared in serum-free, trypsin-free regular medium (RM), and in serum-free medium containing 1 microgram (TM1), 5 microgram (TM5), and 10 microgram (TM10) of trypsin/ml; the the cells were maintained under identical media. Cytopathic effect (CPE), hemadsorption of rat RBC, formation of syncytia, appearance of immunofluorescing cells, and release of infectious virus was followed from postinoculation hours 4 to 100. Maintaining the BEL cells in medium containing trypsin up to 10 microgram/ml did not affect them adversely. The BEL cells appeared resistant to infection with NCDCV in RM by CPE, syncytia, immunofluorescing cells, or infectious virus-release parameters. In TM1, TM5, and TM10, all parameters were positive for NCDCV replication. They manifested and developed in positive correlation with increasing trypsin concentration from 1 microgram to 10 microgram/ml. Release of infectious virions preceded all other parameters of virus replication. Replication of NCDCV was demonstrated earlier by hemadsorption and immunofluorescing cells than by syncytia or CPE. The TM5 and TM10 increased the susceptibility of BEL cells to NCDCV by more than a millionfold, as measured by the titer of released virus in these media (greater than 1-(6) TCID50/ml) as compared with those in RM (infectious virus not demonstrated).","Toth, T E",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7103187/,187

A 10 microliter amount of the test virus, suspended in either faeces or mucin, was placed onto each stainless steel disk (about 1 cm in diameter) and the inoculum allowed to dry for 1 h under ambient conditions. Sixteen disinfectant formulations were selected for this study based on the findings of an earlier investigation with a human rotavirus. After 1 min exposure to 20 microliters of the disinfectant, the virus from the disks was immediately eluted into tryptose phosphate broth and plaque assayed. Using an efficacy criterion of a 3 log10 or greater reduction in virus infectivity titre and irrespective of the virus suspending medium, only the following five disinfectants proved to be effective against all the four viruses tested: (1) 2% glutaraldehyde normally used as an instrument soak, (2) a strongly alkaline mixture of 0.5% sodium o-benzyl-p-chlorophenate and 0.6% sodium lauryl sulphate, generally used as a domestic disinfectant cleaner for hard surfaces, (3) a 0.04% solution of a quaternary ammonium compound containing 7% hydrochloric acid, which is the basis of many toilet bowl cleaners, (4) chloramine T at a minimum free chlorine level of 3000 p.p.m. and (5) sodium hypochlorite at a minimum free chlorine concentration of 5000 p.p.m. Of those chemicals suitable for use as topical antiseptics, 70% ethanol alone or products containing at least 70% ethanol were ineffective only against coxsackievirus B3.

190885,Functional differences in the peplomer glycoproteins of feline coronavirus isolates.,1987,"OBJECTIVE Stressful situations may have a negative effect on population's mental health, including impaired sleep quality. Thus, we analysed the effect on sleep during the confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in a Galicia population sample, measuring subjective sleep satisfaction, and insomnia intensity and incidence. METHODS Through an adapted questionnaire from the Cuestionario Oviedo de Sueño, distributed telematically and printed, using a convenience sampling in Galicia, we compared sleep situation, before and during the first two weeks of confinement for COVID-19. We compared the results of the questionnaire before and during confinement with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test. RESULTS In 451 analysed subjects, there was about half point decrease in sleep satisfaction (in a 1 to 7 scale), three points increase in insomnia score (9 to 45 scale) and an increase from 23.1 to 36.3% in the insomnia incidence (p<0.001 for all the comparisons). There existed less affectation in the insomnia incidence in elderly above 65 years (from 21.7 to 26.1%, p=1) and in subjects that telecommuted (unchanged 28.1% incidence, p=1). In a post-hoc analysis of a health workers subgroup, sleep affectation was similar to that of others workers. CONCLUSIONS Confinement situation in COVID-19 outbreak context in our environment has caused important alterations in the population's sleep quality, increasing the symptoms and incidence of insomnia.","Diz-Ferreira, Eva; Díaz-Vidal, Pablo; Da Cunha Soares Nicolau, María Leonor; Criado-Santos, María Presentación; Ayán, Carlos; Diz, José Carlos",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424020/,187
190980,Antigenic and genomic relationships among turkey and bovine enteric coronaviruses.,1990,"The genomic RNA of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus contains an efficient ribosomal frameshift signal which comprises a heptanucleotide slippery sequence followed by an RNA pseudoknot structure. The presence of the pseudoknot is essential for high-efficiency frameshifting, and it has been suggested that its function may be to slow or stall the ribosome in the vicinity of the slippery sequence. To test this possibility, we have studied translational elongation in vitro on mRNAs engineered to contain a well-defined pseudoknot-forming sequence. Insertion of the pseudoknot at a specific location within the influenza virus PB1 mRNA resulted in the production of a new translational intermediate corresponding to the size expected for ribosomal arrest at the pseudoknot. The appearance of this protein was transient, indicating that it was a true paused intermediate rather than a dead-end product, and mutational analysis confirmed that its appearance was dependent on the presence of a pseudoknot structure within the mRNA. These observations raise the possibility that a pause is required for the frameshift process. The extent of pausing at the pseudoknot was compared with that observed at a sequence designed to form a simple stem-loop structure with the same base pairs as the pseudoknot. This structure proved to be a less effective barrier to the elongating ribosome than the pseudoknot and in addition was unable to direct efficient ribosomal frameshifting, as would be expected if pausing plays an important role in frameshifting. However, the stem-loop was still able to induce significant pausing, and so this effect alone may be insufficient to account for the contribution of the pseudoknot to frameshifting.","Somogyi, P; Jenner, A J; Brierley, I; Inglis, S C",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8413285/,187
191011,2-Mercaptoethanol influences the in vitro function of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,1992,"BACKGROUND There is uncertainty about the mode of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. We analyzed the temporal and spatial distributions of cases in a large community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and examined the correlation of these data with the three-dimensional spread of a virus-laden aerosol plume that was modeled using studies of airflow dynamics. METHODS We determined the distribution of the initial 187 cases of SARS in the Amoy Gardens housing complex in 2003 according to the date of onset and location of residence. We then studied the association between the location (building, floor, and direction the apartment unit faced) and the probability of infection using logistic regression. The spread of the airborne, virus-laden aerosols generated by the index patient was modeled with the use of airflow-dynamics studies, including studies performed with the use of computational fluid-dynamics and multizone modeling. RESULTS The curves of the epidemic suggested a common source of the outbreak. All but 5 patients lived in seven buildings (A to G), and the index patient and more than half the other patients with SARS (99 patients) lived in building E. Residents of the floors at the middle and upper levels in building E were at a significantly higher risk than residents on lower floors; this finding is consistent with a rising plume of contaminated warm air in the air shaft generated from a middle-level apartment unit. The risks for the different units matched the virus concentrations predicted with the use of multizone modeling. The distribution of risk in buildings B, C, and D corresponded well with the three-dimensional spread of virus-laden aerosols predicted with the use of computational fluid-dynamics modeling. CONCLUSIONS Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain this large community outbreak of SARS, and future efforts at prevention and control must take into consideration the potential for airborne spread of this virus.","Yu, Ignatius T S; Li, Yuguo; Wong, Tze Wai; Tam, Wilson; Chan, Andy T; Lee, Joseph H W; Leung, Dennis Y C; Ho, Tommy",The New England journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15102999/,187
191031,Expression of the Hantaan virus M genome segment by using a vaccinia virus recombinant.,1988,"The feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) targets activated CD4-positive helper T cells preferentially, inducing an AIDS-like immunodeficiency in its natural host species, the domestic cat. The primary receptor for FIV is CD134, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, and all primary viral strains tested to date use CD134 for infection. We examined the expression of CD134 in the cat using a novel anti-feline CD134 monoclonal antibody (MAb), 7D6, and showed that as in rats and humans, CD134 expression is restricted tightly to CD4+, and not CD8+, T cells, consistent with the selective targeting of these cells by FIV. However, FIV is also macrophage tropic, and in chronic infection the viral tropism broadens to include B cells and CD8+ T cells. Using 7D6, we revealed CD134 expression on a B220-positive (B-cell) population and on cultured macrophages but not peripheral blood monocytes. Moreover, macrophage CD134 expression and FIV infection were enhanced by activation in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Consistent with CD134 expression on human and murine T cells, feline CD134 was abundant on mitogen-stimulated CD4+ T cells, with weaker expression on CD8+ T cells, concordant with the expansion of FIV into CD8+ T cells with progression of the infection. The interaction between FIV and CD134 was probed using MAb 7D6 and soluble CD134 ligand (CD134L), revealing strain-specific differences in sensitivity to both 7D6 and CD134L. Infection with isolates such as PPR and B2542 was inhibited well by both 7D6 and CD134L, suggesting a lower affinity of interaction. In contrast, GL8, CPG, and NCSU were relatively refractory to inhibition by both 7D6 and CD134L and, accordingly, may have a higher-affinity interaction with CD134, permitting infection of cells where CD134 levels are limiting.","Willett, Brian J; McMonagle, Elizabeth L; Logan, Nicola; Spiller, O Brad; Schneider, Pascal; Hosie, Margaret J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17609274/,187

METHODS Standardized questionnaires on case management were sent to local health departments of 15 of 16 states in Germany. RESULTS Of the 384 local health departments who received the questionnaire, 280 (72%) completed them. They reported 271 suspect or probable severe acute respiratory syndrome cases under investigation (average 4.7). The average duration of quarantine was 5.4 days. Contacts without professional activity were 2.78 times more likely to stay under 10-day quarantine than those with professional activity (CI: 0.80-9.86). Local health departments with at least one case under investigation had invested an average of 104.5 working hours. CONCLUSIONS Our contact-case ratios may serve for planning for modeling in epidemics. We found discrepancies between local and national surveillance figures; home quarantine was frequently not applied as recommended and the burden on urban health departments was disproportionally higher. Flexibility of the national surveillance system and surge capacity for the prevention of future epidemics need improvement, particularly in urban health departments.","Porten, Klaudia; Faensen, Daniel; Krause, Gérard",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16614559/,187

No clinical signs of disease nor lesions suggestive of prior viral exposure were seen. Titers were detected for antibodies against canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus-1, and canine parvovirus-2 but not for antibodies against canine adenovirus-1, canine coronavirus, canine parainfluenza virus, rabies virus, feline herpesvirus-1, feline calicivirus, or feline coronavirus. This is the first report of titers for antibodies against canine herpesvirus-1 in North American river otters, and it suggests a low prevalence of antibody titers against most canine viruses in otter populations in northern and eastern New York. Confounding variables in this study could include exposure to domestic dogs associated with the project, prolonged time spent in captivity, and concurrent bacterial or parasitic infection. Stress-associated humoral immune suppression could have altered serologic profiles, especially in otters exposed to dogs after trapping but before venipuncture.","Kimber, K R; Kollias, G V; Dubovi, E J",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10982127/,187

The experiments using sera of cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and of cats naturally infected with feline coronavirus (FCoV) revealed that infection of the FIPV 79-1146 strain to the U937 cells was enhanced only by the sera of cats infected with type II FIPV or feline enteric coronavirus. The samples positive for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity had high neutralizing antibody titers against the FIPV 79-1146 strain and the samples negative for ADE activity had low neutralizing antibody titers. These findings support the previous results where a monoclonal antibody with neutralizing activity had high ADE activity, suggesting that there was a close relationship between the neutralization and enhancement sites. And then it is also suggested that ADE of infection is likely to be induced by re-infection with the same serotype of virus in type II FIPV infection. Furthermore, U937 cells are considered useful and can be substituted for the feline macrophages for determining ADE of FIPV-infection.","Hohdatsu, T; Yamada, M; Tominaga, R; Makino, K; Kida, K; Koyama, H",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9492360/,187

Furthermore, insights into the survival of these viruses in the environment are possible. In recent years, duck hepatitis B virus and bovine viral diarrhoea virus have been tested as surrogates for hepatitis B and C viruses. Feline calicivirus serves as a surrogate for the group of norovirus. By including these viruses in inactivation experiments, valuable data from suspension tests can be derived on the virucidal efficacy of chemical disinfectants. Even in vivo tests using fingerpads of adult volunteers can be performed with these animal viruses without risk of infection.

At present there is limited clinical information of the SARS-CoV-2 and there is no specific treatment recommended, although technical guidances and suggestions have been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available. Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation. The final outcome is strictly connected with the ability to apply an appropriate treatment early and to reduce all the complications that can arise during the intensive care admission.","Marraro, Giuseppe A; Spada, Claudio",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32204751/,187

The same was true for the hype of several rheumatic treatments such as Plaquenil or anti-IL-6 blockade which finally did not show efficacy in prospective trials for Covid-19 pneumonia. On the other side, notably the first confinement had a substantial negative impact on rheumatic patients.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted at two centres of Sindh, Pakistan. 521 HRCT chest performed from 1st May to 31st July 2020 were included and marked as ""COVID-19 group"". 761 HRCT chest performed during the first six months of 2019 were retrospectively evaluated to determine the prevalence of prior pulmonary tuberculosis and marked as the ""pre-COVID-19 group"". Previous pulmonary tuberculosis was documented as evidenced by clinical history, ATT intake and HRCT findings. Chi-square test was used to determine the association of prior pulmonary tuberculosis with COVID-19 pneumonia. A p-value of ≤0.01 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In the ""COVID-19 group"", 4.9% (n=26) patients had prior pulmonary tuberculosis.

192751,"Prevalence of antibodies to feline parvovirus, calicivirus, herpesvirus, coronavirus, and immunodeficiency virus and of feline leukemia virus antigen and the interrelationship of these viral infections in free-ranging lions in east Africa.",1996,"In contrast to seasonal influenza virus infections, which typically cause significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly, the 2009 H1N1 virus caused severe infection in young adults. This phenomenon was attributed to the presence of cross-protective antibodies acquired by older individuals during previous exposures to H1N1 viruses. However, this hypothesis could not be empirically tested. To address this question, we compared viral replication and the development of the immune response in naïve young adult and aged female rhesus macaques infected with A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (CA04) virus. We show higher viral loads in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and nasal and ocular swabs in aged animals, suggesting increased viral replication in both the lower and upper respiratory tracts. T cell proliferation was higher in the BAL fluid but delayed and reduced in peripheral blood in aged animals. This delay in proliferation correlated with a reduced frequency of effector CD4 T cells in old animals. Aged animals also mobilized inflammatory cytokines to higher levels in the BAL fluid. Finally, we compared changes in gene expression using microarray analysis of BAL fluid samples. Our analyses revealed that the largest difference in host response between aged and young adult animals was detected at day 4 postinfection, with a significantly higher induction of genes associated with inflammation and the innate immune response in aged animals. Overall, our data suggest that, in the absence of preexisting antibodies, CA04 infection in aged macaques is associated with changes in innate and adaptive immune responses that were shown to correlate with increased disease severity in other respiratory disease models.","Josset, Laurence; Engelmann, Flora; Haberthur, Kristen; Kelly, Sara; Park, Byung; Kawoaka, Yoshi; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Katze, Michael G; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855494/,187

Another report published by Li et al. describes that, out of 221 patients with COVID-19, 13 developed acute cerebrovascular disease with cerebral infarction, venous thrombosis and intracerebral hemorrhage.","Jiménez-Ruiz, Amado; García-Grimshaw, Miguel; Ruiz-Sandoval, José L",Gaceta medica de Mexico,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412510/,187
192945,Switching species tropism: an effective way to manipulate the feline coronavirus genome.,2003,"PURPOSE This study was designed to evaluate overall survival after radioembolization or best supportive care (BSC) in patients with chemotherapy-refractory liver-dominant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS This was a matched-pair comparison of patients who received radioembolization plus BSC or BSC alone for extensive liver disease. Twenty-nine patients who received radioembolization were retrospectively matched with a contemporary cohort of >500 patients who received BSC from 3 centers in Germany. Using clinical databases, patients were initially matched for prior treatments and tumor burden and then 29 patients were consecutively identified with two or more of four matching criteria: synchronous/metachronous metastases, tumor burden, increased ALP, and/or CEA >200 U/ml. Survival was calculated from date of progression before radioembolization or BSC by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS Of 29 patients in each study arm, 16 pairs (55.2%) matched for all four criteria, and 11 pairs (37.9%) matched three criteria. Patients in both groups had a similar performance status (Karnofsky index, median 80% [range, 60-100%]). Compared with BSC alone, radioembolization prolonged survival (median, 8.3 vs. 3.5 months; P < 0.001) with a hazard ratio of 0.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.16-0.55; P < 0.001) in a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Treatment-related adverse events following radioembolization included: grade 1-2 fatigue (n = 20, 69%), grade 1 abdominal pain/nausea (n = 14, 48.3%), and grade 2 gastrointestinal ulceration (n = 3, 10.3%). Three cases of grade 3 radiation-induced liver disease were symptomatically managed. CONCLUSIONS Radioembolization offers a promising addition to BSC in treatment-refractory patients for whom there are limited options. Survival was prolonged and adverse events were generally mild-to-moderate in nature and manageable.","Seidensticker, Ricarda; Denecke, Timm; Kraus, Patrick; Seidensticker, Max; Mohnike, Konrad; Fahlke, Jörg; Kettner, Erika; Hildebrandt, Bert; Dudeck, Oliver; Pech, Maciej; Amthauer, Holger; Ricke, Jens",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21800231/,187

METHODS A total of 739 emergency dental cases were collected from January 29 2020 to February 28 2020. They were divided into 3 groups，including adolescents (≤18 years), young adults (18 ~ 60 years), and elderly ( ≥60 years old). The data was analyzed using SPSS 21.0 software package. RESULTS The ratio of male to female was 1.24∶1. There were 655 emergency cases during the day and 84 cases during the night. The types of diseases included pericoronitis (15.83%), apical periodontitis (14.21%), pulpitis (13.40%), periodontitis (12.31%), oral mucosal disease (12.18%), Oral and maxillofacial trauma (10.55%), oral and maxillofacial space infection (8.39%), dental disease in children (5.41%), oral and maxillofacial tumors (2.84%), temporomandibular joint dislocations and disorders (1.76%), and others (3.11%). CONCLUSIONS Under the epidemic situation of the new coronavirus, as one of the high-risk departments, it is of great significance to enhance the clinical emergency skills and ability of emergency treatment, improve patients' oral health awareness, address the diagnosis and treatment of essential diseases, for the improvement the quality of dental medical care and the prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.","Lyu, Chun-Hua; Zhang, Guo-Qin; Gao, Zhen-Ran; Sheng, Lei; Ma, Song-Bo; Liu, Jian",Shanghai kou qiang yi xue = Shanghai journal of stomatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907791/,187

METHOD Database of the 2 521 probable cases of SARS in Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control was used. RESULTS The course of SARS epidemic in Beijing could be divided into five phases: import and spreading-from 1 to 31 in March, rising-from April 1 to April 15, peak-from April 16 to May 4, declining-from 5 to 18 in May, terminating-from 19 to 28 in May. The proportions of portable cases of SARS in each phase were 2.7%, 13.6%, 71.0%, 11.6% and 1.1%, respectively. Totally, 2 521 portable cases were diagnosed and verified according to the diagnostic criteria of SARS issued by the Ministry of Health. Among them, 192 died from SARS. The incidence and mortality rates of SARS were 18.57 per 100,000 and 1.41 per 100,000 with the fatality of 7.6%. The ratio of male to female with SARS was 1:0.97. The highest incidence rate of SARS was in the group of 20 - 29 years (30.85 per 100,000), and the lowest was in the group of 0 - 14 years (2.54 per 100,000). People aged 20 - 49 accounted for 72.3% of all SARS cases. The incidence rates in urban, suburb and far-suburb were 32.25/100,000, 20.57/100,000 and 8.90/100,000, respectively, decreasing according to the population density. Health care providers (17.3%), staff (12.9%), retirees (11.4%), workers (9.7%) and house-hold unemployees (8.8%) appeared to be at the five top risk populations being infected. The fatality increased significantly with age.

193780,Correction in identification of a coronavirus-like agent isolated from parrots.,1982,"OBJECTIVE Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) typically presents as a respiratory illness, co-existent cardiovascular symptomatology associated with an elevated serum troponin level has been identified as a risk factor for adverse outcomes. Our study addressed the need to correlate serum cardiovascular biomarkers with tissue pathology based on autopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 13 patients, we reviewed the clinical history and measurements of serum troponin and other biomarkers and correlated them with autopsy findings. RESULTS At autopsy, the 13 COVID-19 patients exhibited evidence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and cardiomegaly (heart weights ranged from 380 to 1170 grams). Of the 13 patients, three had elevated troponin I and evidence of severe coronary artery disease (CAD) (cases 4, 5, and 11), while six had elevated troponin I without evidence of severe CAD (cases 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and four had no clinical or pathological evidence of CAD. Of note, cases 7 and 9 had significantly elevated troponin I levels (8.84 ng/mL and 4.94 ng/mL, respectively). Several cases showed focal degenerative change or damage of cardiomyocytes. However, none of the cases had evidence of lymphocytic myocarditis. CONCLUSION Although we observed elevated biomarkers of heart failure in some cases, it was not a consistent finding and did not correlate with evidence of myocarditis. The elevated biomarkers may reflect non-ischemic heart damage as a consequence of COVID-19 infection.","Ricks, Elizabeth; Wahed, Amer; Dasgupta, Amitava; Buja, L Maximilian",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33941554/,187
193806,Characterization of the stunting syndrome agent: relatedness to known viruses.,2000,"In November of 2005, President George W Bush requested $7.1 billion dollars for a global influenza epidemic preparedness initiative (Brown, 2005). Preparation measures for a biological threat or influenza pandemic focus on rapid quarantine, vaccines, developing antiviral treatments, and economic concerns (Brown, 2005; Ferguson et al., 2006; Reina, 2008). Although these public health measures are vital, they do not consider the acute mental health consequences that could develop during a pandemic and its aftermath. The most recent H1N1 swine flu has now spread to more than 70 countries (CDC, June 2009), and as of June 11, 2009, is considered a Phase 6 pandemic by the World Health Organization, indicative of ongoing community level outbreaks in multiple parts of the globe. Following recent cases of swine flu, global concern of an influenza pandemic has risen, and it is critical that metal health considerations become an integrated part of the pandemic response. Here, potential mental health consequences and high risk populations are identified and reviewed. Mental health professionals, communities, businesses, and organizations can create an infrastructure to help mitigate mental health consequences.

194105,Genome organization and reverse genetic analysis of a type I feline coronavirus.,2008,"The local increase in the secretion of extracellular proteases, allowing cleavage of the extracellular matrix and thereby facilitating the infiltration of T cells, monocytes and neutrophils, is a hallmark of chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. In pulmonary genetic diseases, such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis, proteases can also favour the development of local immunodeficiency by degrading key regulators of the immune response, such as CD4, CD8, IgG, ICAM-1 and C3b receptors. Since several infectious agents can give rise to severe pulmonary disorders associated with opportunistic infections, we sought to determine whether an increase in proteolytic activity occurred during infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the causative agent of a new disease in swine characterized by severe respiratory problems in young pigs. Piglets were infected with the virus and bronchoalveolar lavages were collected at various times post-infection to measure the net proteolytic activity. It was shown that PRRSV infection leads to a significant increase in proteolytic activity in pulmonary fluids. Maximal activity was found at 7 and 14 days post-infection, with a return towards normal levels at day 42. Zymographic analyses showed a significant increase in the secretion of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) 2 and 9, two enzymes involved in tissue remodelling. Histological analyses showed a correlation between the increase in proteolytic activity and the appearance of lesions that were characterized by massive lymphomononuclear cell infiltration. These results suggest that virus infection of the lungs can lead to a transient increase in proteolytic activity that could favour opportunistic infection.","Girard, M; Cléroux, P; Tremblay, P; Dea, S; St-Pierre, Y",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11369868/,187

The sensitivity of the panel was 88% for detection of culture-proven nocardial infections, and specificity was 85% (excluding cross-reactive leprosy cases). In part 2, no difference in seropositivity was found when PD patients were compared with their age- and gender-matched controls (n = 140). We found a high exposure rate of humans to nocardial antigens, especially among men and older individuals. Our results offer no support to the hypothesis that Nocardia spp. are causative in PD; however, it is possible that serological testing may not be optimal for detection of nocardial central nervous system infection.","Hubble, J P; Cao, T; Kjelstrom, J A; Koller, W C; Beaman, B L",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567923/,187

METHODS This scoping study was based on a ""Google Form"" covering three constituents of the response plan against COVID-19: responders, activities and crisis communication. The attitudes of health professionals who are working in Tunisia and Algeria were measured through the Likert scale with four propositions, grouped in pairs, during the analysis. RESULTS The study population consisted of 280 health professionals, 170 of whom are Tunisians along with 110 Algerians. The medians of age and that of professional seniority are, respectively, 37 and 10 years. The role of ""health workers"", ""Mass Media"" and ""civil society associations"" was found to be satisfactory according, respectively, to 92%, 71%, and 55% of the respondents. As far as 72% of health professionals are concerned, the ""barrier measures"" were respected by the population. Approximately, seven in ten respondents were satisfied with the quality of communication occuring between the Ministries of Health and its epidemiological structures. CONCLUSION Health professionals of the Maghreb working in Tunisia and Algeria had a generally positive perception of the role of population responders, community engagement, and the quality of official communication in regards to the response plan against COVID- 19. This perception would be a prerequisite for the success of community participation and multisectoral action as well as essential in the strategy of prevention and control of this pandemic and of possible other health emergencies.","Ben Abdelaziz, Ahmed; Benzarti, Sofien; Nouira, Sarra; Mlouki, Imen; Achouri, Mohamed Yacine; Ben Abdelaziz, Islem; Yahia, Faten; Barhoumi, Tarek; Soulimane, Abdelkrim",La Tunisie medicale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32548842/,187
194618,Infectious salmon anemia virus specifically binds to and hydrolyzes 4-O-acetylated sialic acids.,2004,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Our aim was to assess the performance of flow-diverter stents. The pre- and end-of-treatment angiographies are commonly compared. However, the arterial flow rate may change between acquisitions; therefore, a better understanding of its influence on the local intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics before and after flow-diverter stent use is required. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-five image-based aneurysm models extracted from 3D rotational angiograms were conditioned for computational fluid dynamics simulations. Pulsatile simulations were performed at different arterial flow rates, covering a wide possible range of physiologic flows among 1-5 mL/s. The effect of flow-diverter stents on intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics was numerically simulated with a porous medium model. Spatiotemporal-averaged intra-aneurysmal flow velocity and flow rate were calculated for each case to quantify the hemodynamics after treatment. The short-term flow-diverter stent performance was characterized by the relative velocity reduction inside the aneurysm. RESULTS Spatiotemporal-averaged intra-aneurysmal flow velocity before and after flow-diverter stent use is linearly proportional to the mean arterial flow rate (minimum R2 > 0.983 of the linear regression models for untreated and stented models). Relative velocity reduction asymptotically decreases with increasing mean arterial flow rate. When the most probable range of arterial flow rate was considered (3-5 mL/s), instead of the wide possible flow range, the mean SD of relative velocity reduction was reduced from 3.6% to 0.48%. CONCLUSIONS Both intra-aneurysmal aneurysm velocity and flow-diverter stent performance depend on the arterial flow rate. The performance could be considered independent of the arterial flow rates within the most probable range of physiologic flows.","Morales, H G; Bonnefous, O; Geers, A J; Brina, O; Pereira, V M; Spelle, L; Moret, J; Larrabide, I",AJNR.

194798,Multigene RNA vector based on coronavirus transcription.,2003,"This review is presented as a common foundation for scientists interested in nanoparticles, their origin,activity, and biological toxicity. It is written with the goal of rationalizing and informing public health concerns related to this sometimes-strange new science of ""nano,"" while raising awareness of nanomaterials' toxicity among scientists and manufacturers handling them.We show that humans have always been exposed to tiny particles via dust storms, volcanic ash, and other natural processes, and that our bodily systems are well adapted to protect us from these potentially harmful intruders. There ticuloendothelial system, in particular, actively neutralizes and eliminates foreign matter in the body,including viruses and nonbiological particles. Particles originating from human activities have existed for millennia, e.g., smoke from combustion and lint from garments, but the recent development of industry and combustion-based engine transportation has profoundly increased an thropogenic particulate pollution. Significantly, technological advancement has also changed the character of particulate pollution, increasing the proportion of nanometer-sized particles--""nanoparticles""--and expanding the variety of chemical compositions. Recent epidemiological studies have shown a strong correlation between particulate air pollution levels, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, and mortality. Adverse effects of nanoparticles on human health depend on individual factors such as genetics and existing disease, as well as exposure, and nanoparticle chemistry, size, shape,agglomeration state, and electromagnetic properties. Animal and human studies show that inhaled nanoparticles are less efficiently removed than larger particles by the macrophage clearance mechanisms in the lungs, causing lung damage, and that nanoparticles can translocate through the circulatory, lymphatic, and nervous systems to many tissues and organs, including the brain. The key to understanding the toxicity of nanoparticles is that their minute size, smaller than cells and cellular organelles, allows them to penetrate these basic biological structures, disrupting their normal function.Examples of toxic effects include tissue inflammation, and altered cellular redox balance toward oxidation, causing abnormal function or cell death. The manipulation of matter at the scale of atoms,""nanotechnology,"" is creating many new materials with characteristics not always easily predicted from current knowledge. Within the nearly limitless diversity of these materials, some happen to be toxic to biological systems, others are relatively benign, while others confer health benefits. Some of these materials have desirable characteristics for industrial applications, as nanostructured materials often exhibit beneficial properties, from UV absorbance in sunscreen to oil-less lubrication of motors.A rational science-based approach is needed to minimize harm caused by these materials, while supporting continued study and appropriate industrial development. As current knowledge of the toxicology of ""bulk"" materials may not suffice in reliably predicting toxic forms of nanoparticles,ongoing and expanded study of ""nanotoxicity"" will be necessary. For nanotechnologies with clearly associated health risks, intelligent design of materials and devices is needed to derive the benefits of these new technologies while limiting adverse health impacts. Human exposure to toxic nanoparticles can be reduced through identifying creation-exposure pathways of toxins, a study that may someday soon unravel the mysteries of diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Reduction in fossil fuel combustion would have a large impact on global human exposure to nanoparticles, as would limiting deforestation and desertification.While nanotoxicity is a relatively new concept to science, this review reveals the result of life's long history of evolution in the presence of nanoparticles, and how the human body, in particular, has adapted to defend itself against nanoparticulate intruders.","Buzea, Cristina; Pacheco, Ivan I; Robbie, Kevin",Biointerphases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20419892/,187

Influenza viruses are ideal for evaluating such microarrays because of their genetic and host diversity, and the availability of an extensive sequence database. A collection of 476 influenza virus-specific oligonucleotides was spotted onto glass slides as probes. Viral RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR, and the products were labeled with cyanine dyes. The presence of viruses and their identities were determined by hybridization. The fluorescence intensities of oligonucleotide spots were highly reproducible within each slide and satisfactorily proportional between experiments. However, the intensities of probe spots completely complementary to target sequences varied from background to saturation. The variations did not correlate with base composition, nucleotide sequence, or internal secondary structures. Therefore, thresholds for determining whether hybridization to a spot should be judged as positive were assigned individually. Considering only positive spots from probes predicted to be monospecific for influenza virus species, subtype, host source, or gene segment, this method made correct identifications at the species, hemagglutinin subtype, and gene segment levels. Monospecific neuraminidase (NA) subtype probes were insufficiently diverse to allow confident NA subtype assignment. Incorporating positive spots from polyspecific probes into the identification scheme gave similar results. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of microarray-based oligonucleotide hybridization for multiple virus detection.","Sengupta, Srikumar; Onodera, Kenji; Lai, Alexander; Melcher, Ulrich",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14532180/,187

This is the first report on the development of an RT-LAMP assay for the detection of NoV genomes. Because of the diversity of NoV genotypes, we used 9 and 13 specially designed primers containing mixed bases for genogroup I (GI) and II (GII), respectively. The RT-LAMP assay had the advantages of rapidity, simplicity, specificity, and selectively and could obtain results within 90 min, generally even within 60 min, under isothermal conditions at 62 degrees C. The detection limits for NoV genomes were between 10(2) and 10(3) copies/tube for GI and GII with differentiation by genotype, and no cross-reactions among NoV GI and GII and other gastroenteritis viruses, such as sapovirus, human astrovirus, adenovirus type 40 and 41, and group A and C rotavirus, were found. In the evaluation tests with fecal specimens obtained from gastroenteritis outbreaks, the sensitivity and specificity of the RT-LAMP assay with regard to RT-PCR were 100 and 94% for GI and 100 and 100% for GII, respectively. These findings establish that the RT-LAMP assay is potentially useful for the rapid detection of NoV genomes from fecal specimens in outbreaks of food-borne and person-to-person-transmitted gastroenteritis.","Fukuda, Shinji; Takao, Shinichi; Kuwayama, Masaru; Shimazu, Yukie; Miyazaki, Kazuo",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16597865/,187

196261,Factors controlling coronavirus infections and disease of the central nervous system. A review.,1995,"BACKGROUND Existing permanent helical coil fasteners, although commonly employed for mesh fixation during laparoscopic hernia repair, are associated with peritoneal tissue attachment formation and resultant visceral complications. We evaluated attachment formation, fastener engagement, and mesh/tissue integration associated with laparoscopic fixation using a novel permanent capped helical coil fastener (HC-Capped) compared to permanent non-capped helical coil fasteners (HC-Non-Capped) in a porcine model. METHODS Twelve female pigs underwent bilateral laparoscopic intraperitoneal fixation of Composix™ L/P Mesh (10 × 15 cm oval) with HC-Capped or HC-Non-Capped fasteners. Thirty-two fasteners were used to secure each mesh utilizing a ""double-crown"" technique. Laparoscopy at 30 days was used to evaluate the presence and area coverage of attachments (Diamond Score) and percentage of engaged fasteners. At 90 days, following necropsy, each mesh was evaluated for the presence, percentage, and tenacity (Butler Score) of attachments and fastener engagement. Samples were biomechanically evaluated to assess tissue integration via T-peel testing. RESULTS HC-Capped fasteners demonstrated a significantly lower attachment area score compared to the HC-Non-Capped group at 30 days (0.92 ± 0.26 vs. 2.50 ± 0.29/3.00, p = 0.002) and 90 days (0.60 ± 0.22 vs. 2.08 ± 0.29/3.00, p = 0.004). At 90 days, the HC-Capped group evidenced significantly lower attachment tenacity score (1.00 ± 0.37 vs. 2.75 ± 0.33/4.00, p = 0.013). Furthermore, at 30 and 90 days, a significantly greater percentage of HC-Capped fasteners remained properly engaged (30 days: 99.7 % vs. 86.5 %, p < 0.001 and 90 days: 99.4 % vs. 74.5 %, p = 0.001). T-peel biomechanical testing demonstrated significantly greater mesh/tissue integration for HC-Capped group (2.16 ± 0.24 vs. 1.16 ± 0.29 N/cm, p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS In a porcine model, HC-Capped fasteners demonstrated significantly less attachment coverage and tenacity in the early postoperative period. Furthermore, the HC-Capped cohort evidenced significantly greater percentage of properly engaged fasteners and greater mesh/tissue integration. Data suggest that shielding exposed fastener points on the visceral mesh surface with polymer caps may reduce attachment formation and aid in mesh fixation and integration.","Majumder, Arnab; Fayezizadeh, Mojtaba; Hope, William W; Novitsky, Yuri W",Surgical endoscopy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27059967/,187

The establishment of collaborative practice agreements between dental hygienists (DH) and physician assistants (PA), has created a need for interprofessional education (IPE) for future interprofessional collaboration with EPDHs. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of an IPE intervention on future interest in collaborative practice agreements.Methods: Current and former DH and PA students from Pacific University Oregon (n=420) were invited to participate in an electronic survey. The 39-item survey included questions related to an annual IPE activity and questions related to collaborative practice agreements between PAs and EPDHs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.Results: A total of 80 DHs and PAs completed the survey for a response rate of 19%. There were high levels of agreement between DHs and PAs in regards to valuing the expertise of other health care providers, teamworking skills and interprofessional collaboration for a better understanding of a patient's condition. Only 18.9% (n=7) of the DH respondents and 25.6% of the PA respondents (n=11) were aware of the collaborative practice agreements for Oregon EPDHs.Conclusion: Participants from DH and PA disciplines agreed patient care is improved by collaborative practice fostered through interprofessional education activities. Multiple approaches may be needed to increase knowledge on the EPDH collaborative practice agreements with PAs in Oregon.","Falcon, Christela Ivon; Coplen, Amy E; Davis-Risen, Saje; Korte, Dina; Fontana, Margherita; Furgeson, Danielle",Journal of dental hygiene : JDH,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554411/,187

METHODS An electronic search of the literature between 1997 and 2007 was undertaken to identify primary studies and systematic reviews; studies were retrieved and analysed using predetermined criteria. Information on the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive surgery for gastric and oesophageal cancer was recorded and analysed. RESULTS From 188 abstracts reviewed, 46 eligible studies were identified, 23 on oesophagectomy and 23 on gastrectomy. There were 35 case series, eight case-matched studies and three randomized controlled trials. Compared with the contemporary results of open surgery, reports on minimally invasive surgery indicate potentially favourable outcomes in terms of operative blood loss, recovery of gastrointestinal function and hospital stay. However, the quality of the data was generally poor, with many potential sources of bias.

During virus replication, seven subgenomic mRNAs are generated by what is thought to be a leader-priming mechanism to form a 3'-coterminal nested set. By using radiolabeled, strand-specific, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probes in RNA blot hybridization analyses, we have found a minus-strand counterpart for the genome and for each subgenomic mRNA species in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Subgenomic minus strands were found to be components of double-stranded replicative forms and in numbers that surpass full-length antigenome. We propose that subgenomic mRNA replication, in addition to leader-primed transcription, is a significant mechanism of mRNA synthesis and that it functions to amplify mRNAs. It is a mechanism of amplification that has not been described for any other group of RNA viruses. Subgenomic replicons may also function in a manner similar to genomes of defective interfering viruses to lead to the establishment of persistent infections, a universal property of coronaviruses.","Sethna, P B; Hung, S L; Brian, D A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2546161/,187

METHODS A descriptive study was conducted based on 15 key informant interviews carried out from April to September 2013. The key informants worked within the health care sector in Trinidad and Tobago. Using a semi-structured interview guide, information was collected on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about creating a PHO; barriers and facilitators to creating and sustaining a PHO; legal considerations; and human resource and information technology requirements. Common themes of the responses were identified. RESULTS The majority of participants supported the development of a national PHO, recognized its value in informing their work, and indicated that a national PHO could 1) provide information to support evidence-informed decision-making for health policy and strategic planning; 2) facilitate data management by establishing data policies, procedures, and standards; 3) increase the use of data by synthesizing and disseminating information; and 4) provide data for benchmarking. However, a number of barriers were identified, including 1) the perception that data collection is not valued; 2) untimely availability of data; 3) limited data synthesis, dissemination, and utilization to inform decision-making; and 4) challenges related to the allocation of human resources and existing information technology. CONCLUSIONS Key informants support the development of a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago. The findings align well within the components of the conceptual framework for establishing national health observatories. A stepwise approach to establishing a national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago, beginning with structural components and followed by functional components, is recommended. A national PHO in Trinidad and Tobago could serve as a model for other countries in the Caribbean.","Pooransingh, Shalini; Misir, Akenath; Ramdath, Dan; Ramsewak, Samuel; Jaglal, Susan; Cameron, Cathy; Goel, Vivek",Revista panamericana de salud publica = Pan American journal of public health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26837526/,187

197093,Molecular intermediates of fitness gain of an RNA virus: characterization of a mutant spectrum by biological and molecular cloning.,2001,"Picornaviruses are small animal viruses with positive-stranded genomic RNA, which is translated using cap-independent internal translation initiation. The key role in this is played by cis elements of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and, in particular, by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The function of translational cis elements requires both canonical translation initiation factors (eIFs) and additional IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). All known ITAFs are cell RNA-binding proteins which play a variety of functions in noninfected cells. Specific features of translational cis elements substantially affect the phenotype and, in particular, tissue tropism and pathogenic properties of picornaviruses. It is clear that, in some cases, the molecular mechanism of this is a change in interactions between viral cis elements and ITAFs. The properties and tissue distribution of ITAFs may determine the biological properties of other viruses that also use the IRES-dependent translation initiation. Since this mechanism is also involved in translation of several cell mRNAs, ITAF may contribute to the regulation of the most important aspects of the living activity in noninfected cells.","Agol, V I",Molekuliarnaia biologiia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11524956/,187
197130,Protective lactogenic immunity conferred by an edible peptide vaccine to bovine rotavirus produced in transgenic plants.,2004,"OBJECTIVES Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected more than 8400 persons in 28 countries, with more than 800 deaths. The current SARS outbreak, especially in North American health care centers, has motivated a re-evaluation of infection control practices in the hospital and clinic environment. These considerations are particularly important to otolaryngology, in which examination and diagnostic procedures often bring the otolaryngologist in close--if not direct--contact with the patient's upper airway, mucosa, and secretions. The otolaryngologist is at increased risk of contracting a respiratory pathogen. METHOD A joint effort by the Department of Otolaryngology at Queen's University and the Infection Control Services of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, Kingston, Ontario, was carried out to develop specific infection control guidelines for the otolaryngologists using strategies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States and the Laboratory Center for Disease Control, Health Canada. RESULTS A set of specific recommendations was developed for the otolaryngologists to augment current infection control, including diligent use of personal protective equipment with every patient encounter. Moreover, this equipment should be removed according to specific protocol, to avoid contamination of self, others, and surroundings. Finally, a number of practice modifications are being adopted as prudent precautionary measures. CONCLUSION It is essential to adhere to these recommendations in order to protect the health and safety of clinicians, colleagues, and patients.","Alexander, Ashlin J; Tan, Andre K W; Evans, Gerald A; Allen, Janet",The Journal of otolaryngology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14974856/,187

An email was sent to them requesting the formulation of a lesson, in the form of a ""Public Health"" good practice recommendation. The final text of the lessons was finalized by the group coordinator and validated by the signatories of the manuscript. RESULTS A list of five lessons for the preparation of the national health systems of the Greater Maghreb for the fight against epidemics, was deduced and approved: 1. Liberal health systems are incapable of managing epidemics; 2. The specialties of ""Public Health"" are often marginalized; 3. Health personnel in the Maghreb are doubly devalued; 4.

A notable feature of the 2003 global SARS outbreak was the relative paucity of cases reported among children. We reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical features of SARS in children and discuss implications of these findings for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of SARS. METHODS We performed a literature search to identify reports of pediatric (younger than 18 years of age) patients meeting the World Health Organization case definitions for SARS and abstracted relevant clinical and epidemiologic information. RESULTS We identified 6 case series reporting 135 pediatric SARS patients (80 laboratory-confirmed, 27 probable and 28 suspect) from Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. Among laboratory-confirmed and probable SARS cases, the most common symptoms included fever (98%), cough (60%) and nausea or vomiting (41%); 97% had radiographic abnormalities. The clinical presentation of SARS in patients older than 12 years of age was similar to that in adults. However, patients 12 years of age or younger had milder disease and were less likely than older children to be admitted to an intensive care unit, receive supplemental oxygen or be treated with methylprednisolone. No deaths were reported among children or adolescents with SARS, and at 6 months after illness only mild residual changes were reported in exercise tolerance and pulmonary function. There is only 1 published report of transmission of SARS virus from a pediatric patient. CONCLUSIONS Children and adolescents are susceptible to SARS-associated coronavirus infection, although the clinical course and outcome are more favorable in children younger than 12 years of age compared with adolescents and adults. Transmission of SARS from pediatric patients appears to be uncommon but is possible.","Stockman, Lauren J; Massoudi, Mehran S; Helfand, Rita; Erdman, Dean; Siwek, Alison M; Anderson, Larry J; Parashar, Umesh D",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17195709/,187

DATA SOURCES References concerning renal denervation and resistant hypertension cited in this review were collected from PubMed published in English and those of renal denervation devices from official websites of device manufacturers up to January 2014. STUDY SELECTION Articles with keywords ""renal denervation"" and ""resistant hypertension"" were selected. RESULTS Renal and systemic sympathetic overactivity plays an important role in pathology of hypertension as well as other diseases characterized by sympathetic overactivity. Renal denervation is a new, catheter based procedure to reduce renal and systemic sympathetic overactivity by disruption of renal sympathetic efferent and afferent nerves through radiofrequency or ultrasound energy delivered to the endoluminal surface of both renal arteries. Although several studies have shown the efficacy and safety of renal denervation in the treatment of resistant hypertension and the potential benefit of the procedure in other diseases, Symplicity HTN 3 study, the most rigorous clinical trial of renal denervation to date, failed to meet its primary endpoint. The procedure also has other limitations such as the lack of long term, efficacy and safety data and the lack of the predictors for the blood pressure lowering response and nonresponse to the procedure. An overview of current renal denervation devices holding Conformité Européenne mark is also included in this review. CONCLUSIONS Renal denervation is a promising therapeutic approach in the management of resistant hypertension and other diseases characterized by sympathetic overactivity. In its early stage of clinical application, the efficacy of the procedure is still controversial. Large scale, blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials are still necessary to address the limitations of the procedure.","Cao, Longxing; Fu, Qiang; Wang, Binghui; Li, Zhiliang",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25266531/,187

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related movement restrictions on the incidence of hip fractures in different age groups. METHODS This single center retrospective observational study included all patients over 60 years old admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of hip fracture during March and April 2020. Exclusion criteria were periprosthetic or pathologic fractures and multitrauma. We collected the same data on all patients with hip fractures admitted during March and April of 2018 and 2019. RESULTS Mean patient age increased from 81.7 to 85.0 years. Only two of 49 patients tested positive for COVID-19. The data show a decrease of 38% in fracture load, but a striking decrease of 85% and 59% among sexagenarians and septuagenarian, respectively. There was no decrease among nonagenarians. Early mortality, both at 30 days and 90 days, was twice as common during the pandemic. However, stratification by age group demonstrated that the risks of early mortality were the same as previous years. Mean waiting time for surgery decreased from 27.5 to 18.9 hours. Patient discharge to home over a rehabilitation facility increased from 9% to 17. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic affected the epidemiology of hip fractures in the elderly. The incidence of fractures and age distribution were significantly different from other years. Discharge destinations were also affected.

METHODS Serial roentgenography and CT of 61 confirmed SARS patients were analyzed. RESULTS The onset symptom was fever in all patients. In the early phase of SARS, the main abnormal appearance was single or bilateral localized patchy clouding opacity on roentgenography, which progressed rapidly. The area of opacity peaked at about 2 weeks, involving the majority area of the lung in 57% of the patients. The area involved was correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms. The opacity disappeared gradually in 5 weeks in 84% of the patients. Lungs complicated infection were found in 6 patients with a prolonged duration of the illness. Among the 61 patients, 4 died. CT scan was performed in 16 SARS patients in the recovery phase, of whom 13 showed lung fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS Lung infiltration in early phase develops rapidly and involves most area of the lung in advanced phase in most SARS patients.

We investigated whole-blood expression of cholinergic system members and correlated it with COVID-19 severity. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and healthy aged-matched controls were included in this non-interventional study. A whole blood sample was drawn between 9-11 days after symptoms onset, and peripheral leukocyte phenotyping, cytokines measurement, RNA expression and plasma viral load were determined. Additionally, whole-blood expression of native alpha-7 nicotinic subunit and its negative dominant duplicate (CHRFAM7A), choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine esterase (AchE) were determined. Thirty-seven patients with COVID-19 (10 moderate, 11 severe and 16 with critical disease) and 14 controls were included. Expression of CHRFAM7A was significantly lower in critical COVID-19 patients compared to controls. COVID-19 patients not expressing CHRFAM7A had higher levels of CRP, more extended pulmonary lesions and displayed more pronounced lymphopenia. COVID-19 patients without CHRFAM7A expression also showed increased TNF pathway expression in whole blood. AchE was also expressed in 30 COVID-19 patients and in all controls. COVID-19-induced hypercytokinemia is associated with decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory dominant negative duplicate CHRFAM7A. Expression of this duplicate might be considered before targeting the cholinergic system in COVID-19 with nicotine.","Courties, Alice; Boussier, Jeremy; Hadjadj, Jérôme; Yatim, Nader; Barnabei, Laura; Péré, Hélène; Veyer, David; Kernéis, Solen; Carlier, Nicolas; Pène, Frédéric; Rieux-Laucat, Frédéric; Charbit, Bruno; Bondet, Vincent; Duffy, Darragh; Berenbaum, Francis; Terrier, Benjamin; Sellam, Jérémie",Sci Rep,,187
209577,Attenuated porcine-derived type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus as vector stably expressing viral gene,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a global pandemic. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological, and virological parameters in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In March 2020, 10 terminally ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication. We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation, as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Over the 14-day study period, six patients survived, two were extubated, and one discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared with the baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction in plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL). Furthermore, the increase in the CD8 percentage was inversely correlated with the reduction in pVL (r = -0.77, p = 0.0013). CONCLUSIONS: Our study design precludes clinical efficacy inferences but the results implicate CCR5 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19 and they form the basis for ongoing randomized clinical trials.","Patterson, Bruce K; Seethamraju, Harish; Dhody, Kush; Corley, Michael J; Kazempour, Kazem; Lalezari, Jay; Pang, Alina P S; Sugai, Christopher; Mahyari, Eisa; Francisco, Edgar B; Pise, Amruta; Rodrigues, Hallison; Wu, Helen L; Webb, Gabriela M; Park, Byung S; Kelly, Scott; Pourhassan, Nader; Lelic, Alina; Kdouh, Lama; Herrera, Monica; Hall, Eric; Bimber, Benjamin N; Plassmeyer, Matthew; Gupta, Raavi; Alpan, Oral; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Mudd, Philip A; Akalin, Enver; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C; Sacha, Jonah B",Int J Infect Dis,,187

As a first step to overcome technical limitations in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 along the water cycle, we assessed the analytical performance of a dead end hollow fiber ultrafiltration coupled to different options for secondary concentrations to concentrate viral particles from large volume of spiked tap water, seawater and surface water together with two quantitative RT-qPCR detection kits. Spiking the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an enveloped virus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, together with the mengovirus, we demonstrated that PEG-precipitation and SENS-kit better recovered PEDV (13.10 ± 0.66%) from tap water, while centrifugal filtration resulted the best option to recover mengovirus regardless of the detection kit used. No statistical significant differences were found when comparing high (10,000 ×g) and low (3500 ×g) centrifugation speeds for the secondary PEG- based concentration of spiked seawater, while considerable inhibition was observed for both viruses detected by NoInh-kit assay. Similarly, the co-concentration of PCR inhibitors and viral particles was observed in surface waters detected with either SENS-kit or NoInh-kit and RNA dilution was needed to achieve acceptable recoveries at the expenses of the overall sensitivity of the method. These methodologies represent suitable options to investigate SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in different water resources and allow to conduct on site sampling of large volume of water.","Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Pérez-Cataluña, Alba; Allende, Ana; Guix, Susana; Randazzo, Walter; Sánchez, Gloria",Sci Total Environ,,187

220151,"The X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Ssr4, a Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromatin-remodelling protein",2020,"OBJECTIVES: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. DESIGN AND SETTING: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool was used to examine deidentified electronic health records of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. PARTICIPANTS: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7 January 2019 and 20 September 2020 (around 37 500 patients per week). OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week.(ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week. RESULTS: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared with that in the previous year (ß coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased (ß coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Patel, Rashmi; Irving, Jessica; Brinn, Aimee; Broadbent, Matthew; Shetty, Hitesh; Pritchard, Megan; Downs, Johnny; Stewart, Robert; Harland, Robert; McGuire, Philip",BMJ Open,,187
221469,Comparison of the mucosal adjuvanticities of two Toll-like receptor ligands for recombinant adenovirus-delivered African swine fever virus fusion antigens,2021,"The widespread problem of a 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) strain outbreak in Wuhan, China has prompted a search for new drugs to protect against and treat this disease. It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favorable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus. This report sought to provide fundamental knowledge as preliminary experimental data to propose an existing nutraceutical material against viral infection. Collectively, it is suggested that molecular modelling and molecular docking are suitable tools to search and screen for new drugs and natural compounds that can be used as future treatments for viral diseases.","Kodchakorn, Kanchanok; Poovorawan, Yong; Suwannakarn, Kamol; Kongtawelert, Prachya",J Mol Graph Model,,187

Affected persons were passengers, crew, and their close contacts. We traced 217 passengers and crew to their final destinations and interviewed, tested, and quarantined them. Among the 16 persons in whom SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected, 12 (75%) were passengers seated in business class along with the only symptomatic person (attack rate 62%). Seating proximity was strongly associated with increased infection risk (risk ratio 7.3, 95% CI 1.2-46.2). We found no strong evidence supporting alternative transmission scenarios. In-flight transmission that probably originated from 1 symptomatic passenger caused a large cluster of cases during a long flight. Guidelines for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection among air passengers should consider individual passengers' risk for infection, the number of passengers traveling, and flight duration.","Khanh, Nguyen Cong; Thai, Pham Quang; Quach, Ha-Linh; Thi, Ngoc-Anh Hoang; Dinh, Phung Cong; Duong, Tran Nhu; Mai, Le Thi Quynh; Nghia, Ngu Duy; Tu, Tran Anh; Quang, La Ngoc; Quang, Tran Dai; Nguyen, Trong-Tai; Vogt, Florian; Anh, Dang Duc",Emerg Infect Dis,,187

Nintedanib is a new antifibrotic agent that interferes with processes of pulmonary fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of nintedanib in COVID-19. METHODS: This was an interventional study in which adult patients with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation were consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The secondary endpoints were length of mechanical ventilation, volume of lung injury, and the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events and acute liver failure. RESULTS: Thirty patients with COVID-19 underwent nintedanib therapy. We included 30 patients not receiving nintedanib as the historical control group. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality between the groups (23.3% vs 20%, P = 0.834). Lengths of mechanical ventilation were significantly shorter in the nintedanib group (P = 0.046). Computed tomography volumetry showed that the percentages of high-attenuation areas were significantly lower in the nintedanib group at liberation from mechanical ventilation (38.7% vs 25.7%, P = 0.027). There were no significant differences in the adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of nintedanib may offer potential benefits for minimizing lung injury in COVID-19.","Umemura, Yutaka; Mitsuyama, Yumi; Minami, Kensuke; Nishida, Takeshi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Okada, Naoki; Yamakawa, Kazuma; Nochioka, Kotaro; Fujimi, Satoshi",Int J Infect Dis,,187

The involvement of cardiovascular system in COVID­19 has been proven and increased healthcare system resources are redirected towards handling infected patients, which induces major changes in access to services and prioritization in the management of patients with chronic cardiovascular disease unrelated to COVID­19. In this expert opinion, conceived by the task force involving the Working Groups on Valvular Heart Diseases and Cardiac Surgery as well as the Association of Cardiovascular Intervention of the Polish Cardiac Society, modification of diagnostic pathways, principles of healthcare personnel protection, and treatment guidelines regarding triage and prioritization are suggested. Heart Teams responsible for the treatment of valvular heart disease should continue their work using telemedicine and digital technology. Diagnostic tests must be simplified or deferred to minimize the number of potentially dangerous aerosol­generating procedures, such as transesophageal echocardiography or exercise imaging. The treatment of aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation has to be offered particularly due to urgent indications and in patients with advanced disease and poor prognosis. Expert risk stratification is essential for triage and setting the priority lists. In each case, an appropriate level of personal protection must be ensured for the healthcare personnel to prevent spreading infection and preserve specialized manpower, who will supply the continuing need for handling serious chronic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, as soon as the local epidemic situation improves, efforts must be made to restore standard opportunities for elective treatment of valvular heart disease and occluder­based therapies according to existing guidelines, thus rebuilding the state ­of ­the ­art cardiovascular services.","Plonska-Gosciniak, Edyta; Suwalski, Piotr; Bartus, Stanislaw; Kukulski, Tomasz; Komar, Monika; Wojakowski, Wojciech; Grygier, Marek; Pruszczyk, Piotr; Gasior, Zbigniew; Huczek, Zenon; Berger-Kucza, Adrianna; Bak, Janusz; Sorysz, Danuta; Kasprzak, Jaroslaw D",Kardiol Pol,,187

For the surgical speciality, there have been changes to both elective and emergency practice. Concern regarding potential aerosolisation during invasive procedures have been raised - including the use of pneumoperitoneum to facilitate laparoscopy. The aim of this study is to systematically review the data available to date regarding the potential risk posed to theatre staff by laparoscopy. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Only publications in peer-reviewed journals were considered. PubMed, Ovid Embase, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library were searched. The search period was between 1st January 1980 and 27th April 2020. Bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: 4209 records were identified, resulting in 9 unique studies being selected. The included studies examined viral DNA aerosoliation generated by electrosurgery and CO2 laser ablation, with one study examining viral DNA aerosolisation following laparoscopy. Each of these demonstrated that viral DNA (Hepatitis B Virus and Human Papilloma Virus) was detectable in the surgical smoke plume. CONCLUSION: The data and analysis reported in this study reflect the most up-to-date evidence available for the surgeon to assess risk towards healthcare staff. It was constrained by heterogeneity of reporting for several outcomes and lack of comparable studies. There is currently insufficient data to recommend open or a minimally invasive surgical approach with regard to theatre team safety in the COVID-19 era.","Patterson, T J; Currie, P J; Beck, J; Spence, R A J; Spence, G M",Surgeon,,187

Services are quickly adapting to new challenges in the practical delivery of end-of-life care to patients in the community including through virtual consultations and in the provision of timely symptom control. AIM: To synthesise existing evidence related to the delivery of palliative and end-of-life care by primary healthcare professionals in epidemics and pandemics. DESIGN: Rapid systematic review using modified systematic review methods, with narrative synthesis of the evidence. DATA SOURCES: Searches were carried out in Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science on 7th March 2020. RESULTS: Only five studies met the inclusion criteria, highlighting a striking lack of evidence base for the response of primary healthcare services in palliative care during epidemics and pandemics. All were observational studies. Findings were synthesised using a pandemic response framework according to 'systems' (community providers feeling disadvantaged in terms of receiving timely information and protocols), 'space' (recognised need for more care in the community), 'staff' (training needs and resilience) and 'stuff' (other aspects of managing care in pandemics including personal protective equipment, cleaning care settings and access to investigations). CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, there is an urgent need for research to provide increased understanding of the role of primary care and community nursing services in palliative care, alongside hospices and community specialist palliative care providers.","Mitchell, Sarah; Maynard, Victoria; Lyons, Victoria; Jones, Nicholas; Gardiner, Clare",Palliat Med,,187

Além disso, a LV vem avançando rapidamente para novas áreas antes consideradas indenes. Os flebotomíneos (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) são pequenos mosquitos com grande relevância em ciências médicas e veterinárias, por serem vetores de vírus, Bartonella bacilliformis e principalmente Leishmania spp. Os estudos sobre esses insetos são fundamentais para uma melhor compreensão da complexa epidemiologia das leishmanioses, revelando os aspectos biológicos desses vetores e suas relações com o parasita e seus reservatórios. Atualmente, abordagens moleculares vêm sendo incluídas nesses estudos e mostram-se ser ferramentas poderosas em pesquisas sobre esses dípteros. O objetivo desse trabalho, foi investigar os aspectos bioecológicos de flebotomíneos em área endêmica de LT e LV no estado de São Paulo, Brasil. Assim, foi realizado um inquérito entomológico para descrever a fauna, sua sazonalidade, taxa de infecção natural por Leishmania spp. e a identificação de hospedeiros vertebrados de flebotomíneos na área de estudo. Os insetos foram triados, identificados e o tórax e abdômen das fêmeas amostradas submetidas a extração de DNA e posterior PCR para a detecção do DNA do Kinetoplasto (kDNA) de parasitas do gênero Leishmania. Em seguida, amostras de DNA de fêmeas ingurgitadas, semiingurgitadas e grávidas foram submetidas a PCR para a amplificação do gene mitocondrial citocromo B (CYT-B) de vertebrados. Os produtos amplificados nas reações de CYT-B foram purificados e submetidos ao sequenciamento genético. As sequências encontradas foram confrontadas com a base de dados GenBank, para identificação da espécie de vertebrado envolvido no repasto sanguíneo, das fêmeas de flebotomíneos. Por empregar ferramentas moleculares, nesse trabalho, também foi analisado o desempenho de alguns métodos de extração de DNA em amostras individuais de tórax e abdômen de fêmeas desses insetos. Em nosso estudo, foram encontradas doze espécies de flebotomíneos, entre vetores comprovados e suspeitos nos ciclos epidemiológicos de LT e LV. Não foram observados padrões sazonais entre os fatores climáticos e a fauna desses insetos. Sobre os métodos de extração de DNA, os métodos comerciais são uma boa opção para esse tipo de amostra. Contudo, os métodos caseiros baseado em fenol/clorofórmio/álcool isoamílico ou em NaCl/álcool apresentaram melhores resultados. As análises moleculares revelaram uma fêmea não ingurgitada de Ev. (Ald.) carmelinoi positiva na PCR do kDNA de Leishmania spp. A identificação das fontes de repasto sanguíneo revelou os suínos, humanos, cães, bovinos, galinhas e gambás como hospedeiros vertebrados de flebotomíneos na área em estudo. As implicações desses achados são aqui apresentadas na forma de dois artigos científicos submetidos para avaliação em revistas da área.","LEONEL, JOAO AUGUSTO FRANCO",,,187

319368,Fine tuned exploration of evolutionary relationships within the protein universe,2021,"Tensional homeostasis is widely recognized to exist at the length scales of organs and tissues, but the cellular length scale mechanism for tension regulation is not known. In this study, we explored whether tensional homeostasis emerges from the behavior of the individual focal adhesion (FA), which is the subcellular structure that transmits cell stress to the surrounding extracellular matrix. Past studies have suggested that cell contractility builds up until a certain displacement is achieved, and we thus hypothesized that tensional homeostasis may require a threshold level of substrate displacement. Micropattern traction microscopy was used to study a wide range of FA traction forces generated by bovine vascular smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on substrates of stiffness of 3.6, 6.7, 13.6, and 30 kPa. The most striking feature of FA dynamics observed here is that the substrate displacement resulting from FA traction forces is a unifying feature that determines FA tensional stability. Beyond approximately 1 µm of substrate displacement, FAs, regardless of cell type or substrate stiffness, exhibit a precipitous drop in temporal fluctuations of traction forces. These findings lead us to the conclusion that traction force dynamics collectively determine whether cells or cell ensembles develop tensional homeostasis, and this insight is necessary to fully understand how matrix stiffness impacts cellular behavior in healthy conditions and, more important, in pathological conditions such as cancer or vascular aging, where environmental stiffness is altered. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Tensional homeostasis is widely recognized to exist at the length scales of organs and tissues, but the cellular length scale mechanism for tension regulation is not known. In this study, we explored whether tensional homeostasis emerges from the behavior of the individual focal adhesion (FA), which is the subcellular structure that transmits cell stress to the extracellular matrix. We utilized micropattern traction microscopy to measure time-lapses of FA forces in vascular smooth muscle cells and in endothelial cells. We discovered that the magnitude of the substrate displacement determines whether the FA has low temporal variability of traction forces. This finding is significant since it is the first known feature of tensional homeostasis that is broadly unifying across a range of environmental conditions and cell types.","Xu, Han; Donegan, Stephanie; Dreher, Jordan M; Stark, Alicia J; Canovic, Elizabeth P; Stamenovic, Dimitrije; Smith, Michael L",Acta biomater,,187

334812,Sensitivity of wastewater-based epidemiology for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a low prevalence setting,2021,"To understand the public sentiment toward the measures used by policymakers for COVID-19 containment, a survey among representative samples of the population in seven European countries was carried out in the first two weeks of April 2020. The study addressed people's support for containment policies, worries about COVID-19 consequences, and trust in sources of information. Citizens were overall satisfied with their government's response to the pandemic; however, the extent of approval differed across countries and policy measures. A north-south divide in public opinion was noticeable across the European states. It was particularly pronounced for intrusive policy measures, such as mobile data use for movement tracking, economic concerns, and trust in the information from the national government. Considerable differences in people's attitudes were noticed within countries, especially across individual regions and age groups. The findings suggest that the epidemic acts as a stressor, causing health and economic anxieties even in households that were not directly affected by the virus. At the same time, the burden of stress was unequally distributed across regions and age groups. Based on the data collected, we draw lessons from the containment stage and identify several insights that can facilitate the design of lockdown exit strategies and future containment policies so that a high level of compliance can be expected.","Sabat, Iryna; Neuman-Böhme, Sebastian; Varghese, Nirosha Elsem; Barros, Pedro Pita; Brouwer, Werner; van Exel, Job; Schreyögg, Jonas; Stargardt, Tom",Health Policy,,187
339587,Shotgun Lipidomic Analysis of Leishmania Cells,2021,"We present a hypothesis for increased sugar consumption and a lack of physical exercise as possible determinants of COVID-19 disease severity by impaired glucose metabolism, concurring into a syndemic. National data demonstrate that increased sugar consumption, a high daily caloric intake, and low levels of daily physical activity are independently associated with COVID-19 mortality. Further, genetic factors such as variations in the androgen receptor may compound the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle and increase the risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms in some patients. A diet high in sugar in combination with a low level of physical activity may increase blood glucose levels and impair glucose metabolism. Recent data show that patients admitted to the hospital with high levels of fasting blood glucose are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms. Moreover, elevated glucose levels resulted in increased SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vitro. We believe that healthier habits of diet and exercise, by improving glucose homeostasis could modulate the individual risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Chesnut, Walter M; MacDonald, Scott; Wambier, Carlos Gustavo",Med Hypotheses,,187
342480,Pathophysiological Association of Endothelial Dysfunction with Fatal Outcome in COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is involved in a global outbreak affecting millions of people who manifest a variety of symptoms. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly associated with cardiovascular complications requiring hospitalizations; however, the mechanisms underlying these complications remain unknown. Nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are gasotransmitters that regulate key cardiovascular functions. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 68 COVID-19 patients and 33 controls and NO and H2S metabolites were assessed. H2S and NO levels were compared between cases and controls in the entire study population and subgroups based on race. The availability of gasotransmitters was examined based on severity and outcome of COVID-19 infection. The performance of H2S and NO levels in predicting COVID-19 infection was also analyzed. Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify the effects of traditional determinants of gasotransmitters on NO and H2S levels in the patients with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Significantly reduced NO and H2S levels were observed in both Caucasian and African American COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. COVID-19 patients who died had significantly higher NO and H2S levels compared to COVID-19 patients who survived. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis of NO and H2S metabolites in the study population showed free sulfide levels to be highly predictive of COVID-19 infection based on reduced availability. Traditional determinants of gasotransmitters, namely age, race, sex, diabetes, and hypertension had no effect on NO and H2S levels in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: These observations provide the first insight into the role of NO and H2S in COVID-19 infection, where their low availability may be a result of reduced synthesis secondary to endotheliitis, or increased consumption from scavenging of reactive oxygen species.","Dominic, Paari; Ahmad, Javaria; Bhandari, Ruchi; Pardue, Sibile; Solorzano, Juan; Jaisingh, Keerthish; Watts, Megan; Bailey, Steven R; Orr, A Wayne; Kevil, Christopher G; Kolluru, Gopi K",Redox Biol,,187

By the end of that month, the World Health Organization, recognizing the severity of the disease and the potential for global spread, had declared a public health emergency. By February 2020, cases had been identified in multiple countries, clinical trials of treatments with some biological plausibility had begun in China, and the initial steps of vaccine development were underway. In mid-March, by which time countries around the world were experiencing rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the World Health Organization categorized the outbreak as a pandemic. This new coronavirus was designated SARS-COV-2 in recognition of its similarity to the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002-2003. The race is on to develop treatments that can mitigate the severe consequences of infection and vaccines that can prevent infection and/or diminish the severity of disease in those who do get infected. Many challenges face these development efforts. Some are similar to those faced in the past; others are new. The urgency of finding ways to treat, and ultimately prevent, the consequences of this new and potentially deadly infection has led to unprecedented focus on clinical trials.","Ellenberg, Susan S",Clin Trials,,187

Here, we investigated the presence of cross-neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in dromedary camels that were Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) seropositive but MERS-CoV free. The tested 229 dromedaries had anti-MERS-CoV camel antibodies with variable cross-reactivity patterns against SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including the S trimer and M, N, and E proteins. Using SARS-CoV-2 competitive immunofluorescence immunoassays and pseudovirus neutralization assays, we found medium-to-high titers of cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in these animals. Through linear B cell epitope mapping using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing and a SARS-CoV-2 peptide/proteome microarray, we identified a large repertoire of Betacoronavirus cross-reactive antibody specificities in these dromedaries and demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2-specific VHH antibody repertoire is qualitatively diverse. This analysis revealed not only several SARS-CoV-2 epitopes that are highly immunogenic in humans, including a neutralizing epitope, but also epitopes exclusively targeted by camel antibodies. The identified SARS-CoV-2 cross-neutralizing camel antibodies are not proposed as a potential treatment for COVID-19. Rather, their presence in nonimmunized camels supports the development of SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune camels, which could be a prominent source of therapeutic agents for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Chouchane, Lotfi; Grivel, Jean-Charles; Farag, Elmoubasher Abu Baker Abd; Pavlovski, Igor; Maacha, Selma; Sathappan, Abbirami; Al-Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Abuaqel, Sirin Wj; Ata, Manar Mahmoud Ahmad; Chouchane, Aouatef Ismail; Remadi, Sami; Halabi, Najeeb; Rafii, Arash; Al-Thani, Mohammed H; Marr, Nico; Subramanian, Murugan; Shan, Jingxuan",JCI insight,,187

348413,"Extracellular Vesicles: Versatile Nanomediators, Potential Biomarkers and Therapeutic Agents in Atherosclerosis and COVID-19-Related Thrombosis",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Currently, there are no definitive data on the relationship between low levels of vitamin D in the blood and a more severe disease course, in terms of the need for hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality, in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We aimed to study the association between levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and adverse clinical outcomes linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further aimed to observe the incidence of low, below-average, and normal levels of 25(OH)D in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 12, 2020, and May 20, 2020, and assess whether these values differed between these patients and a normal population. Finally, we determined whether the need for transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality rate were related to low levels of 25(OH)D. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Quironsalud Hospitals in Madrid, Spain. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 1549 patients (mean age, 70 years; range, 21-104 years); 835 were male (53.9 %; mean age, 73.02 years), and 714 were female (46.1 %; mean age, 68.05 years). Subsequently, infected patients admitted to the ICU (n = 112) and those with a fatal outcome (n = 324) were analyzed. PROCEDURES: Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D were measured by electrochemiluminescence. RESULTS: More hospitalized patients (66 %, n = 1017) had low baseline levels of 25(OH)D (<20 ng/mL) than normal individuals (45 %) (p < 0.001). An analysis by age group revealed that COVID-19 patients between the ages of 20 and 80 years old had significantly lower vitamin D levels than those of the normal population (p < 0.001). Patients admitted to the ICU tended to have lower levels of 25(OH)D than other inpatients (p < 0.001); if we stratified patients by 25(OH)D levels, we observed that the rate of ICU admission was higher among patients with vitamin D deficiency (p < 0.001), indicating that higher vitamin D levels are associated with a lower risk of ICU admission due to COVID-19. ICU admission was related to sex (higher rates in men, p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001). When using a logistic regression model, we found that vitamin D levels continued to show a statistically significant relationship with ICU admission rates, even when adjusting for sex and age. Therefore, the relationship found between vitamin D levels and the risk of ICU admission was independent of patient age and sex in both groups. Deceased patients (n = 324 tended to have lower levels of 25 (OH)D that normal population of the same age (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency in patients with COVID-19 is correlated with an increased risk of hospital admission and the need for critical care. We found no clear relationship between vitamin D levels and mortality.","Diaz-Curiel, Manuel; Cabello, Alfonso; Arboiro-Pinel, Rosa; Mansur, Luis; Heili-Frades, Sarah; Mahillo-Fernandez, Ignacio; Herrero-González, Antonio; Andrade-Poveda, Marjorie",J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,,187

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine during the early phase of the COVID-19 crisis. Failure of the telemedicine encounter was assessed in this study by 2 separate criteria: (1) an unplanned visit to the emergency department (ED) within 6 weeks of the telemedicine encounter and (2) a planned subsequent in-person encounter for inability to formulate a complete diagnosis virtually. The authors retrospectively identified all new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine in the orthopedic surgery department of an academic tertiary care center during the first 6 weeks of the COVID-19 response, from March 16, 2020, to April 26, 2020. The study cohort included 298 new patients treated by 41 providers. The mean age of the 298 patients was 48 years, and 59% were women. Two hundred encounters were performed with video, and 98 were performed with telephone only. Three (1%) patients presented to the ED within 6 weeks of their new patient telemedicine encounter, and 8 (3%) patients presented for a planned in-person encounter. The authors concluded that new patient orthopedic surgery ambulatory encounters performed using telemedicine were able to effectively direct patients to a variety of treatments and dispositions, with a low rate of unplanned presentation to the ED or need for supplementary in-person assessment.

We summarized the latest advances in bioinformatics analysis of sequencing data from T and B cell repertoires and also presented contemporary ideas about the mechanisms of clonal diversity formation at different stages of organism development. At the same time, we focused on the importance of the allelic variants of the HLA genes and spectra of presented antigens for the formation of T-cell receptors (TCR) landscapes. The main idea of this review is that immune equilibrium and proper functioning of immunity are highly dependent on the interaction between the recognition and the presentation landscapes of antigens. Certain changes in these landscapes can occur during life, which can affect the protective function of adaptive immunity. We described some mechanisms associated with these changes, for example, the conversion of effector cells into regulatory cells and vice versa due to the trans-differentiation or bystander effect, changes in the clonal organization of the general TCR repertoire due to homeostatic proliferation or aging, and the background for the altered presentation of some antigens due to SNP mutations of MHC, or the alteration of the presenting antigens due to post-translational modifications. The authors suggest that such alterations can lead to an increase in the risk of the development of oncological and autoimmune diseases and influence the sensitivity of the organism to different infectious agents.","Shevyrev, Daniil; Tereshchenko, Valeriy; Kozlov, Vladimir",Front Immunol,,187

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine paediatric inpatient cases were retrospectively analysed using their clinical, laboratory and imaging features. The National Public Health Guide was used in the diagnosis and treatment of paediatric patients. COVID-19 infections for all patients were confirmed by the COVID-19 nucleic acid test using a pharyngeal swab. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 11 years [3-15]. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (40.6%) and cough (33.3%). When the laboratory findings of patients were examined, the median white blood cell (WBC) count was 5.8/mm3 (4.8-8.05/mm3 ), median lymphocyte count was 2.3/mm3 (1.7-3.55/mm3 ) and median C-reactive protein (CRP) level was 2.3/mm3 (1-2.1/mm3 ). All patients had chest radiographs (CRXs), while only 44.9% of the patients underwent a chest CT. The 8.7% of CXRs and 12.8% of chest CT findings were found as pathological. Ground-glass opacity was the most frequent finding. In the tomography group, the count of lymphocytes was lower, and creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher. The patients with pathological tomography findings demonstrated no statistically significant difference in lymphocyte count and CK and LDH levels; however, their CRP value was significantly higher. CONCLUSION: In this study, it is emphasised that chest CT should be requested by considering the underlying diseases and severity of clinical findings in paediatric patients. In this way, unnecessary chest CT could be prevented in the paediatric population.","Erat, Tugba; Güler, Sükran",Int J Clin Pract,,187

This report includes an overview of therapeutic approaches, individual panel summaries, and a summary of the discussions and perspectives on the challenges ahead for antiviral development.","Hall, Matthew D; Anderson, James M; Anderson, Annaliesa; Baker, David; Bradner, Jay; Brimacombe, Kyle R; Campbell, Elizabeth A; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Carter, Kara; Cherry, Sara; Chiang, Lillian; Cihlar, Tomas; de Wit, Emmie; Denison, Mark; Disney, Matthew; Fletcher, Courtney V; Ford-Scheimer, Stephanie L; Götte, Matthias; Grossman, Abigail C; Hayden, Frederick G; Hazuda, Daria J; Lanteri, Charlotte A; Marston, Hilary; Mesecar, Andrew D; Moore, Stephanie; Nwankwo, Jennifer O; O039,; Rear, Jules; Painter, George; Singh Saikatendu, Kumar; Schiffer, Celia A; Sheahan, Timothy P; Shi, Pei-Yong; Smyth, Hugh D; Sofia, Michael J; Weetall, Marla; Weller, Sandra K; Whitley, Richard; Fauci, Anthony S; Austin, Christopher P; Collins, Francis S; Conley, Anthony J; Davis, Mindy I",J Infect Dis,,187
389948,The MHC Class II Transactivator CIITA: Not (Quite) the Odd-One-Out Anymore among NLR Proteins,2021,"The choices that researchers make while conducting a statistical analysis usually have a notable impact on the results. This fact has become evident in the ongoing research of the association between the environment and the evolution of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in light of the hundreds of contradictory studies that have already been published on this issue in just a few months. In this paper, a COVID-19 dataset containing the number of daily cases registered in the regions of Catalonia (Spain) since the start of the pandemic to the end of August 2020 is analysed using statistical models of diverse levels of complexity. Specifically, the possible effect of several environmental variables (solar exposure, mean temperature, and wind speed) on the number of cases is assessed. Thus, the first objective of the paper is to show how the choice of a certain type of statistical model to conduct the analysis can have a severe impact on the associations that are inferred between the covariates and the response variable. Secondly, it is shown how the use of spatio-temporal models accounting for the nature of the data allows understanding the evolution of the pandemic in space and time. The results suggest that even though the models fitted to the data correctly capture the evolution of COVID-19 in space and time, determining whether there is an association between the spread of the pandemic and certain environmental conditions is complex, as it is severely affected by the choice of the model.","Briz-Redón, Álvaro",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,,187
391397,Exploring the Allosteric Territory of Protein Function,2021,"Global coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) caused by newly identified SARS- CoV-2 coronavirus continues to claim the lives of thousands of people worldwide. The unavailability of specific medications to treat COVID-19 has led to drug repositioning efforts using various approaches, including computational analyses. Such analyses mostly rely on molecular docking and require the 3D structure of the target protein to be available. In this study, we utilized a set of machine learning algorithms and trained them on a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors to run inference analyses on antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs solely based on the ligand information. We also performed virtual screening analysis of the drug candidates predicted by machine learning models and docked them against the active site of SARS- CoV-2 RdRp, a key component of the virus replication machinery. Based on the ligand information of RdRp inhibitors, the machine learning models were able to identify candidates such as remdesivir and baloxavir marboxil, molecules with documented activity against RdRp of the novel coronavirus. Among the other identified drug candidates were beclabuvir, a non-nucleoside inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RdRp enzyme, and HCV protease inhibitors paritaprevir and faldaprevir. Further analysis of these candidates using molecular docking against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp revealed low binding energies against the enzyme active site. Our approach also identified anti-inflammatory drugs lupeol, lifitegrast, antrafenine, betulinic acid, and ursolic acid to have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We propose that the results of this study are considered for further validation as potential therapeutic options against COVID-19.","Cozac, Romeo; Medzhidov, Nazim; Elix, Shinya Yuki; Inc.,; Tokyo,; Japan,",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06523v1.pdf,187

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: This study comprises 91 cases, including 24 cases with anosmia due to SARS-CoV-2, 38 patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) due to viral infection other than SARS-CoV-2, and a control group of 29 normosmic cases. METHODS: All cases had paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT), and cases with OD had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dedicated to the olfactory nerve. The OC width and volumes were measured on CT, and T2-weighted signal intensity (SI), olfactory bulb volumes, and olfactory sulcus depths were assessed on MRI. RESULTS: This study showed 3 major findings: the right and left OC widths were significantly wider in anosmic patients due to SARS-CoV-2 (group 1) or OD due to non-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (group 2) when compared to healthy controls. OC volumes were significantly higher in group 1 or 2 than in healthy controls, and T2 SI of OC area was higher in groups 1 and 2 than in healthy controls. There was no significant difference in olfactory bulb volumes and olfactory sulcus depths on MRI among groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: In this study, patients with COVID-19 anosmia had higher OC widths and volumes compared to control subjects. In addition, there was higher T2 SI of the olfactory bulb in COVID-19 anosmia compared to control subjects, suggesting underlying inflammatory changes. There was a significant negative correlation between these morphological findings and threshold discrimination identification scores.

However, despite the medical consensus, many citizens have resisted adhering to and/or supporting its implementation. While this resistance may stem from the non-negligible personal economic costs of implementing social distancing, we argue that it may also reside in more fundamental differences in normative principles and belief systems, as reflected by political orientation. In a study conducted in Brazil, we test the relative importance of these explanations by examining whether and how support for social distancing varies according to self-identified political orientation and personal economic vulnerability. Results show that while economic vulnerability does not influence support for social distancing, conservatives are systematically less supportive of these practices than liberals. Discrepancies in sensitivity to threats to the economic system help explain the phenomenon.","Ramos, Guilherme; Vieites, Yan; Jacob, Jorge; Andrade, Eduardo B",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,187

Despite their disrupted sources of livelihood, the majority of the African immigrants are without a social welfare safety net and have little hope of benefiting from the Government relief packages. Consequently, it seems that the increase in the triple burden of food insecurity, poverty and malnutrition compounded with social injustice and income inequality is inevitable for the urban poor African immigrants in South Africa. Even though the Government may not have the capacity to address food insecurity by itself, the Government should endeavour to make the limited resources to access food equally available to all with no social injustice. By working hand in hand with foreign national associations, township councillors and other stakeholders, such as the food banks and faith-based organisations, that have stepped forward to try and bridge the widening incapacity of the Government to feed the food insecure, the nexus of food insecurity and social injustice of African immigrants will be alleviated.","Odunitan-Wayas, Feyisayo A; Alaba, Olufunke A; Lambert, Estelle V",Glob Public Health,,187

This research begins by introducing the coronavirus strand and ends with the proposed SmartGate to detect the potential of the virus in patients without human intervention. This is to reduce the manual use of thermometers to measure temperature and to shift the detection to automation. Triz theory principles have been considered in the process of the innovative proposed design of the SmartGate. Implementing the proposed SmartGate in public places such as shopping malls, gardens, schools, supermarkets, etc. will avoid the need for manual measurement and thus reduce exposure to infected people. Furthermore, it aids in identifying infected people in order to guide them to visit the assigned hospitals and prevent the spread of infection. The relational COVID-19 tracking database (RCTD) of possibly infected people can be shared with assigned (to treat COVID-19 patients) local hospital module for further appropriate actions.

The pathophysiology of renal failure in this context is not fully understood, but likely to be multifactorial. The intensive care unit outcomes of patients following COVID-19 acute critical illness with associated AKI have not been fully explored. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the risk factors for acute kidney injury in patients admitted to and intensive care unit with COVID-19, its incidence and associated outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients admitted to our adult intensive care unit suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection from 14th March 2020 until 12th May 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. The outcome analysis was assessed up to date as 3rd of September 2020. RESULTS: A total of 81 patients admitted during this period. All patients had acute hypoxic respiratory failure and needed either noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilatory support. Thirty-six patients (44%) had evidence of AKI (Stage I-33%, Stage II-22%, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)-44%). All patients with AKI stage III had RRT. Age, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, lymphopenia, high D-Dimer levels, increased APACHE II and SOFA scores, invasive mechanical ventilation and use of inotropic or vasopressor support were significantly associated with AKI. The peak AKI was at day 4 and mean duration of RRT was 12.5 days. The mortality was 25% for the AKI group compared to 6.7% in those without AKI. Among those received RRT and survived their illness, the renal function recovery is complete and back to baseline in all patients. CONCLUSION: Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy is common in critically ill patients presenting with COVID-19. It is associated with increased severity of illness on admission to ICU, increased mortality and prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. Recovery of renal function was complete in all survived patients.","Lowe, R; Ferrari, M; Nasim-Mohi, M; Jackson, A; Beecham, R; Veighey, K; Cusack, R; Richardson, D; Grocott, Mpw; Levett, Dzh; Dushianthan, A",BMC Nephrol,,187

The high contagiousness and mortality of COVID-19 and the complete lack of population immunity posed an extraordinary threat for global health. The aim of our research was to collect and review previous experiences on mass vaccination centers. On 4 April 2021, we developed a rapid review searching four electronic databases: PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar and medRxiv. From a total of 2312 papers, 15 of them were included in the current review. Among them, only one article described a COVID-19 vaccination center;all of the others referred to other vaccinations, in particular influenza. The majority were conducted in the United States, and were simulations or single-day experiences to practice a mass vaccination after bioterrorist attacks. Indeed, all of them were published after September 11 attacks. Regarding staff, timing and performance, the data were highly heterogenous. Several studies used as a model the Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Results highlighted the differences around the definition, layout and management of a mass vaccination center, but some aspects can be considered as a core aspect. In light of this, we suggested a potential definition. The current review answers to the urgency of organizing a mass vaccination center during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the most important organizational aspects that should be considered in the planning.","Gianfredi, Vincenza Pennisi Flavia Lume Alessandra Ricciardi Giovanni Emanuele Minerva Massimo Riccò Matteo Odone Anna Signorelli Carlo",Vaccines,,187

Fifty sound extracted premolars were selected and randomly divided into five groups (n = 10 each). Group 1 included sound teeth. In contrast, an AWL was created in all specimens in groups 2 to 5, as follows-Group 2: AWL with no treatment; Group 3: AWL treated with resin infiltration; Group 4: AWL treated with resin infiltration and 5,000 cycles of thermocycling; Group 5: AWL treated with resin infiltration and 10,000 cycles of thermocycling. All specimens were then coated with nail varnish, except for a 4 × 4 mm2 area on the buccal surface (the measurement area), immersed in 2% methylene blue solution, and sectioned buccolingually. Microleakage was evaluated with a stereomicroscope. Data were analyzed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Bonferroni post-hoc correction. Application of resin infiltrant reduced microleakage in AWL. No microleakage was seen in Group 3, and differences between Groups 3, 4, and 5 were not significant (P > 0.05). The resin infiltration technique appears to aid in sealing enamel AWL and may help provide long-term protection against microleakage in enamel AWL.","Klaisiri, Awiruth; Janchum, Suksantiphop; Wongsomtakoon, Kunyakorn; Sirimanathon, Panukorn; Krajangta, Nantawan",J. oral sci,,187

As such, it is challenging to predict the complex hydrological processes and biophysical dynamics. This challenge increases in areas with limited data availability. The key objective of this study was to evaluate the direct integration of remotely sensed Leaf Area Index (LAI) data into a hydrological model to improve streamflow, ET, and crop yield estimates. We also demonstrated how an improved model integrated with remotely sensed LAI data can inform water managers by predicting water productivity (WP) under different irrigation schemes. We took agricultural-dominated San Joaquin Watershed in California, United States, as our testbed and integrated the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m resolution 4-day total LAI data into the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. Results showed that, compared to conventional SWAT model that relies on semi-empirical equations and user inputs for simulating biophysical processes, direct LAI integration into SWAT model (SWAT-LAI) notably captured the actual vegetation dynamics and improved ET and crop yield estimations. The WP simulated by the improved SWAT-LAI model for almond and grape yields varied within a range from 0.363 to 3.81 kg/m3 and 0.32 to 4.76 kg/m3 across different irrigation applications. The outcomes of this study showed that deficit irrigation application could be a viable option in water stressed regions, since it can save a substantial amount of irrigation water and maintain the higher water productivity required for both almond and grape yield production. This study shows an evidence of how remotely sensed data integrated into hydrological models can serve as a decision support tool by providing quantitative information on crop water use and crop production.","Paul, Manashi; Rajib, Adnan; Negahban-Azar, Masoud; Shirmohammadi, Adel; Srivastava, Puneet",Sci Total Environ,,187

However, it is unclear whether these immune signatures are specific to COVID-19 or are merely reflective of illness severity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that human T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens are mediated through interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Methods: We prospectively enrolled a multi-site cohort of patients admitted to the ICU under suspicion for COVID-19 who were then determined to be SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 82) or-negative (n = 97) by RT-PCR. We measured multiple molecular and cellular immune profiles from blood and endotracheal aspirates (ETAs) collected on ICU admission. Our primary analysis tested for associations between IFN-γ and interferon-inducible mediators (CXCL10 and soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1)) in blood or ETAs and SARS-CoV-2 status. We then stratified our cohort into SARS-CoV-2-negative and-positive groups and tested for associations between interferon-inducible mediators and clinical outcomes and SARS-CoV-2-copy-number. We used cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) to simultaneously measure 39 cell surface and intracellular markers on peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from a subset of patients with ARDS. We then compared immune cell signatures in subjects with vs. without SARS-CoV-2. Results: The mean APACHE III score was higher in SARS-CoV-2-negative vs.-positive subjects (80±30 vs. 69±29), but the groups were otherwise well-matched. SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects had higher plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, CXCL10, and sPD-L1 relative to SARSCoV-2-negative patients adjusting for age, sex, and severity of illness (all p ≤ 0.01). The levels of IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, MCP-1, and IL-17A were not significantly different between the two groups. SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects also had higher CXCL10 concentrations in ETAs than SARS-CoV-2-negative subjects. Higher plasma concentrations of CXCL10 and sPD-L1 were associated with higher mortality (Table 1) and more severe respiratory disease (ventilator-free days (VFDs), ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2-positive, but not-negative, patients. In contrast, higher IL-6 was associated with a lower number of VFDs and ARDS in both groups. IFN-γ and CXCL10 (but not IL-6) were associated with SARS-CoV-2-copy-number. Using CyTOF, we found SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects had a lower proportion of CXCR3+ (CXCL10 receptor) T-cells, a higher proportion of PD-L1+ monocytes, and less T-cell and monocyte intracellular cytokine staining vs. SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest interferon-inducible mediator responses and immune cell hypofunction are characteristic of critically ill subjects with SARS-CoV-2 compared with similar patients without SARS-CoV-2. Our identification of immune signatures that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection but are distinct from other forms of critical illness clarifies COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Morrell, E.

478811,Chaperna: linking the ancient RNA and protein worlds,2020,"To combat the rampant spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided Americans with empirically supported preventive behavioral guidelines (e.g., wearing a face mask). However, there is a need to develop behavioral strategies that can effectively increase adherence to these guidelines, especially for young adults, who report particularly poor adherence. Across several domains of prevention science, norms-based interventions have successfully motivated constructive health behavior by correcting normative misperceptions, but these strategies are only relevant when these misperceptions are widespread. We examined the accuracy of young adults' perceptions of peers' adherence to CDC-recommended behavioral guidelines (i.e., perceived social norms) to assess the rationale for employing norm-correcting strategies. Young adult college students (N = 539; Mage = 19.5 years) self-reported their level of adherence to a list of preventive behavioral guidelines and estimated the norms regarding the extent to which other young adults adhered to these guidelines. We measured adherence and perceived norms for each guideline in terms of adherence frequency, ranging from 0 to 100% of the time. We found that young adults, on average, underestimated the extent to which other young adults adhere to each of the recommended preventive behaviors. That is, young adults tended to think that other young adults are failing to adhere to CDC guidelines, whereas our self-reported data showed adherence frequency may be quite high. Moreover, we found positive associations between self-reported adherence and perceptions of others' adherence-that is, those who underestimated others' adherence also self-reported lower adherence to guidelines. Findings from this study establish proof-of-concept for the development of norms-based strategies designed to improve young adults' adherence to preventive behavioral guidelines that are both specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and that prepare for future contagious outbreaks.","Graupensperger, Scott; Lee, Christine M; Larimer, Mary E",J Prim Prev,,187

The review complies with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews and the protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework. In the first six months of the pandemic, there was a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75.4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75.1%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51.5% vs. 41.9% for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9.5% vs. 13.1%), higher discharge rates (80.9% vs. 69.3%), and shorter length of hospital stay (9.3 days vs. 12.2 days). In the first 6 months of the pandemic, antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness. A large proportion of antibiotic prescribing for mild and moderate COVID-19 patients did not have clinical evidence of a bacterial co-infection. Antibiotics may not be beneficial to COVID-19 patients without clinical evidence of a bacterial co-infection.","Cong, Wenjuan Poudel Ak Narayan AIhusein Nour Wang Hexing Yao Guiqing Lambert Helen",Antibiotics,,187

The infected individual may develop symptoms such as high fever, cough, myalgia, lymphopenia, respiratory distress syndrome etc. or remain completely asymptomatic after the incubation period of two to fourteen days. As the virus is transmitted by inhaling infectious respiratory droplets that are produced by sneezing or coughing, so early and rapid diagnosis of the disease can prevent infection and transmission. In the current pandemic situation, the medical industry is looking for new technologies to monitor and control the spread of COVID-19. In this context, the current review article highlights the Artificial Intelligence methods that are playing an effective role in rapid, accurate and early diagnosis of the disease via pattern recognition, machine learning, expert system and fuzzy logic by improving cognitive behavior and reducing human error. Auto-encoder deep learning method, &#945;-satellite, ACEMod and heterogeneous graph auto-encoder are AI approaches that determine the transfer rate of virus and are helpful in shaping public health and planning. In addition, CT scan, X-ray, MRI, and RT-PCR are some of the techniques that are being employed in the identification of COVID-19. We hope using AI techniques, the world can emerge from COVID-19 pandemic while mitigating social and economic crisis.","Zaib, Sumera; Rana, Nehal; Noor, Areeba; Khan, Imtiaz",Curr. med. chem,,187

Italy is one of the most afflicted Country by this epidemic with 136,110 confirmed cases and 16,654 deaths on 9.4.2020 (at the same date, the Ministry of Health was reporting 143,626 cases). During these few months the National Health Service have made a great effort to cope with the increasing request of intensive care beds and all the elective activities in hospital have been suspended. Data from the different Italian regions shows different patterns of positive and dead for this syndrome. Moreover, striking differences of the observed lethality of the infections among different areas were immediately evident from the epidemic reports.

516852,Clustering and classification of virus sequence through music communication protocol and wavelet transform,2020,"[ABSTRACT]. An “infodemic” is defined as “an overabundance of information – some accurate and some not – occurring during an epidemic”. This paper describes the characteristics of an infodemic, which combines an inordinately high volume of information (leading to problems relating to locating the information, storage capacity, ensuring quality, visibility and validity) and rapid output (making it hard to assess its value, manage the gatekeeping process, apply results, track its history, and leading to a waste of effort). This is bound up with the collateral growth of misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Solutions to the problems posed by an infodemic will be sought in improved technology and changed social and regulatory frameworks. One solution could be a new trusted top-level domain for health information. The World Health Organization has so far made two unsuccessful attempts to create such a domain, but it is suggested this could be attempted again, in the light of the COVID-19 infodemic experience. The vital role of reliable information in public health should also be explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals, with explicit targets. All countries should develop knowledge preparedness plans for future emergencies.","Zielinski, Chris",Rev. panam. salud pública,,187

590220,"Prevalence of feline coronavirus antibodies in cats in Bursa province, Turkey, by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay",2009-06-26,"This study presents data from a prospective study of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Of 493 patients included in the study, 223 (45.2%) were aged ≥ 65 years, and 265 (53.7%) had one or more underlying diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus or dementia. In total, 281 microorganisms were identified in 250 (50.7%) patients, with two or more pathogens detected in 28 (5.7%) cases. Microbial diagnosis varied according to age, severity, co-morbidity and site-of-care, but there was much overlap among groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most prevalent organism in outpatients, patients admitted to hospital, and patients who died, either as a single pathogen or combined with another organism. Infections caused by ‘atypical’ pathogens were seen across all groups, including the elderly and patients with co-morbidities. Mortality varied according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI) of the pneumonia patient outcomes research team. Shock (OR 34.48), an age of > 65 years (OR 25) and altered mental status (OR 9.92) were factors associated independently with 30-day mortality. Key findings from this study were the advanced age of the population with CAP, and the high prevalence of dementia as an underlying disease. The study also revealed that microbiological diagnosis of CAP remains problematic. Although certain epidemiological features may help to predict the microbial aetiology, the overlap among groups reduces the usefulness of this information in guiding therapeutic decisions. Greater effort should be made to improve identification methods for microbial pathogens causing CAP.","Gutiérrez, F.; Masiá, M.; Rodríguez, J.C.; Mirete, C.; Soldán, B.; Padilla, S.; Hernández, I.; Ory, F.

DESIGN: Systematic literature review. DATA SOURCES AND ELIGIBILITY: Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PubMed Central and grey literature through ProQuest, The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, COVID-Evidence and speech pathology national bodies were searched up until August 13(th), 2020 for articles examining the aerosol-generating activities in clinical voice and speech assessment and intervention within speech pathology. RESULTS: Of the 8288 results found, 39 studies were included for data extraction and analysis. Included articles were classified into one of three categories: research studies, review articles or clinical guidelines. Data extraction followed appropriate protocols depending on the classification of each article (e.g. PRISMA for review articles). Articles were assessed for risk of bias and certainty of evidence using the GRADE system. Six behaviours were identified as aerosol generating. These were classified into three categories: vegetative acts (coughing, breathing), verbal communication activities of daily living (speaking, loud voicing), and performance-based tasks (singing, sustained phonation). Certainty of evidence ranged from very low to moderate with variation in research design and variables. CONCLUSIONS: This body of literature helped to both identify and categorise the aerosol-generating behaviours involved in speech pathology clinical practice and confirm the low level of evidence throughout the speech pathology literature pertaining to aerosol generation. As many aerosol-generating behaviours are common human behaviours, these findings can be applied across healthcare and community settings.

The plethora of clinical presentations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been described extensively, of which olfactory dysfunction (OD) was established as an important and common extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The aim of this protocol is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on peer-reviewed articles which described clinical data of OD in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This research protocol has been prospectively registered with the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42020196202). CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PubMed, as well as Chinese medical databases China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and WANFANG, will be searched using keywords including ‘COVID-19’, ‘coronavirus disease’, ‘2019-nCoV’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘novel coronavirus’, ‘anosmia’, ‘hyposmia’, ‘loss of smell’, and ‘olfactory dysfunction’. Systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Meta-analyses Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Articles will be screened according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria to extract studies that include new clinical data investigating the effect of COVID-19 on olfactory dysfunction. Included articles will be reviewed in full; data including patient demographics, clinical characteristics of COVID-19-related OD, methods of olfactory assessment and relevant clinical outcomes will be extracted. Statistical analyses will be performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will aim to collate and synthesise all available clinical evidence regarding COVID-19-related OD as an important neurosensory dysfunction of COVID-19 infection. A comprehensive search strategy and screening process will be conducted to incorporate broad clinical data for robust statistical analyses and representation. The outcome of the systematic review and meta-analysis will aim to improve our understanding of the symptomatology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19-related OD and identify knowledge gaps in its disease process, which will guide future research in this specific neurosensory defect.

591320,Metagenomic analysis of the RNA fraction of the fecal virome indicates high diversity in pigs infected by porcine endemic diarrhea virus in the United States,2018-05-25,"The SARS coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 as a zoonotic virus highly transmissible between humans that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic 1,2. This pandemic has the potential to disrupt healthcare globally and has already caused high levels of mortality, especially amongst the elderly. The overall case fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated to be ∼2.3% overall 3 and 32.3% in hospitalized patients age 70-79 years 4. Therapeutic options for treating the underlying viremia in COVID-19 are presently limited by a lack of effective SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs, although steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment can be helpful. A variety of potential antiviral targets for SARS-CoV-2 have been considered including the spike protein and replicase. Based upon previous successful antiviral drug development for HIV-1 and hepatitis C, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) appears an attractive target for drug development. Here we show the existing pharmacopeia contains many drugs with potential for therapeutic repurposing as selective and potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We screened a collection of ∼6,070 drugs with a previous history of use in humans for compounds that inhibit the activity of Mpro in vitro. In our primary screen we found ∼50 compounds with activity against Mpro (overall hit rate <0.75%). Subsequent dose validation studies demonstrated 8 dose responsive hits with an IC50 ≤ 50 μM. Hits from our screen are enriched with hepatitis C NS3/4A protease targeting drugs including Boceprevir (IC50=0.95 μM), Ciluprevir (20.77μM). Narlaprevir (IC50=1.10μM), and Telaprevir (15.25μM). These results demonstrate that some existing approved drugs can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and that screen saturation of all approved drugs is both feasible and warranted. Taken together this work suggests previous large-scale commercial drug development initiatives targeting hepatitis C NS3/4A viral protease should be revisited because some previous lead compounds may be more potent against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than Boceprevir and suitable for rapid repurposing.","Baker, Jeremy D.; Uhrich, Rikki L.; Kraemer, Gerald C.; Love, Jason E.; Kraemer, Brian C.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.197889,187

For improving the knowledge about the pandemic consequences for cancer care, this article aims to identify the effects of mitigation strategies developed to reduce the impact of such delays and disruptions. METHODS: Systematic review with a comprehensive search including formal databases, cancer and COVID-19 data sources, gray literature, and manual search. We considered clinical trials, observational longitudinal studies, cross-sectional studies, before-and-after studies, case series, and case studies. The selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by specific tools. The mitigation strategies identified were described in detail and their effects were summarized narratively. RESULTS: Of 6,692 references reviewed, 28 were deemed eligible, and 9 studies with low to moderate methodological quality were included. Five multiple strategies and four single strategies were reported, and the possible effects of mitigating delays and disruptions in cancer care because of COVID-19 are inconsistent. The only comparative study reported a 48.7% reduction observed in the number of outpatient visits to the hospital accompanied by a small reduction in imaging and an improvement in radiation treatments after the implementation of a multiple organizational strategy. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize the infrequency of measuring and reporting mitigation strategies that specifically address patients' outcomes and thus a scarcity of high-quality evidence to inform program development. This review reinforces the need of adopting standardized measurement methods to monitor the impact of the mitigation strategies proposed to reduce the effects of delays and disruptions in cancer health care because of COVID-19.","Pacheco, Rafael Leite; Martimbianco, Ana Luiza Cabrera; Roitberg, Felipe; Ilbawi, Andre; Riera, Rachel",JCO Glob Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33656910/; https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00632,187

The medical profession has been on the front lines of this rapidly developing situation, which in turn has called for unprecedented changes in the medical school curriculum. These changes have severe implications for medical students interested in applying to competitive surgical specialties like orthopedics. METHODS: As medical students in 3 different class years pursuing orthopedic surgery, we provide our perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 has had on medical student orthopedic education. RESULTS: With the removal of away rotations and a shift to virtual interviews, rising fourth year medical students are arguably the most impacted as they prepare for the orthopedic residency application process. Third year students, who are in the exploratory phase of choosing a specialty, also face uncertainties in the shift to a “new” clerkship experience that may (1) be of shorter duration, (2) implement shifts to limit overcrowding of clinical space, and (3) increase the use of telehealth over direct patient contact. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the course of medical students’ orthopedic education in unprecedented ways. We believe the following suggestions may be helpful for students seeking alternative, supplemental ways of learning: (1) read up on major orthopedic journals, (2) reach out to orthopedic surgeons in areas of interest, (3) reach out to program directors/medical clerkship directors/program coordinators for opportunities to attend their educational curriculum virtually, (4) attend online lectures and hospital grand rounds, and (5) practice suturing technique with a practice kit. CONCLUSIONS: While the medical education landscape remains uncertain amid the evolving conditions of COVID-19, as medical students we strive to learn from this pandemic and respond to future unforeseen challenges with resilience, dedication, and compassion: all qualities we admire in orthopedic surgeons.","Richardson, Michelle A.; Islam, Wasif; Magruder, Matthew",Geriatr Orthop Surg Rehabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083098/; https://doi.org/10.1177/2151459320951721,187

It has become even more challenging in the context of COVID-19 restrictions that have led to drastic changes in family life. Based on the results of a qualitative interpretive descriptive study that aimed to understand the experiences of immigrants living in apartment buildings in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, this paper reports the experiences of 50 immigrant parents. During the summer and fall of 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted by phone or virtually, audio-recorded, then translated and transcribed. The transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results revealed that parenting experiences during the pandemic entailed dealing with changing relationships, coping with added burdens and pressures, living in persistent fear and anxiety, and rethinking lifestyles and habits. Amid these changes and challenges, some parents managed to create opportunities for their children to improve their diet, take a break from their rushed lives, get in touch with their cultural and linguistic backgrounds, and spend more quality time with their family. While immigrant parents exhibit remarkable resilience in dealing with the pandemic-related meso and macro-levels restrictions, funding and programs are urgently needed to support them in addressing the impact of these at the micro level.","Guruge, Sepali; Lamaj, Paula; Lee, Charlotte; Ronquillo, Charlene Esteban; Sidani, Souraya; Leung, Ernest; Ssawe, Andrew; Altenberg, Jason; Amanzai, Hasina; Morrison, Lynn",AIMS Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2021013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33575415/,187

594393,Detection of feline coronaviruses by culture and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of blood samples from healthy cats and cats with clinical feline infectious peritonitis,1998-07-01,"Abstract Nine neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), each of which react with the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of the Beaudette C strain of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), have been used in competitive binding assays to delineate three non-overlapping antigenic sites A, B and C. Epitopes within these sites have been identified on the basis of cross-reactivity of MAb-resistant mutants against the panel of MAbs, determined by plaque assays and Western blotting. Site A contains three non-overlapping epitopes (A1, A2 and A3). A1 is the only linear epitope; all remaining epitopes are conformational. MAbs which react with epitopes A2 and A3 inhibit neuraminidase activity (NA) when assayed with neuraminlactose. Site B contains three partially overlapping epitopes (B1, B2 and B3) and site C is represented by a single epitope (C1). HN gene sequence analysis of MAb-resistant mutants showed that they each had only single amino acid substitutions which range from amino acid residues 347–460 for site A, 284–325 for site B, and at 481 for the Cl epitope. The apparent molecular mass of the HN glycoprotein of one mutant was increased from 72 to 75 kDa. This correlates well with the creation of an additional potential glycosylation site in this mutant from Asn-Ser-Pro(325) to Asn-Ser-Ser(325).","Yusoff, Khatijah; Nesbit, Mark; McCartney, Hazel; Emmerson, Peter T.; Samson, Anthony C.R.",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170288900056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2464879/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170288900056,187

After the intestinal microbiome, that of the oral cavity is the largest and most diversified. Its importance is reflected not only in local and systemic diseases, but also in pregnancy since it would seem to influence the placental microbiome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a literature review of articles published in PubMed about Fusobacterium Nucleatum and both its implications with systemic and oral health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, flavors perception and its interference in the oral-nasal mucosal immunity. RESULTS It is in maintaining the microbiome's homeostasis that the Fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic periodontal pathogen of the oral cavity, plays a crucial role both as a bridge microorganism of the tongue biofilm, and in maintaining the balance between the different species in the oral-nasal mucosal immunity also by taste receptors interaction. It is also involved in the flavor perception and its detection in the oral microbiome of children from the first days of life suggests a possible physiological role. However, the dysbiosis can determine its pathogenicity with local and systemic consequences, including the pathogenesis of respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS It is interesting to evaluate its possible correlation with Sars-CoV-2 and the consequences on the microflora of the oral cavity, both to promote a possible broad-spectrum preventive action, in favor of all subjects for whom, by promoting the eubiosis of the oral microbiome, a defensive action could be envisaged by the commensals themselves but, above all, for patients with specific comorbidities and therefore already prone to oral dysbiosis.","Dessì, A; Bosco, A; Pintus, R; Orrù, G; Fanos, V",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34286500/; https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202107_26251,187

Such complications can worsen gas exchange and the overall prognosis in critical patients. The aim of this study is to investigate what predisposing factors are related to pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in SARS-CoV2-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), what symptoms may predict a severe and potentially fatal complication and what therapeutical approach may provide a better outcome. Methods: In this single center cohort study, we recorded data from 45 critically ill COVID-19 patients who developed one or more complicating events among pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema and pneumothorax. All patients showed ARDS and underwent non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at baseline. Patients with mild to moderate ARDS and pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax (n = 25) received High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC), while patients with severe ARDS and pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax underwent HFNC (n = 10) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (n = 10). Results: Pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax developed in 10.5% of subjects affected by SARS-coV2-ARDS. Dyspnea affected 40% and cough affected 37% of subjects. High resolution computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities (GGO) in 100% of subjects. Traction bronchiolectasis, reticulation, crazy paving and distortion were observed in 64%. Furthermore, 36% showed subcutaneous emphysema. Non-severe ARDS cases received HFNC, and 76% patients recovered from pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax over a median follow up of 5 days. Among severe ARDS cases the recovery rate of pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax was 70% with the HFNC approach, and 10% with IMV. Conclusion: HFNC is a safe and effective ventilatory approach for critical COVID-19 and has a positive role in associated complications such as pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax.","Simioli, Francesca; Annunziata, Anna; Polistina, Giorgio Emanuele; Coppola, Antonietta; Di Spirito, Valentina; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34067404/,187
594525,Molecular analysis of carnivore Protoparvovirus detected in white blood cells of naturally infected cats,2018-02-05,"Human Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection activates a complex interaction host/virus, leading to the reprogramming of the host metabolism aimed at the energy supply for viral replication. Alterations of the host metabolic homeostasis strongly influence the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, forming the basis of a wide range of outcomes, from the asymptomatic infection to the onset of COVID-19 and up to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome, vascular dysfunction, multiple organ failure, and death. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms associated with the individual susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection calls for a system biology approach; this strategy can address multiple goals, including which patients will respond effectively to the therapeutic treatment. The power of metabolomics lies in the ability to recognize endogenous and exogenous metabolites within a biological sample, measuring their concentration, and identifying perturbations of biochemical pathways associated with qualitative and quantitative metabolic changes. Over the last year, a limited number of metabolomics- and lipidomics-based clinical studies in COVID-19 patients have been published and are discussed in this review. Remarkable alterations in the lipid and amino acid metabolism depict the molecular phenotype of subjects infected by SARS-CoV-2; notably, structural and functional data on the lipids-virus interaction may open new perspectives on targeted therapeutic interventions. Several limitations affect most metabolomics-based studies, slowing the routine application of metabolomics. However, moving metabolomics from bench to bedside cannot imply the mere determination of a given metabolite panel; rather, slotting metabolomics into clinical practice requires the conversion of metabolic patient-specific data into actionable clinical applications.","Mussap, Michele; Fanos, Vassilios",Clin. chem. lab. med,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2021-0414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34332518/,187
594766,Expression profile analysis of 5-day-old neonatal piglets infected with porcine Deltacoronavirus,2019-04-16,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is straining health care systems globally. The burden on hospitals during the pandemic could be reduced by implementing prediction models that can discriminate patients who require hospitalization from those who do not. The COVID-19 vulnerability (C-19) index, a model that predicts which patients will be admitted to hospital for treatment of pneumonia or pneumonia proxies, has been developed and proposed as a valuable tool for decision-making during the pandemic. However, the model is at high risk of bias according to the “prediction model risk of bias assessment” criteria, and it has not been externally validated. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to externally validate the C-19 index across a range of health care settings to determine how well it broadly predicts hospitalization due to pneumonia in COVID-19 cases. METHODS: We followed the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) framework for external validation to assess the reliability of the C-19 index. We evaluated the model on two different target populations, 41,381 patients who presented with SARS-CoV-2 at an outpatient or emergency department visit and 9,429,285 patients who presented with influenza or related symptoms during an outpatient or emergency department visit, to predict their risk of hospitalization with pneumonia during the following 0-30 days. In total, we validated the model across a network of 14 databases spanning the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. RESULTS: The internal validation performance of the C-19 index had a C statistic of 0.73, and the calibration was not reported by the authors. When we externally validated it by transporting it to SARS-CoV-2 data, the model obtained C statistics of 0.36, 0.53 (0.473-0.584) and 0.56 (0.488-0.636) on Spanish, US, and South Korean data sets, respectively. The calibration was poor, with the model underestimating risk. When validated on 12 data sets containing influenza patients across the OHDSI network, the C statistics ranged between 0.40 and 0.68. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the discriminative performance of the C-19 index model is low for influenza cohorts and even worse among patients with COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, and South Korea. These results suggest that C-19 should not be used to aid decision-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the importance of performing external validation across a range of settings, especially when a prediction model is being extrapolated to a different population. In the field of prediction, extensive validation is required to create appropriate trust in a model.","Reps, Jenna M; Kim, Chungsoo; Williams, Ross D; Markus, Aniek F; Yang, Cynthia; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Falconer, Thomas; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Williams, Andrew; Fernández-Bertolín, Sergio; DuVall, Scott L; Kostka, Kristin; Rao, Gowtham; Shoaibi, Azza; Ostropolets, Anna; Spotnitz, Matthew E; Zhang, Lin; Casajust, Paula; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Nyberg, Fredrik; Kaas-Hansen, Benjamin Skov; Choi, Young Hwa; Morales, Daniel; Liaw, Siaw-Teng; Abrahão, Maria Tereza Fernandes; Areia, Carlos; Matheny, Michael E; Lynch, Kristine E; Aragón, María; Park, Rae Woong; Hripcsak, George; Reich, Christian G; Suchard, Marc A; You, Seng Chan; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Rijnbeek, Peter R",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33661754/; https://doi.org/10.2196/21547,187

The content draws largely on the guidance developed by the Royal College of Obstetricians (RCOG) and the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), as well as specific guidance on infection prevention and control measures from Public Health England. The key areas addressed are: • Testing of pregnant women prior to and on admission for labour and birth; • Overall approaches to intrapartum care for women with and without symptoms of COVID-19; • Timing, place and type of birth considerations; • Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during labour and birth, for staff, women and birth supporters; • Use of birthing pools and waterbirth; • Fetal monitoring. • Immediate care of the newborn and support for breastfeeding. The chapter refers to some of the ways in which the guidance was translated in practice. The guidance was developed using a rapid analysis approach to emerging research and evidence, along with evidence from previous experiences of Coronaviruses, combined with consensus expert opinion from all key professions providing maternity care in the UK. What is known. The UK RCOG/RCM COVID-19 guidance was widely accepted across the UK maternity services and across the world as a reliable and credible source of information to shape care during the pandemic. What is not known. The full impact of the pandemic on the experiences and outcomes for women and babies of pregnancy, childbirth and early parenting in the UK.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common renal disorder of various etiologies characterized by a sudden and sustained decrease of renal function. Studies have shown that 5–46% of COVID-19 patients develop AKI during hospital stay, and the mortality of those patients may reach up to 100% depending on various factors, such as organ failures and RRT requirement. Catechins are natural products that have multiple pharmacological activities, including anti-coronavirus and reno-protective activities against kidney injury induced by nephrotoxic agents, obstructive nephropathies and AKI accompanying metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the anti-SARS-CoV-2 and reno-protective effects of catechins from a mechanistic perspective. We believe that catechins may serve as promising therapeutics in COVID-19-associated AKI due to their well-recognized anti-SARS-CoV-2, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that mediate their reno-protective activities.","Diniz, Lúcio Ricardo Leite; Elshabrawy, Hatem A.; Souza, Marilia Trindade de Santana; Duarte, Allana Brunna Sucupira; Datta, Sabarno; de Sousa, Damião Pergentino",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34641495/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26195951,187

However, the source of those T cells has been speculative. Using human blood samples derived before the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered in 2019, we mapped 142 T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 genome to facilitate precise interrogation of the SARS-CoV-2–specific CD4(+) T cell repertoire. We demonstrate a range of preexisting memory CD4(+) T cells that are cross-reactive with comparable affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold coronaviruses human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.

Although vaccines provide the most effective means for preventing infectious diseases, there are two main reasons why it is often difficult to reach a socially optimal level of vaccine coverage: (i) the emergence of operational issues (such as yield uncertainty) on the supply side, and (ii) the existence of negative network effects on the consumption side. In particular, uncertainties about production yield and vaccine imperfections often make manufacturing some vaccines a risky process and may lead the manufacturer to produce below the socially optimal level. At the same time, negative network effects provide incentives to potential consumers to free ride off the immunity of the vaccinated population. In this research, we consider how a central policy-maker can induce a socially optimal vaccine coverage through the use of incentives to both consumers and the vaccine manufacturer. We consider a monopoly market for an imperfect vaccine; we show that a fixed two-part subsidy is unable to coordinate the market, but derive a two-part menu of subsidies that leads to a socially efficient level of coverage.","Adida, Elodie; Dey, Debabrata; Mamani, Hamed",Eur J Oper Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713004335; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377221713004335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288068/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.05.034,187

Although most randomized controlled trials have shown negative results, uncontrolled studies have suggested that the antibody content could influence patient outcomes. We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled trial of convalescent plasma for adults with COVID-19 receiving oxygen within 12 d of respiratory symptom onset ( NCT04348656 ). Patients were allocated 2:1 to 500 ml of convalescent plasma or standard of care. The composite primary outcome was intubation or death by 30 d. Exploratory analyses of the effect of convalescent plasma antibodies on the primary outcome was assessed by logistic regression. The trial was terminated at 78% of planned enrollment after meeting stopping criteria for futility. In total, 940 patients were randomized, and 921 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Intubation or death occurred in 199/614 (32.4%) patients in the convalescent plasma arm and 86/307 (28.0%) patients in the standard of care arm-relative risk (RR) = 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.43, P = 0.18).

Previous studies projected indirect mortality by modelling how hypothesised disruptions in health services will affect health outcomes. We provide alternative projections, relying on modelling the relationship between aggregate income shocks and mortality. DESIGN: We construct a sample of 5.2 million births by pooling retrospective birth histories reported by women in Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in 83 low-income and middle-income countries between 1985 and 2018. We employ regression models with country-specific fixed-effects and flexible time trends to estimate the impact of gross domestic product per capita on infant mortality rate. We then use growth projections by the International Monetary Fund to predict the effect of the economic downturn in 2020 on infant mortality. RESULTS: We estimate 267 208 (95% CI 112 000 to 422 415) excess infant deaths in 128 countries, corresponding to a 6.8% (95% CI 2.8% to 10.7%) increase in the total number of infant deaths expected in 2020.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Chest CT scans of patients with clinically–epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 were retrieved from an open-source MosMedData data set, randomised, and independently assigned COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades by an abdominal radiology fellow, thoracic imaging fellow and a consultant cardiothoracic radiologist. The inter- and intraobserver agreement of the two systems were assessed using the Fleiss’ and Cohen’s κ coefficients, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 200 studies were included in the analysis. Both systems demonstrated moderate interobserver agreement, with κ values of 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46–0.56] and 0.55 (95% CI: 0.50–0.59) for COVID-RADS and CO-RADS, respectively. When COVID-RADS and CO-RADS grades were dichotomised at cut-off values of 2B and 4 to evaluate the agreement between grades representing different levels of clinical suspicion for COVID-19, the interobserver agreement became substantial with κ values of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.66–0.82) for COVID-RADS and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65–0.81) for CO-RADS. The median intraobserver agreement was considerably higher for CO-RADS reaching 0.81 (95% CI: 0.43–0.76) compared with 0.60 (95% CI: 0.43–0.76) of COVID-RADS.

The disease has affected more than 200 countries, and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications. OBJECTIVE: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the Brazilian population’s basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify scientifically proven information. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020, across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (ie, the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged ≥18 years) were recruited through social networking platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distributions, frequencies, and similarities or dissimilarities between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. The significance level for all statistical tests was less than .05. RESULTS: A total of 4180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. The region, education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (P<.001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher education levels, nonrecipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, Brazilians with social media access have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19 but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup. Due to the limitation of the platform used in carrying out the study, care should be taken when generalizing the study findings to populations with less education or who are not used to accessing social networking platforms.","Guimarães, Vinícius Henrique Almeida; de Oliveira-Leandro, Maísa; Cassiano, Carolina; Marques, Anna Laura Piantino; Motta, Clara; Freitas-Silva, Ana Letícia; de Sousa, Marlos Aureliano Dias; Silveira, Luciano Alves Matias; Pardi, Thiago César; Gazotto, Fernanda Castro; Silva, Marcos Vinícius; Rodrigues Jr, Virmondes; Rodrigues, Wellington Francisco; Oliveira, Carlo Jose Freire",JMIR Public Health Surveill,https://doi.org/10.2196/24756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400684/,187

Common data models and federated data networks offer a potential solution to many of these problems. The open-source Observational and Medical Outcomes Partnerships (OMOP) common data model standardises the structure, format, and terminologies of otherwise disparate datasets, enabling the execution of common analytical code across a federated data network in which only code and aggregate results are shared. While common data models are increasingly used in regulatory decision making, relatively little attention has been given to their use in health technology assessment (HTA). We show that the common data model has the potential to facilitate access to relevant data, enable multidatabase studies to enhance statistical power and transfer results across populations and settings to meet the needs of local HTA decision makers, and validate findings. The use of open-source and standardised analytics improves transparency and reduces coding errors, thereby increasing confidence in the results. Further engagement from the HTA community is required to inform the appropriate standards for mapping data to the common data model and to design tools that can support evidence generation and decision making.","Kent, Seamus; Burn, Edward; Dawoud, Dalia; Jonsson, Pall; Østby, Jens Torup; Hughes, Nigel; Rijnbeek, Peter; Bouvy, Jacoline C.",Pharmacoeconomics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40273-020-00981-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336320/,187
603332,Reprint of: Coronavirus reverse genetic systems: Infectious clones and replicons(),2014-12-19,"Viruses are widely used as vectors for heterologous gene expression in cultured cells or natural hosts, and therefore a large number of viruses with exogenous sequences inserted into their genomes have been engineered. Many of these engineered viruses are viable and express heterologous proteins at high levels, but the inserted sequences often prove to be unstable over time and are rapidly lost, limiting heterologous protein expression. Although virologists are aware that inserted sequences can be unstable, processes leading to insert instability are rarely considered from an evolutionary perspective. Here, we review experimental work on the stability of inserted sequences over a broad range of viruses, and we present some theoretical considerations concerning insert stability. Different virus genome organizations strongly impact insert stability, and factors such as the position of insertion can have a strong effect. In addition, we argue that insert stability not only depends on the characteristics of a particular genome, but that it will also depend on the host environment and the demography of a virus population. The interplay between all factors affecting stability is complex, which makes it challenging to develop a general model to predict the stability of genomic insertions. We highlight key questions and future directions, finding that insert stability is a surprisingly complex problem and that there is need for mechanism-based, predictive models. Combining theoretical models with experimental tests for stability under varying conditions can lead to improved engineering of viral modified genomes, which is a valuable tool for understanding genome evolution as well as for biotechnological applications, such as gene therapy.","Willemsen, Anouk; Zwart, Mark P",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31741748/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vez045,187

Two mitochondrial genes for proteins that are part of the electron transport chain that generates ATP, ND4 and CO II, were up-regulated after VV infection. Up-regulation of ND4 level by VV infection was confirmed by Western blotting analysis. Up-regulation of ND4 was reduced by the MAPK inhibitor, apigenin, which has been demonstrated elsewhere to inhibit VV replication. The induction of ND4 expression occurred after viral DNA replication since ara C, an inhibitor of poxviral DNA replication, could block this induction. ATP production was increased in the host cells after VV infection. Moreover, 4.5 μM oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP production, reduced the ATP level 13 hr after virus infection to that of mock-infected cells and inhibited viral protein expression and virus production, suggesting that increased ATP production is required for efficient VV production. Our results further suggest that induction of ND4 expression is through a Bcl-2 independent pathway.","Chang, Chia-Wei; Li, Hui-Chun; Hsu, Che-Fang; Chang, Chiao-Yen; Lo, Shih-Yen",J Biomed Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-16-80; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19725950/,187

603809,Baculovirus Display: A Multifunctional Technology for Gene Delivery and Eukaryotic Library Development,2006-09-22,"Rotaviruses (RVs) are a leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis in young children and livestock worldwide. Growing evidence suggests that host cellular glycans, such as histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and sialic acids (SA), are recognized by the RV surface protein VP4. However, a mechanistic understanding of these interactions and their effects on RV infection and pathogenesis is lacking. Here, we established a porcine crypt-derived 3D intestinal enteroids (PIEs) culture system which contains all intestinal epithelial cells identified in vivo and represents a unique physiologically functional model to study RV-glycan interactions in vitro. PIEs expressing different HBGAs (A+, H+, and A+/H+) were established and isolation, propagation, differentiation and RV infection conditions were optimized. Differentiated PIEs were infected with human RV (HRV) G1P[8] Wa, porcine RV (PRV) G9P[13], PRV Gottfried G4P[6] or PRV OSU G5P[7] virulent and attenuated strains and virus replication was measured by qRT-PCR. Our results indicated that virulent HRV G1P[8] Wa replicated to the highest titers in A(+) PIEs, while a distinct trend was observed for PRV G9P[13] or G5P[7] with highest titers in H(+) PIEs. Attenuated Wa and Gottfried strains replicated poorly in PIEs while the replication of attenuated G9P[13] and OSU strains in PIEs was relatively efficient. However, the replication of all 4 attenuate strains was less affected by the PIE HBGA phenotypes. HBGA synthesis inhibitor 2-F-Peracetyl-Fucose (2F) treatment demonstrated that HBGAs are essential for G1P[8] Wa replication; however, they may only serve as a cofactor for PRVs G9P[13] and OSU G5P[7]. Interestingly, contrasting outcomes were observed following sialidase treatment which significantly enhanced G9P[13] replication, but inhibited the growth of G5P[7]. These observations suggest that some additional receptors recognized by G9P[13] become unmasked after removal of terminal SA. Overall, our results confirm that differential HBGAs-RV and SA-RV interactions determine replication efficacy of virulent group A RVs in PIEs. Consequently, targeting individual glycans for development of therapeutics may not yield uniform results for various RV strains.","Guo, Yusheng; Candelero-Rueda, Rosario Adriana; Saif, Linda Jean; Vlasova, Anastasia Nickolaevna",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513201/,187

CIM is commonly perceived as safer, less expensive, and more culturally acceptable. There is a growing body of evidence to support the use of CIM, especially mind-body therapies, diet and nutritional supplements used for mental disorders of aging. RECENT FINDINGS: We summarize the results of the recent clinical trials and meta-analyses that provide the evidence for the role of CIM in treating older adults with mood or cognitive disorders that includes the use of diet and supplements, and mind-body therapies. SUMMARY: Dietary and mind-body therapies have become increasingly popular and show the strongest evidence of efficacy for mood and cognitive disorders. Although the use of vitamins and supplements is the most popular CIM practice, only mixed evidence supports their use with additional concerns for herb (supplement)-drug interactions.

One of the unsolved scientific questions of SARS-CoV-2 is the animal origin of this virus. Bats and pangolins are recognized as the most probable reservoir hosts that harbour highly similar SARS-CoV-2 related viruses (SARSr-CoV-2). This study identified a novel lineage of SARSr-CoVs, including RaTG15 and seven other viruses, from bats at the same location where we found RaTG13 in 2015. Although RaTG15 and the related viruses share 97.2% amino acid sequence identities with SARS-CoV-2 in the conserved ORF1b region, it only shows less than 77.6% nucleotide identity to all known SARSr-CoVs at the genome level, thus forming a distinct lineage in the Sarbecovirus phylogenetic tree. We found that the RaTG15 receptor-binding domain (RBD) can bind to ACE2 from Rhinolophus affinis, Malayan pangolin, and use it as an entry receptor, except for ACE2 from humans. However, it contains a short deletion and has different key residues responsible for ACE2 binding. In addition, we showed that none of the known viruses in bat SARSr-CoV-2 lineage discovered uses human ACE2 as efficiently as the pangolin-derived SARSr-CoV-2 or some viruses in the SARSr-CoV-1 lineage. Therefore, further systematic and longitudinal studies in bats are needed to prevent future spillover events caused by SARSr-CoVs or to understand the origin of SARS-CoV-2 better.","Guo, Hua; Hu, Ben; Si, Hao-Rui; Zhu, Yan; Zhang, Wei; Li, Bei; Li, Ang; Geng, Rong; Lin, Hao-Feng; Yang, Xing-Lou; Zhou, Peng; Shi, Zheng-Li",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1956373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34263709/,187

Despite the presence of different COVID-19 vaccines, the discovery of proper antiviral therapeutics is an urgent necessity. Nature is considered as a historical trove for drug discovery, especially in global crises. During our efforts to discover potential anti-SARS CoV-2 natural therapeutics, screening our in-house natural products and plant crude extracts library led to the identification of C. benedictus extract as a promising candidate. To find out the main chemical constituents responsible for the extract’s antiviral activity, we utilized recently reported SARS CoV-2 structural information in comprehensive in silico investigations (e.g., ensemble docking and physics-based molecular modeling). As a result, we constructed protein–protein and protein–compound interaction networks that suggest cnicin as the most promising anti-SARS CoV-2 hit that might inhibit viral multi-targets. The subsequent in vitro validation confirmed that cnicin could impede the viral replication of SARS CoV-2 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC(50) value of 1.18 µg/mL. Furthermore, drug-like property calculations strongly recommended cnicin for further in vivo and clinical experiments.

Implications of so-called ‘Long Covid’ on neurological services and primary care and similarities with other neurological disorders are discussed. METHODS: Firstly, a systematic overview of current reviews of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 was conducted. Secondly, the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect on neurological services and the similarities in the experience of patients with COVID-19 and those with other neurological disorders. A total of 45 systematic reviews were identified within seven databases, published between 11 April 2020 and 15 October 2020, following a search in June 2020, updated on 20 October 2020. RESULTS: The results indicated that COVID-19 exhibits two types of neurological symptoms; life-threatening symptoms such as Guillain–Barre Syndrome (GBS) and encephalitis, and less devastating symptoms such as fatigue and myalgia. Many of these so-called lesser symptoms appear to be emerging as longer-term for some sufferers and have been recently labelled Long Covid. When compared, these less devastating symptoms are very similar to other neurological conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and functional neurological disorder (FND).

The theory predicts an inverse relationship between the power law exponent and the speed of the lockdown that is validated by the observed COVID-19 data across different countries.","Vazquez, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160531; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.23.20160531v1?rss=1,187
608494,Targeting of Moloney murine leukemia virus gag precursor to the site of virus budding,1996-12-02,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The present article reviews the state of the art of metronomic chemotherapy use to treat the principal types of cancers, namely breast, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal ones, and of the most recent progresses in understanding the underlying mechanisms of action. Areas of novelty, in terms of new regimens, new types of cancer suitable for Metronomic chemotherapy (mCHT) and the overview of current ongoing trials, along with a critical review of them, are also provided. ABSTRACT: Metronomic chemotherapy treatment (mCHT) refers to the chronic administration of low doses chemotherapy that can sustain prolonged, and active plasma levels of drugs, producing favorable tolerability and it is a new promising therapeutic approach in solid and in hematologic tumors. mCHT has not only a direct effect on tumor cells, but also an action on cell microenvironment, by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, or promoting immune response and for these reasons can be considered a multi-target therapy itself. Here we review the state of the art of mCHT use in some classical tumour types, such as breast and no small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), see what is new regarding most recent data in different cancer types, such as glioblastoma (GBL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and new drugs with potential metronomic administration. Finally, a look at the strategic use of mCHT in the context of health emergencies, or in low –and middle-income countries (LMICs), where access to adequate healthcare is often not easy, is mandatory, as we always need to bear in in mind that equity in care must be a compulsory part of our medical work and research.","Cazzaniga, Marina Elena; Cordani, Nicoletta; Capici, Serena; Cogliati, Viola; Riva, Francesca; Cerrito, Maria Grazia",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13092236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066606/,187
609162,Ectodomain Pulling Combines with Fusion Peptide Inserting to Provide Cooperative Fusion for Influenza Virus and HIV,2020-07-29,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is continuously evolving. Although several vaccines were approved, this pandemic is still a major threat to public life. Till date, no established therapies are available against SARS-CoV-2. Peptide inhibitors hold great promise for this viral pathogen due to their efficacy, safety, and specificity. In this study, seventeen antiviral peptides which were known to inhibit SARS-CoV-1 are collected and computationally screened against heptad repeat 1 (HR1) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S2). Out of 17 peptides, Fp13 and Fp14 showed better binding affinity toward HR1 compared to a control peptide EK1 (a modified pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor) in molecular docking. To explore the time-dependent interactions of the fusion peptide with HR1, molecular dynamics simulation was performed incorporating lipid membrane. During 100 ns MD simulation, structural and energy parameters of Fp13-HR1 and Fp14-HR1 complexes demonstrated lower fluctuations compared to the control EK1-HR1 complex. Furthermore, principal component analysis and free energy landscape study revealed that these two peptides (Fp13 and Fp14) strongly bind to the HR1 with higher affinity than that of control EK1. Tyr917, Asn919, Gln926, lys933, and Gln949 residues in HR1 protein were found to be crucial residues for peptide interaction. Notably, Fp13, Fp14 showed reasonably better binding free energy and hydrogen bond contribution than that of EK1. Taken together, Fp13 and Fp14 peptides may be highly specific for HR1 which can potentially prevent the formation of the fusion core and could be further developed as therapeutics for treatment or prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Efaz, Faiyaz Md; Islam, Shafiqul; Talukder, Shafi Ahmad; Akter, Shaila; Tashrif, Md Zakaria; Ali, Md Ackas; Sufian, Md Abu; Parves, Md Rimon; Islam, Md Jahirul; Halim, Mohammad A",J. comput. chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34591335/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.26758,187

Therefore, it will be helpful to predict the tendency of the epidemic and analyze the influence of official policies. Existing models for prediction, such as cabin models and individual-based models, are either oversimplified or too meticulous, and the influence of the epidemic was studied much more than that of official policies. To predict the epidemic tendency, we consider four groups of people, and establish a propagation dynamics model. We also create a negative feedback to quantify the public vigilance to the epidemic. We evaluate the tendency of epidemic in Hubei and China except Hubei separately to predict the situation of the whole country. Experiments show that the epidemic will terminate around 17 March 2020 and the final number of cumulative infections will be about 78 191 (prediction interval, 74 872 to 82 474). By changing the parameters of the model accordingly, we demonstrate the control effect of the policies of the government on the epidemic situation, which can reduce about 68% possible infections. At the same time, we use the capital asset pricing model with dummy variable to evaluate the effects of the epidemic and official policies on the revenue of multiple industries.","Zhou, Lingyun; Wu, Kaiwei; Liu, Hanzhi; Gao, Yuanning; Gao, Xiaofeng",J Shanghai Jiaotong Univ Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288416/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12204-020-2168-1,187

However, the current cross-border transactions still have risks and challenges, e.g., differences in regulation policies and unbalanced profits of banks. To address this critical issue, we construct a new framework for the transaction system with the support of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new consortium blockchain system, namely asymmetric consortium blockchain (ACB), to ensure the implementation of cross-border transactions. Different from traditional consortium blockchain, the new blockchain system could support the supernode to regulate all the transactions timely. Furthermore, the new smart contract is designed to lower the opportunity loss for each node and make the profits allocation system fairer. In the end, the numerical experiments were carried out based on the transactions of Shenzhen and Hong Kong. The results show that the proposed ACB system is efficient to make the profit allocation fairer for the participants and keep intelligent for the new cross-border transaction system.","Fu, Zhengtang; Dong, Peiwu; Li, Siyao; Ju, Yanbing",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106969/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252489,187

Increasing evidence demonstrates a strong correlation between obesity and the COVID-19 disease. We have summarized recent studies and addressed the impact of obesity on COVID-19 in terms of hospitalization, severity, mortality, and patient outcome. We discuss the potential molecular mechanisms whereby obesity contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition to obesity-related deregulated immune response, chronic inflammation, endothelium imbalance, metabolic dysfunction, and its associated comorbidities, dysfunctional mesenchymal stem cells/adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells may also play crucial roles in fueling systemic inflammation contributing to the cytokine storm and promoting pulmonary fibrosis causing lung functional failure, characteristic of severe COVID-19. Moreover, obesity may also compromise motile cilia on airway epithelial cells and impair functioning of the mucociliary escalators, reducing the clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Obese diseased adipose tissues overexpress the receptors and proteases for the SARS-CoV-2 entry, implicating its possible roles as virus reservoir and accelerator reinforcing violent systemic inflammation and immune response. Finally, anti-inflammatory cytokines like anti-interleukin 6 and administration of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells may serve as potential immune modulatory therapies for supportively combating COVID-19. Obesity is conversely related to the development of COVID-19 through numerous molecular mechanisms and individuals with obesity belong to the COVID-19-susceptible population requiring more protective measures.","Ritter, Andreas; Kreis, Nina-Naomi; Louwen, Frank; Yuan, Juping",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21165793; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806722/,187
611807,Differential response of porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells to virulent and inactivated transmissible gastroenteritis virus,2014-09-19,"The evolutionary responses of infectious pathogens often have ruinous consequences for the control of disease spread in the population. Drug resistance is a well-documented instance that is generally driven by the selective pressure of drugs on both the replication of the pathogen within hosts and its transmission between hosts. Management of drug resistance therefore requires the development of treatment strategies that can impede the emergence and spread of resistance in the population. This study evaluates various treatment strategies for influenza infection as a case study by comparing the long-term epidemiological outcomes predicted by deterministic and stochastic versions of a homogeneously mixing (mean-field) model and those predicted by a heterogeneous model that incorporates spatial pair-wise correlation. We discuss the importance of three major parameters in our evaluation: the basic reproduction number, the population level of treatment, and the degree of clustering as a key parameter determining the structure of heterogeneous interactions. The results show that, as a common feature in all models, high treatment levels during the early stages of disease outset can result in large resistant outbreaks, with the possibility of a second wave of infection appearing in the pair-approximation model. Our simulations demonstrate that, if the basic reproduction number exceeds a threshold value, the population-wide spread of the resistant pathogen emerges more rapidly in the pair-approximation model with significantly lower treatment levels than in the homogeneous models. We tested an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. The findings indicate that the overall disease incidence is reduced as the degree of clustering increases, and a longer delay should be considered for implementing the large-scale treatment.","Alexander, Murray E.; Dietrich, Sarah M.; Hua, Yi; Moghadas, Seyed M.",J Theor Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.03.029; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022519309001362; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519309001362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19344730/,187

The impact of the pandemic may have exacerbated existing disparities in cancer screening due to the disproportionate burden of illness and job loss among racial/ ethnic minorities, and potentially, uneven resumption of care between different racial/ ethnic groups. Using electronic health record data from Mass General Brigham (MGB), we assessed changes in rates of breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer screening before and during the pandemic. Among patients who received primary care in an MGB-affiliated primary care practice, cancer screening rates were calculated as the number of individuals who received a screening test for each cancer type over the number of individuals due for each test, during each month between April 2019-November 2020. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to test for changes in screening rates by race/ethnicity before and during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, relative to White individuals, Asian women were less likely to receive breast cancer screening (p < 0.001), and Latinx and Black individuals were less likely to screen for lung cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02). Our results did not show significant improvement or worsening of racial/ethnic disparities for any cancer screening type as screening resumed. However, as of November 2020 rates of screening for breast cancer were lower than pre-pandemic levels for Latinx individuals, and lung cancer screening rates were higher than baseline for Latinx, Black or White individuals. Further monitoring of disparities in cancer screening is warranted as the pandemic evolves.","Marcondes, Felippe O; Cheng, David; Warner, Erica T; Kamran, Sophia C; Haas, Jennifer S",Preventive medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217419/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106640,187

Oxygen concentrators (OCs) can increase access to oxygen, compared to conventional oxygen cylinders. We investigated the costs and critical success factors of OCs in three hospitals in Fiji, and extrapolated these to estimate the oxygen delivery cost to all Sub-Divisional hospitals (SDH) nationwide. METHODS: Data sources included key personnel interviews, and data from SDH records, Ministry of Health and Medical Services, and a non-governmental organisation. We used Investment Logic Mapping (ILM) to define key issues. An economic case was developed to identify the investment option that optimised value while incorporating critical success factors identified through ILM. A fit-for-purpose analysis was conducted using cost analysis of four short-listed options. Sensitivity analyses were performed by altering variables to show the best or worst case scenario. All costs are presented in Fijian dollars. RESULTS: Critical success factors identifed included oxygen availability, safety, ease of use, feasibility, and affordability. Compared to the status quo of having only oxygen cylinders, an option of having a minimum number of concentrators with cylinder backup would cost $434,032 (range: $327,940 to $506,920) over 5 years which would be 55% (range: 41 to 64%) of the status quo cost. CONCLUSION: Introducing OCs into all SDHs in Fiji would reduce overall costs, while ensuring identified critical success factors are maintained.

615084,Enhancement of the vaccinia virus/phage T7 RNA polymerase expression system using encephalomyocarditis virus 5'-untranslated region sequences,1991-12-15,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Very low birthweight (VLBW) infants are highly susceptible to respiratory infections. Information about prevalence of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is scarce. Recent evidence suggests short-term and long-term impact of VRI in morbidity of VLBW infants. The goal of this study is to conduct a VRI surveillance in VLBW infants during NICU admission to address the prevalence, type of viruses and associated clinical features. METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study on infants below 32 gestational weeks admitted to a tertiary NICU during a 2-year period. Respiratory virus detection (influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus (hRV), enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus and adenovirus) was performed by real time multiplex PCR assays in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs), within the first 72 hours after birth and weekly, until discharge. Additional samples were taken if clinically indicated. RESULTS: 147 out of 224 eligible infants were enrolled. At least one positive NPA was found in 38% of the study cohort. Main viruses identified were hRV (58%) and adenovirus (31%). Among the 56 infants with positive NPA, 26 showed non-specific respiratory features in 58% (increased respiratory workload, tachypnoea, apnoea) or typical cold features in 38% (rhinorrhea, cough, fever), at least in one episode. Antibiotics were prescribed in 29% of cases. Positive infants showed higher rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, and had longer hospital stay. Cox regression analysis found BPD as an independent risk factor for viral infection (p<0.001) and symptomatic VRI (p<0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic surveillance in VLBW infants reports VRI is frequent, particularly by hRV. Asymptomatic infection is highly prevalent which is critical in the face of establishing appropriate preventive strategies. Infants with BPD are especially vulnerable to such infections.","Sánchez García, Laura; Calvo, Cristina; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Pellicer, Adelina",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024832/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjpo-2020-000661,187
615102,Nicotinic Receptor Subunits Atlas in the Adult Human Lung,2020-10-09,"AIMS: To explore factors associated with nurses' moral distress during the first COVID‐19 surge and their longer‐term mental health. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional, correlational survey study. METHODS: Registered nurses were surveyed in September 2020 about their experiences during the first peak month of COVID‐19 using the new, validated, COVID‐19 Moral Distress Scale for Nurses. Nurses' mental health was measured by recently experienced symptoms. Analyses included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Outcome variables were moral distress and mental health. Explanatory variables were frequency of COVID‐19 patients, leadership communication and personal protective equipment/cleaning supplies access. The sample comprised 307 nurses (43% response rate) from two academic medical centres. RESULTS: Many respondents had difficulty accessing personal protective equipment. Most nurses reported that hospital leadership communication was transparent, effective and timely. The most distressing situations were the transmission risk to nurses' family members, caring for patients without family members present, and caring for patients dying without family or clergy present. These occurred occasionally with moderate distress. Nurses reported 2.5 days each in the past week of feeling anxiety, withdrawn and having difficulty sleeping. Moral distress decreased with effective communication and access to personal protective equipment. Moral distress was associated with longer‐term mental health. CONCLUSION: Pandemic patient care situations are the greatest sources of nurses' moral distress. Effective leadership communication, fewer COVID‐19 patients, and access to protective equipment decrease moral distress, which influences longer‐term mental health. IMPACT: Little was known about the impact of COVID‐19 on nurses' moral distress. We found that nurses' moral distress was associated with the volume of care for infected patients, access to personal protective equipment, and communication from leaders. We found that moral distress was associated with longer‐term mental health. Leaders should communicate transparently to decrease nurses' moral distress and the negative effects of global crises on nurses' longer‐term mental health.","Lake, Eileen T.; Narva, Aliza M.; Holland, Sara; Smith, Jessica G.; Cramer, Emily; Rosenbaum, Kathleen E.

To better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which receptor cross-linking affects the intracellular trafficking of both ligand and receptor, we studied the intracellular trafficking of the transferrin receptor (TfR) bound to multivalent-transferrin (Tf10) which was prepared by chemical cross- linking of transferrin (Tf). Tf10 was internalized about two times slower than Tf and was retained four times longer than Tf, without being degraded in CHO cells. The intracellular localization of Tf10 was investigated using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Tf10 was not delivered to the lysosomal pathway followed by low density lipoprotein but remained accessible to Tf in the pericentriolar endocytic recycling compartment for at least 60 min. The retained Tf10 was TfR-associated as demonstrated by a reduction in surface TfR number when cells were incubated with Tf10. The presence of Tf10 within the recycling compartment did not affect trafficking of subsequently endocytosed Tf. Retention of Tf10 within the recycling compartment did not require the cytoplasmic domain of the TfR since Tf10 exited cells with the same rate when bound to the wild-type TfR or a mutated receptor with only four amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, cross-linking of surface receptors by a multivalent ligand acts as a lumenal retention signal within the recycling compartment. The data presented here show that the recycling compartment labeled by Tf10 is a long-lived organelle along the early endosome recycling pathway that remains fusion accessible to subsequently endocytosed Tf.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7790351/,187

However, because of limited knowledge about the duration of humoral immunity to COVID-19 and the existence of unique individual immune responses, the potential role of antibody testing in the diagnosis of current and past infections of COVID-19 remains ambiguous. Herein, we describe a unique case of an asymptomatic patient showing a persistent positive total antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 while testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and IgG-specific antibodies. This case study shows how a combination of tests can be employed to identify a false positive and draw conclusions about a patient’s COVID-19 status. It also highlights the complexity of using antibody testing for the diagnosis of COVID-19.","McMurry, Jordan; Fink, Ezekiel",Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/labmed/lmab038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34184052/,187
620256,Systematics for types and effects of RNA variations,2020-09-20,"This work investigated the link between the type of treatment and the clinical evolution of lambs suffering from diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli + Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli.","Gómez, L.; Andrés, S.; Sánchez, J.; Alonso, J.M.; Rey, J.; López, F.; Jiménez, A.",Small Rumin Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2008.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288216/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0921448808000266; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921448808000266,187
620519,"Infection, immunity and the neuroendocrine response",2009-08-15,"BACKGROUND: In recent years real-time PCR has become a leading technique for nucleic acid detection and quantification. These assays have the potential to greatly enhance efficiency in the clinical laboratory. Choice of primer and probe sequences is critical for accurate diagnosis in the clinic, yet current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited, and signature evaluation methods are lacking. METHODS: We assessed the quality of a signature by predicting the number of true positive, false positive and false negative hits against all available public sequence data. We found real-time PCR signatures described in recent literature and used a BLAST search based approach to collect all hits to the primer-probe combinations that should be amplified by real-time PCR chemistry. We then compared our hits with the sequences in the NCBI taxonomy tree that the signature was designed to detect. RESULTS: We found that many published signatures have high specificity (almost no false positives) but low sensitivity (high false negative rate). Where high sensitivity is needed, we offer a revised methodology for signature design which may designate that multiple signatures are required to detect all sequenced strains. We use this methodology to produce new signatures that are predicted to have higher sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: We show that current methods for real-time PCR assay design have unacceptably low sensitivities for most clinical applications. Additionally, as new sequence data becomes available, old assays must be reassessed and redesigned. A standard protocol for both generating and assessing the quality of these assays is therefore of great value. Real-time PCR has the capacity to greatly improve clinical diagnostics. The improved assay design and evaluation methods presented herein will expedite adoption of this technique in the clinical lab.","Lemmon, Gordon H; Gardner, Shea N",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-0711-7-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18817537/,187

They need to find, understand, assess and apply health-related information, and therefore, require health literacy. Adequately responding to the needs of patients requires promoting the communication skills of healthcare professionals within healthcare organisations. Health-literate healthcare organisations can provide an environment strengthening professionals’ and patients’ health literacy. When developing health-literate healthcare organisations, it has to be considered that implementing organisational change is typically challenging. In this study, a communication concept based on previously evaluated communication training is codesigned, implemented and evaluated in four clinical departments of a university hospital. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: In a codesign phase, focus group interviews among employees and patients as well as a workshop series with employees and hospital management are used to tailor the communication concept to the clinical departments and to patients’ needs. Also, representatives responsible for the topic of health literacy are established among employees. The communication concept is implemented over a 12-month period; outcomes studied are health literacy on the organisational and patient levels. Longitudinal survey data acquired from a control cohort prior to the implementation phase are compared with data of an intervention cohort after the implementation phase. Moreover, survey data from healthcare professionals before and after the implementation are compared. For formative evaluation, healthcare professionals are interviewed in focus groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Oldenburg and is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Study participants are asked to provide written informed consent. The results are disseminated via direct communication within the hospital, publications and conference presentations. If the intervention turns out to be successful, the intervention and implementation strategies will be made available to other hospitals.

However, this mechanism of inhibition remains controversial. Using the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) as a model RNA virus, we show here that ISG20 interferes with viral replication by decreasing protein synthesis in the absence of RNA degradation. Importantly, we demonstrate that ISG20 exerts a translational control over a large panel of non-self RNA substrates including those originating from transfected DNA, while sparing endogenous transcripts. This activity correlates with the protein’s ability to localize in cytoplasmic processing bodies. Finally, these functions are conserved in the ISG20 murine ortholog, whose genetic ablation results in mice with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Overall, our results posit ISG20 as an important defense factor able to discriminate the self/non-self origins of the RNA through translation modulation.","Wu, Nannan; Nguyen, Xuan-Nhi; Wang, Li; Appourchaux, Romain; Zhang, Chengfei; Panthu, Baptiste; Gruffat, Henri; Journo, Chloé; Alais, Sandrine; Qin, Juliang; Zhang, Na; Tartour, Kevin; Catez, Frédéric; Mahieux, Renaud; Ohlmann, Theophile; Liu, Mingyao; Du, Bing; Cimarelli, Andrea",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600344/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1008093,187
623031,Characterization of turkey coronavirus from turkey poults with acute enteritis,2002-01-03,"BACKGROUND: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is characterized by much diversity in terms of geography, society, economic development, and health outcomes. The health systems as well as healthcare structure and provisions vary considerably. Consequently, the progress toward Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in these countries also varies. This paper aims to describe the progress toward UHC in the ASEAN countries and discuss how regional integration could influence UHC. DESIGN: Data reported in this paper were obtained from published literature, reports, and gray literature available in the ASEAN countries. We used both online and manual search methods to gather the information and ‘snowball’ further data. RESULTS: We found that, in general, ASEAN countries have made good progress toward UHC, partly due to relatively sustained political commitments to endorse UHC in these countries. However, all the countries in ASEAN are facing several common barriers to achieving UHC, namely 1) financial constraints, including low levels of overall and government spending on health; 2) supply side constraints, including inadequate numbers and densities of health workers; and 3) the ongoing epidemiological transition at different stages characterized by increasing burdens of non-communicable diseases, persisting infectious diseases, and reemergence of potentially pandemic infectious diseases. The ASEAN Economic Community's (AEC) goal of regional economic integration and a single market by 2015 presents both opportunities and challenges for UHC. Healthcare services have become more available but health and healthcare inequities will likely worsen as better-off citizens of member states might receive more benefits from the liberalization of trade policy in health, either via regional outmigration of health workers or intra-country health worker movement toward private hospitals, which tend to be located in urban areas. For ASEAN countries, UHC should be explicitly considered to mitigate deleterious effects of economic integration. Political commitments to safeguard health budgets and increase health spending will be necessary given liberalization's risks to health equity as well as migration and population aging which will increase demand on health systems. There is potential to organize select health services regionally to improve further efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that ASEAN has significant potential to become a force for better health in the region. We hope that all ASEAN citizens can enjoy higher health and safety standards, comprehensive social protection, and improved health status. We believe economic and other integration efforts can further these aspirations.","Van Minh, Hoang; Pocock, Nicola Suyin; Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Chhorvann, Chhea; Duc, Ha Anh; Hanvoravongchai, Piya; Lim, Jeremy; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo; Ng, Nawi; Phaholyothin, Natalie; Phonvisay, Alay; Soe, Kyaw Min; Sychareun, Vanphanom",Glob Health Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25476931/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v7.25856,187

Drugs that combat viral infections are called antiviral drugs. There are no effective antiviral drugs for many viral infections. However, there are several drugs for influenza, a couple of drugs for herpesviruses, and some new antiviral drugs for treatment of HIV and hepatitis C infections. The arsenal of antivirals is complex. As of March 2014, it consists of approximately 50 drugs approved by the FDA, approximately half of which are directed against HIV. Antiviral drug creation strategies are focused on two different approaches: targeting the viruses themselves or targeting host cell factors. Direct virus-targeting antiviral drugs include attachment inhibitors, entry inhibitors, uncoating inhibitors, protease inhibitors, polymerase inhibitors, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors. Protease inhibitors (darunavir, atazanavir, and ritonavir), viral DNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, and tenofovir), and an integrase inhibitor (raltegravir) are included in the list of Top 200 Drugs by sales for the 2010s.","Vardanyan, Ruben; Hruby, Victor",Synthesis of Best-Seller Drugs,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780124114920000341; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124114920000341,187

The initial concerns regarding the virus were quickly compounded with concerns relating to the impact of its mutated forms on viral infectivity, pathogenicity and immunogenicity. To address the latter, we seek to understand how the mutational landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has shaped HLA-restricted T cell immunity at the population level during the first year of the pandemic, before mass vaccination. We analyzed a total of 330,246 high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies sampled across 143 countries and all major continents. Strikingly, we found that specific mutational patterns in SARS-CoV-2 diversify T cell epitopes in an HLA supertype-dependent manner. In fact, we observed that proline residues are preferentially removed from the proteome of prevalent mutants, leading to a predicted global loss of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes in individuals expressing HLA-B alleles of the B7 supertype family. In addition, we show that this predicted global loss of epitopes is largely driven by a dominant C-to-U mutation type at the RNA level. These results indicate that B7 supertype-associated epitopes, including the most immunodominant ones, were more likely to escape CD8+ T cell immunosurveillance during the first year of the pandemic. Together, our study lays the foundation to help understand how SARS-CoV-2 mutants shape the repertoire of T cell targets and T cell immunity across human populations. The proposed theoretical framework has implications in viral evolution, disease severity, vaccine resistance and herd immunity.","Hamelin, David J.; Fournelle, Dominique; Grenier, Jean-Christophe; Schockaert, Jana; Kovalchik, Kevin; Kubiniok, Peter; Mostefai, Fatima; Duquette, Jérôme D.; Saab, Frederic; Sirois, Isabelle; Smith, Martin A.; Pattijn, Sofie; Soudeyns, Hugo; Decaluwe, Hélène; Hussin, Julie; Caron, Etienne",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.446959,187

The aim of this work was to evaluate this new vaccine that uses a conserved viral antigen, in calves, natural hosts for BRSV. Calves, free of colostral or natural anti-BRSV antibodies, were vaccinated with N(SRS) either intramuscularly, or both intramuscularly and intranasally using Montanide™ ISA71 and IMS4132 as adjuvants and challenged with BRSV. All vaccinated calves developed anti-N antibodies in blood and nasal secretions and N-specific cellular immunity in local lymph nodes. Clinical monitoring post-challenge demonstrated moderate respiratory pathology with local lung tissue consolidations for the non-vaccinated calves that were significantly reduced in the vaccinated calves.

627415,Presence of Subgenomic mRNAs in Virions of Coronavirus IBV,1993-09-30,"OBJECTIVES: To assist with planning hospital resources, including critical care (CC) beds, for managing patients with COVID-19. METHODS: An individual simulation was implemented in Microsoft Excel using a discretely integrated condition event simulation. Expected daily cases presented to the emergency department were modeled in terms of transitions to and from ward and CC and to discharge or death. The duration of stay in each location was selected from trajectory-specific distributions. Daily ward and CC bed occupancy and the number of discharges according to care needs were forecast for the period of interest. Face validity was ascertained by local experts and, for the case study, by comparing forecasts with actual data. RESULTS: To illustrate the use of the model, a case study was developed for Guy’s and St Thomas’ Trust. They provided inputs for January 2020 to early April 2020, and local observed case numbers were fit to provide estimates of emergency department arrivals. A peak demand of 467 ward and 135 CC beds was forecast, with diminishing numbers through July. The model tended to predict higher occupancy in Level 1 than what was eventually observed, but the timing of peaks was quite close, especially for CC, where the model predicted at least 120 beds would be occupied from April 9, 2020, to April 17, 2020, compared with April 7, 2020, to April 19, 2020, in reality.

628786,Antiviral effect of mefloquine on feline calicivirus in vitro,2015-04-17,"Viruses may exploit the cardiovascular system to facilitate transmission or within-host dissemination, and the symptoms of many viral diseases stem at least in part from a loss of vascular integrity. The microvascular architecture is comprised of an endothelial cell barrier ensheathed by perivascular cells (pericytes). Pericytes are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and play crucial roles in angiogenesis and the maintenance of microvascular integrity through complex reciprocal contact-mediated and paracrine crosstalk with endothelial cells. We here review the emerging ways that viruses interact with pericytes and pay consideration to how these interactions influence microvascular function and viral pathogenesis. Major outcomes of virus-pericyte interactions include vascular leakage or haemorrhage, organ tropism facilitated by barrier disruption, including viral penetration of the blood-brain barrier and placenta, as well as inflammatory, neurological, cognitive and developmental sequelae. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms may include direct infection of pericytes, pericyte modulation by secreted viral gene products and/or the dysregulation of paracrine signalling from or to pericytes. Viruses we cover include the herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, Human betaherpesvirus 5), the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS, and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, HAND), the flaviviruses dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), and the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). We touch on promising pericyte-focussed therapies for treating the diseases caused by these important human pathogens, many of which are emerging viruses or are causing new or long-standing global pandemics.","Butsabong, Teemapron; Felippe, Mariana; Campagnolo, Paola; Maringer, Kevin",J Gen Virol,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424156/,187
629328,Sequence and organization of barley yellow dwarf virus genomic RNA.,1988-07-11,"Objective Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen accountable for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viral entry via binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to its target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key step in cell infection. The efficient transition of the virus is linked to a unique protein called open reading frame (ORF) 8. As SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop into life-threatening lower respiratory syndromes, effective therapy options are urgently needed. Several publications propose vitamin D treatment, although its mode of action against COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. It is speculated that vitamin D’s beneficial effects are mediated by up-regulating LL-37, a well-known antimicrobial peptide with antiviral effects. Methods Recombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the extended S1 subunit (S1e), the S2 subunit (S2), the receptor binding domain (RBD), and ORF8 were used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies to investigate LL-37’s ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to localize its binding site within the S protein. Binding competition studies were conducted to confirm an inhibitory action of LL-37 on the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to its entry receptor ACE2. Results We could show that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (LL-37/SStrep KD = 410 nM, LL-37/SHis KD = 410 nM) with the same affinity, as SARS-CoV-2 binds to hACE2 (hACE2/SStrep KD = 370 nM, hACE2/SHis KD = 370 nM). The binding is not restricted to the RBD of the S protein, but rather distributed along the entire length of the protein. Interaction between LL-37 and ORF8 was detected with a KD of 290 nM. Further, inhibition of the binding of SStrep (IC50 = 740 nM), S1e (IC50 = 170 nM), and RBD (IC50 = 130 nM) to hACE2 by LL-37 was demonstrated. Conclusions We have revealed a biochemical link between vitamin D, LL-37, and COVID-19 severity. SPR analysis demonstrated that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inhibits binding to its receptor hACE2, and most likely viral entry into the cell. This study supports the prophylactic use of vitamin D to induce LL-37 that protects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the therapeutic administration of vitamin D for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Further, our results provide evidence that the direct use of LL-37 by inhalation and systemic application may reduce the severity of COVID-19.","Roth, Annika; Lütke, Steffen; Meinberger, Denise; Hermes, Gabriele; Sengle, Gerhard; Koch, Manuel; Streichert, Thomas; Klatt, Andreas R.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.02.408153,187
629329,Infectious Bursal Disease Virus: Ribonucleoprotein Complexes of a Double-Stranded RNA Virus,2009-02-27,"The interferon (IFN) system is one of the most important defensive responses of mammals against viruses, and is rapidly evoked when the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of viruses are sensed. Non-self, virus-derived RNA species have been identified as the PAMPs of RNA viruses. In the present study, we compared different types of IFN-β-inducing and -non-inducing viruses in the context of Sendai virus infection. We found that some types of unusual viral RNA species were produced by infections with IFN-β-inducing viruses and accumulated into distinct cytoplasmic structures in an RNA-type-dependent manner. One of these structures was similar to the so-called antiviral stress granules (avSGs) formed by an infection with IFN-inducing viruses whose C proteins were knocked-out or mutated. Non-encapsidated, unusual viral RNA harboring the 5′-terminal region of the viral genome as well as RIG-I and typical SG markers accumulated in these granules. Another was a non-SG-like inclusion formed by an infection with the Cantell strain; a copyback-type DI genome, but not an authentic viral genome, specifically accumulated in the inclusion, whereas RIG-I and SG markers did not. The induction of IFN-β was closely associated with the production of these unusual RNAs as well as the formation of the cytoplasmic structures.","Yoshida, Asuka; Kawabata, Ryoko; Honda, Tomoyuki; Tomonaga, Keizo; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Irie, Takashi",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26300870/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00804,187

The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds to ACE2 to initiate the process of replication. This enzyme is widely present in human organ tissues, such as the heart and lung. The pathophysiology of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex and may be associated with several factors and conditions that are more severe in COVID-19 patients, such as age, male gender, and comorbidities, namely, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, obesity, and diabetes. Here we present a comprehensive review that aims to correlate the levels of expression of the ACE2 in patients with comorbidities and with a poor outcome in COVID-19 disease. Significantly higher levels of expression of ACE2 were observed in myocardial and lung tissues in heart failure and COPD patients, respectively. An age-dependent increase in SARS2-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium may be also responsible for the increased severity of COVID-19 lung disease in elderly people. Although the role of ACE2 is highlighted regarding the damage that can arise upon the SARS-CoV-2 invasion, there was no association observed between renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors and the severity of COVID-19.","Rodrigues, Rui; Costa de Oliveira, Sofia",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9081692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34442770/,187

630995,Nidovirales: Evolving the largest RNA virus genome,2006-02-28,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to cause havoc to many countries of the globe, with no end in sight, due to nonavailability of a given vaccine or treatment regimen. The pandemic has so far had a relatively limited impact on the African continent, which contributes more than 93% of global malaria burden. However, the limited burden of COVID-19 pandemic on the African region could have long-term implications on the health and wellbeing of affected inhabitants due to its malaria-endemic status. Malaria causes recurrent insulin resistance with episodes of infection at relatively low parasitaemia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is widely distributed in the human body is implicated in the pathogenesis of malaria, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and COVID-19. Use of ACE2 by the COVID-19 virus induces inflammation and oxidative stress, which can lead to insulin resistance. Although COVID-19 patients in malaria-endemic African region may not exhibit severe signs and symptoms of the disease, their risk of exhibiting heightened insulin resistance and possible future development of T2DM is high due to their prior exposure to malaria. African governments must double efforts at containing the continued spread of the virus without neglecting existing malarial control measures if the region is to avert the plausible long-term impact of the pandemic in terms of future development of T2DM.","Acquah, Samuel",J Diabetes Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134395/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8205261,187

To predict the inflection points, i.e., inflection time (Tmax) & maximal infection number (Imax) of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), we adopted a trial and error strategy and explored a series of approaches from simple logistic modeling (that has an asymptomatic line) to sophisticated tipping point detection techniques for detecting phase transitions but failed to obtain satisfactory results. Method: Inspired by its success in diversity-time relationship (DTR), we apply the PLEC (power law with exponential cutoff) model for detecting the inflection points of COVID-19 outbreaks. The model was previously used to extend the classic species-time relationship (STR) for general DTR (Ma 2018), and it has two secondary parameters (computed from its 3 parameters including power law scaling parameter w, taper-off parameter d to overwhelm virtually exponential growth ultimately, and a parameter c related to initial infections): one that was originally used for estimating the potential or dark biodiversity is proposed to estimate the maximal infection number (Imax) and another is proposed to determine the corresponding inflection time point (Tmax). Results: We successfully estimated the inflection points [Imax, Tmax] for most provinces (≈ 85%) in China with error rates <5% in both Imax and Tmax. We also discussed the constraints and limitations of the proposed approach, including (i) sensitive to disruptive jumps, (ii) requiring sufficiently long datasets, and (iii) limited to unimodal outbreaks.","Ma, Zhanshan (Sam)",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.25.20043893,187
632279,Functional Genomic Strategies for Elucidating Human–Virus Interactions: Will CRISPR Knockout RNAi and Haploid Cells?,2016-03-02,"BACKGROUND: While porcine biological hazards have had the potential to be transmitted through feed and feed mills for decades, the emerging threat of foreign animal disease has elevated the concern that these may enter or be transmitted throughout the domestic swine herd via a feed vehicle. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this review was to describe the current classification for emerging porcine biological pathogen transmission through the feed supply chain so resources can be best directed towards those of highest risk. METHODS: By assessing the pathogen severity to pigs and the probability of pathogen transmission through feed, an overall risk can be established using a hazard analysis matrix. RESULTS: There is negligible risk for feed‐based transmission of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, Trichinella spiralis, Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella Choleraesuis, Salmonella spp. except Choleraesuis and I 4,[5],12:i:‐, porcine deltacoronavirus, Senecavirus A, mammalian orthoreovirus 3, foot and mouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus or Chinese pseudorabies virus. However, the combined severity and probability of Salmonella enterica serotype I 4,[5],12:i:‐, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus and African swine fever virus warrant a moderate risk characterization for transmission through the US feed supply chain. CONCLUSIONS: This risk can be maintained below critical status by minimizing the likelihood that a pathogen can enter the feed supply chain, such as by excluding high‐risk ingredients from facilities, extending biosecurity to mills, and considering proactive mitigation strategies. In reality, all these actions may be necessary to prevent the detrimental transmission of porcine biological hazards into the US swine herd through the feed supply chain.","Jones, Cassandra K.; Woodworth, Jason; Dritz, Steve S.; Paulk, Chad B.",Vet Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31854118/; https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.227,187
632619,Mechanism of Membrane Fusion by Viral Envelope Proteins,2005-12-31,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread globally. Epidemiological susceptibility to COVID-19 has been reported in patients with cancer. We aimed to systematically characterise clinical features and determine risk factors of COVID-19 disease severity for patients with cancer and COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicentre, retrospective, cohort study, we included all adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with any type of malignant solid tumours and haematological malignancy who were admitted to nine hospitals in Wuhan, China, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020. Enrolled patients were statistically matched (2:1) with patients admitted with COVID-19 who did not have cancer with propensity score on the basis of age, sex, and comorbidities. Demographic characteristics, laboratory examinations, illness severity, and clinical interventions were compared between patients with COVID-19 with or without cancer as well as between patients with cancer with non-severe or severe COVID-19. COVID-19 disease severity was defined on admission on the basis of the WHO guidelines. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, cancer type, tumour stage, and antitumour treatments, were used to explore risk factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR2000030807. FINDINGS: Between Jan 13 and March 18, 2020, 13 077 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the nine hospitals in Wuhan and 232 patients with cancer and 519 statistically matched patients without cancer were enrolled. Median follow-up was 29 days (IQR 22–38) in patients with cancer and 27 days (20–35) in patients without cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have severe COVID-19 than patients without cancer (148 [64%] of 232 vs 166 [32%] of 519; odds ratio [OR] 3·61 [95% CI 2·59–5·04]; p<0·0001). Risk factors previously reported in patients without cancer, such as older age; elevated interleukin 6, procalcitonin, and D-dimer; and reduced lymphocytes were validated in patients with cancer. We also identified advanced tumour stage (OR 2·60, 95% CI 1·05–6·43; p=0·039), elevated tumour necrosis factor α (1·22, 1·01–1·47; p=0·037), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (1·65, 1·03–2·78; p=0·032), reduced CD4+ T cells (0·84, 0·71–0·98; p=0·031), and reduced albumin–globulin ratio (0·12, 0·02–0·77; p=0·024) as risk factors of COVID-19 severity in patients with cancer. INTERPRETATION: Patients with cancer and COVID-19 were more likely to deteriorate into severe illness than those without cancer. The risk factors identified here could be helpful for early clinical surveillance of disease progression in patients with cancer who present with COVID-19.

Recently, through the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act, pharmacists were given the ability to order and administer COVID-19 tests, giving them a better opportunity to engage in the pandemic response across the nation as well as in Idaho. This survey sought to determine Idaho pharmacists’ willingness to provide different COVID-19 related services, assess needed resources to provide such services, and identify and prioritize other unmet community needs. We conducted a nine-question, cross-sectional survey distributed to pharmacists with addresses located in Idaho. All questions in the survey were optional and focused on pharmacist’s willingness to provide services, what resources and additional training they would need, difficulty with 90-day prescriptions, and solicited additional feedback using an open-ended question. A total of 229 responses were received, representing all areas of pharmacy practice, with approximately half from community settings. The majority of respondents (70%) were willing to provide COVID-19 testing. Adequate staffing, changes to workflow, and the need for billing and clear reimbursement mechanisms were most frequently cited as barriers to contributing to the COVID-19 response. In summary, we found that pharmacists are very willing to help during this crisis, but their involvement may be better facilitated with the removal of barriers.

The expression of this genomic information of SARS-CoV involves synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we showed that the translational levels of 10 SARS-CoV sgRNAs including the two low-abundance sgRNAs 2-1 and 3-1 varied considerably in translation reporter assays. We also demonstrated that the initiator AUG codon of sgRNA-8 was silent and the repressive control was most likely positioned in the upstream untranslated region (UTR) of sgRNA-8. The initiator AUG codons of most sgRNAs are in poor Kozak contexts and the translation of truncated proteins from downstream AUG codons by leaky scanning was common in our experimental settings. No significant correlation was found between complexity of 5′-UTR and the sequence context of AUG codon with the level of translation of SARS-CoV sgRNAs. These results will be helpful for further studies to reveal the biological functions and translation regulatory mechanisms of sgRNAs in the coronavirus life cycle and pathogenesis.","Yang, Yaling; Hussain, Snawar; Wang, Hao; Ke, Min; Guo, Deyin",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19363699/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11262-009-0357-y,187

To reduce the risk of infection, we launched selected team (Team COVID) of non-specialists and brought in active telemedicine method and computed tomography (CT)-first protocol. We describe our actual practice and the health status of medical doctors dealing with COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Between April 17, 2020 and May 24, 2020, 10 doctors worked with COVID-19 patients as part of Team COVID. The Team COVID doctors used a CT-first triage protocol for outpatients and telemedicine for inpatients and outpatients. We evaluated paired serum-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 at the initial and end of the study duration and PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 at the end of the study duration. Furthermore, 36-item short-form of the Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire (SF-36) at the beginning and end of the study period were evaluated. RESULTS: Ten doctors worked as Team COVID: seven internal medicine doctors and three surgeons. During the study period, Team COVID treated 165 individuals in the outpatient clinic and isolated hospitalized patients for 315 person-days. There were no positive results of serum-specific antibody testing and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in Team COVID doctors. Furthermore, the SF-36 showed no deterioration in physical and mental QOL status. No in-hospital infection occurred during the study period.

No difference in commitment or intention-to-leave were seen between students who did or did not had internship experience during CoViD-19 period. Need-supportive experiences - indicating that students felt competent, related to the team, and could be themselves on internship - coincided with high commitment. Conversely, need-frustrating experiences - indicating that students felt insecure, unrelated, and controlled by the nursing team – increased intention-to-leave nursing education. Students who felt pressured for an internship during the first wave of the CoViD-19 crisis, had more doubts to continue nursing education, and an increased chance on drop-out. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend nursing schools to assess student's motivation when making a substantiated decision concerning internships during a health crisis, as facing an imposed or subjective mandatory decision to go into clinical practice might lead to less commitment to the study program. For both teacher and staff mentors it is deemed important to discuss the internship climate with the student, in order to early identify need-frustrating issues during internship.","Duprez, Veerle; Vermote, Branko; Van Hecke, Ann; Verhaeghe, Rik; Vansteenkiste, Maarten; Malfait, Simon",Nurse Educ Today,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0260691721003816; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260691721003816; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.105124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481310/,187

This article analyzes 30 years of health crises in Spain from a multifaceted perspective: population, patients, clinicians, public health practitioners, politicians, the media and other groups involved. The interaction among all stakeholders shapes the response and management of any health crisis. Heterogeneity of management and of health effects–contributing to inequalities in health-is common. The participation and coordination of the health services is crucial in detection of the crisis and in modulating the population reactions. Public health services characterized by their low public profile could gain public influence by their role in coordinating politicians and the media when solving important health problems. Analyzing the mistakes and successes in previous crises together with risk and vulnerability assessments, research and drills are essential to give a quick and adequate response to future crises.","Gérvas, Juan; Hernández-Aguado, Ildefonso",Gac Sanit,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0213911108000460; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0213911108000460,187
635763,Molecular characterization of a virulent canine coronavirus BGF strain(),2004-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) became the deadliest pandemic of the new millennium. One year after it became a pandemic, the current COVID-19 situation in Brazil is an example of how the impacts of a pandemic are beyond health outcomes and how health, social, and political actions are intertwined. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to provide an overview of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, from a social and political point of view, and to discuss the perspectives from now on. METHODS: This is a narrative review using official, scientific (PubMed, Medline, and SciELO databases) and publicly available data. Press articles were also used that contain important information not found in these databases. FINDINGS: We address the impacts of COVID-19 in different regions of Brazil, on indigenous populations, health care workers, and how internal social contrasts impacted the pandemics advance across the country. We also discuss key points that culminated in the countrys failed management of the COVID-19 spread, such as poor management of the public health care system, disparities between public and private health care infrastructure, lack of mass testing and viral spread tracking, lack of preparedness and planning to implement strict isolation and social distancing measures, and, most importantly, political instability, a deteriorating Health Ministry and sabotaging attitudes of the countrys president, including anti-scientific actions, underplaying COVID-19 severity, spreading and powering fake news about the pandemic, promoting knowingly inefficient medications for COVID-19 treatment, and interference in collective health policies, including the countrys vaccination plan. CONCLUSIONS: After one year of COVID-19 and a disastrous management of the disease, Brazil has more than 11 million cases, 270,000 deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to COVID-19 in the world, most of which could have been avoided and can be credited to negligence of municipal, state, and federal authorities, especially President Jair Messias Bolsonaro. Unfortunately, the country is an example of what not to do in a pandemic setting. KEY POINTS: One year after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Brazil had the second higher number of cases and deaths, and the highest number of daily deaths due to the disease. Lack of massive testing, non-stringent and ineffective collective health policies, poor management of the public health care system, and political instability were the main drivers of the countrys flawed management of the COVID-19 advancement. Anti-science and sabotaging actions by government had a pivotal role in the countrys current situation. Brazil has a large territory and is marked by social contrasts among different regions and states, which showed contrasting data regarding the impact caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 databases and data sharing are important to provide an overview of epidemiological aspects of the disease; however, Brazil lacks standardization in these datasets.","Boschiero, Matheus Negri; Palamim, Camila Vantini Capasso; Ortega, Manoela Marques; Mauch, Renan Marrichi; Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046307/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3182,187

Seven, 5-weeks-old New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits chosen at random from 35 ill animals that were remitted for postmortem, histopathology, and ultrastructural examinations were studied. Bacteriological and parasitological studies were carried out in three additional ill rabbits of same age. In a field trail 45, 5-weeks-old apparently healthy NZW rabbits were observed daily for sanitary status for a 5-week period. Some of the rabbits did not response to the preventive drug treatment and were therefore, used to study the development of the disease. Clinical signs, gross lesions, and mortality throughout the fattening period were recorded. Eight, 8-weeks-old NZW rabbits who survived an outbreak were assessed for gamma-globulins in serum of the total protein fraction during a 3-week period. Gamma-globulins were also measured in eight free-disease healthy rabbits of same breed and age. Lesions of the small intestine consisted of mucoid enteropathy, lymphocytic plasmocytic enteritis with atrophy and fusion of villi, and hyperplasia of globet cells. Serosal edema was present. Ultrastructural examinations of jejunum and ileum from 3/7 diseased rabbits, revealed enterocytes in apoptosis, mixed with degenerative and/or necrotic changes together with infiltration of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and loss of microvillus. There were electron dense structures suggestive of virus particles inside the nuclei and cytoplasm of some enterocytes. There was lymphoid spleen atrophy and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in 7/7 rabbits. Interstitial pneumonia in 4/7 rabbits was found. Encephalitozoon cuniculi was detected in the brain of 1/7 rabbits. Escherichia coli were detected in 3/3 cases and Eimeria spp. in 2/3 cases. Mortality rate in the field study was 51.1% and the spread of the disease occur in 9/9 cages. The proportion of gamma-globulins in rabbits who survive an outbreak was much lower (P = 0.0001) than free-disease healthy rabbits (8.1 ± 1.0 and 14.0 ± 1.0, respectively). The disease was multifactorial and consisted of sub-acute mucoid enteropathy probably induced by viral infection and aggravated by the proliferation of opportunistic pathogens common to rabbits. This may explain the severe degenerative and necrotic changes observed in the small intestine of diarrhoeic rabbits.","Rodríguez-De Lara, R.; Cedillo-Peláez, C.; Constantino-Casas, F.; Fallas-López, M.; Cobos-Peralta, M.A.; Gutiérrez-Olvera, C.; Juárez-Acevedo, M.; Miranda-Romero, L.A.",Res Vet Sci,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452880700121X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452880700121X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17597173/,187

Progressive lymphopenia, especially in T cells, was a prominent clinical feature of severe COVID-19. Activated HLA-DR(+)CD38(+) CD8(+) T cells were enriched over a prolonged period from the lymphopenia patients who died from Ebola and influenza infection and in severe patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, the CD38(+)HLA-DR(+) CD8(+) T population was reported to play contradictory roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A total of 42 COVID-19 patients, including 32 mild or moderate and 10 severe or critical cases, who received care at Beijing Ditan Hospital were recruited into this retrospective study. Blood samples were first collected within 3 days of the hospital admission and once every 3–7 days during hospitalization. The longitudinal flow cytometric data were examined during hospitalization. Moreover, we evaluated serum levels of 45 cytokines/chemokines/growth factors and 14 soluble checkpoints using Luminex multiplex assay longitudinally. RESULTS: We revealed that the HLA-DR(+)CD38(+) CD8(+) T population was heterogeneous, and could be divided into two subsets with distinct characteristics: HLA-DR(+)CD38(dim) and HLA-DR(+)CD38(hi). We observed a persistent accumulation of HLA-DR(+)CD38hi CD8(+) T cells in severe COVID-19 patients. These HLA-DR(+)CD38(hi) CD8(+) T cells were in a state of overactivation and consequent dysregulation manifested by expression of multiple inhibitory and stimulatory checkpoints, higher apoptotic sensitivity, impaired killing potential, and more exhausted transcriptional regulation compared to HLA-DR(+)CD38(dim) CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, the clinical and laboratory data supported that only HLA-DR(+)CD38(hi) CD8(+) T cells were associated with systemic inflammation, tissue injury, and immune disorders of severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that HLA-DR(+)CD38(hi) CD8(+) T cells were correlated with disease severity of COVID-19 rather than HLA-DR(+)CD38(dim) population.","Du, Juan; Wei, Lirong; Li, Guoli; Hua, Mingxi; Sun, Yao; Wang, Di; Han, Kai; Yan, Yonghong; Song, Chuan; Song, Rui; Zhang, Henghui; Han, Junyan; Liu, Jingyuan; Kong, Yaxian",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.735125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34567001/,187

To identify crucial mutations in spike protein that escape humoral immune response, we evaluated the cross-neutralization of convalescent plasmas and RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against various spike protein-based pseudoviruses. Three of 24 SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses containing different mutations in spike protein, including D614G, A475V, and E484Q, consistently showed an altered sensitivity to neutralization by convalescent plasmas. A475V and E484Q mutants are highly resistant to neutralization by mAb B38 and 2-4, suggesting that some crucial mutations in spike protein might evolve SARS-CoV-2 variants capable of escaping humoral immune response.","Ding, Chengchao; He, Jun; Zhang, Xiangyu; Jiang, Chengcheng; Sun, Yong; Zhang, Yuqing; Chen, Qingqing; He, Hongliang; Li, Wenting; Xie, Jiajia; Liu, Zhirong; Gao, Yong",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.693775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34484190/,187

SETTING: Multicenter registry of patients from 116 emergency departments in 27 US states. METHODS: Planned secondary analysis of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2, with (n=415) and without (n=25,306) HIV. Descriptive statistics were used to compare patient information and clinical characteristics by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV status. Unadjusted and multivariable models were used to explore factors associated with death, intubation, and hospital length of stay. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival by SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection status. RESULTS: Patients with both SARS-CoV-2 and HIV and patients with SARS-CoV-2 but without HIV had similar admission rates (62.7% versus 58.6%, p=0.24), hospitalization characteristics (e.g. rates of admission to the intensive care unit from the ED [5.0% versus 6.3%, p=0.45] and intubation [10% versus 13.3%, p=0.17]), and rates of death (13.9% versus 15.1%, p=0.65). They also had a similar cumulative risk of death (log-rank p=0.72). However, patients with both HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to patients with HIV but without SAR-CoV-2 had worsened outcomes, including increased mortality (13.9% versus 5.1%, p<0.01, log rank p<0.0001) and their deaths occurred sooner (median 11.5 days versus 34 days, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Among ED patients with HIV, clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not worse when compared to patients without HIV, but SARS-CoV-2 infection increased risk of death in patients with HIV.","Bennett, Christopher L; Ogele, Emmanuel; Pettit, Nicholas R; Bischof, Jason J; Meng, Tong; Govindarajan, Prasanthi; Camargo, Carlos A; Nordenholz, Kristen; Kline, Jeffrey A",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002795; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483295/,187

In total, 161 caregivers completed an online questionnaire to provide data regarding their general mental health state and difficulties in asking their child with ADHD to adopt protective behaviors against COVID-19 and in managing the child’s after-school learning, sleep routine, and internet use, as well as worsened psychological symptoms. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that caregivers’ difficulties in managing ADHD children’s self-protective behaviors and after-school learning and the children’s worsened emotional symptoms were significantly associated with poor caregiver general mental health state.

We describe the phylogenomic and population genetic patterns of the virus in Mexico during the pre-vaccination stage, including asymptomatic carriers. Our RT-qPCR screening and phylogenomics directed a sequence/structure analysis of the Spike glycoprotein, revealing mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico, in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C/S:452R (B.1.427/9). Overall, the detected variants in Mexico show mutations in the N-terminal domain (i.e., R190M), in the receptor-binding motif (i.e., T478K, E484K), within the S1-S2 subdomains (i.e., P681R/H, T732A), and at the basis of the protein, V1176F, raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the postulated variants of interest (VOIs) 20B/478K.V1 and P.3. Moreover, the population patterns of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers sampled with a self-sampling scheme, revealed a bimodal distribution of polymorphisms in all three sampled localities from central Mexico, and confirmed the presence of several fixed variants, mostly from the 241T-3037T-14408T-23403G haplotype common in Asia. Despite gene flow among Mexican localities, we found differences in both the allelic frequencies among localities and the allelic imbalance of the mutation S194L of the nucleocapsid protein between symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers.

The use and selection of adequate face masks is a safety and health measure that could help minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine sociodemographic variables and factors relating to COVID-19 that could impact decision making or the choice to use or not use face masks in the prevention and care of a possible COVID-19 infection among a large sample of younger and older Brazilian people. METHODS: An online survey composed of 14 closed-ended questions about sociodemographic variables and COVID-19 was used. A total of 2673 participants consisted of Brazilian people (aged ≥18 years) from different states of Brazil and were grouped according to age (≤59 years and ≥60 years). To compare the variables of interest (associated with wearing a face mask or not), chi-square and likelihood ratio tests were used (with P<.05 being significant). RESULTS: Most of the participants in both groups were women from the southeast region who had postgraduate degrees. Approximately 61% (1452/2378) of individuals aged ≤59 years and 67.8% (200/295) of those aged ≥60 years were not health professionals. In the group aged ≤59 years, 83.4% (1983/2378) did not show COVID-19 signs and symptoms, and 97.3% (2314/2378) were not diagnosed with COVID-19. In the older adult group, 92.5% (273/295) did not show signs and symptoms of COVID-19, and 98.3% (290/295) were not diagnosed with the disease. The majority of the participants in both groups reported using face masks, and their decision to use face masks was influenced by the level of education and their occupation as a health professional. CONCLUSIONS: Younger and older adults have worn face masks during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is difficult to measure how much of a positive impact this attitude, habit, and behavior could have on the degree of infection and spread of the disease. However, it can be a positive indicator of adherence to the population’s security and safety measures during the pandemic.","Vancini, Rodrigo L; Camargo-Neto, Luiz; Andrade, Marilia S; de Lira, Claudio A; dos Santos, Rafaela G; Nikolaidis, Pantelis T; Knechtle, Beat; Piacezzi, Luiz HV; Teixeira-Lopes, Maria CB; Assayag-Batista, Ruth E; Pinto-Okuno, Meiry F; Vancini-Campanharo, Cássia R",JMIR Aging,https://doi.org/10.2196/28989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253508/,187

Clinical data from 38 COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed, treated and discharged from the Qishan Hospital in Yantai over the period from January to February 2020 were analysed. NLR and procalcitonin (PCT) were determined in the first and fourth weeks after their admission, along with the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of these patients. Based on results as obtained on the first and fourth weeks after admission, five indices consisting of NLR, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes (LY) and monocytes (MON) were selected to generate receiver operating characteristic curves, while optimal cutoff values, sensitivities and specificities were obtained according to the Yuden index. Statistically significant differences in neutrophils, LY and the NLR were present in the severe vs. moderate COVID-19 group from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The cut-off value of NLR for predicting the severity of COVID-19 was 4.425, with a sensitivity of 0.855 and a specificity of 0.979. A statistically significant positive correlation was present between PCT and NLR in the severe group as determined within the first week of admission. NLR can serve as a predictor of COVID-19 disease severity as patients' progress from the first to the fourth week of their hospitalisation. The statistically significant positive correlation between levels of NLR and PCT in severe patients indicated that increases in NLR were accompanied with gradual increases in PCT.","Wang, Kun; Wang, Xin; Du, Jiangdong; Liu, Chunling; Jiang, Yanan; Zhang, Heqiu; Jiang, Haiming; Fu, Qiang",Epidemiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775266/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268821000674,187

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence, longitudinal course and mortality-risk of WTD in community-dwelling older people. DESIGN: Observational study with 6-year follow-up. SETTING: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a nationally representative cohort of older adults. SUBJECTS: In total, 8,174 community-dwelling adults aged ≥50 years. METHODS: To define WTD, participants were asked: ‘In the last month, have you felt that you would rather be dead?’ Depressive symptoms were measured using the CES-D. Mortality data were compiled by linking administrative death records to individual-level survey data from the study. RESULTS: At Wave 1, 3.5% of participants (279/8,174) reported WTD. Both persistent loneliness (OR 5.73 (95% CI 3.41–9.64)) and depressive symptoms (OR 6.12 (95% CI 4.33–8.67)) were independently associated with WTD. Of participants who first reported WTD at Wave 1 or 2, 72% did not report WTD when reassessed after 2 years, and the prevalence of depressive symptoms (−44%) and loneliness (−19%) was more likely to decline in this group at follow-up. Fifteen per cent of participants expressing WTD at Wave 1 died during a 6-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: WTD amongst community-dwelling older people is frequently transient and is strongly linked with the course of depressive symptoms and loneliness. An enhanced focus on improving access to mental health care and addressing social isolation in older people should therefore be a public health priority, particularly in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Briggs, Robert; Ward, Mark; Kenny, Rose Anne",Age Ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570600/,187

It may cause acute respiratory failure ranging from severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to exacerbations of airflow limitation. Non-invasive ventilation is now considered first-line intervention for different causes of acute respiratory failure and may be considered in the context of H1N1 pandemic. Although infection control issues have been arisen, non-invasive ventilation was effective and safe during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. It is reasonable to recommend non-invasive ventilation in H1N1-related exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases, especially in negative-pressure wards. Treatment of early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome associated with H1N1 using non-invasive ventilation could be tried rapidly identifying those who fail without delaying endotracheal intubation. Considering the high demand for critical care beds during the pandemic, non-invasive ventilation may have a role in reducing the estimated load.","Winck, João Carlos; Gonçalves, Miguel",Revista Portuguesa de Pneumologia,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0873215915312538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21067697/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0873215915312538,187

The Nordic countries have an abundance of clean fresh water as a source for drinking water supplies. They have followed developments in safeguarding water, both the recommendations of the World Health Organization framework for safe drinking water and European legislation. Worldwide, including the Nordic countries, small water supplies are less compliant with water safety regulation. The forthcoming EU directive on drinking water require risk-based approaches and improved transparency on water quality. This research looks at the Nordic frameworks for safe water supply, with emphasis on risk-based approaches and smaller systems. We analyzed the legal frameworks for safe water, the structure of the water sector across the Nordic countries and explored how prepared these countries are to meet these requirements. Our findings show that, while legal requirements are mostly in place, delivery of information to the public needs to be improved. Most Nordic countries are in the process of implementing risk-based management in large and medium size water supplies, whereas small supplies are lagging. We conclude that a key to success is increased training and support for small supplies. We suggest wider adoption of the Nordic model of cooperation with benchmarking of safe water for all to transfer knowledge between the countries. This work provides insights into challenges and opportunities for the Nordic countries and provides insights relevant to countries worldwide in their effort towards realization of SDG Target 6.1.","Gunnarsdottir, Maria J.; Gardarsson, Sigurdur M.; Schultz, Anna Charlotte; Albrechtsen, Hans-Jörgen; Hansen, Lisbeth Truelstrup; Gerlach Bergkvist, Kim Steve; Rossi, Pekka M.; Klöve, Björn; Myrmel, Mette; Persson, Kenneth M.; Eriksson, Magnus; Bartram, Jamie",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920305733; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920305733; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32956900/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113627,187
647975,Molecular characterisation of the virulent canine coronavirus CB/05 strain(),2007-02-01,"Majority of the million tons of plastic produced each year is being disposed after single-use. Plastic bottle, bags, food containers, gloves, and cup that end up in landfills and environment could linger for hundreds to thousands of years. Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), will also exacerbate the global plastic pollution as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE i.e., gloves, masks) became mandatory to prevent the spread of the virus. Plastic eventually breaking down in micro & nanoscopic bits due to physical or chemical or biological actions in the environment, can enter animal and human food web. So, plastic management programs need to be more robust with a focus on the prevention of the micro and nanoplastics entrance into the environment and food web. In the present pandemic situation, it is even more necessary to know about how much plastic waste is being generated and how different countries are coping up with their plastic waste management. In this review, we have elucidated how global plastic production rise during COVID-19 and how it would contribute to short and long-term impacts on the environment. Plastic pollution during the pandemic will increase the GHS emissions in the incineration facilities. Improper disposal of plastics into the oceans and lands would endanger the marine species and subsequently human lives. We have also assessed how the increased plastic pollution will aggravate the micro and nanoscale plastic problem, which have now become an emerging concern. This review will be helpful for people to understand the plastic usage and its subsequent consequences in the environment in a pandemic like COVID-19.","Shams, Mehnaz; Alam, Iftaykhairul; Mahbub, Md Shahriar",Environ Adv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604829/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666765721000909; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envadv.2021.100119; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666765721000909,187

He had experienced no recurrence during previous follow-up visits. Chest CT scan revealed numerous bilateral small peripheral and perilymphatic pulmonary nodules, unilateral ground-glass patch, and nodular interlobular septal thickening. Biopsy of the pulmonary nodules established pulmonary metastasis of chondrosarcoma origin, and pharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was positive for COVID-19.

648669,The combination of PRRS virus and bacterial endotoxin as a model for multifactorial respiratory disease in pigs,2004-12-08,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Vimentin is an important filamentous protein providing structural and functional support to the cell. During initial stages of cancer development, vimentin concentration is very low, however, it increases when cancer starts to invade the surrounding areas. This review highlights the varied roles of vimentin in cancer growth and its spread to distant areas of the body. We have tried to explore the potential new areas of research related to the role of vimentin in cancer progression. We have also highlighted the reported damage to the vimentin gene in cancers, although how the damaged vimentin helps in cancer growth and spread is not known. We propose that latest technologies should be employed to medicinally target vimentin to reduce the cancer growth and its spread thereby helping to increase treatment outcomes and patients’ survival. ABSTRACT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible plethora of molecular events where epithelial cells gain the phenotype of mesenchymal cells to invade the surrounding tissues. EMT is a physiological event during embryogenesis (type I) but also happens during fibrosis (type II) and cancer metastasis (type III). It is a multifaceted phenomenon governed by the activation of genes associated with cell migration, extracellular matrix degradation, DNA repair, and angiogenesis. The cancer cells employ EMT to acquire the ability to migrate, resist therapeutic agents and escape immunity. One of the key biomarkers of EMT is vimentin, a type III intermediate filament that is normally expressed in mesenchymal cells but is upregulated during cancer metastasis. This review highlights the pivotal role of vimentin in the key events during EMT and explains its role as a downstream as well as an upstream regulator in this highly complex process. This review also highlights the areas that require further research in exploring the role of vimentin in EMT. As a cytoskeletal protein, vimentin filaments support mechanical integrity of the migratory machinery, generation of directional force, focal adhesion modulation and extracellular attachment. As a viscoelastic scaffold, it gives stress-bearing ability and flexible support to the cell and its organelles. However, during EMT it modulates genes for EMT inducers such as Snail, Slug, Twist and ZEB1/2, as well as the key epigenetic factors. In addition, it suppresses cellular differentiation and upregulates their pluripotent potential by inducing genes associated with self-renewability, thus increasing the stemness of cancer stem cells, facilitating the tumour spread and making them more resistant to treatments. Several missense and frameshift mutations reported in vimentin in human cancers may also contribute towards the metastatic spread. Therefore, we propose that vimentin should be a therapeutic target using molecular technologies that will curb cancer growth and spread with reduced mortality and morbidity.","Usman, Saima; Waseem, Naushin H.; Nguyen, Thuan Khanh Ngoc; Mohsin, Sahar; Jamal, Ahmad; Teh, Muy-Teck; Waseem, Ahmad",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13194985; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34638469/,187

First, we argue that additional elements could be included in measures of value, but such elements have not generally been included in measures of quality-adjusted life-years. For example, we describe a recently developed extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) that provides a good example of how to use a broader concept of utility. ECEA adds two features—measures of financial risk protection and income distributional consequences. We then discuss a further option for expanding this approach—augmented CEA, which can introduce many value measures. Neither of these approaches, however, provide a comprehensive measure of value. To resolve this issue, we review a technique called multicriteria decision analysis that can provide a comprehensive measure of value. We then discuss budget-setting and prioritization using multicriteria decision analysis, issues not yet fully resolved. Next, we discuss deliberative processes, which represent another important approach for population- or plan-level decisions used by many health technology assessment bodies. These use quantitative information on CEA and other elements, but the group decisions are reached by a deliberative voting process. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of stated preference methods for developing “hedonic” value frameworks, and conclude with some recommendations in this area.","Phelps, Charles E.; Lakdawalla, Darius N.; Basu, Anirban; Drummond, Michael F.; Towse, Adrian; Danzon, Patricia M.",Value Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29477392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301517338950; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2017.12.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301517338950,187

The DID estimates reveal a lowering of the gender gap in employment probabilities which occurs due to the lower probability of male employment, rather than an increase in female employment. The first month of the national lockdown, April 2020, saw a large contraction in employment for both men and women, where more men lost jobs in absolute terms. Between April and August 2020 male employment recovered steadily as the economy unlocked. The event study estimates show that in August 2020, for women, the likelihood of being employed was 9% points lower than that for men, compared to April 2019, conditional on previous employment. However, by December 2020, gender gaps in employment were at the December 2019 levels. The burden of domestic chores worsened for women under the pandemic. Men spent more time on housework in April 2020 relative to December 2019, but by December 2020, the average male hours had declined to below the pre-pandemic levels, whereas women’s average hours increased sharply. Time spent with friends fell sharply between December 2019 and April 2020, with a larger decline in the case of women. The hours spent with friends recovered in August 2020, to again decline by December 2020 to roughly one-third of the pre-pandemic levels.

651428,Natural Killer Cell Dysfunction and Its Role in COVID-19,2020-09-01,"The transmission dynamics of the coronavirus—COVID-19—have challenged humankind at almost every level. Currently, research groups around the globe are trying to figure out such transmission dynamics under special conditions such as separation policies enforced by governments. Mathematical and computational models, like the compartmental model or the agent-based model, are being used for this purpose. This paper proposes an agent-based model, called INFEKTA, for simulating the transmission of infectious diseases, not only the COVID-19, under social distancing policies. INFEKTA combines the transmission dynamic of a specific disease, (according to parameters found in the literature) with demographic information (population density, age, and genre of individuals) of geopolitical regions of the real town or city under study. Agents (virtual persons) can move, according to its mobility routines and the enforced social distancing policy, on a complex network of accessible places defined over an Euclidean space representing the town or city. The transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 under different social distancing policies in Bogotá city, the capital of Colombia, is simulated using INFEKTA with one million virtual persons. A sensitivity analysis of the impact of social distancing policies indicates that it is possible to establish a ‘medium’ (i.e., close 40% of the places) social distancing policy to achieve a significant reduction in the disease transmission.","Gomez, Jonatan; Prieto, Jeisson; Leon, Elizabeth; Rodríguez, Arles",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606714/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245787,187

We sought to evaluate the utilization and diagnostic yield of blood cultures during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine prevalence and common etiologies of bacteremia and to inform a diagnostic approach to relieve blood culture overutilization. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 88,201 blood cultures from 28,011 patients at a multicenter network of hospitals within New York City to evaluate order volume, positivity rate, time to positivity, and etiologies of positive cultures in COVID-19. Ordering volume increased by 34.8% in the second half of March 2020 compared to the level in the first half of the month. The rate of bacteremia was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (3.8%) than among COVID-19-negative patients (8.0%) and those not tested (7.1%) (P < 0.001). COVID-19 patients had a high proportion of organisms reflective of commensal skin microbiota, which, when excluded, reduced the bacteremia rate to 1.6%. More than 98% of all positive cultures were detected within 4 days of incubation. Bloodstream infections are very rare for COVID-19 patients, which supports the judicious use of blood cultures in the absence of compelling evidence for bacterial coinfection. Clear communication with ordering providers is necessary to prevent overutilization of blood cultures during patient surges, and laboratories should consider shortening the incubation period from 5 days to 4 days, if necessary, to free additional capacity.","Sepulveda, Jorge; Westblade, Lars F.; Whittier, Susan; Satlin, Michael J.; Greendyke, William G.; Aaron, Justin G.; Zucker, Jason; Dietz, Donald; Sobieszczyk, Magdalena; Choi, Justin J.; Liu, Dakai; Russell, Sarah; Connelly, Charles; Green, Daniel A.",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00875-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404482/,187

It then summarizes the unique “lessons learned” from the Covid-19 crisis by baselining actual developments against a reasonable, pre-Covid-19 pandemic scenario based on the 2002 SARS epidemic and 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Actual developments support the pre-Covid-19 hypothesis that financial market developments dominate claims losses due to the demographics of pandemics and other factors. However, Covid-19 “surprised” relative to the pre-Covid-19 scenario in terms of its impact on the real economy as well as on the property and casualty segment as business interruption property triggers and exclusions are challenged, something that may adversely impact the insurability of pandemics as well as the perception of the industry for some time to come. The unique lessons of Covid-19 reinforce the need for resilience upfront in solvency and liquidity, the need to improve business interruption wordings and re-underwrite the book, and the recognition that business interruption caused by pandemics may not be an insurable risk due to its large accumulation potential and the threat of external moral hazard. These insurability limitations lead to a discussion about the structure and financing of protection against the impact of future pandemics.","Richter, Andreas; Wilson, Thomas C.",Geneva Risk Insur Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982612/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s10713-020-00054-z,187

Geospatial analysis of neighborhood-level data could provide insight into drivers of infection. In the current analysis of Harris County, Texas, we used custom interpolation tools in GIS to disaggregate COVID-19 incidence estimates from the zip code to census tract estimates—a better representation of neighborhood-level estimates. We assessed the associations between 29 neighborhood-level characteristics and COVID-19 incidence using a series of aspatial and spatial models. The variables that maintained significant and positive associations with COVID-19 incidence in our final aspatial model and later represented in a geographically weighted regression model were the percentage of the Black/African American population, percentage of the foreign-born population, area derivation index (ADI), percentage of households with no vehicle, and percentage of people over 65 years old inside each census tract. Conversely, we observed negative and significant association with the percentage employed in education. Notably, the spatial models indicated that the impact of ADI was homogeneous across the study area, but other risk factors varied by neighborhood. The current findings could enhance decision making by local public health officials in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding factors that drive community transmission, we can better target disease control measures.","Oluyomi, Abiodun O.; Gunter, Sarah M.; Leining, Lauren M.; Murray, Kristy O.; Amos, Chris",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557439/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041495,187

Because they often co-exist, it is difficult to assess if age is a risk factor on its own. METHODS: We used administrative register data of the total Swedish population from 01/2015 until 07/2020. We stratified the population aged 70+ into three groups according to level of care (in care homes, with home care, and in independent living). Within these groups, we explored the level of excess mortality in 2020 by estimating expected mortality with Poisson regression and compared it to observed levels. We investigated if excess mortality has been of the same magnitude in the three groups, and if age constitutes a risk factor for death during the pandemic regardless of level of care. FINDINGS: Individuals living in care homes experienced the highest excess mortality (75- >100% in April, 25–50% in May, 0–25% in June, depending on age). Individuals with home care showed the second highest magnitude (30–60% in April, 15–40% in May, 0–25% in June), while individuals in independent living experienced excess primarily at the highest ages (5–50% in April, 5–50% in May, 0–25% in June). Although mortality rates increased, the age-pattern of mortality during the pandemic resembled the age-pattern observed in previous years. INTERPRETATION: We found stepwise elevated excess mortality by level of care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden, suggesting that level of frailty or comorbidities plays a more important role than age for COVID-19 associated deaths. Part of our findings are likely attributable to differences in exposure to the virus between individuals receiving formal care and those living independently, and not only different case fatality between the groups. Although age is a strong predictor for mortality, the relative effect of age on mortality was no different during the pandemic than before. We believe this is an important contribution to the discussion of the pandemic, its consequences, and which groups need the most protection.

In this Essay, it is argued that such agents already exist and are readily available while highlighting the challenges that remain to translate them into the clinic. Multivalent inhibitors of viral infectivity based on polymers or supramolecular agents and nanoparticles are shown to be broadly acting against diverse pathogens in vitro as well as in vivo. Furthermore, uniquely, such agents can be virucidal. Polymers and nanoparticles are stable, do not require cold chain of transportation and storage, and can be obtained on large scale. Specifically, for the treatment of respiratory viruses and pulmonary diseases, these agents can be administered via inhalation/nebulization, as is currently investigated in clinical trials as a treatment against SARS CoV‐2/Covid‐19.

653605,Therapeutic Targets for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Emerging from Animal Models with Perinatal Immune Activation,2015-11-27,"Kawasaki Disease (KD) is an acute inflammatory illness that mostly occurs in children below 5 years of age, with intractable fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and lesions of the coronary artery (CAL). KD is sharing clinical symptoms with systemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which is related to COVID-19. Certain genes are identified to be associated with KD, but the findings usually differ between countries and races. Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) allele types and toll-like receptor (TLR) expression are also correlated to KD. The acute hyperinflammation in KD is mediated by an imbalance between augmented T helper 17 (Th17)/Th1 responses with high levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and IP-10, in contrast to reduced Th2/Treg responses with lower IL-4, IL-5, FoxP3, and TGF-β expression. KD has varying phenotypic variations regarding age, gender, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance, macrophage activation and shock syndrome. The signs of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) can be interpreted as hyperferritinemia and thrombocytopenia contradictory to thrombocytosis in typical KD; the signs of KD with shock syndrome (KDSS) can be interpreted as overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and coagulopathy. For over five decades, IVIG and aspirin are the standard treatment for KD. However, some KD patients are refractory to IVIG required additional medications against inflammation. Further studies are proposed to delineate the immunopathogenesis of IVIG-resistance and KDSS, to identify high risk patients with genetic susceptibility, and to develop an ideal treatment regimen, such as by providing idiotypic immunoglobulins to curb cytokine storms, NO overproduction, and the epigenetic induction of Treg function.","Chang, Lung; Yang, Horng-Woei; Lin, Tang-Yu; Yang, Kuender D.",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350146/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.697632,187

The significance of the presence and infectivity of this virus on environmental surfaces, especially in a hospital setting, remains less clear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to analyze surface swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and infectivity, and to determine their suitability for sequence analysis. METHODS: Samples were collected during two waves of COVID-19 at the University of California, Davis Medical Center, in COVID-19 patient serving and staff congregation areas. qRT-PCR positive samples were investigated in Vero cell cultures for cytopathic effects and phylogenetically assessed by whole genome sequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission. Ours is the first report on recovering near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences directly from environmental surface swabs.","Coil, David A.; Albertson, Timothy; Banerjee, Shefali; Brennan, Greg; Campbell, A.

Apart from the velocity of money, fiscal multipliers tend to depend on average propensity to consume and average propensity to import of the economy as a whole and also on average tax rate among other things which are not reflected in the modern SVAR based estimation. Here, in the first place, we amend the algebraic definition of the fiscal multipliers considering the impact of velocity of money, provide a micro-foundation relating fiscal multipliers with money velocity and other macro variables and later propose a modification in the conventional SVAR set up by incorporating aforesaid macro variables arranged in a logical manner.

These studies assume the availability of a sufficient amount of human-annotated data to train models that can generalize to corresponding test data. In real-world situations, however, researchers often have limited or no in-house training data. Existing systems and external data can help jump-start deidentification on in-house data; however, the most efficient way of utilizing existing systems and external data is unclear. This article investigates the transferability of a state-of-the-art neural clinical deidentification system, NeuroNER, across a variety of datasets, when it is modified architecturally for domain generalization and when it is trained strategically for domain transfer. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a comparative study of the transferability of NeuroNER using 4 clinical note corpora with multiple note types from 2 institutions. We modified NeuroNER architecturally to integrate 2 types of domain generalization approaches. We evaluated each architecture using 3 training strategies. We measured transferability from external sources; transferability across note types; the contribution of external source data when in-domain training data are available; and transferability across institutions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Transferability from a single external source gave inconsistent results. Using additional external sources consistently yielded an F1-score of approximately 80%. Fine-tuning emerged as a dominant transfer strategy, with or without domain generalization. We also found that external sources were useful even in cases where in-domain training data were available. Transferability across institutions differed by note type and annotation label but resulted in improved performance.","Lee, Kahyun; Dobbins, Nicholas J; McInnes, Bridget; Yetisgen, Meliha; Uzuner, Özlem",Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34586386/,187

The absence of a specific antiviral drug or vaccination has promoted the development of immediate therapeutic responses against SARS-CoV-2. As increased levels of plasma chemokines and, cytokines and an uncontrolled influx of inflammatory cells were observed in lethal cases, it was concluded that the severity of the infection corresponded with the imbalanced host immunity against the virus. Tracing back the knowledge acquired from SERS and MERS infections, clinical evidence suggested similar host immune reactions and host ACE2 receptor-derived invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Further studies revealed the integral role of proteases (TMPRSS2, cathepsins, plasmin, etc.) in viral entry and the immune system. This review aims to provide a brief review on the latest research progress in identifying the potential role of proteases in SARS-CoV-2 viral spread and infection and combines it with already known information on the role of different proteases in providing an immune response. It further proposes a multidisciplinary clinical approach to target proteases specifically, through a combinatorial administration of protease inhibitors. This predictive review may help in providing a perspective to gain deeper insights of the proteolytic web involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral invasion and host immune response.","Seth, Sanchit; Batra, Jyotsna; Srinivasan, Srilakshmi",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33195400/,187

Besides the well known plant and animal-infecting ssDNA viruses, it has recently become apparent through metagenomic surveys of ssDNA molecules that there also exist large numbers of other diverse ssDNA viruses within almost all terrestrial and aquatic environments. The host ranges of these viruses probably span the tree of life and they are likely to be important components of global ecosystems. Various lines of evidence suggest that a pivotal evolutionary process during the generation of this global ssDNA virus diversity has probably been genetic recombination. High rates of homologous recombination, non-homologous recombination and genome component reassortment are known to occur within and between various different ssDNA virus species and we look here at the various roles that these different types of recombination may play, both in the day-to-day biology, and in the longer term evolution, of these viruses. We specifically focus on the ecological, biochemical and selective factors underlying patterns of genetic exchange detectable amongst the ssDNA viruses and discuss how these should all be considered when assessing the adaptive value of recombination during ssDNA virus evolution.","Martin, Darren P.; Biagini, Philippe; Lefeuvre, Pierre; Golden, Michael; Roumagnac, Philippe; Varsani, Arvind",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v3091699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21994803/,187

Many have since resumed services with an emphasis on catch-up vaccinations to reach children with missed vaccinations. This paper evaluated immunization disruptions during Indias March-May 2020 lockdown and the extent to which subsequent catch-up efforts reversed them in Rajasthan, India. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, we conducted phone surveys to collect immunization details for 2,144 children that turned one year old between January and October 2020. We used logistic regressions to compare differences in immunization timeliness and completed first-year immunization status among children that were due immunizations just before (unexposed), during (heavily exposed), and after (post-exposure) the lockdown. Results: Relative to unexposed children, heavily exposed children were significantly less likely to be immunized at or before 9 months (OR 0.550; 95%CI 0.367-0.824; p=0.004), but more likely to be immunized at 10-12 months (OR 1.761; 95%CI 1.196-2.591; p=0.004). They were also less likely to have completed their key first-year immunizations (OR 0.624; 95%CI 0.478-0.816; p=0.001) by the time of survey. In contrast, post-exposure children showed no difference in timeliness or completed first-year immunizations relative to unexposed children, and their immunization coverage was 6.9pp above heavily exposed children despite their younger age. Declines in immunization coverage were larger among children in households that were poorer, less educated, lower caste, and residing in COVID red zones, although subgroup comparisons were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Disruptions to immunization services resulted in children missing immunization during the lockdown, but catch-up efforts after it was eased ensured many children were reached at later ages. Nevertheless, catch-up was incomplete and children due their immunizations during the lockdown remained less likely to be fully immunized 4-5 months after it lifted, even as younger cohorts due immunizations in June or later returned to pre-lockdown schedules.","Jain, R.; Chopra, A.; Falezan, C.; Patel, M.; Dupas, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.20244327; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.20244327v1?rss=1,187

METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with ≥24 hours of inpatient admission, ≥24 hours of antibiotic therapy, and discharge/death from March to November 2020 at 201 US hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. Included patients had a test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a positive bacterial culture (gram-positive or gram-negative). We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the impact of inadequate empiric therapy (IET), defined as therapy not active against the identified bacteria or no antimicrobial therapy in the 48 hours following culture, on in-hospital mortality and hospital and intensive care unit length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Of 438 888 SARS-CoV-2-tested patients, 39 203 (8.9%) had positive bacterial cultures. Among patients with positive cultures, 9.4% were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 74.4% had a gram-negative pathogen, 25.6% had a gram-positive pathogen, and 44.1% received IET for the bacterial infection. The odds of mortality were 21% higher for IET (odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10–1.33; P < .001) compared with adequate empiric therapy. IET was also associated with increased hospital LOS (LOS, 16.1 days; 95% CI, 15.5–16.7 days; vs LOS, 14.5 days; 95% CI, 13.9–15.1 days; P < .001).

Herein, to identify potential antiviral agents, 97 natural amide-like compounds known as alkamides and piperamides were tested against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. The docking results showed that alkamides and dimeric piperamides from Piper species have a high binding affinity and potential antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile and Lipinski’s rule of five showed that dimeric piperamides have druglikeness potential. The molecular dynamics results showed that pipercyclobutanamide B forms a complex with Mpro at a similar level of stability than N3-I. Our overall results indicate that alkamides and piperamides, and specifically pipercyclobutanamide B, should be further studied as compounds with SARS-CoV-2 antiviral properties.","Gutierrez-Villagomez, Juan Manuel; Campos-García, Tonatiu; Molina-Torres, Jorge; López, Mercedes G.; Vázquez-Martínez, Juan",J Phys Chem Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32840378/; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c01685,187

661930,Supramolecular Architecture of the Coronavirus Particle,2016-09-15,"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the health of people from communities of color and people of limited socioeconomic means in a disproportionate way due to social determinants of health (SDoH). The Centers for Disease Control defines SDoH as the “conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play that affect a wide range of health and quality-of life-risks and outcomes.” A related construct, social determinants of learning (SDoL), includes contextual conditions and variables that impact students’ ability to optimally participate in their education, including academic and clinical development. SDoL directly impact students’ ability to participate in the educational process. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students struggling with SDoH and, by extension SDoL, may be more likely to have sick family members, caregiving responsibilities, food and housing insecurity, and obligations to supplement lost family wages. SDoL are also influenced by individual experiences within and outside of the classroom. Beyond bringing this matter to the attention of our profession, especially clinical and academic educators, we must take action to reach and support students who are at higher academic risk due to the SDoL. The purpose of this paper is to: (1) define SDoL, (2) explain how SDoL are impacting DPT and physical therapist assistant students, and (3) discuss actions that physical therapists and physical therapist assistants can take to mitigate the effects of SDoL on current DPT and physical therapist assistant students.","Felter, Cara E; Cicone, Jonathan; Mathis, Lindsey; Smith, Deanna L",Phys Ther,https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzab210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499180/,187
661999,Risk assessment and integrated surveillance of foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in Russia based on Monte Carlo simulation,2021-08-10,"Platelets are anucleate blood cells that play a crucial role in the maintenance of hemostasis. While platelet activation and elevated platelet counts (thrombocytosis) are associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications, low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and several platelet function disorders increase the risk of bleeding. Over the last years, more and more evidence has emerged that platelets and their activation state can also modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and low platelet counts have been identified as a surrogate marker for poor prognosis in septic patients. Viral infections often coincide with platelet activation. Host inflammatory responses result in the release of platelet activating mediators and a pro-oxidative and pro-coagulant environment, which favors platelet activation. However, viruses can also directly interact with platelets and megakaryocytes and modulate their function. Furthermore, platelets can be activated by viral antigen–antibody complexes and in response to some viruses B-lymphocytes also generate anti-platelet antibodies. All these processes contributing to platelet activation result in increased platelet consumption and removal and often lead to thrombocytopenia, which is frequently observed during viral infection. However, virus-induced platelet activation does not only modulate platelet count but also shape immune responses. Platelets and their released products have been reported to directly and indirectly suppress infection and to support virus persistence in response to certain viruses, making platelets a double-edged sword during viral infections. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on platelet interaction with different types of viruses, the viral impact on platelet activation, and platelet-mediated modulations of innate and adaptive immune responses.","Assinger, Alice",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566260/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00649,187
663211,Optimization of bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-estrase glycoprotein expression in E3 deleted bovine adenovirus-3,2000-11-08,"Recently, automatic computer-aided detection (CAD) of COVID-19 using radiological images has received a great deal of attention from many researchers and medical practitioners, and consequently several CAD frameworks and methods have been presented in the literature to assist the radiologist physicians in performing diagnostic COVID-19 tests quickly, reliably and accurately. This paper presents an innovative framework for the automatic detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray (CXR) images, in which a rich and effective representation of lung tissue patterns is generated from the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based textural features. The input CXR image is first preprocessed by spatial filtering along with median filtering and contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization to improve the CXR image's poor quality and reduce image noise. Automatic thresholding by the optimized formula of Otsu's method is applied to find a proper threshold value to best segment lung regions of interest (ROIs) out from CXR images. Then, a concise set of GLCM-based texture features is extracted to accurately represent the segmented lung ROIs of each CXR image. Finally, the normalized features are fed into a trained discriminative latent-dynamic conditional random fields (LDCRFs) model for fine-grained classification to divide the cases into two categories: COVID-19 and non-COVID-19. The presented method has been experimentally tested and validated on a relatively large dataset of frontal CXR images, achieving an average accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 95.88%, 96.17%, 94.45%, and 95.79%, respectively, which compare favorably with and occasionally exceed those previously reported in similar studies in the literature.","Bakheet, Samy; Al-Hamadi, Ayoub",Comput Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521005758?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104781; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521005758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455303/,187

Multiple cytokines have been implicated in CRS, but TNFSF14 (LIGHT) has not been previously measured in this setting. In this study, we observed significantly elevated serum LIGHT levels in hospitalized COVID-19 patients as compared to healthy age and gender matched control patients. The assay detected bioavailable LIGHT unbound to the inhibitor Decoy receptor-3 (DcR3). Bioavailable LIGHT levels were elevated in patients both on and off ventilatory support, with a trend toward higher levels in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In hospitalized patients over the age of 60, who exhibited a mortality rate of 82%, LIGHT levels were significantly higher (p=0.0209) in those who died compared to survivors. As previously reported, interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were also elevated in these patients with significantly (p=0.0076) higher levels observed in patients who died vs. survivors, paralleling the LIGHT levels. Although attempts to block IL-6 binding to its receptor have shown limited effect in COVID-19 CRS, neutralization of LIGHT may prove to be more effective owing to its more central role in regulating antiviral immune responses.","Perlin, D.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Medical records of 616 pneumonia patients who were admitted to the Yichang Central People’s Hospital in Hubei, China, from January 1 to March 23, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated in the dedicated COVID-19 units, and the patients with CAP were admitted to regular hospital campus. Risks of VTE were assessed using the Padua prediction score. All the patients received pharmaceutical or mechanical VTE prophylaxis. VTE was diagnosed using Duplex ultrasound or computed tomography pulmonary angiogram. Differences between COVID-19 and CAP groups were compared statistically. All statistical tests were 2 sided, and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant. All data managements and analyses were performed by IBM SPSS, version 24, software (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Of the 616 patients, 256 had COVID-19 pneumonia and 360 patients had CAP. The overall rate of VTE was 2% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 3.6% in CAP group, respectively (P=0.229). In these two groups, 15.6% of the COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 10% of the CAP patients were categorized as high risk for VTE (Padua score, >4), which were significantly different (P=0.036). In those high-risk patients, the incidence of VTE was 12.5% in COVID-19 pneumonia group and 16.7% in CAP group (P=0.606). Subgroup analysis of the critically ill patients showed that VTE rate was 6.7% in COVID-19 group versus 13% in CAP group (P=0.484). In-hospital mortality of COVID-19 and CAP was 6.3% and 3.9%, respectively (P=0.180). CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that COVID-19 pneumonia was associated with hypercoagulable state. However, the rate of VTE in COVID-19 pneumonia patients was not significantly higher than that in CAP patients.","Mei, Fei; Fan, Jiawei; Yuan, Jinhua; Liang, Zhenzhen; Wang, Kewei; Sun, Jianfeng; Guan, Wenfei; Huang, Mingkui; Li, Yu; Zhang, Wayne W.",Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.314779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628040/,187

It has been shown to exert cardioprotection against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, studies regarding its antihypertrophic property are still lacking, whether it demonstrates similar antihypertrophic effect to its metabolite, quercetin. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effects of both flavonoids on oxidative stress and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in H9c2 cardiomyocytes that were exposed to angiotensin II (Ang II) to induce hypertrophy. Cardiomyocytes were exposed to Ang II (600 nM) with or without quercetin (331 μM) or rutin (50 μM) for 24 h. A group given vehicle served as the control. The concentration of the flavonoids was chosen based on the reported effective concentration to reduce cell hypertrophy or cardiac injury in H9c2 cells. Exposure to Ang II increased cell surface area, intracellular superoxide anion level, NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities, and reduced cellular superoxide dismutase activity and nitrite level, which were similarly reversed by both rutin and quercetin. Rutin had no significant effects on phosphorylated proteins of extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2) and p38 but downregulated phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2), which were induced by Ang II. Quercetin, on the other hand, had significantly downregulated the phosphorylated proteins of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2. The quercetin inhibitory effect on JNK1/2 was stronger than the rutin. In conclusion, both flavonoids afford similar protective effects against Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, but they differently modulate MAPK pathway.","Siti, Hawa Nordin; Jalil, Juriyati; Asmadi, Ahmad Yusof; Kamisah, Yusof",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22105063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064664/,187

However, specific data on vaccination confidence, willingness or coverage among health care workers (HCWs) has been less reported. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted to specify the basic data and patterns of vaccination confidence, willingness and coverage among HCWs nationwide. Results: In total, 2386 out of 2583 (92.4%) participants were enrolled for analysis, and the rates of confidence in vaccine, professional institutes and government were 75.1%, 85.2% and 85.4%, respectively. The overall vaccination coverage rate was 63.6% which was adjusted as 82.8% for participants under current medical conditions or having contraindications. Confidence in vaccine safety was shown to be the most related factor to willingness among doctors, nurses, medical technicians and hospital administrators, while confidence in vaccine effectiveness as well as trust in government played the key role in formulating public health employees’ willingness. 130 (7.1% of 1833) participants reporting willingness still not been vaccinated regardless of contraindications. Multivariate analysis among willingness participants showed that males, aged over 30 years, public health employees and higher vaccination confidence had significantly higher vaccination rates with ORs (95% confidence intervals) as 1.64 (1.08–2.49), 3.14 (2.14–4.62), 2.43 (1.46–4.04) or 2.31 (1.24–4.33). Conclusions: HCWs’ confidence, willingness and coverage rates to the vaccine were generally at high levels. Heterogeneity among HCWs should be considered for future vaccination promotion strategies.

Methods In this retrospective study, we used survival analysis to determine whether or not mortality following intubation was associated with hormone exposure in patients treated at New York Presbyterian/ Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Here, we report the overall hazards ratio for each hormone for exposure before and after intubation for intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Results Among the 189,987 patients, we identified 948 intubation periods across 791 patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 or infected with SARS-CoV2 and 3,497 intubation periods across 2,981 patients who were not. Melatonin exposure after intubation was statistically associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.131, 95% CI: 7.76E-02 - 0.223, p-value = 8.19E-14) and non-COVID-19 (demographics and comorbidities adjusted HR: 0.278, 95% CI: 0.142 - 0.542, p-value = 1.72E-04) intubated patients.

669409,Induction of mucosal immune responses and protection against enteric viruses: rotavirus infection of gnotobiotic pigs as a model,2002-09-10,"The worldwide struggle against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a public health crisis continues to sweep across the globe. Up to now, effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 is not available. Therefore, throughout virus infections, a thorough clarification of the virus-host immune system interactions will be most probably helpful to encounter these challenges. Emerging evidence suggests that just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 primarily suppresses the innate immune system, enabling its stable propagation during the early stage of infection. Consequently, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been increasing during infection progression associated with severe lung pathology. It is imperative to consider hyper inflammation in vaccine designing, as vaccine-induced immune responses must have a protective role against infection without leading to immunopathology. Among the front-line responders to viral infections, Natural Killer (NK) cells have immense therapeutic potential, forming a bridge between innate and adaptive responses. A subset of NK cells exhibits putatively increased effector functions against viruses following pathogen-specific and immunization. Memory NK cells have higher cytotoxicity and effector activity, compared with the conventional NK cells. As a pioneering strategy, prompt accumulation and long‐term maintenance of these memory NK cells could be an efficacious viral treatment. According to the high prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection in the world, it remains to be determined whether HCMV adaptive NK cells could play a protective role against this new emerging virus. In addition, the new adaptive-like KIR+NKG2C+ NK cell subset (the adaptive-like lung tissue residue [tr]NK cell) in the context of the respiratory infection at this site could specifically exhibit the expansion upon COVID-19. Another aspect of NK cells we should note, utilizing modified NK cells such as allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-NK cells as a state-of-the-art strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. In this line, we speculate introducing NKG2C into chimeric antigen receptors in NK cells might be a potential approach in future viral immunotherapy for emerging viruses. In this contribution, we will briefly discuss the current status and future perspective of NK cells, which provide to successfully exploit NK cell-mediated antiviral activity that may offer important new tools in COVID-19 treatment.","Soleimanian, Saeede; Yaghobi, Ramin",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32973527/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01309,187

Implications of this modality are extensive. Seamless integration into advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) has potential to improve resuscitation outcomes, and there is growing impetus for its implementation during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. However, it remains underutilized largely due to limited training. We use high-fidelity simulation and a novel 4W approach (when to apply POCUS, where to place the ultrasound probe, what images mean, what to do next) to incorporate this technique into resuscitation training. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a novel 4W POCUS approach for training anesthesiology residents in the setting of resuscitation. Methods Our approach teaches learners when and where to implement POCUS, how to interpret their findings, and how to apply these findings in a clinical setting. Learners apply this method in high-fidelity simulation to diagnose and treat cardiopulmonary pathologies. Assessments were administered before and after training to evaluate efficacy. Results Post-test improvements were appreciated across all residency classes (n = 23), with achieved significance of P < 0.001 in the first-year clinical anesthesia class (CA-1) and P = 0.02 in the second-year clinical anesthesia class (CA-2). Performance was further subdivided into five categories: resuscitation integration, lung ultrasound, transthoracic echo, disease recognition, and treatment. Post-test scores also improved in each category, with lung ultrasound being the most significant improvement (P = 0.04). Conclusions Our initial data demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to POCUS training. Performance is improved and learners are more likely to use POCUS in the future. The application of this method to larger sample sizes is an appropriate next step to demonstrate its utility.","Wang, Hong; Uraco, Adam M; Stover, Justin; Hollis, Nicole",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850225/,187

This note focuses on some potential effects on the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 ‘Zero Hunger’ (Target 2.1) and, specifically, on the prevalence of undernourishment. After discussing the main changes induced by the Covid19 outbreak in various dimensions of food security, as identified by the preliminary literature on the topic, the note presents the dynamic estimates (GMM) of the recent determinants of food security, measured through the prevalence of undernourishment (SDG indicator 2.1.1), using a sample of 84 developing countries observed over the period 2000–2017. Since the rate of economic growth turns out to be a relevant determinant, the analysis quantifies the potential consequences that the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may have on the short- and long-run achievements of SDG 2 if proper counterbalancing measures will not be implemented. Such consequences in the short run would consist of millions of new undernourished people, while in the long run the progress made towards the ‘Zero Hunger’ goal are at risk of being completely reversed in the majority of countries.

This report presents fifteen patients who had COVID-19 respiratory illness followed by cerebrovascular events. A call by the Iranian Neurological Association gathered cases accros the country who developed neurological symptoms attributed to hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke after a definite or probable COVID-19 respiratory illness. Definite cases were those with a typical respiratory illness, positive nasopharyngeal COVID-19 PCR test and chest CT consistent with COVID-19 infection. Probable cases were defined by a typical respiratory illness, history of contacts with a COVID-19 case and chest CT charachteristic for COVID-19 infection. Fifteen patients (12 men and 3 women) with age range of 38 to 93 years-old (median: 65 years-old) were included. Fourteen patients had first ever acute ischemic stroke and one patient had subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients (73%) had previous cardiovascular comorbidities. Median time between respiratory symptoms and neurological symptoms was seven days (range 1-16 days). Stroke severity in two patients was mild (NIHSS ≤ 6), in six patients moderate (NIHSS: 7-12) and in seven patients severe (NIHSS ≥13). One patient received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) with improved neurological symptoms. Six out of 15 patients (40%) died. All but one of those who survived had significant disability assessed by modified ranking scale >2. The majority of patients in this case series had vascular risk factors and their stroke was associated with severe disability and death.

672199,Meta-transcriptomics and the evolutionary biology of RNA viruses,2018-01-02,"Wild foods contribute to the food security of multiple communities in tropical areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America. However, wild foods are not regularly considered in the planning of strategies for food and nutrition security mainly due to the lack of technical and/or scientific knowledge so that they can be considered suitable for human consumption. This paper proposes a multidisciplinary method that estimates the potential of wild foods as alternative resources when planning interventions in favour of food and nutrition security in tropical forest territories. When designing the method, four dimensions were identified in science, technology and innovation (STI) that define this potential as well as ten assessment criteria. The wild foods chosen for applying the method were Alibertia patinoi (a fruit commonly known as Borojó) and Proechimys semispinosus (Mouse of thorns), which are two of the main wild foods traditionally used by human communities in a tropical forest territory in the northwest of Colombia. In both cases, although there are significant advances in STI, compliance with some criteria is still required to regard them as viable alternatives for nutrition and food security within this territory. This research is useful for promoting the inclusion of wild food in food security programmes for communities where this food is already included in their traditional pattern of consumption and identifies the progress needed in STI to achieve this purpose. It may also promote the early recognition of possible traditional and cultural practices with high risk of transmission of pathogenic elements by the handling and/or inadequate consumption of wild foods. This early recognition could contribute to the prevention of diseases of wild animal origin, including those of rapid global spread.","Asprilla-Perea, Jeferson; Díaz-Puente, José M.; Martín-Fernández, Susana",Ambio,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34533766/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-021-01624-9,187

There is little evidence regarding the feasibility of universal, asymptomatic testing to help control outbreaks in this population. This study aimed to pilot mass COVID-19 testing on a university research park, to assess the feasibility and acceptability of scaling up testing to all staff and students. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional feasibility study on a university research park in the East of England. All staff and students (5625) were eligible to participate. All participants were offered four PCR swabs, which they self-administered over two weeks. Outcome measures included uptake, drop-out rate, positivity rates, participant acceptability measures, laboratory processing measures, data collection and management measures. RESULTS: 798 (76%) of 1053 who registered provided at least one swab; 687 (86%) provided all four; 792 (99%) of 798 who submitted at least one swab had all negative results and 6 participants had one inconclusive result. There were no positive results. 458 (57%) of 798 participants responded to a post-testing survey, demonstrating a mean acceptability score of 4.51/5, with five being the most positive.

Thus, an electronic search of the literature, in two well-known databases (PubMed and Web of Science), was performed until February 2021 (without date restriction). PRISMA guideline methodology was employed and data regarding the HRQoL were extracted from eligible studies. Articles were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: (a) children and/or adolescent population (4 to 19 years old); (b) HRQoL as a main assessment; (c) German, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and English language; and (d) pre-pandemic and during pandemic HRQoL data. Following the initial search, 241 possible related articles were identified. A total of 79 articles were identified as duplicates. Moreover, 129 articles were removed after reading the title and abstract. Of the remaining 33 articles, 27 were removed since they were not focused on children or adolescents (n = 19), articles did not report pre- and post- pandemic HRQoL values (n = 6), articles were not focused on HRQoL (n = 6), and one article was an editorial. Finally, six studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and, therefore, were included in the systematic review. A total of 3177 children and/or adolescents during COVID-19 were included in this systematic review. Three articles showed that COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the HRQoL of children and adolescents, and another did not report comparison between pre- and during COVID-19 pandemic, although a reduction in the HRQoL can be observed. Nevertheless, two articles did not find significant changes and another one did not report p-values. Regarding sex differences, only two studies analyzed this topic, observing no differences between girls and boys in the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on HRQoL. Taking into account these results, this systematic review might confirm that COVID-19 has a negative impact on the HRQoL of children and/or adolescents.","Nobari, Hadi; Fashi, Mohamad; Eskandari, Arezoo; Villafaina, Santos; Murillo-Garcia, Álvaro; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33923120/,187

However, its efficacy is debated and toxicity concerns might limit the therapeutic range of this drug. Computational models that aid in balancing efficacy and toxicity would be of great help. Parametrizing models is difficult because the prodrug remdesivir is metabolized to its active form (RDV-TP) upon cell entry, which complicates dose-activity relationships. Here, we employ a computational model that allows predicting drug efficacy based on the binding affinity of RDV-TP for its target polymerase in SARS-CoV-2. We identify an optimal infusion rate to maximize remdesivir efficacy. We also assess drug efficacy in suppressing both wild-type and resistant strains, and thereby selection of resistance. Our results differ from predictions using prodrug dose-response curves (pseudo-EC50s). We expect that reaching 90% inhibition (EC90) is insufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 in lungs. While standard dosing mildly inhibits viral polymerase and therefore likely reduces morbidity, we also expect selection for resistant mutants for most realistic parameter ranges. To increase efficacy and safeguard against resistance, we recommend continuing remdesivir use with companion antivirals and/or with dosing regimens that substantially increase the levels of RDV-TP.","Conway, J.

However, an organic model is still missing. Here, we propose a new model that takes into account common and rare germline variants applied in a cohort of 1,300 Italian SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. Ordered logistic regression of clinical WHO grading on sex and age was used to obtain a binary phenotypic classification. Genetic variability from WES was synthesized in several boolean representations differentiated according to allele frequencies and genotype effect. LASSO logistic regression was used for extracting relevant genes. We defined about 100 common driver polymorphisms corresponding to classical -threshold model-. Extracted genes were demonstrated to be gender specific. Stochastic rare more penetrant events on about additional 100 extracted genes, when occurred in a medium or severe background (common within the family), simulate Mendelian inheritance in 14% of subjects (having only 1 mutation) or oligogenic inheritance (in 10% having 2 mutations, in 11% having 3 mutations, etc). The combined effect of common and rare results can be described as an integrated polygenic score computed as: (nseverity-nmildness) +F (mseverity-mmildness) where n is the number of common driver genes, m is the number of driver rare variants and F is a factor for appropriately weighing the more powerful rare variants. We called the model -post-Mendelian-. The model well describes the cohort, and patients are clustered in severe or mild by the integrated polygenic scores, the F factor being calibrated around 2, with a prediction capacity of 65% in males and 70% in females. In conclusion, this is the first comprehensive model interpreting host genetics in a holistic post-Mendelian manner.

Global health care now faces unprecedented challenges with widespread and rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and high morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 worldwide. Across the world, medical care is hampered by a critical shortage of not only hand sanitizers, personal protective equipment, ventilators, and hospital beds, but also impediments to the blood supply. Blood donation centers in many areas around the globe have mostly closed. Donors, practicing social distancing, some either with illness or undergoing self-quarantine, are quickly diminishing. Drastic public health initiatives have focused on containment and “flattening the curve” while invaluable resources are being depleted. In some countries, the point has been reached at which the demand for such resources, including donor blood, outstrips the supply. Questions as to the safety of blood persist. Although it does not appear very likely that the virus can be transmitted through allogeneic blood transfusion, this still remains to be fully determined. As options dwindle, we must enact regional and national shortage plans worldwide and more vitally disseminate the knowledge of and immediately implement patient blood management (PBM).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, they also keep the pressure off hospitals. PHCPs are assumed to be at high risk of a COVID-19 infection, as they are exposed to a large portion of the population (usually with less personal protective equipment than other frontline health care workers(HCWs)). Nevertheless, previous seroprevalence studies focussed on the general population or HCWs in hospital settings, rather than PHCPs. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of PHCPs after the first and during the second SARS-CoV-2 wave in Flanders (Belgium) and compare it to the seroprevalence in the general population (blood donors). A prospective cohort of PHCPs, mainly GPs (n=698) was screened for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 at five different time-points (June-December 2020). The dried blood spots they produced were analysed using a Luminex multiplex immunoassay. The seroprevalence of PHCPs remained stable between June and September 2020 (4.6-5.0%), but increased significantly from October to December (8.1-13.4%) 2020. The seroprevalence of PHCPs was not significantly higher than the seroprevalence of the blood donors at the end of December 2020. In conclusion, the sharp increase in seroprevalence during the second COVID-19 wave in Flanders shows that PHCPs were more at risk during the second wave compared to the first one. However, the increase was in line with the general population suggesting that PHCPs mainly got infected in their private settings.","Marien, j.; Ceulemans, A.; Bakokimi, D.; Lammens, C.; Ieven, M.; Heytens, S.; De Sutter, A.; Van den Bruel, A.; Goossens, H.; Van Damme, P.; Arien, K.

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg−1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells.

The proposed system is based on ShuffleNet and SqueezeNet architecture to extract deep learned features and Multiclass Support Vector Machines (MSVM) for detection and classification. Our dataset contains 1200 CRIs that collected from two different publicly available databases. Extensive experiments were carried out using the proposed model. The highest detection accuracy of 100% for COVID/NonCOVID, 99.72% for COVID/Normal/pneumonia and 94.44% for COVID/Normal/Bacterial pneumonia/Viral pneumonia have been obtained. The proposed system superior all published methods in recall, specificity, precision, F1-Score and accuracy. Confusion Matrix (CM) and Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC) analysis are also used to depict the performance of the proposed model. Hence the proposed COVIDetection-Net can serve as an efficient system in the current state of COVID-19 pandemic and can be used in everywhere that are facing shortage of test kits.","Elkorany, Ahmed S.; Elsharkawy, Zeinab F.",Optik (Stuttg),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0030402621001388; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030402621001388?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.166405,187

680900,Interferon-gamma response of PBMC indicates productive pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in swine,2004-12-28,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the present COVID-19 global pandemic, is known to bind to the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in human cells. A possible treatment of COVID-19 could involve blocking ACE2 and/or disabling the spike protein on the virus. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to test the binding affinities of nine candidate compounds. Of these, three drugs showed significant therapeutic potential that warrant further investigation: SN35563, a ketamine ester analogue, was found to bind strongly to the ACE2 receptor but weakly within the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD); in contrast, arbidol and hydroxychloroquine bound preferentially with the spike RBD rather than ACE2. A fourth drug, remdesivir, bound approximately equally to both the ACE2 and viral spike RBD, thus potentially increasing risk of viral infection by bringing the spike protein into closer proximity to the ACE2 receptor. We suggest more experimental investigations to test that SN35563-in combination with arbidol or hydroxychloroquine-might act synergistically to block viral cell entry by providing therapeutic blockade of the host ACE2 simultaneous with reduction of viral spike receptor-binding; and that this combination therapy would allow the use of smaller doses of each drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We analyzed >4,700 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and associated meta-data retrieved from public repositories. SARS-CoV-2 sequences have a high sequence identity (>99.9%), which drops to >96% when compared to bat coronavirus. We built a mutation-annotated reference SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny with two main macro-haplogroups, A and B, both of Asian origin, and >160 sub-branches representing virus strains of variable geographical origins worldwide, revealing a uniform mutation occurrence along branches that could complicate the design of future vaccines. The root of SARS-CoV-2 genomes locates at the Chinese haplogroup B1, with a TMRCA dating to 12 November 2019 - thus matching epidemiological records. Sub-haplogroup A2a originates in China and represents the major non-Asian outbreak.

Saliva samples from healthy dogs and dogs with severe parvovirosis that survived or perished due to the disease were analysed and compared by Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) analysis. Proteomic analysis quantified 1516 peptides, and 287 (corresponding to 190 proteins) showed significantly different abundances between studied groups. Ten proteins were observed to change significantly between dogs that survived or perished due to PVE. Bioinformatics’ analysis revealed that saliva reflects the involvement of different pathways in PVE such as catalytic activity and binding, and indicates antimicrobial humoral response as a pathway with a major role in the development of the disease. These results indicate that saliva proteins reflect physiopathological changes that occur in PVE and could be a potential source of biomarkers for this disease.","Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Horvatić, Anita; Guillemin, Nicolas; Cerón, José Joaquín; Escribano, Damián; Eckersall, David; Kocatürk, Meriç; Yilmaz, Zeki; Lamy, Elsa; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Mrljak, Vladimir",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2018.09.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0147957118300742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30396423/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147957118300742,187
683445,Psychophysical Effects of Nasal and Oral Inflammation,2009-08-04,"BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are the most prevalent mental health concern among older adults (possibly heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic), which raises questions about how such symptoms can be lowered in this population. Existing research shows that offline social connectedness is a protective factor against depression in older adults; however, it is unknown whether web-based social connectedness can have similar effects. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates whether social connectedness on a support website protects older adults against depressive symptoms over the course of a year, above and beyond the protective effect of offline social connectedness. The secondary aim is to determine whether older adults with increased depressive symptoms are more likely to engage in social connectedness on this website. Thus, we examine depressive symptoms as both an outcome and predictor of web-based social connectedness to fully understand the chain of causality among these variables. Finally, we compare web-based social connectedness with offline social connectedness in their ability to lower depressive symptoms among older adults. METHODS: A total of 197 adults aged 65 years or older were given access to a social support website, where they were able to communicate with each other via a discussion forum for a year. Participants’ social connectedness on the web-based platform, conceptualized as message production and consumption, was measured using behavioral log data as the number of messages participants wrote and read, respectively, during the first 6 months (t(1)) and the following 6 months (t(2)) of the study. Participants self-reported their offline social connectedness as the number of people in their support networks, and they reported their depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 both at baseline (t(1)) and at 12-month follow-up (t(2)). To ascertain the flow of causality between these variables, we employed a cross-lagged panel design, in which all variables were measured at t(1) and t(2). RESULTS: After controlling for the effect of offline support networks at t(1), web-based message consumption at t(1) decreased older adults’ depressive symptoms at t(2) (β=−.11; P=.02), but web-based message production at t(1) did not impact t(2) depressive symptoms (β=.12; P=.34). Web-based message consumption had a larger effect (β=−.11; P=.02) than offline support networks (β=−.08; P=.03) in reducing older adults’ depressive symptoms over time. Higher baseline depressive symptoms did not predict increased web-based message consumption (β=.12; P=.36) or production (β=.02; P=.43) over time. CONCLUSIONS: The more messages older adults read on the web-based forum for the first 6 months of the study, the less depressed they felt at the 1-year follow-up, above and beyond the availability of offline support networks at baseline. This pinpoints the substantial potential of web-based communication to combat depressive symptoms in this vulnerable population.

683919,Complementation and recombination between Alfalfa Mosaic Virus RNA3 mutants in tobacco plants,1991-08-31,"Background COVID-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its’ first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known. Methods Available data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination. Findings All the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body. Interpretation The fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).","Banerjee, Shuvam; Dhar, Shrinjana; Bhattacharjee, Sandip; Bhattacharjee, Pritha",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.06.027854,187

684339,Inverse folding of RNA pseudoknot structures,2010-06-23,"Alcohol abuse along with difficulties in communication has led to increased morbidity and mortality among patients with psychiatric disorders. This issue has a higher importance during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection such as self-quarantine, hand washing, covering mouth and nose while coughing may be difficult to enforce in patients with mental illnesses. There is a controversy in discharge and management of patients with history of alcohol abuse and psychiatric disorders when they come to the Emergency Departments with mild presentation of COVID-19. We discussed a 39 years old patient known case of paranoid schizophrenia who came to the Emergency Department (ED) with mild fever, cough and headache. She was soon discharged from the ED after having a normal chest radiograph. She was recommended to be in self-quarantine for at least 14 days. Her COVID-19 condition deteriorated rapidly in a week, and she was brought back to the ED after she had an altercation with her friends while drinking. Patients with psychiatric disorders especially schizophrenia or those who have been diagnosed with alcohol abuse may have a higher risk for progression of their mild COVID-19 to a severe form. On the other hand, they have a role in the spread of COVID-19 in the community due to lower compliance with preventive recommendations. A higher rate of alcohol abuse in psychiatric patients and their lower compliance to self-quarantine calls for a different approach when they come to the ED with COVID-19 presentations.","Haddadi, Sara; Murthi, Mukunthan; Salloum, Ihsan; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi S.",Respir Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32953449/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2020.101222; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007120304366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007120304366?v=s5,187

In this manuscript, each community is modeled as a multiplex network (i.e., virtual layer and physical one). The connections inside certain community are referred as inter-contacts while the intra-contacts denote the connections among communities. For the epidemic spreading process, the traditional susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is adopted. Then, corresponding state transition trees are determined and simulations are conducted to study the epidemic spreading process in multi-communities. Here, the effect of incorporating virtual layer on the range of individual affected by the epidemic is pursued. As illustrated, multi-summits are incurred if the spreading in multi-communities is considered; furthermore, the disparity between summits varies. This is affected by various factors. As indicated, the incorporation of virtual layer is capable of reducing the proportion of individuals being affected; moreover, disparity of different summits is likely to be increased regarding with scenarios of excluding virtual layer. Furthermore, the summit is likely to be postponed if virtual layer is incorporated.","Zhu, Peican; Wang, Xing; Zhi, Qiang; Ma, Jiezhong; Guo, Yangming",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077918300493; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077918300493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288353/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2018.02.007,187

METHODS: Observational, retrospective study from January 2014 to June 2018, that included paediatric patients admitted with a diagnosis of CAP in a tertiary hospital, in which antigenic tests and/or viral PCR on a respiratory sample was performed. RESULTS: A total of 105 CAP episodes were included, with identification of a respiratory virus in 93 (88.6%) cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) detection had a lower onset of empirical antibiotic therapy (35.1% vs. 55.9%, P-value=.042). In addition, cases with RSV or influenza identification required shorter duration of antibiotic therapy (receiving 45.6% ≥2 days vs. 68.8% of those not identified, P=.017).

We considered the effects of COVID‐19‐induced social isolation on cognitive function within a representative sample of the general population. We additionally considered how participants ‘shielding’ due to underlying health complications, or living alone, performed. We predicted that performance would be poorest under strictest, most‐isolating conditions. At five timepoints over 13 weeks, participants (N = 342; aged 18–72 years) completed online tasks measuring attention, memory, decision‐making, time‐estimation, and learning. Participants indicated their mood as ‘lockdown’ was eased. Performance typically improved as opportunities for social contact increased. Interactions between participant sub‐groups and timepoint demonstrated that performance was shaped by individuals' social isolation levels. Social isolation is linked to cognitive decline in the absence of ageing covariates. The impact of social isolation on cognitive function should be considered when implementing prolonged pandemic‐related restrictive conditions.","Ingram, Joanne; Hand, Christopher J.; Maciejewski, Greg",Appl Cogn Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1002/acp.3821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230768/,187

Lung ultrasonography has emerged as a promising imaging modality during the pandemic, but there is still a paucity of systematic analysis of lung ultrasound findings. In this retrospective observational study, 12 Zone ultrasound scans of COVID-19 positive patients were systematically analysed for pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, B lines, deep consolidations and effusions. Lung abnormalities were analysed according to overall frequency, frequency distribution in coronal and sagittal lung planes and were also correlated to clinical severity groups as determined by oxygenation deficit. Our results show that lung zones with abnormalities can occur juxtaposed to normal lung. Irregular pleural and small subpleural consolidations appear ubiquitously distributed throughout both lungs and occur early in the disease process. Wide B-lines are a predominant feature in COVID-19 infection. B-lines are found in a variety of patterns with number and width correlated to disease severity. In our analysis we also describe a previously unrecognised finding of small peri-pleural effusions in 8.7% of scans occurring in all areas of the lung.

689615,Oropouche virus entry into HeLa cells involves clathrin and requires endosomal acidification(),2008-10-28,"We have developed and evaluated a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for the detection of human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) in clinical specimens. This assay was developed in response to the unprecedented 2014 nationwide EV-D68 outbreak in the United States associated with severe respiratory illness. As part of our evaluation of the outbreak, we sequenced and published the genome sequence of the EV-D68 virus circulating in St. Louis, MO. This sequence, along with other GenBank sequences from past EV-D68 occurrences, was used to computationally select a region of EV-D68 appropriate for targeting in a strain-specific RT-PCR assay. The RT-PCR assay amplifies a segment of the VP1 gene, with an analytic limit of detection of 4 copies per reaction, and it was more sensitive than commercially available assays that detect enteroviruses and rhinoviruses without distinguishing between the two, including three multiplex respiratory panels approved for clinical use by the FDA. The assay did not detect any other enteroviruses or rhinoviruses tested and did detect divergent strains of EV-D68, including the first EV-D68 strain (Fermon) identified in California in 1962. This assay should be useful for identifying and studying current and future outbreaks of EV-D68 viruses.","Wylie, Todd N.; Wylie, Kristine M.; Buller, Richard S.; Cannella, Maria; Storch, Gregory A.",J Clin Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00923-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26063859/,187
689948,Benzotriazole: An overview on its versatile biological behavior,2015-06-05,"As with all viruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) utilizes specific host cell factors during its infection cycle. Some of these factors have been identified and are now increasingly scrutinized as targets to intervene with infection. In this brief review, we describe the current understanding of how the SARS‐CoV is able to use the cellular machinery for its replication.","De Haan, Cornelis A. M.; Rottier, Peter J.

690221,Identification of the spinal cord as a major site of persistence during during chronic infection with a murine coronavirus,1990-04-30,"This research aimed to quantify the racial disparities of COVID-19 for primarily positive tests and deaths across the US and territories individually and collectively. The first research hypothesis investigated whether positive cases and death rates were higher for people of color (POC) than the White ethnic group. The second hypothesis examined whether there is a significant difference in confirmed positive cases and death rates between ethnic groups across the US and territories. The third hypothesis investigated if political party control and governmental policies affected the number of cases and death proportion rates across ethnic groups. The research findings suggest that POC positive cases and death rates were higher in some states. Black ethnic groups were dying at a high rate in the southeastern states, the District of Columbia, and in Maryland. Specifically, in the District of Columbia, the death rate is five times higher than the White ethnic group. For Latinx ethnic groups, the high cases and death rates have mostly occurred in western states, including Texas. The Latinx ethnic group accounted for half the total deaths in Texas and California. The Latinx ethnic group death rate is higher than the White ethnic group in four states: Texas, California, New Mexico, and the District of Columbia. The research findings also show that the rate of deaths and cases per ethnic group for policies and political factors were significant except for the mask mandate policy. Based on the analyzed data, mask mandates were not a factor in the cases or death rates of any ethnic group. Each state’s policies for bars, curfews, public schools, and travel—along with legislative party control—had the most influences across ethnic groups. The research results for the death rates and number of cases due to these implemented policies varied between ethnic groups.","Hamilton, Michael A.; Hamilton, Danielle; Soneye, Oluwatamilore; Ayeyemi, Olorunshola; Jaradat, Raed",Int J Data Sci Anal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41060-021-00284-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604504/,187
690469,The Kynurenine Pathway—New Linkage between Innate and Adaptive Immunity in Autoimmune Endocrinopathies,2021-09-13,"Medical mistrust, a result of systemic racism, is prevalent among Black Americans and may play a role in COVID-19 inequities. In a convenience sample of HIV-positive Black Americans, we examined associations of COVID-19-related medical mistrust with COVID-19 vaccine and COVID-19 treatment hesitancy and negative impacts of COVID-19 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. METHODS: Participants were 101 HIV-positive Black Americans (age: M = 50.3 years; SD = 11.5; 86% cisgender men; 77% sexual minority) enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of a community-based ART adherence intervention in Los Angeles County, CA. From May to July 2020, participants completed telephone interviews on negative COVID-19 impacts, general COVID-19 mistrust (eg, about the government withholding information), COVID-19 vaccine and treatment hesitancy, and trust in COVID-19 information sources. Adherence was monitored electronically with the Medication Event Monitoring System. RESULTS: Nearly all participants (97%) endorsed at least one general COVID-19 mistrust belief, and more than half endorsed at least one COVID-19 vaccine or treatment hesitancy belief. Social service and health care providers were the most trusted sources. Greater COVID-19 mistrust was related to greater vaccine and treatment hesitancy [b (SE) = 0.85 (0.14), P < 0.0001 and b (SE) = 0.88 (0.14), P < 0.0001, respectively]. Participants experiencing more negative COVID-19 impacts showed lower ART adherence, assessed among a subset of 49 participants [b (SE) = −5.19 (2.08), P = 0.02]. DISCUSSION: To prevent widening health inequities, health care providers should engage with communities to tailor strategies to overcome mistrust and deliver evidence-based information, to encourage COVID-19 vaccine and treatment uptake.","Bogart, Laura M.; Ojikutu, Bisola O.; Tyagi, Keshav; Klein, David J.; Mutchler, Matt G.; Dong, Lu; Lawrence, Sean J.; Thomas, Damone R.; Kellman, Sarah",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,https://doi.org/10.1097/qai.0000000000002570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196555/,187
