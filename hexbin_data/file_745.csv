In this chapter, we review ecological concepts, and discuss their relevance to health, with an emphasis on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Despite the fact that most EIDs originate in wildlife, few studies account for the population, community, or ecosystem ecology of the host, reservoir, or vector. The dimensions of ecological approaches to public health that we propose in this chapter are, in essence, networks of population dynamics, community structure, and ecosystem matrices incorporating concepts of complexity, resilience, and biogeochemical processes.","Preston, Nicholas D.; Daszak, Peter; Colwell, Rita R.",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,745,17

As a measuring device, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector, modeled as a qubit that interacts for a long time with a massless Klein-Gordon field in the vacuum state. The temperatures in each case (i) - (v) are functions of up to three invariant quantities: curvature or proper acceleration, κ, torsion, b, and hypertorsion, ν, and except for the case (i), they depend on the transition frequency difference of the detector, ω. We investigate numerically the behavior of the frequency-dependent temperatures for different values of κ, b, and ν along the stationary worldlines (ii) - (v) and evaluate analytically the regimes where the temperatures recorded along the different worldlines coincide with each other in terms of relevant asymptotic limits for κ, b, or ν, and discuss their physical meaning. We demonstrate that the temperatures in cases (ii) - (v) dip under the Unruh temperature at low frequencies and go above the Unruh temperature for large |ω|.

The added values come from the ability of vendors to enable customer-specific business advantage for every different tenant who uses the same main enterprise software product. Software vendors need novel customization solutions for Cloud-based multi-tenant SaaS. In this paper, we present an event-based approach in a non-intrusive customization framework that can enable customization for multi-tenant SaaS and address the problem of too many API calls to the main software product. The experimental results on Microsoft’s eShopOnContainers show that our approach can empower an event bus with the ability to customize the flow of processing events, and integrate with tenant-specific microservices for customization. We have shown how our approach makes sure of tenant-isolation, which is crucial in practice for SaaS vendors. This direction can also reduce the number of API calls to the main software product, even when every tenant has different customization services.","Nordli, Espen Tønnessen; Nguyen, Phu H.; Chauvel, Franck; Song, Hui",Coordination Models and Languages,745,1

The emphasis of palliative care is on optimizing quality of life and provided support for patients nearing end of life. However, chemotherapy is often offered as a palliative therapy for patients with advanced cancer nearing death. The purpose of this review was to evaluate the state of the science relative to use of palliative chemotherapy and maintenance of quality of life in patients with advanced cancer who were at end of life. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published research from January 2010 to December 2019 was reviewed using PRISMA guidelines using PubMed, Proquest, ISI web of science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. MeSH keywords including quality of life, health related quality of life, cancer chemotherapy, drug therapy, end of life care, palliative care, palliative therapy, and palliative treatment. FINDINGS: 13 studies were evaluated based on inclusion criteria. Most of these studies identified that reduced quality of life was associated with receipt of palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced cancer at the end of life. CONCLUSION: Studies have primarily been conducted in European and American countries. Cultural background of patients may impact quality of life at end of life.

We included 2827 adult patients with HAP from the Chinese Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections network admitted in 15 Chinese teaching hospitals between 2007 and 2016. Clinical data and antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated pathogens were obtained from the medical records and central laboratory, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the risk factors for mortality and multidrug resistance (MDR). A total of 386 (13.7%) patients died in the hospital, while 1181 (41.8%) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Active immunosuppressant therapy (OR 1.915 (95% CI 1.475–2.487)), solid tumor (OR 1.860 (95% CI 1.410–2.452)), coma (OR 1.783 (95% CI 1.364–2.333)), clinical pulmonary infection score ≥7 (OR 1.743 (95% CI 1.373–2.212)), intensive care unit stay (OR 1.652 (95% CI 1.292–2.111)), age ≥65 years (OR 1.621 (95% CI 1.282–2.049)), and tracheal cannula insertion (OR 1.613 (95% CI 1.169–2.224)) were independent risk factors for in-hospital mortality. Liver cirrhosis (OR 3.120 (95% CI 1.436–6.780)) and six other variables were independent predictors of MDR. Acinetobacter baumannii (25.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (12.6%) were the most common pathogens (MDR prevalence 64.9%). Isolates from VAP patients showed more A. baumannii and less K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains (p < 0.001, respectively) than those from patients without VAP. The proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains decreased; that of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and Enterobacterales strains increased. There had been changes in the antibiotic resistance profiles of HAP pathogens in China. Risk factors for mortality and MDR are important for the selection of antimicrobials for HAP in China.

In particular, lactoferrin restores iron homeostasis and inhibits replication of SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Ovotransferrin has antiviral peptides and activities that are shared with lactoferrin.

One starting point for those practicing acute neurology and neurocritical care is a new mnemonic TELL ME (Time course, Essence, Laboratory, Life-sustaining interventions, Management, Expectation), which will assist physicians in standardizing their communication skills before they start a conversation or pick up a phone. These include knowing the time course (new and ""out of the blue"" or ongoing for some time); extracting the essentials (eliminating all irrelevancies); communicating what tests are known and pending (computerized tomography and laboratory); relaying how much critical support will be needed (secretion burden, intubation, vasopressors); knowing fully which emergency drugs have been administered (e.g., mannitol, antiepileptics, tranexamic acid), when transport is anticipated, and what can be expected in the following hours.

First, the article will analyse the responsibilities of drafters in drafting subordinate legislations and the techniques therein; the discussion will be contextualized within a need for urgent public health responses to combat the pandemic. Second, the powers conferred upon law enforcement officers and restrictions on individual liberty under Hong Kong law and English law will be analysed.

METHODS: A research consortium led by WHO Collaboration Centre for Research in Surgical Care Delivery in Low and Middle Income countries, India, conducted this retrospective cross-sectional study in 12 hospitals across the country. We compared the anaesthesia preferences during pandemic (April 2020) to a corresponding pre pandemic period (April 2019) RESULTS: A total of 636 out of 2,162 (29.4%) and 156 out of 927 (16.8%) surgeries were performed under GA in April 2019 and April 2020 respectively, leading to a fall of 13% in usage of GA. A 5% reduction in GA and a 12% increase in the usage of regional anaesthesia was observed for cesarean sections. There was no significant change in anesthesia for laparotomies and fracture surgeries. However, 14% increase in GA usage was observed in surgeries for local soft tissue infections and necrotic tissues. CONCLUSION: Though overall usage of GA reduced marginally, the change was mainly contributed by anesthesia for caesarean births. The insignificant change in anaesthesia for other surgeries may be attributed to the lack of facilities for spinal anaesthesia and may reflect the risk taking behaviour of healthcare professionals in COVID-19 pandemic.","Shah, Priyansh; Sarang, Bhakti; Gadgil, Anita; Bhandoria, Geetu; Khajanchi, Monty; Veetil, Deepa Kizhakke; Bhandarkar, Prashant; Gupta, Monali Mohan; Goh, Dylan; Roy, Nobhojit; Shah, Priyansh",BJS Open,745,1

Patients undergoing elective resection of an intra-abdominal cancer with curative intent were included in a multilevel logistic regression. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative mortality. RESULTS: Of 7402 patients included, 3031 underwent surgery before and 4371 during the pandemic. Overall, 6.5% (n = 484) patients suffered a pulmonary complication, 5.1% had a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed, and 1.4% patients (n = 107) died.

METHODS: This international cohort study included adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020. Patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection before operation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. Preoperative testing strategies were adjusted for confounding using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2 per cent) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6 per cent) had a swab test, 521 (5.9 per cent) CT only, and 324 (3.7 per cent) swab and CT.

DESIGN: Multicentre retrospective study. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We included the images of keratoconic and healthy volunteers’ eyes provided by three centres: Royal Liverpool University Hospital (Liverpool, UK), Sedaghat Eye Clinic (Mashhad, Iran) and The New Zealand National Eye Center (New Zealand). Corneal tomography scans were used to train and test CNN models, which included healthy controls. Keratoconic scans were classified according to the Amsler-Krumeich classification. Keratoconic scans from Iran were used as an independent testing set. Four maps were considered for each scan: axial map, anterior and posterior elevation map, and pachymetry map. RESULTS: A CNN model detected keratoconus versus health eyes with an accuracy of 0.9785 on the testing set, considering all four maps concatenated. Considering each map independently, the accuracy was 0.9283 for axial map, 0.9642 for thickness map, 0.9642 for the front elevation map and 0.9749 for the back elevation map. The accuracy of models in recognising between healthy controls and stage 1 was 0.90, between stages 1 and 2 was 0.9032, and between stages 2 and 3 was 0.8537 using the concatenated map.

Background/Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching effects on everyday life leading to stress and anxiety, which may be heightened in those undergoing cardiac surgery. Health impacts following a traumatic event may be apparent at one month but can also present after many months. PURPOSE: The aim of the CardiacCovid study was to explore the effect of the pandemic on recovery from cardiac surgery. We report the preliminary results from a single centre study in the UK during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients >18 years old undergoing any form of cardiac surgery between 23rd March 2020 (UK lockdown) to 4th July 2020 (lifting of most restrictions) were recruited to this prospective observational study. Those too unwell or unable to give consent/complete study questionnaires were excluded. Participants completed a Quality of Life (QoL) (EQ-5D), impact of event (IES-R), depression (CES-D) and health service use questionnaire at baseline, 1 week after hospital discharge, and 6 weeks after surgery. Questionnaires were completed electronically on the Amplitude platform or via post. Ethics approval (20/YH/0132) was obtained and the study was registered (Clinicaltrials.gov:NCT04366167). RESULTS: A total of 395 patients had surgery of which 298 (91.7%) were screened and 203 (68.1%) were enrolled to the study. Participants were mostly male (74.6%), with a mean age of 63 years, undergoing urgent/emergency (57.9%) CABG +/-valve (70.1%). Mean inpatient stay was 8.6 days and in-hospital mortality was 0.5%. No patients had Covid-19. The initial findings suggest a deterioration of QoL at 1 week post discharge with near restoration to baseline level at 6 weeks post-surgery. Mean scores for CES-D and IES-R remained within subclinical levels at all available time points. However, at 6 weeks, a proportion of patients reached levels for depression on the CES-D and had high IES-R scores indicating possible post-traumatic stress. CONCLUSION: We believe that this is the largest/only study exploring the impact of the pandemic on cardiac surgery recovery, including QoL, spanning the immediate recovery phase but will continue until 1 year. The findings so far show that recovery from cardiac surgery during the Covid-19 pandemic is similar to that reported prior to the pandemic (Cromhout et al 2018) and reinforces the need for psychosocial assessments to identify patients who may require additional support during the immediate recovery phase.","Bueser, T; Clayton, T; Dodd, M; Beaumont, E; Owens, G; Murray, S; Sepehripour, A; Oo, A; Sanders, J",Eur J Cardiovasc Nurs,745,1

Videoconferencing could provide safe remote access to group WMPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this study were to determine the uptake of a virtual group WMP and its predictors. METHODS All patients enrolled on a face-to-face group WMP, which constitutes part of a Tier 3 WMP delivered by the NHS, at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were invited to transfer to a virtual format of the group WMP. Baseline data included weight, BMI, age, gender, ethnicity and Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile score. The outcomes were accept/decline transfer to the virtual group WMP. Logistic regression was performed to assess for predictors of uptake. RESULTS The 315 participants were included, of which 72.1% (n = 227) accepted. After adjusting for gender, deprivation and BMI; older patients (OR 0.966, [95% CI 0.944, 0.989]; p = 0.003) and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients (OR 0.460 [95% 0.248, 0.851]; p = 0.023) were less likely to accept the virtual group WMP. CONCLUSION Strategies aimed at improving uptake of group WMP among BAME and older adult groups are needed, particularly considering the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in these two groups, and the links between obesity and poor COVID-19 outcomes.","Abbott, Sally; Parretti, Helen M; Hazlehurst, Jonathan; Tahrani, Abd A",Journal of human nutrition and dietetics : the official journal of the British Dietetic Association,745,24

The notion of realization, however, has been accepted at face value, with little consideration of whether the dreamer realizes that they are dreaming in the sense of actual reasoning, or if it is a mere epiphenomenon of lucid dream initiation. This article offers a solution to this problem by, first, arguing that the transition to lucidity can occur as a result of successful reasoning, and second, building a model of this reasoning in terms of probabilistic reasoning. The established Bayesian model explains realization in lucid dreams taking under consideration two factors: the beliefs that the dreamer holds on what is generally probable and improbable, and the dreamer's admissibility of being in a dream. Defended against important objections, the model offers an explanation of lucid dream initiation, relevant for future research on dreaming.","Szymanek, Piotr",Conscious Cogn,745,1

The 3CL protease (3CLpro) is a highly conserved protease which is indispensable for CoVs replication, and is a promising target for development of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this study we investigated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of Shuanghuanglian preparation, a Chinese traditional patent medicine with a long history for treating respiratory tract infection in China. We showed that either the oral liquid of Shuanghuanglian, the lyophilized powder of Shuanghuanglian for injection or their bioactive components dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro as well as the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells. Baicalin and baicalein, two ingredients of Shuanghuanglian, were characterized as the first noncovalent, nonpeptidomimetic inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and exhibited potent antiviral activities in a cell-based system. Remarkably, the binding mode of baicalein with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro determined by X-ray protein crystallography was distinctly different from those of known 3CLpro inhibitors. Baicalein was productively ensconced in the core of the substrate-binding pocket by interacting with two catalytic residues, the crucial S1/S2 subsites and the oxyanion loop, acting as a ""shield"" in front of the catalytic dyad to effectively prevent substrate access to the catalytic dyad within the active site. Overall, this study provides an example for exploring the in vitro potency of Chinese traditional patent medicines and effectively identifying bioactive ingredients toward a specific target, and gains evidence supporting the in vivo studies of Shuanghuanglian oral liquid as well as two natural products for COVID-19 treatment.","Su, Hai-Xia; Yao, Sheng; Zhao, Wen-Feng; Li, Min-Jun; Liu, Jia; Shang, Wei-Juan; Xie, Hang; Ke, Chang-Qiang; Hu, Hang-Chen; Gao, Mei-Na; Yu, Kun-Qian; Liu, Hong; Shen, Jing-Shan; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Xiao, Geng-Fu; Ni, Li; Wang, Dao-Wen; Zuo, Jian-Ping; Jiang, Hua-Liang; Bai, Fang; Wu, Yan; Ye, Yang; Xu, Ye-Chun",Acta Pharmacol Sin,745,32

The first detected cases were reported on 21 February 2020 in two Italian towns: Vo' Euganeo in the Province of Padua, Veneto region, and Codogno, in the Province of Lodi, Lombardy. In the next weeks the epidemic spread quickly across the country but mainly in the north of Italy. The two regions: Veneto and Lombardy, implemented different strategies to control the viral spread. In Veneto, health personnel tested both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects, while in Lombardy only symptomatic cases were investigated. We analyzed the evolution of the epidemic in these regions and showed that testing both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is a more effective strategy to mitigate the epidemic impact. We strongly recommend that decision-makers: ensure early isolation of symptomatic patients and rapid identification of their contacts; maximize testing rapidly, especially among people with multiple daily contacts with infected populations, high exposure to the public in essential services; rapidly increase diagnostic capacity by mobilizing trained personnel capable of performing rRT-PCR on respiratory samples; equip the population with protective masks.","Romagnani, Paola; Gnone, Guido; Guzzi, Francesco; Negrini, Simone; Guastalla, Andrea; Annunziato, Francesco; Romagnani, Sergio; De Palma, Raffaele",J Public Health Policy,745,26

Of 33 non-homogenized specimens, 31 (93.9%) analysed in triplicate were consistently categorized relative to 10 µg/g, compared to all 33 (100%) homogenized specimens. Imprecision was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% to 48.6%)) in non-homogenized specimens than in homogenized specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed over time (p = 0.26).Discussion: The FIT immunoassay evaluated is capable of detecting faecal Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 µg/g and is suitable for application in this context. The greatest practical challenge to FIT performance is reproducible sampling, the pre-analytical step associated with most variability. Further research should focus on reducing sampling variability, particularly as post-COVID-19 guidance recommends greater FIT utilization.","James, T; Nicholson, B D; Marr, R; Paddon, M; East, J E; Justice, S; Oke, J L; Shine, B",Br J Biomed Sci,745,13

We aimed to describe microbiologically confirmed co-infections and secondary infections, and antimicrobial use, in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Methods: The International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) study is an ongoing, prospective cohort study recruiting inpatients from 260 hospitals in England, Scotland, and Wales, conducted by the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium. Patients with a confirmed or clinician-defined high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for inclusion in the ISARIC WHO CCP-UK study. For this specific study, we excluded patients with a recorded negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and those without a recorded outcome at 28 days after admission. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, therapeutic, and outcome data were collected using a prespecified case report form. Organisms considered clinically insignificant were excluded. Findings: We analysed data from 48 902 patients admitted to hospital between Feb 6 and June 8, 2020. The median patient age was 74 years (IQR 59-84) and 20 786 (42·6%) of 48 765 patients were female. Microbiological investigations were recorded for 8649 (17·7%) of 48 902 patients, with clinically significant COVID-19-related respiratory or bloodstream culture results recorded for 1107 patients. 762 (70·6%) of 1080 infections were secondary, occurring more than 2 days after hospital admission. Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens causing respiratory co-infections (diagnosed &#8804;2 days after admission), with Enterobacteriaceae and S aureus most common in secondary respiratory infections. Bloodstream infections were most frequently caused by Escherichia coli and S aureus. Among patients with available data, 13 390 (37·0%) of 36 145 had received antimicrobials in the community for this illness episode before hospital admission and 39 258 (85·2%) of 46 061 patients with inpatient antimicrobial data received one or more antimicrobials at some point during their admission (highest for patients in critical care). We identified frequent use of broad-spectrum agents and use of carbapenems rather than carbapenem-sparing alternatives. Interpretation: In patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, microbiologically confirmed bacterial infections are rare, and more likely to be secondary infections. Gram-negative organisms and S aureus are the predominant pathogens. The frequency and nature of antimicrobial use are concerning, but tractable targets for stewardship interventions exist.

One of the critical problems harming the wide adoption of such displays is the presence of speckle noise inherent to holography, that compromises its quality by introducing perceptible artifacts. Although speckle noise suppression has been an active research area, the previous works have not considered the perceptual characteristics of the Human Visual System (HVS), which receives the final displayed imagery. However, it is well studied that the sensitivity of the HVS is not uniform across the visual field, which has led to gaze-contingent rendering schemes for maximizing the perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we present the first method that reduces the""perceived speckle noise""by integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation. Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being adaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display. Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.","Chakravarthula, Praneeth; Zhang, Zhan; Tursun, Okan; Didyk, Piotr; Sun, Qi; Fuchs, Henry",,745,29

More than ever, valid, transparent, and intuitive summaries of the treatment effects, including efficacy and harm, are needed. In recently published and ongoing randomized comparative trials evaluating treatments for COVID-19, time to a positive outcome, such as recovery or improvement, has repeatedly been used as either the primary or key secondary end point. Because patients may die before recovery or improvement, data analysis of this end point faces a competing risk problem. Commonly used survival analysis techniques, such as the Kaplan-Meier method, often are not appropriate for such situations. Moreover, almost all trials have quantified treatment effects by using the hazard ratio, which is difficult to interpret for a positive event, especially in the presence of competing risks. Using 2 recent trials evaluating treatments (remdesivir and convalescent plasma) for COVID-19 as examples, a valid, well-established yet underused procedure is presented for estimating the cumulative recovery or improvement rate curve across the study period. Furthermore, an intuitive and clinically interpretable summary of treatment efficacy based on this curve is also proposed. Clinical investigators are encouraged to consider applying these methods for quantifying treatment effects in future studies of COVID-19.","McCaw, Zachary R; Tian, Lu; Vassy, Jason L; Ritchie, Christine Seel; Lee, Chien-Chang; Kim, Dae Hyun; Wei, Lee-Jen",Ann Intern Med,745,24

Our goal is to develop a globally applicable method, integrated in a twice daily updated dashboard that provides an estimate of the trend in the evolution of the number of cases and deaths from reported data of more than 200 countries and territories, as well as a seven-day forecast. One of the significant difficulties to manage a quickly propagating epidemic is that the details of the dynamic needed to forecast its evolution are obscured by the delays in the identification of cases and deaths and by irregular reporting. Our forecasting methodology substantially relies on estimating the underlying trend in the observed time series using robust seasonal trend decomposition techniques. This allows us to obtain forecasts with simple, yet effective extrapolation methods in linear or log scale. We present the results of an assessment of our forecasting methodology and discuss its application to the production of global and regional risk maps.","Krymova, Ekaterina; B'ejar, Benjam'in; Thanou, Dorina; Sun, Tao; Manetti, Elisa; Lee, Gavin; Namigai, Kristen; Choirat, Christine; Flahault, Antoine; Obozinski, Guillaume",,745,24

Social distancing measures in informal settlements may be difficult to implement due to the density and layout of settlements. This study measures the distance between dwellings in informal settlements in Cape Town to identify the risk of COVID-19 transmission. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to determine if social distancing measures are achievable in informal settlements in Cape Town, using two settlements as an example. We will first examine the distance between dwellings and their first, second, and third nearest neighbors and then identify clusters of dwellings in which residents would be unable to effectively practice social isolation due to the close proximity of their homes. METHODS: Dwellings in the settlements of Masiphumelele and Klipfontein Glebe were extracted from a geographic information system data set of outlines of all informal dwellings in Cape Town. The distance to each dwelling's first, second, and third nearest neighbors was calculated for each settlement. A social distance measure of 2 m was used (buffer of 1 m, as dwellings less than 2 m apart are joined) to identify clusters of dwellings that are unable to effectively practice social distancing in each settlement. RESULTS: The distance to each dwelling's first 3 nearest neighbors illustrates that the settlement of Masiphumelele is constructed in a denser fashion as compared to the Klipfontein Glebe settlement. This implies that implementing social distancing will likely be more challenging in Masiphumelele than in Klipfontein Glebe. However, using a 2-m social distancing measure, it was demonstrated that large portions of Klipfontein Glebe would also be unable to effectively implement social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Effectively implementing social distancing may be a challenge in informal settlements due to their density. This paper uses dwelling outlines for informal settlements in the city of Cape Town to demonstrate that with a 2 m measure, effective social distancing will be challenging.","Gibson, Lesley; Rush, David",JMIR Public Health Surveill,745,1

Since January 23rd, 2020, the strategies of containment and contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation has been implemented extensively in mainland China, and the rates of detection and confirmation have been continuously increased, which have effectively suppressed the rapid spread of the epidemic. In the early stage of the outbreak of COVID-19, it is of great practical significance to analyze the transmission risk of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness and timeliness of prevention and control strategies by using mathematical models and combining with a small amount of real-time updated multi-source data. On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.","Tang, S Y; Xiao, Y N; Peng, Z H; Shen, H B",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,745,2

However, the psychological distress of patients with incidental meningiomas under a wait-and-watch strategy is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to compare the psychosocial situation of meningioma patients under wait-and-watch to patients after complete resection to bridge this gap. The inclusion criteria for the prospective monocenter study were either an incidental meningioma under a wait-and-watch strategy or no neurologic deficits after complete resection. Sociodemographic, clinical, and health-related quality of life and clinical data were assessed. Psychosocial factors were measured by the Distress Thermometer (DT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), and the Short Form (SF-36). A total of 62 patients were included (n = 51 female, mean age 61 (SD 13) years). According to HADS, the prevalence of anxiety was 45% in the postoperative and 42% in the wait-and-watch group (p = 0.60), and depression was 61% and 87%, respectively (p = 0.005). In total, 43% of patients under wait-and-watch and 37% of patients in the postoperative group scored &#8805;6 on the DT scale.

Installing an air purifier seems a legitimate strategy, but this has recently been questioned. METHODS: Patients undergoing an HRM procedure at the Leuven University Hospital were included in this clinical study. All subjects had to wear a surgical mask which was only lowered beneath the nose during the placement and removal of the nasogastric catheter. The number of aerosol particles was measured by a Lasair(®) II Particle Counter to obtain data about different particles sizes: 0.3; 0.5; 1.0; 3.0; 5.0; and 10.0 µm. Measurements were done immediately before the placement and the removal of the HRM catheter, and one and 5 min after. A portable air purifier with high‐efficiency particle air filters was installed in the hospital room. KEY RESULTS: Thirteen patients underwent a manometry examination. The amount of 0.3 µm‐sized particles was unaffected during the whole procedure. The larger particle sizes (1.0; 3.0; 5.0; and 10.0 µm) decreased when the catheter was positioned, but not 0.5 µm. During the HRM measurements itself, these numbers decreased further. Yet, 1 min after catheter removal a significant elevation of particles was seen, which did not recover within 5 min. CONCLUSIONS & INTERFERENCES: Based on this study, there is no evidence that filtration systems reduce aerosol particles properly during a clinical investigation.","Verbeure, Wout; Geeraerts, Annelies; Huang, I‐Hsuan; Timmermans, Lien; Tóth, Joran; Geysen, Hannelore; Cools, Louise; Carbone, Florencia; Schol, Jolien; Devriese, Herman; Haesaerts, Rico; Mori, Hideki; Vanuytsel, Tim; Tack, Jan",Neurogastroenterol Motil,745,21
