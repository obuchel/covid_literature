2837,"Ethical, legal and societal considerations on Zika virus epidemics complications in scaling-up prevention and control strategies",2017-08-25,"Much of the fear and uncertainty around Zika epidemics stem from potential association between Zika virus (ZIKV) complications on infected pregnant women and risk of their babies being born with microcephaly and other neurological abnormalities. However, much remains unknown about its mode of transmission, diagnosis and long-term pathogenesis. Worries of these unknowns necessitate the need for effective and efficient psychosocial programs and medical-legal strategies to alleviate and mitigate ZIKV related burdens. In this light, local and global efforts in maintaining fundamental health principles of moral, medical and legal decision-making policies, and interventions to preserve and promote individual and collectiveHuman Rights, autonomy, protection of the most vulnerable, equity, dignity, integrity and beneficence that should not be confused and relegated by compassionate humanitarian assistance and support. This paper explores the potential medical and ethical-legal implications of ZIKV epidemics emergency response packages and strategies alongside optimizing reproductive and mental health policies, programs and best practice measures. Further long-term cross-borders operational research is required in elucidating Zika-related population-based epidemiology, ethical-medical and societal implications in guiding evidence-based local and global ZIKV maternal-child health complications related approaches and interventions. Core programs and interventions including future Zika safe and effective vaccines for global Zika immunization program in most vulnerable and affected countries and worldwide should be prioritized.","Tambo, Ernest; Madjou, Ghislaine; Khayeka-Wandabwa, Christopher; Olalubi, Oluwasogo A.; Chengho, Chryseis F.; Khater, Emad I.M.",Philos Ethics Humanit Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574124/,377
7689,Dysfonction immunitaire induite par la ventilation mécanique,2014-01-11,"Treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been subject to many researches, sometimes leading to intense controversy. New findings in this field are varied. Effects on prognosis of commonly used treatments for ARDS have recently been investigated. Consistently, prone position, previously known to improve oxygenation without effect on mortality, has been shown to improve survival of the most severely hypoxemic patients. Administration of neuromuscular blocking agents in the acute phase of ARDS has been also shown to be beneficial on survival. In contrast, the exact place of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in ARDS management remains to be defined despite data suggesting its possible efficiency. In addition, a new era of research has emerged with the advent of cell therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells are able to both promote alveolar epithelium repair and prevent infections. Their efficacy in animal models of ARDS still needs to be confirmed by clinical trials. Finally, other promising therapies including beta-2 adrenergic agonists and omega-3 fatty acids have shown significant limitations in large clinical studies on ARDS.","Gaudry, S.; Dreyfuss, D.; Ricard, J. -D.",Reanimation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117833/,377

12063,"Digital technology adoption scale in the blended learning context in higher education: Development, validation and testing of a specific tool",2020-07-10,"Adipose tissue is a central regulator of metabolism and an important pharmacological target to treat the metabolic consequences of obesity, such as insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Among the various cellular compartments, the adipocyte cell surface is especially appealing as a drug target as it contains various proteins that when activated or inhibited promote adipocyte health, change its endocrine function and eventually maintain or restore whole-body insulin sensitivity. In addition, cell surface proteins are readily accessible by various drug classes. However, targeting individual cell surface proteins in adipocytes has been difficult due to important functions of these proteins outside adipose tissue, raising various safety concerns. Thus, one of the biggest challenges is the lack of adipose selective surface proteins and/or targeting reagents. Here, we discuss several receptor families with an important function in adipogenesis and mature adipocytes to highlight the complexity at the cell surface and illustrate the problems with identifying adipose selective proteins. We then discuss that, while no unique adipocyte surface protein might exist, how splicing, posttranslational modifications as well as protein/protein interactions can create enormous diversity at the cell surface that vastly expands the space of potentially unique epitopes and how these selective epitopes can be identified and targeted.","Onogi, Yasuhiro; Khalil, Ahmed Elagamy Mohamed Mahmoud; Ussar, Siegfried",Biochem J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7360119/,377
20907,Higher education and science popularization: Can they achieve coordinated growth?,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Leishmania tarentolae is a protozoan isolated from geckoes (Tarentola annularis, Tarentola mauritanica), which is considered non-pathogenic and is transmitted by herpetophilic Sergentomyia spp. sand flies. This species occurs in sympatry with Leishmania infantum in areas where canine leishmaniasis is endemic. In the present study, we investigated the circulation of L. tarentolae and L. infantum in sand flies, dogs and lizards in a dog shelter in southern Italy, where canine leishmaniasis by L. infantum is endemic. METHODS: Sheltered dogs (n = 100) negative for Leishmania spp. (March 2020) were screened by immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) using promastigotes of both species at two time points (June 2020 and March 2021). Whole blood from dogs, tissues of Podarcis siculus lizards (n = 28) and sand flies (n = 2306) were also sampled and tested by a duplex real-time PCR (dqPCR). Host blood meal was assessed in sand flies by PCR. RESULTS: Overall, 16 dogs became positive for L. infantum and/or L. tarentolae by IFAT at one or both sampling periods. One canine blood sample was positive for L. infantum, whilst two for L. tarentolae by dqPCR. At the cytology of lizard blood, Leishmania spp. amastigote-like forms were detected in erythrocytes. Twenty-two tissue samples, mostly lung (21.4%), scored molecularly positive for L. tarentolae, corresponding to 10 lizards (i.e., 35.7%). Of the female Sergentomyia minuta sampled (n = 1252), 158 scored positive for L. tarentolae, four for L. infantum, and one co-infected. Two Phlebotomus perniciosus (out of 29 females) were positive for L. tarentolae. Engorged S. minuta (n = 10) fed on humans, and one P. perniciosus, positive for L. tarentolae, on lagomorphs. CONCLUSIONS: Dogs and lacertid lizards (Podarcis siculus) were herein found for the first time infected by L. tarentolae. The detection of both L. tarentolae and L. infantum in S. minuta and P. perniciosus suggests their sympatric circulation, with a potential overlap in vertebrate hosts. The interactions between L. tarentolae and L. infantum should be further investigated in both vectors and vertebrate hosts to understand the potential implications for the diagnosis and control of canine leishmaniasis in endemic areas.

33453,Management intergénérationnel. Vous travaillez avec des jeunes ?,2020-06-02,"Advancements in Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Networks have shown remarkable success in various Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. However, generating sequence from pre-specified lexical constraints is a new, challenging and less researched area in NLG. Lexical constraints take the form of words in the language model’s output to create fluent and meaningful sequences. Furthermore, most of the previous approaches cater this problem by allowing the inclusion of pre-specified lexical constraints during the decoding process, which increases the decoding complexity exponentially or linearly with the number of constraints. Moreover, some of the previous approaches can only deal with single constraint. Additionally, most of the previous approaches only deal with single constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel neural probabilistic architecture based on backward-forward language model and word embedding substitution method that can cater multiple lexical constraints for generating quality sequences. Experiments shows that our proposed architecture outperforms previous methods in terms of intrinsic evaluation.","Latif, Seemab; Bashir, Sarmad; Agha, Mir Muntasar Ali; Latif, Rabia",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256622/,377
34857,From heroism to hardship: dental nurses during the pandemic,2020-06-19,"Influence maximization is a significant research problem that requires the selection of influential users who are capable of spreading information in the network such that it can reach to a large number of people. Many real-world networks like Road Network, Email Networks are weighted networks. Influence maximization on weighted networks is more challenging than an unweighted network. Many methods, such as weighted-degree rank, weighted-voteRank, weighted-eigenvalue rank, and weighted-betweenness rank methods, have been used to rank the nodes in weighted networks with certain limitations. In this manuscript, we propose a Hooke’s law-based approach named HookeRank method to identify spreaders in a weighted network. We model edge weights as spring constants. The edges present in the network are modeled as springs, which are connected in series and parallel. They elongate by a distance under the effect of a given constant force following Hooke’s law of elasticity, and this is the equivalent propagation distance between nodes in the network. The proposed the model finds relevant influential nodes, that can propagate the information to other nodes. A higher HookeRank score implies the greater influential capability of the node in the network. We compared our proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art models and found that it performs reasonably well on real-life data-sets using epidemic spreading Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.","Kumar, Sanjay; Aggarwal, Nipun; Panda, B.

36137,Children's oral health,2020-07-06,"Despite the positive outcomes obtained through the application of gamification in the technology-enhanced learning context, previous studies have also reported unexpected results concerning students’ engagement, learning outcomes, and motivation in gamified learning systems. To increase the chances of obtaining positive results in this context, this article proposes a “gamification analytics model for teachers”. In this model, teachers are allowed to define interaction goals, monitor students’ interaction with the system’ learning resources and the gamification elements, and adapt the gamification design through missions to motivate disengaged students to achieve the interaction goals defined. However, the gamification analytics model-based design concepts that will be implemented to support the learning process should be well-planned to teachers’ needs. Hence, one of the contributions of this paper is the validation of twenty design concepts based on the gamification analytics model for teachers by using the speed dating method. Our results suggest that teachers judged useful/relevant visualize students’ interaction with gamification elements such as missions, levels to help them understand the students’ status, but did not evaluate the visualization of the interaction of students with trophies relevant. Teachers also highly evaluated the creation of personalized missions for a student or a specific group as relevant to help demotivated students to engage and achieve the desired goals. Therefore, this study provides some relevant insights to guide the design and re-design of gamified adaptive learning systems.","Tenório, Kamilla; Dermeval, Diego; Monteiro, Mateus; Peixoto, Aristoteles; Pedro, Alan",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334171/,377

In existing formalisms, such reasoning typically either fails or is subject to stringent side conditions on formulas (notably precision) that significantly impair automation. We suggest two formal syntactic additions that collectively remove the need for such side conditions: first, the use of both “weak” and “strong” forms of separating conjunction, and second, the use of nominal labels from hybrid logic. We contend that our suggested alterations bring formal reasoning with fractional permissions in separation logic considerably closer to common pen-and-paper intuition, while imposing only a modest bureaucratic overhead.","Brotherston, James; Costa, Diana; Hobor, Aquinas; Wickerson, John",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363218/,377

41892,The Future of the Bologna Process and the European Higher Education Area: New Perspectives on a Recurring Topic,2020-07-26,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic affected medical practise significantly and caused difficulties in accessing necessary investigations at the appropriate time. As of March 2020, NHS England issued measures to redirect staffs and resources in preparation for the rising cases of coronavirus. As a result of this, non-urgent tests/treatments were put on hold. We present a new case of EGPA admitted to our district general hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the challenges faced. The diagnosis was reached based on clinical judgment in the absence of some confirmatory tests as well as the decision of starting immunosuppressant treatment during the pandemic. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 41-years-old lady with a background of well-controlled asthma, presented with five days history of paraesthesia and swelling in both legs. She also reported mild pleuritic chest pain, which radiated to her left arm. Physical examination revealed left foot drop. She had reduced sensation on the L5-S1 dermatomal distribution with absent ankle reflex and reduced knee reflex of her left leg. Her left calf was swollen and tender. The rest of her examination was unremarkable. Baseline blood revealed raised WCC of 19.3 with significant eosinophilia (10). CRP and ESR were 135 mg/L and 48mm/hr, respectively. Electrocardiogram showed new T-wave inversion in the anterolateral leads with significantly raised troponin levels. There was ground glass appearance in both lungs, keeping with suspected COVID-19 and no evidence of pulmonary embolus was found on CTPA. MRI spine confirmed no evidence of cauda equina compression. Deep vein thrombosis was also excluded with US doppler. She was treated as myocarditis and pneumonia secondary to probable COVID-19 infection. Echocardiogram revealed severe LVSD (EF < 35%) with no LV hypertrophy. Three days later, she became acutely breathless and required high flow oxygen. New bilateral basal crackles were found on auscultation. Her antibiotic regimes were escalated to intravenous infusion. A revised CT report suggested the findings may correlate with eosinophilic pneumonia or EGPA. MRI of lower legs proved muscular oedema in bilaterally, which was suggestive of myositis with fasciitis. There was no significant change on the thigh musculature. CK level was slightly elevated (403 IU/L). Urinalysis was positive for blood (3+). Given the strong clinical suspicion of EPGA, a decision to start high dose steroid therapy was made, despite the pending immunology results. After the third dose of the methylprednisolone, pulsed cyclophosphamide was started along with high dose oral prednisolone. The patient was discharged home following significant clinical improvement. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: This patient has fulfilled 4 out of 6 criteria of ACR 1990 classification for EGPA, which are eosinophilia, bronchial asthma, mononeuritis multiplex and pulmonary infiltrates on radiological images. However, in the context of current pandemic, these changes on chest CT findings could also be suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonitis. At present, there is no reliable test for COVID-19. Even though RT-PCR testing has been the gold standard for diagnosing suspected cases, the clinical sensitivity and specificity of these tests are variable. A negative test may not rule out infection. In our case, the patient was tested twice at separate times to rule out the possibility of COVID-19 infection. During the pandemic, there is extremely limited access to some confirmatory tests. We were not able to perform nerve conduction studies on our patient as the service was suspended, instead, we sought neurologist’s review to confirm the mononeuritis multiplex. We also sought advice from haematologist to rule out the possibility of hyper-eosinophilic syndrome as bone marrow biopsy was unavailable. The screen for atypical pneumonia, aspergillosis, viruses, and tuberculosis were negative. By excluding the alternative diagnoses related to eosinophilia, we concluded that this was likely to be a case of first presentation EGPA. Our next obstacle was introducing remission–induction regimens during COVID-19 pandemic. BSR does not recommend starting new treatment due to the increased risk of infection. We had to weigh out the benefits and risks of initiating immunosuppression. Our patient was made aware of the potential risks involved which include severe infection with COVID-19. She was also shifted to a side room with strict infection control precautions and PCP prophylaxis prescribed before starting pulsed methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Fortunately, her neurological symptoms resolved after three days of steroid therapy. Eosinophils count dropped within 1 day to zero, after the first dose of IV methylprednisolone. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: Despite the rising cases of COVID-19 infection, it is essential to keep an open mind and consider alternative diagnosis if a patient did not respond to conventional treatment. As EGPA and COVID-19 pneumonia share similar clinical and radiological presentation, clinical judgement is essential when making the diagnosis as the treatments for both conditions are vastly different. When EGPA is suspected, a multidisciplinary team should be involved in the evaluation of different organ involvements as well as ruling out other causes of eosinophilia. The role of specialists’ inputs is extremely important in reaching the diagnosis, especially with limited access to the usual confirmatory tests due to reduced services during the pandemic. In addition, when there is an increased risk of infection such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to weigh up the benefits and risks of commencing immunosuppressant treatment carefully. Patients need to be involved in the decision-making process as well as take precautions to minimise the risk of infection. The decision to start remission induction regimes should not be delayed if there is a presence of life or organ threatening disease manifestations in EGPA patients. Our patient has had a life-threatening disease because of multi-organ involvements (cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological systems).","Tan, Yvonne; Mohamedalhadi, Ammar; Wood, Fiona",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607312/,377
41893,Evolving Social Dimension of the European Higher Education Area,2020-07-26,"CASE REPORT - INTRODUCTION: Based on initial clinical data, it was suggested that patients with vasculitis who were immunosuppressed, would have a more severe COVID-19 infection. Here we present a case of a young 26-year old lady with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) on rituximab who developed COVID-19 infection while on active GPA treatment. Her COVID-19 infection confirmed on PCR serology, has been protracted but non-fulminant. She did not require mechanical respiratory support. At the same time her GPA remained active and worsened requiring further immunosuppression after she developed mild pulmonary haemorrhage. She is currently still receiving vasculitis treatment. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 26-year-old lady with a background history of obstructive sleep apnoea and fibromyalgia was diagnosed with ENT-limited GPA in 2017. She was initially treated with azathioprine then methotrexate, and later switched to Rituximab in 2018 after she developed organ-threatening manifestations with bilateral hearing loss. She was stable on periodic infusions of rituximab at 6 to 9-monthly intervals and did not develop other organ-threatening features. She had been given one dose of rituximab for a flare of her GPA. In between rituximab doses, she was admitted with acute COVID-19 infection with related pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, fluids, and oxygen. Shortly after discharge, she was readmitted with worsening symptoms of non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonia which was evident on chest x-ray and levofloxacin treatment was initiated. Her condition improved and she was discharged. No mechanical respiratory support was required. She had her 2(nd) dose of rituximab after it had been delayed by about 2 weeks. She had been afebrile after the acute COVID-19 infection and her persistent positive results were explained as related viral shedding over a period of 8 weeks. One week later, she represented to hospital with fever, cough and shortness of breath, and her blood results showed a remarkable rise in inflammatory markers, including a CRP of 242. She was treated for non-resolving COVID-19 pneumonitis with worsening chest x-ray features. After hospital discharge, her GPA continued to flare with persistent epistaxis with nasal crusting. She also had worsening inflammatory arthritis with purpuric rash on her legs. An ENT review confirmed nasal septum perforation, but no renal involvement was found. Additional cyclophosphamide was commenced via the day-case unit. Her SARS-CoV-2 serology was negative prior to commencing cyclophosphamide. She is now SARS-CoV-2 positive after two doses of cyclophosphamide, but she is afebrile and stable. CASE REPORT – DISCUSSION: COVID-19 infection carries a high mortality rate in patients with multiple co-morbidities, but recent literature suggests that patients on immunosuppressants may not actually have fulminant COVID-19 disease. This case illustrates the challenges of treating active vasculitis in the context of ongoing COVID-19 infection. Her vasculitis remained active requiring escalation of immunosuppression with caution, while she was concomitantly fighting SARS-CoV-2 and superadded bacterial infection. A similar case has been published by Guilpain et al of a 52-year-old woman with PR3-ANCA vasculitis on maintenance therapy with rituximab and low-dose prednisone who developed COVID-19 infection. They reported milder evolution of COVID-19 infection in comparison with previous reports. It is now well known that some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine and tofacitinib could suppress the cytokine profile seen in severe COVID-19 infection. In addition, several case reports have even reported possible protective effect of immunosuppressants against severe complications of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatological and non-rheumatological conditions. Another complexity in this case was monitoring the disease progression, since both COVID-19 and GPA can have similar findings on chest CT scan of ground glass opacity. In order to better understand the role of immunosuppressants in rheumatological patients with COVID-19 infection, more data is required, currently European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) is collecting data to monitor and report outcomes of COVID-19 in adult and paediatric population, this will provide invaluable insight for Rheumatologists. Case report - Key learning points: This case poses a challenge for Rheumatologists in managing a patient with active vasculitis and concomitant COVID-19 infection due to limited data available literature. . It has also stressed the importance of working in a multidisciplinary team when managing such complex patients. . Importance of continuous surveillance of patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy is advised due to possible increased risk to SARS-CoV-2.","Kaur, Gurpreet; Nour, Alaeldin; Sunmboye, Kehinde",Rheumatol Adv Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607314/,377
42349,My passion to progress in dentistry,2020-11-20,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation in helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) environments is a procedure which carries a significant risk of complications. Limited data on the quality and performance of mechanical ventilation in HEMS are available in the literature. METHOD: We conducted an international survey to evaluate mechanical ventilation infrastructure in HEMS and collect data of transported ventilated patients. From June 20–22, 2019, the participating HEMS bases were asked to provide data via a web-based platform. Vital parameters and ventilation settings of the patients at first patient contact and at handover were compared using non-parametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Out of 215 invited HEMS bases, 53 responded. Respondents were from Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland. Of the HEMS bases, all teams were physician staffed, mainly anesthesiologists (79%), the majority were board certified (92.5%) and trained in intensive care medicine (89%) and had a median (range) experience in HEMS of 9 (0–25) years. HEMS may provide a high level of expertise in mechanical ventilation whereas the majority of ventilators are able to provide pressure controlled ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure modes (77%). Data of 30 ventilated patients with a median (range) age of 54 (21–100) years and 53% male gender were analyzed. Of these, 24 were primary missions and 6 interfacility transports. At handover, oxygen saturation (p < 0.01) and positive end-expiratory pressure (p = 0.04) of the patients were significantly higher compared to first patient contact. CONCLUSION: In this survey, the management of ventilated HEMS-patients was not associated with ventilation related serious adverse events. Patient conditions, training of medical crew and different technical and environmental resources are likely to influence management. Further studies are necessary to assess safety and process quality of mechanical ventilation in HEMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The survey was prospectively registered at Research Registry (researchregistry2925).","Hilbert-Carius, Peter; Struck, Manuel F.; Hofer, Veronika; Hinkelbein, Jochen; Rognås, Leif; Adler, Jörn; Christian, Michael D.; Wurmb, Thomas; Bernhard, Michael; Hossfeld, Björn",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7672415/,377

METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on pertussis epidemiology and burden of disease in South Korea. The objective was to highlight evidence gaps which could help improve awareness about pertussis disease in adults in South Korea. RESULTS: Of 940 articles published between January 2000 to December 2019, 19 articles provided data for pertussis epidemiology and 9 provided data in adults. Laboratory confirmation rates in adults varied according to methodology, likely influenced by study/sampling variations. Three studies reported serological evidence of infection in adolescents and adults (33-57%). Among cases, the average cough duration was 16.5 days (range 7-30 days) and over 85% of cases presented with paroxysmal cough, while only 25% of cases or less presented with a characteristic whoop or post-tussive vomiting. Importantly, in 4 studies reporting vaccination status, almost all adult cases had no history of pertussis vaccination since childhood. CONCLUSION: Primary childhood vaccination rates in South Korea are among the highest globally, while adult pertussis vaccine uptake appears to be quite low. Our literature review suggests that pertussis is underreported in adults, as evidenced by serology data demonstrating that tetanus antibody levels are low while pertussis toxin antibody levels are relatively high, suggesting continued circulation of community pertussis. These findings highlight the need for strategies such as maternal immunization and decennial revaccination of adults to address the changing epidemiology and waning immunity. Active pertussis testing/reporting and better utilization of adult vaccine registries is required to help provide robust data for vaccine decision-making at the national level. In the current COVID-19 environment, strategies that can reduce clinic or hospital visits will have substantial benefits to authorities managing rapid increases in health care resource utilization, and vaccine preventable diseases provide an easy and immediate target for achieving that goal.

We show that in dependent type theory with uniqueness of identity proofs, even the infinitary case of QW-types can be encoded using the combination of inductive-inductive definitions involving strictly positive occurrences of Hofmann-style quotient types, and Abel’s size types. The latter, which provide a convenient constructive abstraction of what classically would be accomplished with transfinite ordinals, are used to prove termination of the recursive definitions of the elimination and computation properties of our encoding of QW-types. The development is formalized using the Agda theorem prover.","Fiore, Marcelo P.; Pitts, Andrew M.; Steenkamp, S.

It is based on the insight that the collection of finite structures can be embedded, via a map they call the Stone pairing, in a space of measures, where the desired limits can be computed. We show that a closely related but finer grained space of measures arises — via Stone-Priestley duality and the notion of types from model theory — by enriching the expressive power of first-order logic with certain “probabilistic operators”. We provide a sound and complete calculus for this extended logic and expose the functorial nature of this construction. The consequences are two-fold. On the one hand, we identify the logical gist of the theory of structural limits. On the other hand, our construction shows that the duality-theoretic variant of the Stone pairing captures the adding of a layer of quantifiers, thus making a strong link to recent work on semiring quantifiers in logic on words. In the process, we identify the model theoretic notion of types as the unifying concept behind this link. These results contribute to bridging the strands of logic in computer science which focus on semantics and on more algorithmic and complexity related areas, respectively.","Gehrke, Mai; Jakl, Tomáš; Reggio, Luca",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788618/,377

This leads to a notion of program equivalence as typed bisimulation. Our semantics reflects the role of types as hiding operators, firstly via an axiomatic characterization of “parallel composition with hiding” which yields a general technique for establishing congruence results for typed bisimulation, and secondly via an example which captures the hiding of implementations in abstract data types: a typed bisimulation for the (Curry-style) lazy [Formula: see text] -calculus with polymorphic types. This is built on an abstract machine for CPS evaluation of [Formula: see text] -terms: we first give a basic typing system for this LTS which characterizes acyclicity of the environment and local control flow, and then refine this to a polymorphic typing system which uses equational constraints on instantiated type variables, inferred from observable interaction, to capture behaviour at polymorphic and abstract types.","Laird, James",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788620/,377

Standard induction rules induct over only the top-level structure of data, leaving any data internal to the top-level structure untouched. By contrast, deep induction rules induct over all of the structured data present. We give a grammar generating a robust class of nested types (and thus ADTs), and develop a fundamental theory of deep induction for them using their recently defined semantics as fixed points of accessible functors on locally presentable categories. We then use our theory to derive deep induction rules for some common ADTs and nested types, and show how these rules specialize to give the standard structural induction rules for these types. We also show how deep induction specializes to solve the long-standing problem of deriving principled and practically useful structural induction rules for bushes and other truly nested types. Overall, deep induction opens the way to making induction principles appropriate to richly structured data types available in programming languages and proof assistants. Agda implementations of our development and examples, including two extended case studies, are available.","Johann, Patricia; Polonsky, Andrew",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788624/,377

Many properties (coverability, boundedness, ...) can be decided using Clover, in a time proportional to the size of Clover. So it is crucial to design algorithms that compute it efficiently. We present a simple modification of the original but incomplete Minimal Coverability Tree algorithm (MCT), computing Clover, which makes it complete: it memorizes accelerations and fires them as ordinary transitions. Contrary to the other alternative algorithms for which no bound on the size of the required additional memory is known, we establish that the additional space of our algorithm is at most doubly exponential. Furthermore we have implemented a prototype MinCov which is already very competitive: on benchmarks it uses less space than all the other tools and its execution time is close to the one of the fastest tool.","Finkel, Alain; Haddad, Serge; Khmelnitsky, Igor",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788628/,377

Such polymers are capable of altering their chemical and/or physical properties, such as chemical structures, chain conformation, solubility, shape, morphologies, and optical properties, in response to single or multiple stimuli. Among various stimuli-responsive polymers, those with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties possess the advantages of high sensitivity, fast response, large contrast, excellent photostability, and low background noise. The changes in fluorescence signal can be conveniently detected and monitored using portable instruments. The integration of AIE and stimuli responses into one polymer system provides a feasible and effective strategy for the development of smart polymers with high sensitivity to environmental variations. Here, we review the recent advances in the design, preparation, performance, and applications of functional synthetic polymer systems with AIE and stimuli responses. Various AIE-based polymer systems with responsiveness toward single physical or chemical stimuli as well as multiple stimuli are summarized with specific examples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective, 3:1 ratio randomized, sham‐controlled, double‐blind, pilot study with 16 adolescents diagnosed with migraine randomized to eight weeks of biofeedback treatment (n = 12) or sham biofeedback (n = 4), carried out at two university hospitals in Norway. The prespecified and primary objective of the study was to observe changes in outcomes within the active treatment group. The sham control group was included in a minor ratio primarily to evaluate its feasibility. The primary outcome was change in headache frequency. A modified intention to treat analysis was performed, including participants completing at least seven biofeedback sessions in weeks 1–4 (n = 12 vs. n = 4) and weeks 5–8 (n = 7 vs. n = 2). RESULTS: Adherence was poor with 40% (136/336) of planned biofeedback sessions completed during weeks 5–8. Within the biofeedback group, a not statistically significant reduction in headache frequency was observed at weeks 1–4 (2.92 days/month, 95% CI −1.00 to 6.84, p = .145) and weeks 5–8 (1.85 days/month, 95% CI −2.01 to 5.72, p = .395). The biofeedback group experienced a median of one fewer headache days/month versus sham that did not reach significance (95% CI −4.0 to 9.0, p = .760). CONCLUSIONS: We observed a small reduction in headache frequency in the active treatment group. Findings were likely undermined by low adherence and underpowered analyses but indicate that a therapist‐independent biofeedback treatment app has the potential to be an effective, tolerable, and inexpensive treatment option.","Stubberud, Anker; Linde, Mattias; Brenner, Eiliv; Heier, Martin; Olsen, Alexander; Aamodt, Anne Hege; Gravdahl, Gøril B.; Tronvik, Erling",Brain Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7882181/,377

However, there is a lack of a validated Arabic tool to measure stress related to this pandemic in the Arab countries. This study aims to translate into Arabic and measure the psychometric characteristics of the previously developed English COVID Stress Scales (CSS). Using a forward-backward translation, the CSS was translated into Arabic and 22 jurors assessed its content validity. An online-based survey was carried out among 1080 university students (Egyptian and Saudi) to assess internal consistency and validity of the Arabic version (CSS-Arabic) using Cronbach’s α and factor analysis. RESULTS: The content validity indices of the scale were 0.943 and 0.932 for both relevance and clarity. The internal consistency of the total CSS-Arabic was satisfactory (with α = 0.94) within the acceptable range for different subscales. Confirmatory factor analysis reveals 5-factor model with 36 retained items similar to the original English CSS. CONCLUSIONS: CSS-Arabic is a reliable and valid self-reporting tool for screening of stress due to COVID-19 among the university students.

Forged in the crucible of the post-apartheid era’s growth and development challenges, the partnership with China has grown in depth, reach, and complexity. Quite crucially, the impulse which drives China’s global engagements is essentially geo-economic in character but with significant political undertones and strategic considerations. China’s historical competitive advantage has been driven by low unit labour costs, a surplus of subsidised credit, and an undervalued exchange rate. As with the rest of Africa, these have had serious implications for South Africa and as one of the more developed economies of the continent, there are risks and opportunities in how it has shaped the contours of its relations with China. This becomes a critical challenge for South Africa in view of the China’s disruptive trade wars with the United States on the one hand; and what policy shifts might be necessary as China recalibrates its economy towards domestic consumption and capital intensity.

For example, given exponential population growth, modest annual growth rates result in comparatively rapidly doubling, which, even absent a modest increases in average global living standards, significantly strains resources and pollution levels, necessitating that capitalist interests in maintaining dependence on “sunken (oil, coal, and gas) assets” give way to the social utility of renewable and non-polluting energy, and the recycling it enables. Moreover, widespread adoption of socialist cooperation would ensure compensation of the workforce at levels adequate to overcoming any impending crisis of overproduction, also eliminating the “free rider” dynamic which holds back cooperatively enhanced R&D as well as the availability of the resulting technological development to all, and educational opportunities. This would result in both a reduction in poverty and an increase in self-actualization, which, in addition to arguably reducing conflict in its own right, would reduce conspicuous consumption which would benefit the environment and reduce conflict and wars over resources.","Glynn, Simon",The Economic Logic of Late Capitalism and the Inevitable Triumph of Socialism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991157/,377

The aim of this study was to audit the outcomes of the management of AA in a district general hospital during the pandemic. METHOD: The prospective data was collected for all patients treated for AA from 12/03/2020 to 18/05/2020. The primary objective was the failure rate of conservative management requiring surgical intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using JASP software. RESULTS: There were 22 patients included. 19 (86%) were managed conservatively of which 4 (21%) patients failed and progressed to surgery and 3 (14%) patients had appendicectomy on admission. 3 patients (20%) treated non-operatively were readmitted within median 4 days (4-6); 2 (13%) of them developed appendix mass. None of the patients had positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Median length of stay (LOS) was 3.5 (1-8) days; 4 (3-8) days in the immediate appendicectomy group, 3 (1-7) in the group managed conservatively. CONCLUSIONS: The sample size was small hence it is difficult to draw any solid conclusions. We feel that appendicectomy should remain standard treatment for AA. However, antibiotics should be considered as the first line during the pandemic.","Urbonas, T; Centea, D; Wild, T; Thomas, P",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135864/,377

LFIA results are often obtained by visualizing by the naked eye color changes in given areas, providing a qualitative information about the presence/absence of the target analyte in the sample. However, this platform has the potential to provide ultrasensitive quantitative analysis for several applications. Indeed, LFIA is based on well-established immunological techniques, which have known in the last year great advances due to the combination of highly sensitive tracers, innovative signal amplification strategies and last-generation instrumental detectors. All these available progresses can be applied also to the LFIA platform by adapting them to a portable and miniaturized format. This possibility opens countless strategies for definitively turning the LFIA technique into an ultrasensitive quantitative method. Among the different proposals for achieving this goal, the use of enzyme-based immunoassay is very well known and widespread for routine analysis and it can represent a valid approach for improving LFIA performances. Several examples have been recently reported in literature exploiting enzymes properties and features for obtaining significative advances in this field. In this review, we aim to provide a critical overview of the recent progresses in highly sensitive LFIA detection technologies, involving the exploitation of enzyme-based amplification strategies.

58507,How dental education can be delivered successfully online,2021-10-04,"INTRODUCTION: In Canada, most provinces have established administrative health data repositories to facilitate access to these data for research. Anecdotally, researchers have described delays and substantial inter-provincial variations in the timeliness of data access approvals and receipt of data. Currently, the reasons for these delays and variations in timeliness are not well understood. This paper provides a study protocol for (1) identifying the factors affecting access to administrative health data for research within select Canadian provinces, and (2) comparing factors across provinces to assess whether and how they contribute to inter-provincial variations in access to administrative health data for research. METHODS: A qualitative, multiple-case study research design will be used. Three cases will be included, representing three different provinces. For each case, data will be collected from documents and interviews. Specifically, interviews will be carried out with (1) research stakeholders, and (2) regulatory stakeholders (10 individuals/group * 2 groups/province * 3 provinces = 60). During within-case analysis, interview data for each stakeholder group will be analyzed separately using constant comparative analysis. Document analysis will occur iteratively, and will inform interview guide adaptation, and supplement interview data. Cross-case analysis will involve systematic comparison of findings across cases. DISCUSSION: This study represents the first in-depth examination of access to administrative health data in Canada. The main outcome will be an overarching mid-range theory explaining inter-provincial variations in access to administrative health data in Canada. This theory will be strengthened by the inclusion of the perspectives of both researchers and those involved in the regulation of data access. The findings from this study may be used to improve equitable and timely access to administrative health data across provinces, and may be transferable to other jurisdictions where barriers to access to administrative health data have been reported.","Kendell, Cynthia; Levy, Adrian R; Porter, Geoff; Gibson, Elaine; Urquhart, Robin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8477899/,377

68380,Setting up a Research Poster During COVID-19 Lockdown: A Reflection.,2020,"OBJECTIVE Infant amygdala connectivity correlates with maternal reports of infant temperament characterized by novelty-evoked distress and avoidance. However, no studies examine how human infant amygdala connectivity relates to direct observations of novelty-evoked distress in human infants. The current study examines the link between amygdala connectivity and infant novelty-evoked distress using direct-observation of temperament. METHOD At four-months of age infants' (N=90) novelty-evoked distress was assessed using a standardized reactivity assessment and parent-report. Within three weeks, resting state fMRI was collected in a subset of infants (n=34). Using a whole-brain voxel wise approach, we examine amygdala connectivity associated with positive and negative affect during the reactivity assessment. We then examined regions where the association of amygdala connectivity with negative affect was higher than with positive affect. Additionally, we examined associations between amygdala connectivity and parent-report of temperament. RESULTS Greater amygdala-cingulate and amygdala-superior frontal gyrus connectivity was associated with lower positive affect during the reactivity assessment. Results further indicated that the association between amygdala-cingulate connectivity was greater for negative affect compared to positive affect. There were no significant associations between latency to approach novelty (as measured by parent-report) and amygdala connectivity. Validation analyses conducted using a large independent longitudinal sample (N=323) demonstrate that negative reactivity is associated with increased child-reported anxiety symptoms in adolescence. CONCLUSION These results provide novel insight into the developmental pathophysiology of novelty-evoked distress. This is consistent with research linking an altered cognitive control mechanism to temperamental risk for anxiety.","Filippi, Courtney A; Ravi, Sanjana; Bracy, Maya; Winkler, Anderson; Sylvester, Chad M; Pine, Daniel S; Fox, Nathan A",Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.11.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385507/,377

The impact of β-residue incorporation within polypeptides that adopt less regular conformations, however, has received less attention. The HRC domains of fusion glycoproteins from pathogenic paramyxoviruses contain a segment that must adopt an extended conformation in order to co-assemble with the HRN domain in the post-fusion state and drive merger of the viral envelope with a target cell membrane. Here we examine the impact of single α-to-β substitutions within this extended N-terminal segment of an engineered HRC peptide designated VIQKI. Stabilities of hexameric co-assemblies formed with the native HPIV3 HRN have been evaluated, the structures of five co-assemblies have been determined, and antiviral efficacies have been measured. Many sites within the extended segment show functional tolerance of α-to-β substitution.

75954,The Greatest of These.,2020,"AIM Previous studies have indicated that early metastasis is a major cause of mortality in patients with choriocarcinoma. However, what determines whether early metastasis of choriocarcinoma has occurred is unknown. The emerging role of miRNA in regulating cancer development and progression has been recognized. miR-373 has been shown to play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, whether miR-373 functions to promote choriocarcinoma metastasis is not clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the function of miR-373-3p in the progression of this cancer. METHODS In this study, we first compared epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, which were inversely correlated with miR-373-3p expression in trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cell lines. Using PCR and Western blot, upregulation of miR-373-3p was observed to inhibit EMT progression. Similarly, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that ectopic miR-373-3p overexpression inhibited the migration by transwell methods of choriocarcinoma cells. RESULTS Our results revealed that miR-373-3p acted as an EMT inhibitor in JEG-3 and JAR cells; this was due to its mediation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling pathway, which was responsible for EMT. miRNA microarray analysis demonstrated that miR-373-3p interacted with the 3' untranslated region of TGFβR2 mRNA, and then Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays verified this interaction. CONCLUSION Our findings suggest that miR-373-3p upregulation partly accounts for TGFβR2 downregulation and leads to a restraint of EMT and migration. miR-373-3p may therefore serve as a valuable potential target in the treatment of choriocarcinoma.","Lu, Yanjie; Li, Xiaoru; Zuo, Yanzhen; Xu, Qian; Liu, Lei; Wu, Haiying; Chen, Long; Zhang, Ying; Liu, Ying; Li, Yuhong",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14809; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955122/,377

Intra-operative risks include cartilage damage when inserting multiple screws. A common post-operative complication is distal-varus collapse of the head. The aim of this study was to investigate if an Innovative technique (reduced number of screws and injection of a beta-TCP additivated partially resorbable cement) provides the same or better stability of the reconstructed head compared to the Standard technique (using more screws). A four-fragment fracture was simulated in six pairs of humeri, with partial removal of the cancellous bone to simulate osteoporotic ""eggshell"" defect. One humerus of each pair was repaired with a Standard (locking plate, 2 cortical and 6 locking screws), and the other with the Innovative technique (same plate, 2 cortical and only 3 locking screws, plus cement injection). The reconstructed specimens were subjected to a biomechanical test where a cyclic force of increasing amplitude was applied axially until failure. The Innovative reconstructions withstood a force 3.49 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions before failure started. The maximum force before final collapse for the Innovative reconstructions was 4.24 times larger than the contralateral Standard reconstructions. These differences were statistically significant. The Innovative reconstructions, based on fewer screws and beta-TCP additivated acrylic cement, showed positive results, demonstrating better biomechanical properties compared to the Standard reconstructions. These laboratory findings, along with the advantages of a reduced number of screws, may help perform a surgically safer, and more effective procedure in osteoporotic patients.","Cristofolini, Luca; Morellato, Kavin; Cavallo, Marco; Guerra, Enrico",Medical engineering & physics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2020.06.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709270/,377

Incident reporting systems help prevent harm, yet there is considerable variability in how patient safety incidents are reported. This may lead to inconsistent or unnecessary patterns of incident reporting and failures to identify serious patient safety incidents. This systematic review aims to describe international approaches in relation to defining serious reportable patient safety incidents. METHODS Multiple electronic and gray literature databases were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2019. Empirical studies, reviews, national reports, and policies were included. A narrative synthesis was conducted because of study heterogeneity. RESULTS A total of 50 articles were included. There was wide variation in the terminology used to represent serious reportable patient safety incidents. Several countries defined a specific subset of incidents, which are considered sufficiently serious, yet preventable if appropriate safety measures are taken. Terms such as ""never events,"" ""serious reportable events,"" or ""always review and report"" were used. The following dimensions were identified to define a serious reportable patient safety incident: (1) incidents being largely preventable; (2) having the potential for significant learning; (3) causing serious harm or have the potential to cause serious harm; (4) being identifiable, measurable, and feasible for inclusion in an incident reporting system; and (5) running the risk of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Variations in terminology and reporting systems between countries might contribute to missed opportunities for learning. International standardized definitions and blame-free reporting systems would enable comparison and international learning to enhance patient safety.","Hegarty, Josephine; Flaherty, Sarah Jane; Saab, Mohamad M; Goodwin, John; Walshe, Nuala; Wills, Teresa; McCarthy, Vera J C; Murphy, Siobhan; Cutliffe, Alana; Meehan, Elaine; Landers, Ciara; Lehane, Elaine; Lane, Aoife; Landers, Margaret; Kilty, Caroline; Madden, Deirdre; Tumelty, Mary; Naughton, Corina",Journal of patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1097/pts.0000000000000700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271529/,377
112796,The seroprevalence of canine respiratory coronavirus and canine influenza virus in dogs in New Zealand.,2009,"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is an important immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory virus that primarily infects immune cells and strongly suppresses the proliferation of infected cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation and suppression mediated by HHV-6 are still unknown. In this study, we examined the ability of HHV-6A to manipulate cell cycle progression in infected cells and explored the potential molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that infection with HHV-6A imposed a growth-inhibitory effect on HSB-2 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase. We then showed that the activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex was significantly decreased in HHV-6A-infected HSB-2 cells. Furthermore, we found that inactivation of Cdc2-cyclin B1 in HHV-6A-infected cells occurred through the inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation resulting from elevated Wee1 expression and inactivated Cdc25C. The reduction of Cdc2-cyclin B1 activity in HHV-6-infected cells was also partly due to the increased expression of the cell cycle-regulatory molecule p21 in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, HHV-6A infection activated the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1. Our data suggest that HHV-6A infection induces G(2)/M arrest in infected T cells via various molecular regulatory mechanisms. These results further demonstrate the potential mechanisms involved in immune suppression and modulation mediated by HHV-6 infection, and they provide new insights relevant to the development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutic approaches.","Li, Lingyun; Gu, Bin; Zhou, Feng; Chi, Jing; Wang, Fang; Peng, Guangyong; Xie, Fangyi; Qing, Jian; Feng, Dongju; Lu, Shiqiang; Yao, Kun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02577-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21525341/,377

However, postoperative fractures and poor shoulder function are common. The purpose of this review was to introduce a composite approach in oncologic reconstruction of the proximal humerus and assess its clinical outcomes. METHODS We retrospectively investigated five children (3 osteosarcoma and 2 Ewing's sarcoma) who underwent biological reconstruction with combination of vascularized fibula epiphyseal transfer and massive bone allograft after oncologic resection of the proximal humerus. The mean follow-up was 46.8 months. RESULTS All patients were alive at the last follow-up. There was no graft fracture, hardware failure, or infection. The mean time of osseous union was 2.9 months at fibula-humerus junction and 6.2 months at allograft-humerus junction. Hypertrophy and axial growth were evident in all, except one patient who has avascular necrosis of the fibula head. The mean hypertrophy index was 51.5%, and the mean growth was 4.4 mm per annum. The mean arm discrepancy was 4.6 cm. All reconstruction was in situ with the average abduction of 113° and forward flexion of 69°. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 85.4% at the final follow-up. All patients experienced dropped foot and resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS The combination of vascularized fibula epiphyseal transfer with massive allograft bone provides a reliable oncologic reconstruction of proximal humerus in children. It not only offers the ability of longitudinal growth, hypertrophy, and osseous union but also diminishes reconstructive complications and improves shoulder function.

128499,From Face-to-Face to FaceTime.,2020,"In addition to acting as a transcriptional coactivator, YAP1 directly mediates translocalization of the pro-oncogenic phosphatase SHP2 from the cytoplasm to nucleus. In the cytoplasm, SHP2 potentiates RAS-ERK signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and cell motility, while in the nucleus, it mediates gene regulation. As a result, elucidating the details of SHP2 trafficking is important for understanding its biological roles, including in cancer. YAP1 comprises multiple splicing isoforms defined in part by the presence (as in YAP1-2γ) or absence (as in YAP1-2α) of a γ-segment encoded by exon 6 that disrupts a critical leucine zipper. While the disruptive segment is known to reduce coactivator function, it is unclear how this element impacts the physical and functional relationships between YAP1 and SHP2. To explore this question, we first demonstrated that YAP1-2γ cannot bind SHP2. Nevertheless, YAP1-2γ exhibits stronger mitogenic and motogenic activities than does YAP1-2α because the YAP1-2α-mediated delivery of SHP2 to the nucleus weakens cytoplasmic RAS-ERK signaling. However, YAP1-2γ confers less in vivo tumorigenicity than does YA1-2α by recruiting tumor-inhibitory macrophages. Mechanistically, YAP1-2γ transactivates and the YAP1-2α-SHP2 complex transrepresses the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant CCL2. Thus, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic pro-oncogenic YAP1 activities are inversely regulated by alternative splicing of exon 6. Notably, oncogenic KRAS downregulates the SRSF3 splicing factor that prevents exon 6 skipping, thereby creating a YAP1-2α-dominant situation that supports a ""cold"" immune microenvironment.","Ben, Chi; Wu, Xiaojing; Takahashi-Kanemitsu, Atsushi; Knight, Christopher Takaya; Hayashi, Takeru; Hatakeyama, Masanori",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.013820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763976/,377
140992,"Data Streams, Data Lakes, and Information Pipelines: Enter the Chief Research Information Officer.",2020,"Affibody molecules are a class of small (∼7 kDa) robust scaffold proteins suitable for radionuclide molecular imaging in vivo. The attachment of a hexahistidine (His(6))-tag to the Affibody molecule allows facile purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) but leads to high accumulation of radioactivity in the liver. Earlier, we have demonstrated that replacement of the His(6)-tag with the negatively charged histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate-histidine-glutamate (HEHEHE)-tag permits purification of Affibody molecules by IMAC, enables labeling with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)](+), and provides low hepatic accumulation of radioactivity. In this study, we compared the biodistribution of cysteine-containing Affibody molecules site-specifically labeled with (111)In, (99m)Tc, and (125)I at the C-terminus, having a His(6)-tag at the N- or C-terminus or a HEHEHE-tag at the N-terminus. We show that the use of a HEHEHE-tag provides appreciable reduction of hepatic radioactivity, especially for radiometal labels.

149014,Quality indicators for colonoscopy.,2015,"Background: Observational and intervention studies examining trunk electromyographic (EMG) activity following stroke are underpowered and fail criteria for systematic reviews of randomized control trials. Objective: To systematically evaluate and summarize evidence about trunk muscle activation after stroke during ADL and with diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.Methods: Search databases were Medline Complete, CINAHL and Health Sources: Nursing Academic Edition. Studies written in English after 1989 included these search terms: stroke, muscle activity, and trunk including abdominal or back muscles. Systematic reviews, single case studies, dissertations, or letters to the editor were excluded. Reviewers used Covidence to screen relevant research and extract information after title, abstract, and full-text screening. Information extracted related to stroke severity, time since onset, specific muscles and EMG analysis technique, and study limitations. Articles were classified as observational, intervention or device-related.Results: The electronic search yielded 188 articles and a hand search found 3. Title and abstract screening yielded 102 articles for full text screening. Ultimately, 45 articles were extracted. Trunk muscle recruitment during function and movement demonstrated significant differences in trunk EMG recruitment timing, magnitude, and symmetry after stroke when compared with healthy participants. Individuals with stroke demonstrated significant differences when comparing paretic to non-paretic side trunk EMG measures. Intervention studies showed some effect on improving trunk muscle activation but they had small sample sizes and methodological issues.Conclusions: Trunk muscle activation after stroke can be monitored with EMG during rehabilitation programs which challenge functional recovery.","Babyar, Suzanne R; Holland, Thomas J; Rothbart, Daniel; Pell, John",Topics in stroke rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/10749357.2021.1940725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275435/,377

(Special Issue: The future of e-HRM and artificial intelligence in the hospitality and tourism industry.),2021,"OBJECTIVES Delirium is the most common postoperative neurological complication and some evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is associated with a decreased incidence of delirium. This study is designed to assess the effect of dexmedetomidine on postoperative delirium (POD) in elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS Sixty geriatric patients with MCI were enrolled and ramdomly divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomisation sequence: dexmedetomidine group (D group) and normal saline group (C group). Patients in D group received a loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine over 10 minutes before anesthesia induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.4 μg·kg-1·h-1 until 30 minutes before the end of surgery; equal volume of normal saline was given in C group. Blood samples were extracted to detect the concentration of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-10 (IL-10), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) before anesthesia induction (T1), before suture (T2), and 30 minutes after surgery (T3). Postoperative recovery times were recorded. Delirium was assessed with the 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for confusion assessment method during the first 7 days postoperatively. RESULTS POD occurred in 10 (33.3%) of 30 patients in C group, and in 3 (10%) of 30 patients given dexmedetomidine (odds ratio [OR] 0.222, 95% CI 0.054-0.914; P = 0.028). The serum concentrations of TNF-α, MMP-9, and GFAP were significantly increased and IL-10 was decreased in the C group than in the D group at T2 and T3. No differences were observed between groups in the level of HO-1. Analysis using random-effect multivariable logistic regression indicated that POD was associated with GFAP (odds ratio [OR] 16.691, 95% CI 2.288-121.746; P = 0.005). The positive predictive ability of the multivariate logistic regression model tested by ROC analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.713 (95% CI, 0.584-0.842). CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine can alleviate POD in elderly patients with MCI and may be related to reduce the neuroinflammation by lowering the permeability of blood-brain barrier.","Xin, Xi; Chen, Jing; Hua, Wei; Wang, Haiyun",International journal of geriatric psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411362/,377

Acknowledging the magnitude of the disease, rapid rise in the number of cases and geographical distribution, it is the need of the hour to strengthen preparedness activities and response action plan. In these emergency times, it is important to realize that not the health sector alone cannot make a difference unless other concerned sectors join hands together and work in a concerted and coordinated manner. The planned measures should also simultaneously target the strengthening of the case detection, prompt isolation, contact tracing, facilities for quarantine, and provision of appropriate care to the confirmed cases of the disease. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing at a rapid pace with each day and this clearly highlights the fact that the preparedness and response activities need to be strengthened immensely. However, the success of the implemented measures and the eventual magnitude of the disease will be determined by the adoption of a multi-sectoral approach.","Shrivastava, Saurabh Shrivastava Prateek",The Anatolian Journal of Family Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5505/anatoljfm.2020.25238,377

Through interviews and the analysis of learner diaries, we consider the experience of the school manager and teachers, and the strategies used by the learners, in relation to online delivery, with a particular focus on the measures taken to cater for a group of third-age learners with minimal previous language learning experience. Our analysis highlights the importance of collaborative decision making, team teaching, and a didactic approach that is sensitive to learners’ cultural backgrounds and that provides adequate L1 (i.e. first language) support. From a curriculum perspective, we discuss the importance of including content that is responsive to the evolving emergency context, and which strengthens learners’ ability (and inclination) to use the language-rich context of the public sphere for learning purposes. We also discuss the relative challenge of shifting grammar and vocabulary focused lessons to online delivery. Learners appeared to employ more frequently memory, cognitive and metacognitive strategies and we discuss this in relation to their current emergency learning context and previous educational background.

165286,Conclusion: how could tourism planners and policymakers overcome the barriers to sustainable tourism development in the small island developing state of North Cyprus?,2021,"As a consequence of missing data on tests for infection and imperfect accuracy of tests, reported rates of cumulative population infection by the SARS CoV-2 virus are lower than actual rates of infection. Hence, reported rates of severe illness conditional on infection are higher than actual rates. Understanding the time path of the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the absence of bounds on infection rates that are credible and informative. This paper explains the logical problem of bounding these rates and reports illustrative findings, using data from Illinois, New York, and Italy. We combine the data with assumptions on the infection rate in the untested population and on the accuracy of the tests that appear credible in the current context. We find that the infection rate might be substantially higher than reported. We also find that the infection fatality rate in Illinois, New York, and Italy is substantially lower than reported.","Manski, Charles F.; Molinari, Francesca",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.20066811,377
166392,Development of online learning platform for thai university students,2021,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is traditionally classified based on albuminuria and reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)), but these have limitations as prognostic biomarkers due to the heterogeneity of DKD. Novel prognostic markers are needed to improve stratification of patients based on risk of disease progression. The iBEAT study, part of the BEAt-DKD consortium, aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)) provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD (primary aim), and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD progression (secondary aim). iBEAT is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and eGFR > 30ml/min/1.73m2. At baseline each participant will undergo quantitative renal MRI and US imaging with central processing for MRI images. Blood sampling, urine collection and clinical examinations will be performed and medical history obtained at baseline, and these assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for later biomarker and validation studies. All data will be stored in a central data depository. Data analysis will explore the potential associations between imaging biomarkers and renal function, and whether the imaging biomarkers may improve the prediction of DKD progression rates. Embedded within iBEAT are ancillary substudies that will (1) validate imaging biomarkers against renal histopathology; (2) validate MRI based renal blood flow against water-labelled positron-emission tomography (PET); (3) develop machine-learning methods for automated processing of renal MRI images; (4) examine longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers; (5) examine whether the glycocalyx, microvascular function and structure are associated with imaging biomarkers and eGFR decline; (6) a pilot study to examine whether the findings in T2D can be extrapolated to type 1 diabetes. The iBEAT study, the largest DKD imaging study to date, will provide invaluable insights into the progression and heterogeneity of DKD, and aims to contribute to a more personalized approach to the management of DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Gooding, K.

166795,Evaluating Feasibility and Effectiveness of Digital Game-Based Instructional Technology,2021,"Mandatory energy (calorie) labelling of alcoholic drinks is a public health measure that could be used to address both alcohol consumption and obesity. We used systematic review methodology to assess evidence from studies examining 1) consumer knowledge of the energy content of alcoholic drinks, 2) public support for energy labelling and 3) experiments examining the effect of energy labelling of alcoholic drinks on consumption behaviour. Levels of evidence level were evaluated using the GRADE approach. Eighteen eligible studies (from 16 sources) were included. Among studies examining consumer knowledge of the energy content of alcoholic drinks (N=8) and support for energy labelling (N=9), there was consistent evidence that people tend to be unaware of the energy content of alcoholic drinks, and were more likely to support than oppose energy labelling of alcoholic drinks. The level of evidence supporting these conclusions was rated as moderate due to the majority of studies being of low methodological quality. Six studies examined the effect of energy labelling on outcome measures related to alcohol drinking. Overall, findings were indicative of no likely effect of energy labelling on outcome measures. However, the majority of studies were of low methodological quality, used proxy outcome measures of alcohol drinking and none of the studies were conducted in real-world settings, so the level of evidence supporting this conclusion was classed as very low. Further research is required to determine whether energy labelling of alcoholic drinks affects consumer behaviour and is likely to be an effective public health policy.","Robinson, E.; Humphreys, G.; Jones, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.20181479v1?rss=1,377
166832,Distance learning during lockdown: Satisfaction assessment among moroccan trainee teachers,2021,"Outbreaks, epidemics or pandemics have increased over the last years, increasing the morbidity and mortality over large geographical areas, as well as causing financial crises and irreversible social changes. Coping with emerging infectious diseases such as Covid-19, different mitigation policies are developed by countries. However, the benefit of each mitigation policy is still not well-explored due to the considerable difference between implementations of policies in each country. The question is which policies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19 transmission. Developing two models used in Artificial Neural Network, this study investigates the impact of mitigation policies or strategies (a combination of policies) by considering different vaccination and mutation scenarios. The former model requires the prediction of reproduction number based on the number of cases reported in previous days;whereas, the latter model is constructed based on the number of people impacted by a mitigation policy or strategy. Although the first model yields more accurate results, it requires the use of historical data;hence, the passage of time during a critical period of fighting against Covid-19. The benefit of the second model is that it can be implemented more quickly by determining a coefficient for each policy or strategy based on the restricted population and/or limited mobility. Testing different scenarios through a real-world example from Turkey, we find mitigation policies or strategies play a significant role in controlling Covid-19;as well as vaccination and mutation scenarios. Our results suggest continuous and predetermined mitigation policies or strategies should be implemented to control the spread of infectious diseases in addition to a successful vaccination program.","Çaparoğlu, Ömer Faruk Ok Yeşim Tutam Mahmut","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.111246,377

167173,"Study of the quality of virtual university services at the National University of the Peruvian Amazon, during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"Background Billions of doses of medicines are donated for mass drug administrations in support of the World Health Organization’s “Roadmap to Implementation,” which aims to control, eliminate, and eradicate Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The supply chain to deliver these medicines is complex, with fragmented data systems and limited visibility on performance. This study empirically evaluates the impact of an online supply chain performance measurement system, “NTDeliver,” providing understanding of the value of information sharing towards the success of global health programs. Methods Retrospective secondary data was extracted from NTDeliver, which included 1,484 shipments for four critical medicines ordered by over 100 countries between February 28, 2006 and December 31, 2018. We applied statistical regression models to analyze the impact on key performance metrics, comparing data before and after the system was implemented. Findings The results suggest information sharing has a positive impact on three performance indicators: purchase order timeliness (β=1.01, p<0.000), arrival timeliness (β=0.53, p=0.09), and—most importantly—delivery timeliness (β=0.73, p=0.03). Three variables indicated an increased positive impact when the data is publicly shared: shipment timeliness (β=2.57, p=0.001), arrival timeliness (β=2.88, p=0·003), and delivery timeliness (β=2.82, p=0.01). Conclusions Our findings suggest that information sharing between the NTD program partners can help drive improved performance in the supply chain, and even more so when data is shared publicly. Given the large volume of medicine and the significant number of people requiring these medicines, information sharing has the potential to provide improvements to global health programs affecting the health of tens to hundreds of millions of people Author Summary The supply chain to deliver donated preventive chemotherapy medicines is complex due to the many stakeholders and partnerships participating, as well as challenging because the logistics are further complicated by delivery to remote destinations in developing countries. As MDA campaigns involve treating hundreds of thousands to millions of patients in endemic regions within entire countries over the course of days or weeks, close coordination and timing of medicine delivery is critical. Inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems and limited transparency on supply chain performance further challenges the ability to identify shipment issues and explore the root cause of the issues. Prior to 2016, delivery was performing below standards, lagging as much as 40% below the WHO target of 80% on-time delivery. These delays result in wasted medicine donations, increased program costs, delayed MDAs, or sometimes even completely missed MDAs. In September 2016, an online supply chain performance measurement system, “NTDeliver,” was launched by the NTD Supply Chain Forum (a public-private partnership focused on managing and improving the PC donation supply chain) to enhance supply chain performance and information transparency. Our findings suggest that information sharing through NTDeliver is positively associated with performance at several key stages in NTD supply chain and that information sharing has more substantial positive impact on performance when the information is made publicly accessible, focused towards country program managers. The study findings support investment in supply chain systems and commitment to data transparency, in the context of a growing focus on supply chain investment in NTD programs.","Kasparis, Elena; Huang, Yufei; Lin, William; Vasilakis, Christos",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.446886,377

In this study, we investigate whether clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), a common aging-related process that predisposes various inflammatory responses, may exert COVID-19 severity. We examine the clinical impact of CHIP in 143 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Both stratified analyses and logistic regression including the interaction between canonical risk factors and CHIP show that CHIP is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, especially in previously healthy patients. Analyses of 60,310 single-cell immune transcriptome profiles identify distinct immunological signatures for CHIP (+) severe COVID-19 patients, particularly in classical monocytes, with a marked increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and potent IFN-γ mediated hyperinflammation signature. We further demonstrate that the enhanced expression of CHIP (+) specific IFN-γ response genes is attributed to the CHIP mutation-dependent epigenetic reprogramming of poised or bivalent cis-regulatory elements. Our results highlight a unique immunopathogenic mechanism of CHIP in the progression of severe COVID-19, which could be extended to elucidate how CHIP contributes to a variety of human infectious diseases.","Kang, Chang Kyung; Choi, Baekgyu; Kim, Sugyeong; Park, Seongwan; Yoon, Soon Ho; Lee, Dohoon; Lee, Andrew J.; Ko, Yuji; Chang, Euijin; Jung, Jongtak; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Park, Wan Beom; Kim, Eu Suk; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Nam Joong; Oh, Myoung-don; Kang, Suk-jo; Kang, Kyuho; Kim, Sun; Im, Hogune; Kim, Joohae; Lee, Yong Hoon; Lee, Jaehee; Lee, Ji Yeon; Moon, Joon Ho; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Koh, Youngil; Jung, Inkyung",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.05.463271,377

MRx0518 is under investigation in various oncological settings, including in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (NCT03637803) and radiotherapy (NCT04193904).MethodsTreatment naïve patients were recruited from April 2019 to February 2020. Patients were eligible if they received a histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer (solid tumours) scheduled for surgical resection. Patients received 1 capsule of MRx0518 (1x1010 to 1x1011 CFU) twice daily from inclusion until the day preceding surgery (maximum 28 days therapy). The primary study outcome is to evaluate safety and tolerability of MRx0518 monotherapy in treatment naïve patients. Additional exploratory outcomes including identifying surrogate biomarkers of efficacy, microbiome analysis, effect on metabonomic markers and identification of histological and genomic alterations in paired pre-treatment (diagnostic biopsy) and post-treatment (surgical specimen) samples.ResultsIn part A, 17 patients received treatment, across tumour groups including breast (n=8), prostate (n=4), uterine (n=3), melanoma (n=1) and bladder (n=1). MRx0518 was well tolerated by all, with no grade 3/4 CTCAE toxicity reported, no severe adverse effects or treatment discontinuations. All patients proceeded to surgery, however the COVID-19 pandemic delayed surgery in 3 cases.Analysis of the first 5* patient paired samples utilising the NanoString Pan Cancer IO 360TM Gene Expression panel has demonstrated significant changes in gene expression profiles in 48 genes (pConclusionsThis study has demonstrated the safety and tolerability of the live biotherapeutic MRx0518 in treatment naïve cancer patients. Exploratory analyses of post-treatment samples has echoed preclinical observations of increased infiltration of immune cells following treatment and will undergo further validation. Part B will focus on investigating efficacy in a further 100 treatment naïve patients with a placebo-controlled arm.Trial RegistrationNCT03934827Ethics ApprovalThe study was approved by East of England - Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee approval number 18/EE/0091ReferenceLauté-Caly DL, Raftis EJ, Cowie P, et al.

Examining acquired employability skills in higher education institutions,2021,"AimsThe aim of this study was to identify pre-discharge risk factors associated with early inpatient readmission in general adult service users, with a particular focus on modifiable factors. We hypothesised that stability prior to discharge would reduce readmission to inpatient services within 90 days.BackgroundEarly readmission to inpatient psychiatric services is a poor outcome for service users, staff and the healthcare system. A variety of clinical, demographic and system factors, mostly non-modifiable, have been investigated previously. The identification of pre-discharge and particularly modifiable factors associated with readmission would give an opportunity for intervention and changes in policy.Method272 medical records of all admissions within an 8 month period to a NHS inner city psychiatric inpatient service were reviewed to identify factors associated with readmission within 90 days of discharge. The data were analysed by simple comparison, calculation of odds ratios and logistic regression.Result26% of service users were readmitted to the mental health trust within 90 days of discharge. Incidents (OR = 3.86;95% CI 1.39–10.75) and psychotropic medication change in the week before discharge (OR = 2.94;95% CI 1.43–6.03) were significantly associated with readmission, as were the number of previous admissions, and comorbid substance misuse. Successful overnight leave was found to be significantly protective against readmission (OR = 0.29;95% CI 0.11–0.72).ConclusionThe ability to predict those at high risk for readmission means they can be targeted for interventions and it can also help develop best practice around inpatient care and the discharge process. The novel findings in this study of pre-discharge modifiable risk factors such as stability and successful overnight leave could have significant implications in discharge planning policy.","Wright, Jessica Rhianne Thomas",BJPsych Open,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.800,377
171093,A Snapshot of University Students’ Perceptions About Online Learning During the Covid-19 Pandemic,2022,"In many enveloped virus families, including HIV and HSV, a crucial, yet unexploited, step in the viral life cycle is releasing particles from the infected cell membranes. This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug, tenatoprazole, was previously shown to bind to ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the release of HSV particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with an EC50 of 0.8 μM, which is more potent than tenatoprazole. Finally, we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole-based analogs that demonstrate both binding to Tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of HIV-1 from 293T cells. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses, by interrupting cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell. Importance These results provide the basis for the development of drugs that target enveloped virus budding that can be used ultimately to control multiple virus infections in humans.","Leis, Jonathan; Luan, Chi-Hao; Audia, James E.; Dunne, Sara F.; Heath, Carissa M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.04.075036,377
171823,Technological Skills in Higher Education—Different Needs and Different Uses,2021,"Exposure to infection in utero predisposes towards psychiatric diseases such as autism, depression and schizophrenia in later life. The mechanisms involved are typically studied by administering mimetics of double-stranded (ds) RNA viral or bacterial infection to pregnant rats or mice. The effect of single-stranded (ss) virus mimetics has been largely ignored, despite evidence linking prenatal ss virus exposure specifically with psychiatric disease. Understanding the effects of gestational ss virus exposure has become even more important with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, in pregnant mice, we compare directly the effects, on the maternal blood, placenta and the embryonic brain, of maternal administration of ds-virus mimetic poly I:C (to activate toll-like receptor 3, TLR3) and ss-virus mimetic resiquimod (to activate TLR7/8). We find that, 4h after the administration, both poly I:C and resiquimod elevated the levels of IL-6, TNFα, and chemokines including CCL2 and CCL5, in maternal plasma. Both agents also increased placental mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but only resiquimod increased placental TNFα mRNA. In foetal brain, poly I:C produced no detectable immune-response-related increases, whereas pronounced increases in cytokine (e.g. Il-6, Tnfα) and chemokine (e.g. Ccl2, Ccl5) expression were observed with maternal resiquimod administration. The data show substantial differences between the effect of maternal exposure to a TLR7/8 activator as compared to a TLR3 activator. There are significant implications for future modelling of diseases where maternal ss virus exposure contributes to environmental disease risk in offspring.","Kwon, Jaedeok; Suessmilch, Maria; McColl, Alison; Cavanagh, Jonathan; Morris, Brian J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.460754,377
172521,Contribution of Higher Education Institutions to Social Innovation: Practices in Two Southern European Universities,2021,"Crop diversity is thought to have small, positive impacts on dietary diversity among farming households, particularly when market access is restricted. Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic severely restricted market access. To date, no study has explored the relationship between crop and dietary diversity in this context. To address this gap, we used longitudinal data collected from 833 farmers across 12 states in India at three time points between May and August 2020. Dietary diversity was measured using a modified version of the FAO Minimum Dietary Diversity score for women, which has been used in representative samples of the Indian population in both men and women. Eight food groups were included: (1) starchy staples (rice, wheat, and potatoes), (2) pulses, (3) nuts, (4) vegetables, (5) fruits, (6) dairy, (7) eggs, and (8) fleshy foods (meat, poultry, and fish). Multivariate polynomial logistic regression was used to estimate the association between crop and dietary diversity. Models were adjusted for educational attainment, caste, farm size, having a kitchen garden, and livestock ownership. Participants were, on average, 42.2 years old and 94.2% were male. Dietary diversity decreased over the study period, especially between baseline and follow-up 1, when lockdown measures were the most restrictive (34.2% of participants experienced a decline compared to 16.1% from follow-up 1 to follow-up 2). Compared to farmers who cultivated 1 crop (monocroppers), farmers who cultivated 2 crops or 3 or more crops were significantly less likely to experience a decline in dietary diversity from baseline to follow-up 1: adjusted relative risk (RR) (95% confidence interval [CI]), 0.52 (0.35, 0.78) and 0.48 (0.31, 0.75), respectively. There was no significant association between crop diversity and change in dietary diversity from follow-up 1 to follow-up 2, when phased re-opening had begun. These findings suggest that farmers with greater crop diversity in India were more resilient to market disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, while the links between crop and dietary diversity may be small under normal circumstances, diversifying production systems may play an increasingly important role, as there is greater uncertainty due to global events such as pandemics and climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Connors, Jaacks, Prabhakaran, Veluguri, Ramanjaneyulu and Roy.","Connors, K.; Jaacks, L.

To identify and critically evaluate insights on which ideas for marketing communication activities for NBF Connect can be built upon. To build an operational plan for NBF Connect customer engagement on online social communities. Case overview/synopsis: In 2020, NBF launched a new digital platform for SMEs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called “NBF Connect” with the purpose of redefining banking services for the small businesses sector. The digitalization wave in the UAE was revolutionizing various industry sectors. The global banking industry was already impacted by digitalization and some banks in the UAE, especially in the retail segment (Emirates NBD, 2017), had already introduced many technology-led innovations bringing more effectiveness in the processes and better customer experience. However, the SME banking segment was lagging in terms of innovation. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic situation, with compulsory lockdowns and social distancing, changed the way of doing business for entire industries and increased the pressure on banks for the provisioning of new digital products. Rose joined NBF in the first part of 2020 as Product Owner of the project NBF Connect. The new digital platform was ideated by NBF to be differentiated from other banking products. It was co-created with insights from and regular interaction with the SME community. After the deployment of the first version of the platform in April 2020, Rose realized that the user adoption and commercial results were below par. Over the next three months, only a few users were using the platform with shallow interactions. This case study looks at Rose’s journey as NBF refined and evolved its SME banking platform, including developing and positioning the digital platform in the market, identifying competitive advantages and developing the right commercial strategy to monetize NBF’s investment in the digital platform’s development.

173557,"THE ""BLACK SWAN"" OF COVID-19 AND THE SECURITY ISSUES IN DIGITAL LEARNING",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic challenged society, requiring measures that impacted communities socially and economically. Rurally dispersed older adults [RDOA] have a greater number of health comorbidities, poorer finances and limited access to internet and community resources (e.g. healthcare specialists), leaving them more vulnerable in a crisis. Current guidelines are better suited to urban communities, neglect certain needs of RDOA, and are at times difficult to navigate/access due to their online formats. RDOA specific resources are warranted and development should involve stakeholders. CMU-CARES sought to develop an innovative protocol that would engage RDOA in the development of a crisis preparedness toolkit. CMU-CARES protocol consists of six stages. (1) Awareness by community-based outreach (e.g. mailed-letters, social media, community organizations) and participation from older adults in previous studies with the college of medicine. (2) Engagement occurred once a participant expressed interest. (3) Screening was completed at time of engagement. (4) Interviews/Interactions were modified from the WHOQOL-BREF and completed via Web-Ex online software to observe social distancing requirements. (5) Transcript analysis was completed with NVivo software to identify participant identified themes. (6) Design and development of a toolkit based on interviews. A target sample limited to 20–25 RDOA was used to reach data saturation. Presently 20 interviews have been completed. Preliminary themes include the need for timely and reliable information, training in use of technology and the need for social interaction. Overall, CMU-CARES is a novel person-centered project dedicated to improving well-being and healthcare outcomes in the vulnerable RDOA population during crises. It hopes to foster camaraderie between healthcare providers and the community while inspiring medical student driven research and fostering careers in geriatrics, primary care and public health policy.","Varriano, Brenda Dickinson Averie Raha Mouzoon Long Jacob Lu Ruoxi Beatty Andrea Ragina Neli Pandey Jyotsna",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.58,377

LP-Ag was made into an immunochromatographic strip. When a blood sample was added to the sample hole of the test card, it would move forward along the nitrocellulose (NC) film. If the sample contained IgM, the IgM bound to LP-Ag and formed anMline with the coated mouse anti-human IgM antibody, giving a positive response to the presence of IgM of COVID-19. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the immunochromatographic strip based on the LP was compared with those of the nucleic acid detection method and the colloidal gold method, proving it to be much simpler than the nucleic acid detection method, which can greatly shorten the detection period, and to be much more stable than the colloidal gold method, which can overcome uncertainty. LP-Ag can be used to image lung tissue with COVID-19 by two-photon fluorescence microscopy (TFM).

174691,Will Facts Convince Our Patients To Be Vaccinated?,2021,"When new pathogens emerge, numerous questions arise about their future spread, some of which can be addressed with probabilistic forecasts. The many uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging pathogens can make it difficult to choose among model structures and assumptions, however. To assess the potential for uncertainties about emerging pathogens to affect forecasts of their spread, we evaluated the performance of a suite of 16 forecasting models in the context of the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic in Colombia. Each model featured a different combination of assumptions about the role of human mobility in driving transmission, spatiotemporal variation in transmission potential, and the number of times the virus was introduced. All models used the same core transmission model and the same iterative data assimilation algorithm to generate forecasts. By assessing forecast performance through time using logarithmic scoring with ensemble weighting, we found that which model assumptions had the most ensemble weight changed through time. In particular, spatially coupled models had higher ensemble weights in the early and late phases of the epidemic, whereas non-spatial models had higher ensemble weights at the peak of the epidemic. We compared forecast performance of the equally-weighted ensemble model to each individual model and identified a trade-off whereby certain individual models outperformed the ensemble model early in the epidemic but the ensemble model outperformed all individual models on average. On balance, our results suggest that suites of models that span uncertainty across alternative assumptions are necessary to obtain robust forecasts in the context of emerging infectious diseases.","Oidtman, R.

175474,Pre-service social sciences teachers’ reflections on a teacher preparation program,2021,"Due to the fast transmission speed and severe health damage, COVID-19 has attracted global attention. Early diagnosis and isolation are effective and imperative strategies for epidemic prevention and control. Most diagnostic methods for the COVID-19 is based on nucleic acid testing (NAT), which is expensive and time-consuming. To build an efficient and valid alternative of NAT, this article investigates the feasibility of employing computed tomography images of lungs as the diagnostic signals. Unlike normal lungs, parts of the lungs infected with the COVID-19 developed lesions, ground-glass opacity, and bronchiectasis became apparent. Through a public dataset, in this article, we propose an advanced residual learning diagnosis detection (RLDD) scheme for the COVID-19 technique, which is designed to distinguish positive COVID-19 cases from heterogeneous lung images. Besides the advantage of high diagnosis effectiveness, the designed residual-based COVID-19 detection network can efficiently extract the lung features through small COVID-19 samples, which removes the pretraining requirement on other medical datasets. In the test set, we achieve an accuracy of 91.33%, a precision of 91.30%, and a recall of 90%. For the batch of 150 samples, the assessment time is only 4.7 s. Therefore, RLDD can be integrated into the application programming interface and embedded into the medical instrument to improve the detection efficiency of COVID-19.","Zhang, M. D.; Chu, R.

A concern has arisen that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the incidence of childhood obesity. Current Concepts: The consequences of severe pediatric obesity are more devastating than those of moderate obesity. Children with severe obesity are at a greater risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, and adult obesity. Correct assessment and diagnosis of a child with severe obesity is key to successful therapy. A thorough history and physical examination are important in identifying monogenic obesity or metabolic syndrome. Eating behaviors and psychosocial factors should be assessed to improve weight management outcomes. Treatment options for severe pediatric obesity include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic and bariatric surgery. Even though progress has been made with regard to the treatment of obesity, safe and effective treatment of severe pediatric obesity is challenging.

175786,20 years of Nordic tourism experience research: a review and future research agenda. (Special Issue: 20th anniversary of the scandinavian journal of hospitality and tourism.),2021,"SARS-CoV-2 genetic material has been detected in raw wastewater around the world throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and has served as a useful tool for monitoring community levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections. SARS-CoV-2 genetic material is highly detectable in a patient feces and the household wastewater for several days before and after a positive COVID-19 qPCR test from throat or sputum samples. Here, we characterize genetic material collected from raw wastewater samples and determine recovery efficiency during a concentration process. We find that pasteurization of raw wastewater samples did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 signal if RNA is extracted immediately after pasteurization. On the contrary, we find that signal decreased by approximately half when RNA was extracted 24-36 hours post-pasteurization and ~90% when freeze-thawed prior to concentration. As a matrix control, we use an engineered enveloped RNA virus. Surprisingly, after concentration, the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 signal is consistently higher than the recovery of the control virus leading us to question the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic material detected in wastewater. We see no significant difference in signal after different 24-hour temperature changes; however, treatment with detergent decreases signal ~100-fold. Furthermore, the density of the samples is comparable to enveloped retrovirus particles, yet, interestingly, when raw wastewater samples were used to inoculate cells, no cytopathic effects were seen indicating that wastewater samples do not contain infectious SARS-CoV-2. Together, this suggests that wastewater contains fully intact enveloped particles.","Robinson, C. A.; Hsieh, H.-y.; Hsu, S.

176068,Probability-density risk-maps for tourism during emergencies,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 surge in March 2020 resulted in a hiatus placed on screening mammography programs in support of shelter-inplace mandates and diversion of medical resources to pandemic management. The COVIDrelated economic recession and ongoing social distancing policies continued to influence screening practices after the hiatus was lifted. We evaluated the effect of the hiatus on breast cancer stage distribution on the diverse patient population of a health care system in New York City, the first pandemic epicenter in the United States. Methods: Breast cancer patients diagnosed January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020 were analyzed, with comparisons of stage distribution and mammography screen-detection for three intervals: Pre-Hiatus, During Hiatus (March 15, 2020 to June 15, 2020), and Post- Hiatus. Results were stratified by African American (AA), White American (WA), Asian (As) and Hispanic/Latina (Hisp) self-reported racial/ethnic identity. Results: A total of 894 patients were identified;of these, 549 WA, 100 AA, 104 As, and 93 Hisp comprised the final race/ethnicity-stratified study population. Overall, 588 patients were diagnosed Pre-Hiatus, 61 During-Hiatus, and 245 Post-Hiatus. Nearly two-thirds (65.5%) of the Pre- Hiatus cases were screen-detected versus 49.2% During-Hiatus and 54.7% Post-Hiatus (p = 0.002). Frequency of tumors diagnosed &lt; 1 cm declined from 41.9% Pre-Hiatus to 31.7% Post-Hiatus (p = 0.035). WA patients were more likely to have screen-detected disease compared to AA in the Pre-Hiatus period (69.1% vs. 56.1%;p = 0.05) but non-significantly more likely to have screendetected disease compared to As and Hisp patients (66.2% vs. 56.9%;p = 0.08). In the Post- Hiatus period, the frequency of screen-detected disease was highest among WA patients (63.0%) compared to all other racial/ethnic groups (AA;48.1%, As-33.3%, and Hisp-40%;p = 0.007). Similar patterns were observed for frequency of tumors diagnosed ≤1cm Pre-Hiatus (WA-44.3% vs AA-26%, p = 0.02;and vs. As-41.3%, Hisp-48%;p = 0.09), and Post-Hiatus (WA-37.7% vs. AA- 18.2%, As-30.8%, Hisp-23.5%;p = 0.25). Conclusions: The 3-month pandemicrelated mammography screening hiatus resulted in a more advanced stage distribution for New York City breast cancer patients, and worsened preexisting race/ethnicity-associated disparities, especially for AA pts.","Fasano, G.

New entities, issues, and ideas continuously emerge, while the semantics of the existing conversation topics gradually shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT greatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of content understanding tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to study how these language models can be adapted to better handle continuously evolving web content. In our study, we first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter data, and unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past tweets would heavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we investigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of existing tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To this end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well as propose three sampling methods which help in efficient incremental training for BERT-like models.

Conventional gene selection methods employing statistical tests have the critical problem of heavy dependence of P-values on sample size. Although the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA) and tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) has often outperformed these statistical test-based methods, the reason why they worked so well is unclear. In this study, we aim to understand this reason in the context of projection pursuit that was proposed a long time ago to solve the problem of dimensions; we can relate the space spanned by singular value vectors with that spanned by the optimal cluster centroids obtained from K-means. Thus, the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE can be understood by this equivalence. In addition to this, empirical threshold adjusted P-values of 0.01 assuming the null hypothesis that singular value vectors attributed to genes obey the Gaussian distribution empirically corresponds to threshold-adjusted P-values of 0.1 when the null distribution is generated by gene order shuffling. These findings thus rationalize the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE for the first time.","Taguchi, Y-h.; Turki, Turki",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.02.324616,377

Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, incompletely understood deleterious and aberrant host immune responses play critical roles in severe disease. Rheumatologists have the best experience of studying and treating these complicated hyperinflammatory processes. Objectives: To summarize the available information on pathophysiology of COVID-19. Methods: As part of a EULAR taskforce, two systematic literature reviews were performed one on pathophysiology and one on immunomodulatory therapies. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the following PICO framework: P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection;I (intervention): any intervention/no intervention;C (comparator): any comparator;O (outcome) any clinical or serological outcome including but not limited to immune cell phenotype and function and serum cytokine concentration. The results pertaining to pathophysiology of COVID-19 are presented here. Results: Of the 55496 records yielded, 85 articles were eligible for inclusion. Included studies were at variable risk of bias and exploring various aspects of disease pathogenesis from immune to non-immune cells (Table 1). Pro-inflammatory cytokines' expression including IL-6, was increased, especially in severe COVID-19, although not as high as other states with severe systemic inflammation. Innate and adaptative immune cell compartments were differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection: neutrophils displayed an immature differentiation state and also increased neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation. Dendritic cell number was reduced and classical monocytes was increased although displaying a reduced expression of HLA-DR. The lymphoid compartment was also affected: lymphopenia was present with a reduced number of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and more frequent PD1+CD8+ T cells corresponding to an exhausted phenotype. Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a high variability across individuals and disease spectrum. Multiparametric algorithms showed variable diagnostic performances in predicting survival, hospitalization, disease progression or severity, and mortality. Differences in SARS-CoV-2 manifestations in adults and children were highlighted. Conclusion: Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection affects both innate and adaptative immune responses in a variable way, according to both disease severity and individual parameters. This SLR informs the EULAR points to consider on pathophysiology and use of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19.","Najm, A.; Alunno, A.; Mariette, X.; Terrier, B.; De Marco, G.; Mason, L.; Emmel, J.; McGonagle, D.; Machado, P.

180047,Tools and techniques to stimulate higher order thinking in online learning,2021,"Background Like other Asian countries, acquired Aplastic Anaemia (AA) is prevalent in Myanmar and severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) is one of the leading cause of mortality among haematological disorders, particularly from infectious complications. As there is no health insurance system, patients with SAA who are mainly from poor socio-economic class, have to rely on government supply of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with anti-thymocyte globulin and ciclosporin. During pandemic, new cases are provided individually tailored treatment to minimize the risk while the patients already treated with IST are followed-up by telecommunication. Under such limited setting, outcome of SAA who received IST are reviewed to provide balanced care between risk and benefit amid pandemic in this referral center of the country. Methods In our center, SAA and very severe aplastic anaemia (VSAA) classified according to the modified Camitta criteria were treated with Anti-thymocyte globulin -Equine (Thymogam) 250mg/5ml, Bharat Serums and Vaccines ltd., India, in a total dose ranged between (depend on availability of supply) 40 to 160mg/kg divided into 4 or 5 days of intravenous infusion with oral ciclosporin A (CsA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. During Covid-19 pandemic, new cases of VSAA and cases refractory to previously received IST have been offered Eltrombopag (EPAG) 100mg/day for 8 weeks and tapered depend on response. Results Between January, 2018 to July, 2020, 11 cases of SAA and 9 cases of VSAA, 19 in total, at median age 24 years (range 14-57 years) with female to male ratio of 1:5.3 received IST. Of 19, only one patient had evidence of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Nine of 19 (47.4%) received lower dose of ATG ranged between 40-60 mg/kg while 5 (26.3%) had 60-80 mg/kg and another 5 (26.3%) had standard dose of 160 mg/kg. Eltrombopag was added to IST in two non-responder VSAA and up-front therapy combined with CsA in two without ATG. However, due to inadequate response, ATG has to be added later. Mortality rate during initial 12 weeks was 3/19 (15.8%) from bleeding and sepsis before achieving response, two of whom were from lower dose range group. Overall response was observed in 15 (78.9%) as early as 2nd month and all became transfusion independent although complete remission was not achieved. One without response received second course of IST at a higher dose followed by addition of EPAG. Among responder, one relapsed after one year despite having standard dose of ATG and one lost to follow-up. To date, during median follow-up of 16 months (range 3 to 30 months) except one who relapsed, 14 (73.7%) remained alive and free from SARS-COV-2 infection as well as transformation to myelodysplasia. Conclusion This is the first report from Myanmar on response to ATG supporting immune mediated aetiology underlying AA similar to other regions from Asia. This limited experience on minimum immunosuppression with low- dose ATG even at 40-60mg/kg had helped SAA and VSAA to keep transfusion independent and stay safe during pandemic.

This is most commonly in the pleural cavity. Surgery for recurrent thymoma has been shown to have a survival advantage. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a reduction in capacity for routine healthcare provision. We present the outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for recurrent thymoma during the COVID-19 pandemic and our protocols to allow surgery to be performed during this time. Retrospective review of patients undergoing surgery for recurrent thymoma between March 2020 and the March 2021 at a single centre was performed. Preoperative demographic data, postoperative outcomes and the incidence of complications or postoperative COVID-19 infection were assessed. Over a 4-year period, and under the care of a single surgeon, 7 operations were performed for recurrent thymoma. Of these, three patients were operated during the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients had a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) and all patients presented with disease recurrence in the pleural cavity. No patients had post-operative complications and no patients tested positive for COVID-19 in the pre or postoperative period. Complete macroscopic resection was achieved in all patients. Surgery for recurrent thymoma can be performed safely and complete macroscopic resection can be achieved. It is possible to offer surgery with low risk of perioperative COVID infection and related morbidity and mortality. Given the benefits seen in survival and disease-free survival, we believe surgery for recurrent thymoma should continue to be advocated even during the current viral pandemic. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

180177,Coronavirus- aviation's biggest challenge,2020,"Technological advancements have led to generation and collection of big data from various data sources including mobile devices. For instance, to prevent, combat and detect COVID-19, citizens of many countries were encouraged to use contact tracing apps on their mobile devices. Collection of their trajectories can be analyzed and mined for social goods. At the same time, their privacy also needs to be preserved. In other words, the advent of COVID-19 has made releasing of patient records become imperative and yet privacy of individuals must be protected. Releasing spatio-temporal COVID-19 data plays a significant role in contact tracing and may help in reducing the spread of the disease due to likelihood of increasing adherence to social distancing and other health related guidelines by the people around the cluster of the released data. In this paper, we examine the problem of preserving privacy of spatio-temporal trajectory data and introduce a hierarchical temporal representative point (HTRP) differential privacy model. We evaluate our framework using a South Korean COVID-19 patient route dataset. Empirical results show a balance of utility and privacy provided by our framework with our HTRP for privacy-preserving healthcare data analytics. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Leung, C.

A pre-tested questionnaire was used and participants were recruited for 10 days via a source list of email addresses and two discrete Instagram organic open campaigns. A total of 3,122 responses were collected: 509 participants were recruited by email (2.1% response rate) and 2,613 by the two Instagram campaigns (20.7% and 11.7% conversion rates), respectively. Response/min collection rates in the first 24 h ranged between 0.23 (email) and 1.09 (first campaign). In total, 98.8% of all responses were received in the first 48 h for the different recruitment strategies. There were significant differences for all demographic variables (p<0.001) between email and Instagram respondents, except for sex (p=0.373). Instagram respondents were slightly older, had more professional experience (years in practice), and a higher graduate education level than email respondents. Moreover, most email and Instagram respondents worked in the public sector and private practice, respectively. Although both strategies could collect responses from all Brazilian regions, email responses were slightly better distributed across the five territorial areas compared to Instagram. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that survey recruitment of a large sample using Instagram is feasible. However, using Instagram to engage participants is challenging and has limitations that warrant further investigation. Combination of email and Instagram recruitment led to a more diverse population and improved response rates.","Moraes, R. R.; Correa, M. B.; Daneris, A.; Queiroz, A. B.; Lopes, J. P.; Lima, G.

The proposed study analyzes a system architecture for the identification of individuals affected by the virus, estimating their biomedical parameters. The presented method exploits different techniques, such as stereoscopy vision, thermal measures and remote photoplethysmography, to acquire standalone data that can be compared to evaluate the target risk. The tested solutions are proposed to measure the social distancing among multiple individuals, the skin temperature of a target person, and the image photoplethysmography signal, that are critical parameters to detect a potentially infect individual during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different test strategies were adopted to carry out the mentioned tasks. To measure the distance between target individuals, two drones equipped with visible band cameras were employed. To measure the skin temperature of a target, a drone equipped with a thermal camera was adopted, performing measures at different distances and heights. To obtain the image photoplethysmography signal, a video file from drone camera is processed. Image processing techniques are required to elaborate the data coming from several images and videos acquired by drones. Comparing the measures, altered biomedical parameters of several targets can be detected and later tested with medical equipment. © 2021 IEEE.","Conte, C.; De Alteriis, G.; De Pandi, F.; Caputo, E.; Lo Moriello, R.

Their ontogeny, subpopulations, localization and trafficking, and responses to pathogens are reviewed. The development of porcine T cells begins in the liver during the first trimester of fetal life and continues in the thymus from the second trimester until after birth. Porcine T cells are divided into two lineages, based on their possession of the alphabeta or gammadelta T-cell receptor. Porcine alphabeta T cells recognize antigens in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted manner, whereas the gammadelta T cells recognize antigens in a MHC non-restricted fashion. The CD4+CD8- and CD4+CD8lo T cell subsets of alphabeta T cells recognize antigens presented in MHC class II molecules, while the CD4-CD8+ T cell subset recognizes antigens presented in MHC class I molecules. Porcine alphabeta T cells localize mainly in lymphoid tissues, whereas gammadelta T cells predominate in the blood and intestinal epithelium of pigs. Porcine CD8+ alphabeta T cells are a prominent T-cell subset during antiviral responses, while porcine CD4+ alphabeta T cell responses predominantly occur in bacterial and parasitic infections. Porcine gammadelta T cell responses have been reported in only a few infections. Porcine T cell responses are suppressed by some viruses and bacteria. The mechanisms of T cell suppression are not entirely known but reportedly include the killing of T cells, the inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation, the inhibition of antiviral cytokine production, and the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines.","Charerntantanakul, Wasin; Roth, James A",Animal health research reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17389056/,377

This document summarizes the recommendations of the CDC for basic health services. Disease surveillance in communities and hospitals should be performed in light of existing information on risk factors, particularly those related to geographic dissemination patterns and to documented transmission of SARS-CoV, the coronavirus that causes SARS. As long as no cases of person-to-person disease transmission are reported anywhere in the world, efforts should be aimed at early detection and notification of cases and of groups of people who are in contact with one another and who have severe respiratory infections of undetermined cause, such as pneumonia, which could signal the reemergence of SARS. If cases of transmission of SARS-CoV have been reported, the aim should be to immediately identify and notify any cases detected in order to take appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures and to facilitate outbreak control. The reach of surveillance and reporting activities in specific communities should depend on how widely the disease has spread, both in the community and in local health services.

While many of the risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in western countries are well-recognized, it remains unclear whether they are the same in Thailand. We set out to investigate the risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma in Thailand. Methods: Starting March 4, 2016, we reviewed studies found using pre-specified keywords on SCOPUS, Pro Quest Science Direct, PubMed, and online public access catalog of Khon Kaen University. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed the studied Risk of Bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools were used to assess the quality of included studies. The risk effects of factors were estimated as a pooled adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. The heterogeneity of results was considered using the I-square, Tau-square and Chi-square statistics. Results: A strong association was found between cholangiocarcinoma and age, Opisthorchis viverrini infection, eating raw cyprinoid fish, family history of cancer, liquor consumption, and taking praziquantel. There was only a mild association found between eating nitrite-containing foods, fresh vegetables, education, smoking behavior, and sex. No association was found between cholangiocarcinoma and eating fermented fish (Pla-ra), northeastern Thai or Chinese sausage, sticky rice, meat, chewing betel nut, or eating fruit. There were two protective factors including fresh vegetables consumption and education attainment.

Digital money has several disadvantages: Payments are difficult or outright impossible in emergency situations such as the failure of the electricity grid or Internet. CBDC may also be difficult to handle for children, the elderly, or non-resident travelers. To overcome these problems, we design a cash-like CBDC experience. Our design process has three stages: interviews, system design, and system tests. Based on the interviews, we design and implement a CBDC component which is physical and offline. We then test our system for usability. We discuss a spectrum of trust levels to allow for offline payments and argue that our system can handle emergencies and exceptional situations for digital payments.","Wang, Ye; Chen, Yu; Wang, Shenyi; Zhou, Chenhang; Zheng, Xiaochen; Wattenhofer, Roger",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10480v1.pdf,377

Methods: Throat swabs and sputum were sampled in pairs from 78 patients before discharge and sampled in pairs twice from 54 cases with an interval of 1-5 d. Real-time fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the virus in the two types of samples. Throat swab, sputum and fecal samples of six patients were tested for 2019-nCoV during follow-up. Results: The detection rate of viral nucleic acid was 46.15% in throat swabs and 50.00% in sputum samples. Test results of the second paired samples showed that the detection rate of viral nucleic acid was 25.93% in throat swabs and 46.30% in sputum samples, and the difference between the two types of samples was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). During follow-up, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid could be detected in the fecal samples of the six patients, but not in their throat swab and sputum samples. Their fecal samples remained positive up to 52 d. Conclusions: In the late convalescence, the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 patients gradually disappeared with the improvement of clinical symptoms. Moreover, the virus might enter the gastrointestinal tract from respiratory tract, and could long-term exist in recovered patients and be excreted in feces. In order to reduce the rate of missed detection and avoid false negative results, it was suggested to test the viral nucleic acid in different types of samples before a COVID-19 patient was discharged.","Lyu, Likun; Li, Li; Liu, Xiaochang; Xie, Tong; Zhou, Penghui; Zheng, Baolu; Liu, Yong; Liu, Peng; Li, Xiaoyan; Su, Xu",Chin.

210225,An Investigation on Online Learning for K12 in Rural Areas in China during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Objectives: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition initiated by psychological trauma. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been a source of great fear and stress. Few studies have reported on psychiatric disorders among patients with COVID-19. The goal of this study was to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with PTSD among patients with confirmed COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective observational study utilized the IBM® Explorys® electronic health record database. Participants included patients with a first COVID-19 diagnosis between December 1, 2019 and July 31, 2020. The outcome of interest was a diagnosis for PTSD after COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 diagnoses were determined via the Standard Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) codes or positive test results;PTSD diagnoses were identified by SNOMED-CT codes. Factors examined included age, sex, race and ethnicity, Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), mental health history, COVID-19 severity (e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) admission), and lifestyle. Logistic regression models were employed to investigate the strength of the association (odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)) between each factor and PTSD. Factors with a p-value&lt;0.20 were selected for a subsequent multivariable model. Results: Of 89,457 (mean age 47 years;57% female) patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis, 373 developed PTSD. Age, female, race and ethnicity, CCI, mental health history, COVID-19 severity, smoking status and obesity were significantly associated with PTSD. Age (OR=0.98 [95% CI 0.97-0.99]), mental health history (4.39 [3.05-6.18]), COVID-19 severity (hospitalization (2.50 [1.81-3.42]);ICU admission (8.22 [5.33-12.32])), smoking status (1.39 [1.05-1.82]), and obesity (1.84 [1.43-2.38]) were independently associated with PTSD in a multivariable model. Conclusions: This study identified a wide variety of factors associated with PTSD after COVID-19 infection. These findings can guide healthcare professionals to develop programs targeted at COVID-19 patients at risk for PTSD.","Rosario, B. L.; Huang, H.; Jackson, G.

214228,MOOC Learning Assessment in Clinical Settings: Analysis from Quality Dimensions,2021,"Data accumulation in public databases has resulted in extensive use of meta-analysis, a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple studies. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical activity and antioxidant activity, which can be studied in insects by transcriptome analysis. This study aimed to apply a meta-analysis approach to evaluate insect oxidative transcriptomes using publicly available data. We collected oxidative stress response-related RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data for a wide variety of insect species, mainly from public gene expression databases, by manual curation. Only RNA-seq data of Drosophila melanogaster were found and were systematically analyzed using a newly developed RNA-seq analysis workflow for species without a reference genome sequence. The results were evaluated by two metric methods to construct a reference dataset for oxidative stress response studies. Many genes were found to be downregulated under oxidative stress and related to organ system process (GO:0003008) and adherens junction organization (GO:0034332) by gene enrichment analysis. A cross-species analysis was also performed. RNA-seq data of Caenorhabditis elegans were curated, since no RNA-seq data of insect species are currently available in public databases. This method, including the workflow developed, represents a powerful tool for deciphering conserved networks in oxidative stress response.","Bono, Hidemasa",,,377

Fast, accurate, and simple blood-based assays for quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are urgently needed to identify infected individuals and keep track of the spread of disease. METHODS: The study included 33 plasma samples from 20 individuals with confirmed COVID-19 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and 40 non-COVID-19 plasma samples. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected by a microfluidic quantitative immunomagnetic assay (IMA) (ViroTrack Sero COVID IgM + IgA/IgG Ab, Blusense Diagnostics) and compared to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (EuroImmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika). RESULTS: Of the 33 plasma samples from the COVID-19 patients, 28 were positive for IgA/IgM or IgG by IMA and 29 samples were positive by ELISA. Sensitivity for only one sample per patient was 68% for IgA + IgM and 75% IgG by IMA and 80% by ELISA. For samples collected 14 days after symptom onset, the sensitivity of both IMA and ELISA was around 91%. The specificity of the IMA reached 100% compared to 95% for ELISA IgA and 97.5% for ELISA IgG. CONCLUSION: IMA for COVID-19 is a rapid simple-to-use point-of-care test with sensitivity and specificity similar to a commercial ELISA.","Moeller, Maria E; Fock, Jeppe; Pah, Pearlyn; Veras, Antia De La C; Bade, Melanie; Donolato, Marco; Israelsen, Simone B; Eugen-Olsen, Jesper; Benfield, Thomas; Engsig, Frederik N",J Med Virol,,377

Emergency orthopaedic operations are still among the most commonly performed procedures with increased risk of transmission of SARS CoV-2 to the patients and the healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to present the evidence available into best practices limiting the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare setting during current and future pandemics. METHODS: A review of the literature was performed in multiple databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control), using 'COVID-19' with other relevant keywords in different combinations. Owing to the limited and heterogenous evidence available, data were presented in a narrative manner. FINDINGS: From the evidence gathered it was noted that a multimodal approach to minimising pathogen transmission is required. This primarily comprises the wider engineering and administrative controls to reduce the concentration of the pathogen and to separate staff and patients from it. Theatre isolation and traffic control bundling, theatre flow and logistics, ventilation and waste management form a pivotal role in the environmental/engineering controls. Administrative measures include policies for both patients and staff. For patients, isolation and preoperative screening are of utmost value. For staff, testing for COVID-19, risk assessment, redeployment and provision of persona; protective equipment, together with the necessary training are important administrative controls. CONCLUSION: We believe these measures are likely to improve the sustainability of resources and can be carried to elective settings in order to return to some form of normality and help to mitigate the effects of future pandemics.","Khalefa, M A; Khadabadi, N A; Moores, T S; Hossain, F S",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,377

SETTING: Complex sample survey designed to produce nationally representative estimates of behavioral and clinical characteristics of adults with diagnosed HIV in the United States. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of having &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19 and prevalence differences (PDs) by race/ethnicity, income level, and type of health insurance. We considered PDs &#8805;5 percentage points to be meaningful from a public health perspective. RESULTS: An estimated 37.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 36.6 to 39.2] of adults receiving HIV care had &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity associated with severe illness from COVID-19. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks or African Americans were more likely [adjusted PD, 7.8 percentage points (95% CI: 5.7 to 10.0)] and non-Hispanic Asians were less likely [adjusted PD, -13.7 percentage points (95% CI: -22.3 to -5.0)] to have &#8805;1 diagnosed comorbidity after adjusting for age differences.

Unprepared for this emergency, hospitals have quickly reformulated paths of assistance in an effort to guarantee treatment for infected patients. Orthopaedic departments have been focused on elderly traumatology, especially the treatment of femoral neck fractures in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the orthopaedic management strategy for femoral fragility fractures in COVID-19-positive patients with the hypothesis that operative treatment may contribute to the overall stability of the patient. METHODS: Sixteen patients affected by proximal femoral fracture and a recent history of fever, shortness of breath, and desaturation were admitted to the emergency room. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) and oropharyngeal swabs confirmed that they were positive for COVID-19, requiring hospitalization and prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin. RESULTS: Three patients died before surgery because of severe respiratory insufficiency and multiple-organ-failure syndrome. Ten patients underwent surgery on the day after admission, whereas 3 patients had suspended their use of direct thrombin inhibitors and needed surgery to be delayed until the third day after admission. In all patients except 1, we noted an improvement in terms of O2 saturation and assisted respiration. In 9 patients, hemodynamic and respiratory stability was observed at an average of 7 days postoperatively. Four patients who underwent surgical treatment died of respiratory failure on the first day after surgery (1 patient), the third day after surgery (2 patients), or the seventh day after surgery (1 patient). CONCLUSIONS: We noted a stabilization of respiratory parameters in 12 COVID-19-positive patients who underwent surgery treatment of proximal femoral fractures. We believe that in elderly patients with COVID-19 who have proximal femoral fractures, surgery may contribute to the overall stability of the patient, seated mobilization, improvement in physiological ventilation, and general patient comfort in bed.

Our empirical results show that (i) COVID-19 has a negative but short-term impact on stock markets of affected countries and that (ii) the impact of COVID-19 on stock markets has bidirectional spill-over effects between Asian countries and European and American countries. However, there is no evidence that COVID-19 negatively affects these countries’ stock markets more than it does the global average. The findings contribute to the research on economic impact of the pandemic by providing empirical evidence that COVID-19 has spill-over effects on stock markets of other countries.

This study investigated the IPV help-seeking messages disseminated by the Spanish-speaking media in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We engaged in an exploratory content analysis of videos from Univision's main website, the most-watched Spanish-speaking media network in the U.S. We searched for videos related to IPV help-seeking posted from March 19-April 21, 2020-including the weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the U.S. mandated a shelter-in-place. After assessing inclusion criteria, 29 videos were analyzed. Data were analyzed using basic content analysis to determine frequencies and inductive interpretive content analysis to code for help-seeking messages. We identified eight manifest messages related to seeking help when experiencing IPV in times of a crisis: (1) contact a professional resource; (2) contact law enforcement; (3) contact family, friends, and members of your community; (4) create a safety plan; (5) don't be afraid, be strong; (6) leave the situation; (7) protect yourself at home; and (8) services are available despite the pandemic. We found that the manifest messages alluded to three latent messages: (1) it is your responsibility to change your circumstances; (2) you are in danger and in need of protection; and (3) you are not alone. IPV and media professionals should ensure a structural understanding of IPV in their help-seeking messages and avoid perpetrating stigmatizing and reductionist messages.","Alvarez-Hernandez, Luis R; Cardenas, Iris; Bloom, Allison",J Fam Violence,,377

238775,Evaluation of E-Learning in Higher Education during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study in University of Sulaimani,2021,"Introduction:Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in critically ill patients and has been extremely common during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in patients admitted to the adult intensive care unit with severe viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We investigated the incidence and outcomes of AKI in this population comparing the COVID-19 pandemic to the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all patients with severe COVID-19 infection, admitted to ICU level of care between 3/1/2020 and 6/1/2020 and we obtained patient data via the research patient data registry. We excluded patients who were admitted with a complaint unrelated to their COVID-19 infection and patients with end-stage renal disease. We stratified patients based on presence of AKI and further stratified the AKI group for the need for Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT). All data collection was approved by the IRB at Mass General Brigham (IRB #2020P001674). All data was analyzed using Excel and R version 4.0.1 (2020-06-06). When comparing groups, medians and interquartile ranges are reported. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was used for statistical analysis. Results: 272 patients were identified of which 31 patients were excluded from further study due to reasons as above. The remaining 241 patients were analyzed, and the median age was 64 (52-72) with, 40.6% females. 79.6% (192) of patients were Intubated with a median lowest PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 124 (91.4-177.5).105/241 (43.5%) did not develop AKI and 136/241 (56.4%) developed AKI, of which 36 had AKI requiring RRT. Patients with AKI had a higher length of hospitalization (20 ± 10.75 vs 15 ± 8.5, p 0.055), Increased pressor days (11 ± 9 vs 4 ± 6.5, P&lt;0.001), Increased mortality (47% vs 17.1%, p&lt;0.001). AKI and AKI-RRT were associated with prolonged hospitalization, higher ICU readmission rates, and worse respiratory and hemodynamic parameters. Discussion: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the most frequently occurring extrapulmonary organ failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Based on established literature by Ignacio et al. (1) from the H1N1 pandemic, 17.8% of patient's developed AKI, patients with AKI had increased days of hospitalization (30.3 ± 19.9 vs 20.5 ± 16.8 days, p&lt;0.0001), increased mortality (44.1% vs 13.3 %, p&lt;0.01) and increased incidence of shock (75.4% vs 38.3%, p&lt;0.01) which was consistent with our analysis. However, incidence of AKI was higher in patients with COVID 19 infection compared to H1N1 infection.","Ahmad, I.; Lakshman, S.; Rahaghi, F. N.; Czarnecki, P.

239006,Impact of technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic for improving behavioral intention to use e-learning,2021,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both. Binding of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 also suggests that prolonged uncontrolled hyperglycemia, and not just a history of diabetes mellitus, may be important in the pathogenesis of the disease. It is tempting to consider that the same mechanism acts in COVID-19 as in SARS, where an overactive macrophage M1 inflammatory response, as neutralizing antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein form at day 7 to 10, results in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in susceptible patients. It also allows consideration of agents, such as hydroxychloroquine, which may interfere with this overly brisk macrophage inflammatory response and perhaps influence the course of the disease, in particular, those that blunt but do not completely abrogate the M1 to M2 balance in macrophage polarization, as well as viral load, which in SARS appears to be temporally related to the onset of ARDS.","Brufsky, Adam",J Med Virol,,377

248136,Pupils' Perceptions and Suggestions for the Improvement of Distance Education in Greece,2020,"Rural areas are significantly affected by spatial vulnerability, the digital gap, depopulation, and population ageing. Marginalized populations are seeking collective well-being, social inclusion, and local development in smart villages, an increasingly important area of interest for scholars and practitioners as well as rural areas and communities. This article attempts to highlight the dominant trends in smart villages planning and depict the characteristics of Greek rural areas and populations alongside the implemented localized smart actions. To achieve this aim, the research utilized the existing literature through bibliometric analysis by extracting data from the Web of Science database. Building upon the bibliometrics, the research focused on identifying localized implemented interventions in the Greek rural areas. The results suggest that innovation, knowledge, growth, and management appear to impact rural smart planning, while the limited interventions of smart villages in Greece focus on social innovation and local development. The study argues that in Greece, a single holistic smart villages model cannot be proposed, due to the country’s geographical and demographical variability. The proposed trends, though, can be implemented locally to encourage rural development and population inclusion;therefore it is recommended to increase local stakeholders’ awareness and active engagement.","Anastasiou, Evgenia Stella Manika Ragazou Konstantina Katsios Ioannis",Social Sciences,,377

The proposed system includes five sub-systems: an information management system, a knowledge-based expert system, adaptive learning, a notification and follow-up system, and a mobile tracker system. This study shows that, to control epidemics, there is a method to overcome the shortage of specialists in the management of infections in Saudi Arabia, both today and in the future. The availability of computerized clinical guidance and an up-to-date knowledge base play a role in Saudi health organizations, which may not have to constantly train their physician staff and may no longer have to rely on international experts, since the expert system can offer clinicians all the information necessary to treat their patients.","Banjar, Haneen Reda; Alkhatabi, Heba; Alganmi, Nofe; Almouhana, Ghaidaa Ibraheem",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,377

The purpose of the present study was to identify behaviors during confinement and sociodemographic variables associated with the mental health status of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients who were part of the epidemiological surveillance program in Ecuador that included mandatory confinement and self-isolation. A cross-sectional study was performed from March 22th to April 18th, 2020 using an online survey. The survey collected socio-demographic information and severity of depressive symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and anxiety symptoms through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. A total of 759 patients completed the questionnaire, 20.3% presented moderate to severe symptoms of depression and 22.5% moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety. Being a woman and from the Coastal region were risk factors. Exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to an hour was associated with better mental health. Regression analysis indicated that the mentioned behaviors explained approximately 17% of the variance for depression sum scores and 11.8% of the variance for anxiety sum scores while controlling for gender and region. Understanding the association between sociodemographic variables and psychological states in patients with COVID-19 is relevant to tackle future public mental health problems and to implement health policies that are intended to palliate further psychiatric complications. Promotion of modifiable behaviors such as exercising, maintaining daily routines, and keeping informed about the COVID-19 but limiting to less than an hour is recommended.","Paz, Clara; Mascialino, Guido; Adana-Díaz, Lila; Rodríguez-Lorenzana, Alberto; Simbaña-Rivera, Katherine; Gómez-Barreno, Lenin; Troya, Maritza; Paez, María Ignacia; Cárdenas, Javier; Gerstner, Rebekka M; Ortiz-Prado, Esteban",PLoS One,,377
251898,Emergency education effects on teacher abilities and motivation to use digital technologies,2021,"Floods are among the most frequently occurring natural hazards in Malawi, often with public health implications. This mixed methods study assessed the capacity for and implementation status of the disaster risk management (DRM) strategy for the health sector in Malawi, using flooding in the Nsanje District as a case. Data were collected using desk review and a workshop methodology involving key officials from government ministries, national and international development partners, and the academia. The results show that Malawi had recently strengthened its DRM institutional frameworks, with a pronounced policy shift from reactive to proactive management of disasters. Health sector personnel and structures were key contributors in the design and implementation of DRM activities at all levels. Development partners played a significant role in strengthening DRM coordination and implementation capacity. Lack of funding and the limited availability, and often fragmented nature, of vulnerability and risk assessment data were identified as key challenges. Limited human resource capacity and inadequate planning processes at district level impeded full implementation of DRM policies. These findings call for community-level interventions for improved coordination, planning, and human resource capacity to strengthen community disaster resilience and improve public health. The approach used in this study can serve as a model framework for other districts in Malawi, as well as in other low- and middle-income countries in the context of Sendai Framework implementation.","Dewa, Ozius Makoka Donald Ayo-Yusuf Olalekan A.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Science,,377

253445,Remote proctored exams: Integrity assurance in online education?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Developing dementia is feared by many for its detrimental effects on cognition and independence. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that sepsis is a risk factor for the later development of dementia. We aimed to investigate whether intensive care-treated sepsis is an independent risk factor for a later diagnosis of dementia in a large cohort of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We identified adult patients admitted to an ICU in 2005 to 2015 and who survived without a dementia diagnosis 1 year after intensive care admission using the Swedish Intensive Care Registry, collecting data from all Swedish general ICUs. Comorbidity, the diagnosis of dementia and mortality, was retrieved from the Swedish National Patient Registry, the Swedish Dementia Registry, and the Cause of Death Registry. Sepsis during intensive care served as a covariate in an extended Cox model together with age, sex, and variables describing comorbidities and acute disease severity. RESULTS: One year after ICU admission 210,334 patients were alive and without a diagnosis of dementia; of these, 16,115 (7.7%) had a diagnosis of sepsis during intensive care. The median age of the cohort was 61 years (interquartile range, IQR 43-72). The patients were followed for up to 11 years (median 3.9 years, IQR 1.7-6.6). During the follow-up, 6312 (3%) patients were diagnosed with dementia. Dementia was more common in individuals diagnosed with sepsis during their ICU stay (log-rank p < 0.001), however diagnosis of sepsis during critical care was not an independent risk factor for a later dementia diagnosis in an extended Cox model: hazard ratio (HR) 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.91-1.11, p = 0.873). Renal replacement therapy and ventilator therapy during the ICU stay were protective. High age was a strong risk factor for later dementia, as was increasing severity of acute illness, although to a lesser extent. However, the severity of comorbidities and the length of ICU and hospital stay were not independent risk factors in the model. CONCLUSION: Although dementia is more common among patients treated with sepsis in the ICU, sepsis was not an independent risk factor for later dementia in the Swedish national critical care cohort.

The pKaMeCN([MHLn]+/[MLn) of paramagnetic hydrides in MeCN are estimated for the first time using the ligand acidity constant (LAC) equation where contributions to the pKaMeCN from each ligand are simply added together, with the sum corrected for effects of charge and 5d metals. The pKaLAC-MeCN([MHLn]+/MLn) of over 200 hydride complexes MHLn are used, along with their electrochemical potentials from the literature, in an uncommonly applied thermochemical cycle in order to reveal systematic trends in the redox couples MIII/II and MV/IV (M = Cr, Mo, W), MnII/I, ReVI/V and ReIV/III, MIII/II and MIV/III (M = Fe, Ru, Os), and MIII/II and MII/I (M = Co, Rh, and Ir) and allow the estimation of the bond dissociation free energies BDFE(MH) of the unoxidized hydrides MHLn and the prediction of the electrochemical potential for their oxidation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to validate the pKaLAC-MeCN values of hydrides of WIII, MnII, FeIII, RuIII, CoII, and NiIII. When a pKaLAC-MeCN is less than zero for a given complex [MHLn]+, the oxidation of MHLn is irreversible due to proton loss from the oxidized complex to the solvent. When pKaLAC-MeCN â« 0, the oxidation is reversible when there is no gross change in the coordination geometry upon a change in the redox state.

METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform published from the year 2000 onwards) investigating whether levosimendan offers advantages compared to standard therapy or placebo, in cardiogenic shock adult patients treated with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The primary outcome was veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning, whereas secondary outcome was all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available. We pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence interval using fixed and random effects models according to the heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of five non-randomized clinical trials comprising 557 patients were included, 299 patients for levosimendan and 258 patients for control groups. The pooled prevalence of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning was 61.4% (95% confidence interval 39.8-82.9%), and all-cause mortality was 36% (95% confidence interval 29.6-48.8%). There was a significant increase in veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning with levosimendan compared to the controls (risk ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.8), p for effect = 0.004, I2 = 71%). A decrease risk of all-cause mortality in the levosimendan group was also observed, risk ratio = 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88), p for effect = 0.007, I2 = 36%. CONCLUSION: The use of levosimendan on adult patients with cardiogenic shock may facilitate the veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning and reduce all-cause mortality. Few articles of this topic are available, and prospective, randomized multi-center trials are warranted to conclude decisively on the benefits of levosimendan in this setting.","Burgos, Lucrecia María; Seoane, Leonardo; Furmento, Juan Francisco; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Diez, Mirta; Vrancic, Mariano; Aissaoui, Nadia; Benzadón, Mariano Noel; Navia, Daniel",Perfusion,,377

METHODS: Indexed databases were searched without time and language restrictions using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The inclusion criteria were: (a) original studies; (b) patients/subjects undergoing MSI-assisted intrusion; and (c) tomographic and/or histological assessment of OIIRR. Letters to the Editor, commentaries, case reports/series, reviews, and studies based on two-dimensional radiographic assessment of OIIRR were excluded. For experimental and clinical studies, the risk of bias assessment was performed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation risk of bias tool and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions guidelines, respectively. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 453 studies, out of which 6 (3 clinical and 3 on animal-models) were included. The clinical studies were performed on males and females with a mean age ranging between 16.07 and 25.5 years. Duration of the clinical studies ranged from 3.8 to 9 months. The animal studies were performed on mini-pigs, rats, and dogs. The mean age in the studies on rats and mini-pigs was 2.76 and 18 months, respectively. In the study on canine models, mean age was not reported. In all studies, MSI-assisted intrusion was shown to cause OIIRR. Power analysis was performed in one study. All studies had a moderate risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: MSI-assisted intrusion is a risk factor for OIIRR; however, from a clinical perspective, further well-designed and power-adjusted studies are needed.","St Martin, J G; Javed, F; Rossouw, P E; Michelogiannakis, D",Eur.

Wireless technologies can play a key role in assisting contact tracing to quickly halt a local infection outbreak and prevent further spread. In this work, we present a wearable proximity and exposure notification solution based on a smartwatch that also promotes safe physical distancing in business, hospitality, or recreational facilities. Our proximity-based privacy-preserving contact tracing (P$^3$CT) leverages the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for reliable proximity sensing, and an ambient signature protocol for preserving identity. Proximity sensing exploits the received signal strength (RSS) to detect the user's interaction and thus classifying them into low- or high-risk with respect to a patient diagnosed with an infectious disease. More precisely, a user is notified of their exposure based on their interactions, in terms of distance and time, with a patient. Our privacy-preserving protocol uses the ambient signatures to ensure that users' identities be anonymized. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed solution through extensive experimentation.","Ng, Pai Chet; Spachos, Petros; Gregori, Stefano; Plataniotis, Konstantinos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04399v1.pdf,377

256756,The Role of Supervisors in the Hygiene Practice Compliance of the Food Sector Workers,2021,"In 2018, the Australian Government instructed the Productivity Commission to examine the social and economic effects of poor mental health, as well as make recommendations on how they might be addressed. The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reform should be based on evidence and achieved without increasing administrative complexity.","Kisely, Steve; Looi, Jeffrey Cl",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,,377

However, it is also important for clinicians and epidemiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza viruses. RESEARCH QUESTION: The aim of this study was to explore the different clinical presentations between COVID-19 and influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia in patients with ARDS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This analysis was a retrospective case-control study. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 (n = 73) or H1N1 (n = 75) were compared. Their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, treatments, and prognosis were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: The median age of patients with COVID-19 was higher than that of patients with H1N1, and there was a higher proportion of male subjects among the H1N1 cohort (P < .05). Patients with COVID-19 exhibited higher proportions of nonproductive coughs, fatigue, and GI symptoms than those of patients with H1N1 (P < .05). Patients with H1N1 had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores than patients with COVID-19 (P < .05). The Pao2/Fio2 of 198.5 mm Hg in the COVID-19 cohort was significantly higher than the Pao2/Fio2 of 107.0 mm Hg in the H1N1 cohort (P < .001). Ground-glass opacities was more common in patients with COVID-19 than in patients with H1N1 (P < .001). There was a greater variety of antiviral therapies administered to COVID-19 patients than to H1N1 patients. The in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19 was 28.8%, whereas that of patients with H1N1 was 34.7% (P = .483). SOFA score-adjusted mortality of H1N1 patients was significantly higher than that of COVID-19 patients, with a rate ratio of 2.009 (95% CI, 1.563-2.583; P < .001). INTERPRETATION: There were many differences in clinical presentations between patients with ARDS infected with either COVID-19 or H1N1. Compared with H1N1 patients, patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS had lower severity of illness scores at presentation and lower SOFA score-adjusted mortality.","Tang, Xiao; Du, Rong-Hui; Wang, Rui; Cao, Tan-Ze; Guan, Lu-Lu; Yang, Cheng-Qing; Zhu, Qi; Hu, Ming; Li, Xu-Yan; Li, Ying; Liang, Li-Rong; Tong, Zhao-Hui; Sun, Bing; Peng, Peng; Shi, Huan-Zhong",Chest,,377

The goal of this tutorial is to disseminate skills in structure-based drug design and to allow others to unleash their own creativity to design new drugs to fight the current pandemic. The tutorial begins with the X-ray crystallographic structure of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) bound to a peptide substrate and then uses the UCSF Chimera software to modify the substrate to create a cyclic peptide inhibitor within the Mpro active site. Finally, the tutorial uses the molecular docking software AutoDock Vina to show the interaction of the cyclic peptide inhibitor with both SARS-CoV Mpro and the highly homologous SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The supporting information provides an illustrated step-by-step protocol, as well as a video showing the inhibitor design process, to help readers design their own drug candidates for COVID-19 and the coronaviruses that will cause future pandemics.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was conducted in the form of a standardised telephone interview survey in certified German CPUs. Analyses comprised the overall setting of the CPU, bed capacities, possibilities for ventilation, possible changes in organisation and resources, chest pain patient admittance, overall availability of CPUs and bail-out strategies. The response rate was 91%. Nationwide, CPU bed capacities decreased by 3% in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic response, exhibiting differences within and between the federal states. Pre-pandemic and pandemic bed capacities stayed below 1 CPU bed per 50,000 inhabitants. 97% of CPUs were affected by internal reorganisation pandemic plans at variable extent. While we observed a decrease of CPU beds within an emergency room (ER) set-up and on intermediate care units (ICU), beds in units being separated from ER and ICU were even increased in numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Certified German CPUs are able to maintain adequate coverage for chest pain patients in COVID-19 pandemic despite structural changes. However, at this time, it appears important to add operating procedures during pandemic outbreaks to the certification criteria of forthcoming guidelines either at the individual CPU level or more centrally steered by the German Cardiac Society or the European Society of Cardiology.","Settelmeier, Stephan; Rassaf, Tienush; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Münzel, Thomas; Breuckmann, Frank",Clin Res Cardiol,,377

Yet even as the world has shifted, the “worlds” of our conceptual habitations have not, and this is particularly the case with regards to religious beliefs. It is from within this context that the present study seeks clarity. Beginning at the beginning, the paper sets out from a re-examination of the foundational creation myth of Western societies, and argues that a more careful reading of the actual presentation of that account, along with some situational explanations, results in an understanding of divinity that stresses neither omnipotence nor omniscience. The article then transitions to the importance of the notional in grounding and generating social behaviors, employing phenomenological and psychological research and analytical methods. Intuitions are seen to be central in the personally based methodology undertaken, and the conceptual–perceptional brace of the notion/event is offered as a theoretical construct. Finally, an attempt at application is made through a return to the earlier explication of a reduced idea of divinity, and subtle gestures at possibly resulting ethical calls are given. Although the virus has taken charge of our lives, and although even God/“God” might not be in absolute control, the “world” is yet ours to (re)make. © 2021 Andrew Oberg, published by De Gruyte","Oberg, A.",Open Theology,,377

Technically speaking, how has the crisis triggered, prompted, or simply facilitated the selection and employment of particular conceptual metaphors or their linguistic and non-linguistic manifestations? This article, based on a large-scale corpus of political cartoons, aims to answer that question ? how the pandemic itself becomes a metaphor I show that various different metaphor targets (including WAR, ISRAEL, TURKEY, DONALD TRUMP, BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ARAB DICTATORS, THE KUWAITI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY, THE JORDANIAN CABINET, THE IRANIAN REGIME, MILITANT GROUPS, POVERTY, RACISM, CALENDAR, CORRUPTION, INJUSTICE, RUMORS, POLITICAL ASSASSINATIONS, THE GLOBE, THE UNION JACK, THE EUROPEAN UNION, THE US FAR RIGHT, THE 50 STARS OF THE AMERCAN FLAG, US-RUSSIAN RELATIONS, HOUSEWIVES, PERSONAL BELONGINGS, LOVE, QURBAN BAYRAM, CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, ARABIC DRAMA, SCHOOL BAG, AWARENESS, and SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES such as Facebook, among many others) are all explained with reference to coronavirus-related terms or the source domain of CORONAVIRUS/VACCINATION The sheer frequency of occurrences of CORONAVIRUS metaphors (a total of 175 out of 497 relevant multimodal cartoons, that is, more than 35%) demonstrates and makes a case for the necessity to examine the effect of context, in particular topical news and physical circumstances, in the cognitive linguistic study of creative metaphor In short, the results provide initial evidence that new viruses and diseases such as Covid-19 have a negative and significant effect on cognition (or shape societies? worldviews)","Abdel-Raheem, Ahmed",Discourse &amp; Society,,377

Our goal is to understand how patients are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, including where they receive relevant information, how it has affected medical care, and what measures they use to protect themselves. METHODS: This is a prospective online survey study at large academic practice. All patients with a neuromuscular junction disorder diagnosis code in the Duke Health System were invited to participate. RESULTS: 1,848 patients were approached to participate and 75 completed the survey between April 16, 2020 and May 28, 2020. The most frequently used information sources were non-presidential federal government (75%), state government (57%), local healthcare provider (37%), and television news (36%). Non-presidential federal government (80%), local healthcare providers (55%), state government (33%) and patient support organizations (29%) were considered the most trusted information sources. Thirty-three (44%) of survey responders had attended a telemedicine visit. Patients were taking recommended precautions during the pandemic and remained very concerned (69%) about COVID-19. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scores were moderate-severe in 20% of responders. DISCUSSION: Health care providers, the government, and patient organizations play a critical role in communicating with the MG patient community. Use of targeted messaging strategies by these groups to convey accurate information may increase effectiveness and lead to more informed patients with reduced anxiety.","Li, Yingkai; Emmett, C Douglas; Cobbaert, Marjan; Sanders, Donald B; Juel, Vern C; Hobson-Webb, Lisa D; Massey, Janice M; Gable, Karissa L; Raja, Shruti M; Gonzalez, Natalia L; Guptill, Jeffrey T",Muscle nerve,,377

283153,Tourism: how to achieve the sustainable development goals?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), to be a pandemic. From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on Google® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.","De Sio, S; Buomprisco, G; La Torre, G; Lapteva, E; Perri, R; Greco, E; Mucci, N; Cedrone, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,377

On the basis of the existing theoretical statements, discovery of essential characteristics, peculiarities and systematisation of the obtained results of the research, conceptual approaches to interpretation of the features of state financial support for small business during the coronavirus crisis have been suggested. Small business is an important component of the economic system of any country. It ensures formation of the complex structure of the market for goods and services, development of efficient competition and promotes addressing the needs of consumers in conditions of formation of their sovereignty. State financial support for small business in European countries is at different stages of development. In the EU countries, financial policy of small business regulation is an example of state intervention in the mechanism of market self-regulation in order to solve social and economic problems by changing the economic behaviorur of small enterprises. The formational process, strategic priorities of state financial support for small business in European countries and macroeconomic instruments for its implementation during the coronavirus crisis have been studied. Changes in the concern of the world community in forms of state financial support for small business have been detected. A comparative and analytical examination of the instruments for macroeconomic financial regulation, which are being used during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, has been conducted. The research shows the importance of small business in terms of solving economic and social problems of social development, outlines the situation of state financial support in the EU countries in comparison with Ukrainian small enterprises, determines the general features and differences in state regulation of entrepreneurship. The practical significance of the obtained results consists in the fact that the main scientific statements of the article can be used in practice of state and regional management of small business.","Humeniuk, V.; Umantsiv, I.; Dligach, A.; Ivanova, N.; Umantsiv, H.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,,377

Although imperfect and time-consuming to develop, we do have some conventional vaccine and therapeutic approaches to stop viral spreading. Most importantly, all of this takes significant time while viruses continue to wreak havoc on our healthcare system. Furthermore, viral infections are accompanied by a weakened immune system which is often overlooked in antiviral drug strategies and requires additional drug development. In this review, for the first time, we touch on some promising alternative approaches to treat viral infections, specifically those focused on the use of platform nanomaterials with antiviral peptides. In doing so, this review presents a timely discussion of how we need to change our old way of treating viruses into one that can quickly meet the demands of COVID-19, as well as future pandemic-causing viruses, which will come.","F Nahhas, Alaa; F Nahhas, Alrayan; J Webster, Thomas",Nanomedicine (Lond),,377

AIM: To describe characteristics and outcomes of approximately the first 200 documented COVID-19 cases during the first outbreak in the Gold Coast. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of COVID-19 patients managed by Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service (GCHHS). Demographics, clinical characteristics and outcomes data were collected. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-seven patients were included (mean age 45 years); 52.3% were female and 9.1% were healthcare workers. Most were overseas travellers (53.8%), contacts of a local confirmed case (25.4%) or cruise ship passengers (17.3%). The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (14.2%) and asthma (11.2%). The commonest symptoms were cough (74.1%), fever (58.9%), sore throat (48.7%), headache (48.7%) and rhinorrhoea (46.2%). Sixty-three patients were hospitalised and the rest admitted to a 'virtual ward'. Of 63 hospitalised patients, 5 (7.9%) required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and 3 (4.8%) required intubation. No patients died. Due to low numbers of accurate exposure dates, the incubation period could not be reliably calculated for a significant proportion of the cohort. Average duration of symptoms was 14 days, time from first symptom to hospitalisation was 5.3 days and time from first symptom to ICU admission was 11.6 days. The majority (88%) experienced mild disease and achieved complete symptom resolution (97%). Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction was the main diagnostic method (99%). Twenty-four patients received anti-viral pharmacotherapy, with 87.5% getting hydroxychloroquine. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides characteristics and outcomes of the first 197 patients with COVID-19 in the Gold Coast.","Je, David; O039,; Brolchain, Aongus; Ulett, Kimberly B; Zainudheen, Amith; Gerrard, John; Alcorn, Kylie; Memon, Salim",Intern Med J,,377

300022,Epigrammatic study on the effect of lockdown amid Covid-19 pandemic on air quality of most polluted cities of Rajasthan (India),2020,"Introduction: Individuals with COVID-19 may have complex coagulation abnormalities in consistence with hypercoagulability. This manifests as high plasma level of certain coagulation factors, particularly fibrinogen. DIC, on the other hand, is characterized by consumption of these factors. We present a case of COVID-19 respiratory failure at which a DIC phase was followed by thromboinflammation and organ failure. Case Presentation: A 51-year-old male presented with 3-day duration of fever and dyspnea. He had laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 infection a day prior to his presentation. He displayed significant hypoxia and respiratory distress which led to mechanical ventilation at 48 hours post presentation. His laboratory evaluation showed a platelet count of 45 x 1000/ mm3, International Normalized Ratio (INR) of 3.2, activated Partial Thromboplastin Time of 39 seconds, Fibrinogen of 30 mg/dl, D-Dimer of &lt;4 mcg/ml and Fibrin Split Products of 320 unigram/ml. Peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes and ultrasound of the lower extremities showed bilateral deep venous thrombosis. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were considered. Serum Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with a ThromboSpondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13) level was ordered, plasmapheresis trial initiated and IV argatroban drip started. Platelet count normalized with 48 hours. ADAMTS-13 level was inconsistent with TTP. On the sixth day of admission, serum fibrinogen level increased to 457 mg/dl which coexisted with worsening ventilatory requirements. A similar pattern of increasing serum D-Dimer level, ferritin and creatinine was observed together with the development of shock and multiorgan failure syndrome. Patient eventually succumbed to his critical illness on the 28th day of admission. Discussion: Endothelial injury [1] and hypercoagulable status [2] cause COVID Coagulopathy. DIC is predominately a consumptive disorder associated with bleeding, COVID- associated coagulopathy is associated with increasing thrombosis. In s series that reported on thromboembolic events, none of the patients developed overt DIC[3]. While thromboembolic events in COVID-19 are associated with increased mortality, the clinical significance of this compensated form of DIC is unknown. Conclusion:Critically ill patients with COVID-19 may display “compensated” DIC. Whether this is a separate entity or lies within a large spectrum of different coagulation abnormalities is unknown. The clinical significance of it is unknown wither. Randomized clinical trials are needed for further understanding.","Hayrabedian, M.; Sreedhar, R.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,377

306608,"All It Takes Is One Click to Join Me on a ""Meet"": The Positive Impact of Technology on Peer Observations in the Virtual Learning Environment",2021,"OBJECTIVE: Current evidence suggests a decrease in elective diagnostic imaging procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic with potentially severe long-term consequences. The aim of this study was to quantify recent trends in public interest and related online search behavior for a range of imaging modalities, and ""nowcast"" future scenarios with respect to imaging use. METHODS: We used Google Trends, a publicly available database to access search query data in systematic and quantitative fashion, to search for key terms related to clinical imaging. We queried the search volume for multiple imaging modalities, identified the most common terms, extracted data for the United States over the time range from August 1, 2016 to August 1, 2020. Results were given in relative terms, using the Google metric 'search volume index'. RESULTS: We report a decrease in public interest across all imaging modalities since March 2020 with a subsequent slow increase starting in May 2020. Mean relative search volume (RSV) has changed by -19.4%, -38.3%, and -51.0% for the search terms ""Computed tomography"", ""Magnetic resonance imaging"", and ""Mammography"", respectively, and comparing the two months prior to and following March 1, 2020. RSV has since steadily recuperated reaching all-year highs. CONCLUSION: Decrease in public interest coupled with delays and deferrals of diagnostic imaging will likely result in a high demand for healthcare in the coming months. To respond to this challenge, measures such as risk-stratification algorithms must be developed to allocate resources and avoid the risk of overstraining the healthcare system.","Adelhoefer, Siegfried; Henry, Travis S; Blankstein, Ron; Graham, Garth; Blaha, Michael J; Dzaye, Omar",Clin Imaging,,377
307445,Effectiveness of using online platforms as a substitute for face-to-face learning in learning chemistry on colloid topic,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected mental health, creating an urgent need for convenient and safe interventions to improve well-being. Online mindfulness interventions show promise for improving depression, anxiety, and general well-being. Objective: To assess: 1) the impact of online mindfulness on psychological distress, 2) altruistic efforts, and 3) the quantity, quality, and availability of online mindfulness resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: 233 participants (203 U.S.;20 international;10 unknown) participated in this prospective, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial of a single online mindfulness meditation session with pre- and post-surveys. Main Outcome Measures: (a) Mindfulness session helpfulness, online platform effectiveness, and immediate pre- to post-session changes in momentary stress, anxiety, and COVID-19 concern;(b) qualitative themes representing how people are helping others during the pandemic;(c) absolute changes in quantity of mindfulness-oriented web content and free online mindfulness resource availability from May to August 2020. Results: Most participants felt the online mindfulness session was helpful and the electronic platform effective for practicing mindfulness (89%, 95% CI: [82 to 93%]), with decreased momentary anxiety (76%;95% CI: [69 to 83%]), stress (80%;[72 to 86%]), and COVID-19 concern (55%;[46 to 63%]), (p &lt; 0.001 for each measure). Participants reported helping others in a variety of ways during the pandemic, including following public health guidelines, conducting acts of service and connection, and helping oneself in hopes of helping others. “Mindfulness + COVID” search results increased by 52% from May to August 2020. Most (73%) Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health member websites offer free online mindfulness resources. Conclusions: Virtual mindfulness is an increasingly accessible intervention available world-wide that may reduce psychological distress during this isolating public health crisis. Kindness and altruism are being demonstrated during the pandemic. The consolidated online mindfulness resources provided may help guide clinicians and patients.","Farris, S.

METHODS: This was a descriptive and cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire was conducted, including demographics, the self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the quality of life (WHOQOL) evaluation. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression was 15.4% in our sample, with 505 participants. SDS overall mean in participants was 39.50±9.02, which indicates no psychopathology. There was a significant difference between the quality of life scores according to depressive levels (P=0.001) except general health (P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, mild and moderate depression has been identified. Quality of life is becoming the most critical issue to improve physical, social, and mental components. Besides, to prevent the spread of the virus, mental health, and quality of life improvement interventions should become priority public health strategies.","Okudan, B.; Uslu, B.; Çelebi, S.

307651,Impact of technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic for improving behavioral intention to use e-learning,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed significant changes to resident education and workflow. However, the impact of the pandemic on U.S. neurosurgery residents has not been well characterized. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. neurosurgery resident workflow, burnout, and career satisfaction. In 2020, a survey evaluating factors related to career satisfaction and burnout was emailed to 1,374 American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) residents. Bivariate and multivariate (logistic) analyses were performed to characterize predictors of burnout and career satisfaction. 167 survey responses were received, with a response rate (12.2%) comparable to that of similar studies. Exclusion of incomplete responses yielded 111complete responses. Most respondents were male (65.8%) and White (75.7%). Residents reported fewer work hours (67.6%) and concern that COVID-19 would impair theirachievement of surgical milestones (65.8%). Burnout was identified in 29 (26.1%) respondents and career satisfaction in 82 (73.9%) respondents. In multivariate analysis, burnout was significantly associated with alterations in elective rotation/vacation schedules (p = .013) and the decision to not pursue neurosurgery again if given the choice (p < .001). Higher post-graduate year was associated with less burnout (p = .011). Residents displayed greater career satisfaction when focusing their clinical work upon neurosurgical care (p = .065). Factors related to COVID-19 have contributed to workflow changes among U.S. neurosurgery residents. We report a moderate burnout rate and a paradoxically high career satisfaction rate among neurosurgery residents. Understanding modifiable stressors during the COVID-19pandemic may help to formulate interventions to mitigate burnout and improve career satisfaction among residents.","Khalafallah, Adham M; Lam, Shravika; Gami, Abhishek; Dornbos, David L; Sivakumar, Walavan; Johnson, Jeremiah N; Mukherjee, Debraj",J Clin Neurosci,,377
307905,Legal basis for the use of educational technologies in the knowledge information space formation,2020,"Reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have already been documented in humans, although its real incidence is currently unknown. Besides having a great impact on public health, this phenomenon raises the question of immunity generated by a single infection is sufficient to provide sterilizing/protective immunity to a subsequent SARS-CoV-2 re-exposure. The Golden Syrian hamster is a manageable animal model to explore immunological mechanisms able to counteract COVID-19, as it recapitulates pathological aspects of mild to moderately affected patients. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2-inoculated hamsters resolve infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts within seven days upon inoculation with the Cat01 (G614) SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Three weeks after the primary challenge, and despite high titres of neutralizing antibodies, half of the animals were susceptible to reinfection by both identical (Cat01, G614) and variant (WA/1, D614) SARS-CoV-2 isolates. However, upon re-inoculation, only nasal tissues were transiently infected with much lower viral replication than those observed after the first inoculation. These data indicate that a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection is not sufficient to elicit a sterilizing immunity in hamster models but protects against lung disease.","Brustolin, Marco; Rodon, Jordi; Rodríguez de la Concepción, María Luisa; Ávila-Nieto, Carlos; Cantero, Guillermo; Pérez, Mónica; Te, Nigeer; Noguera-Julián, Marc; Guallar, Víctor; Valencia, Alfonso; Roca, Núria; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Blanco, Julià; Clotet, Bonaventura; Bensaid, Albert; Carrillo, Jorge; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Segalés, Joaquim",Emerg Microbes Infect,,377

316365,Ethical and responsible tourism: managing sustainability in local tourism destinations,2020,"AimsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, admissions to the Mildred Creek Unit (MCU), an Inpatient CAMHS Ward at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) changed.The MCU is a 7–10 bed unit for children aged 7–15 years based on therapeutic milieu principles. The ward accepts patients via a planned national referral pathway, however, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were admitted as emergencies and consequently risk assessments were missed. Risk assessment is important in all admissions and as the MCU is not a locked unit, early risk assessment is particularly important.We aimed to review whether risk assessment occurred within one working day of admission, as suggested by the ward risk assessment policy, and if this was not the case, our aim was to ensure that all risk assessments took place within this period via our audit interventions.MethodWe collated data looking at the time between admission to GOSH and the date at which first risk assessments took place. We then put in place three interventions.1) Posters prompting doctors who were providing on-call liaison input to perform a risk assessment within one working day of admission.2) New junior doctors were provided with written and verbal information to emphasise the importance of early risk assessment.3) Guidelines also highlight that assessment of risk may need to be on-going. We therefore added a prompt section in the weekly ward round proforma with the aim of reducing the interval between risk assessments during admission.The first audit cycle was conducted on the 3/8/2020 and the second on the 28/11/21 to allow for a comparative number of inpatients between the first and second audit cycle.ResultWe found these interventions significantly reduced delays in risk assessments. Prior to the audit's first cycle the average delay between admission to GOSH/MCU and a risk assessment was 2 weeks. After the interventions there were no patients whose risk assessment was delayed outside the next working day parameters.ConclusionThis full cycle audit demonstrates the impact that prompts to clinical practice can make on patient care. It is important to recognise the need for flexible risk assessment with regular review, especially at times of clinical change. We hope that this continued trend for early risk assessment leads to improved clinical care and timely discussion of risk for all new CAMHS inpatients at GOSH.","Stock, Lisanne Evans Sacha",BJPsych Open,,377
316921,Social issues dominate African ESG,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Effective treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are urgently needed. We hypothesized that colchicine, by counteracting proinflammatory pathways implicated in the uncontrolled inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients, reduces pulmonary complications, and improves survival. METHODS: This retrospective study included 71 consecutive COVID-19 patients (hospitalized with pneumonia on CT scan or outpatients) who received colchicine and compared with 70 control patients who did not receive colchicine in two serial time periods at the same institution. We used inverse probability of treatment propensity-score weighting to examine differences in mortality, clinical improvement (using a 7-point ordinary scale), and inflammatory markers between the two groups. RESULTS: Amongst the 141 COVID-19 patients (118 [83.7%] hospitalized), 70 (50%) received colchicine. The 21-day crude cumulative mortality was 7.5% in the colchicine group and 28.5% in the control group (P = 0.006; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.24 [95%CI: 0.09 to 0.67]); 21-day clinical improvement occurred in 40.0% of the patients on colchicine and in 26.6% of control patients (adjusted relative improvement rate: 1.80 [95%CI: 1.00 to 3.22]). The strong association between the use of colchicine and reduced mortality was further supported by the diverging linear trends of percent daily change in lymphocyte count (P = 0.018), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P = 0.003), and in C-reactive protein levels (P = 0.009). Colchicine was stopped because of transient side effects (diarrhea or skin rashes) in 7% of patients. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective cohort study colchicine was associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery in COVID-19 patients. This support the rationale for current larger randomized controlled trials testing the safety/efficacy profile of colchicine in COVID-19 patients.","Manenti, Lucio; Maggiore, Umberto; Fiaccadori, Enrico; Meschi, Tiziana; Antoni, Anna Degli; Nouvenne, Antonio; Ticinesi, Andrea; Cerundolo, Nicoletta; Prati, Beatrice; Delsante, Marco; Gandoflini, Ilaria; Donghi, Lorenzo; Gentile, Micaela; Farina, Maria Teresa; Oliva, Vincenzo; Zambrano, Cristina; Regolisti, Giuseppe; Palmisano, Alessandra; Caminiti, Caterina; Cocchi, Enrico; Ferrari, Carlo; Riella, Leonardo V; Cravedi, Paolo; Peruzzi, Licia",PLoS One,,377

The majority of reports thus far have focused on the epidemiology, clinical factors, and acute care of these patients, with less attention given to the recovery phase and care of those patients requiring extended time on mechanical ventilation. In this paper, we review the procedures and methods to safely care for patients with COVID-19 who require tracheostomy, gastrostomy, weaning from mechanical ventilation, and final decannulation. The guiding principles consist of modifications in the methods of airway care to safely prevent iatrogenesis and to promote safety in patients severely affected by COVID-19, including mitigation of aerosol generation to minimize risk for health care workers.","Divo, Miguel J; Oberg, Catherine L; Pritchett, Michael A; Celli, Bartolome R; Folch, Erik E",Respir Care,,377

However, no studies seem to be focused on the BP (blood pressure) in patients with hypertension after COVID-19. REPORT: This report presents the cases of five frail geriatric patients (avg. age 78.3 (±6.4) years) with sarcopenia and controlled hypertension (office BP < 140 mmHg) who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Control ABPM performed after COVID-19 showed that these hypertensive patients were hypotensive and that the previously well-established therapy was suddenly too intensive for them. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that BP control after COVID-19 is needed and that ABPM is, particularly in frail geriatric patients, by no means a luxury but a necessity.","Koudelka, Marek; Sovová, Eliska",Medicina (Kaunas),,377

We also included data from one COVID19 patient who went under surgery for HNSCC. RESULTS: TMPRSS2 expression in HNSCC was significantly reduced compared to the normal tissues. It was more evident in women than in men, in TP53 mutated versus wild TP53 tumors, in HPV negative patients compared to HPV positive counterparts. Functionally, we modeled the multivariate effect of TP53, HPV, and other inherent variables on TMPRSS2. All variables had a statistically significant independent effect on TMPRSS2. In particular, in tumor tissues, HPV negative, TP53 mutated status and elevated TP53-dependent Myc-target genes were associated with low TMPRSS2 expression. The further analysis of both TCGA and our institutional HNSCC datasets identified a signature anti-correlated to TMPRSS2. As proof-of-principle we also validated the anti-correlation between microRNAs and TMPRSS2 expression in a SARS-CoV-2 positive HNSCC patient tissues Finally, we did not find TMPRSS2 promoter methylation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings suggest that tumoral tissues, herein exemplified by HNSCC and lung cancers might be more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to reduced expression of TMPRSS2. These observations may help to better assess the frailty of SARS-CoV-2 positive cancer patients.","Sacconi, Andrea; Donzelli, Sara; Pulito, Claudio; Ferrero, Stefano; Spinella, Francesca; Morrone, Aldo; Rigoni, Marta; Pimpinelli, Fulvia; Ensoli, Fabrizio; Sanguineti, Giuseppe; Pellini, Raul; Agrawal, Nishant; Izumchenko, Evgeny; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Giannì, Aldo; Muti, Paola; Strano, Sabrina; Blandino, Giovanni",J Exp Clin Cancer Res,,377

The study adopted a descriptive survey design. About 67 women participated in the survey questionnaire. The study utilised Technology Facilitated Gender-Based Violence Framework as theoretical lens. The study noted that women experienced various forms of cyber violence such as cyber bullying, cyber harassment, online defamation, cyberstalking, sexual exploitation, online hate speech, and revenge pornography. Perpetrators used digital platforms such Facebook, WhatsApp, online personal accounts, dating sites, and smartphones to carry out their evil acts. The study also found that perpetrators' motivations were driven by revenge, anger, jealousy, sexual desire and political agenda, with the intentions to harm the victims socially, psychologically, economically, and physically. The women used coping measures such as confrontation and blocking the perpetrator or by leaving the online platform. It was found that women never bothered to report the incidences to the police or community to seek for support due to lack of awareness, cultural and patriarchal factors. In conclusion, the study found that the prevalence of cyber violence against women is rising significantly in Malawi. Therefore, the findings provide insights to policy makers and research practioners on how to implement strategies for combating cyber violence against women in the country.","Malanga, Donald Flywell",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09806v1.pdf,377

Xenotransplantation has the potential to offer unlimited availability of pig organs for transplantation, and pig-to-non-human primate models have demonstrated outcomes that may soon justify clinical trials. However, one of the unique ethical challenges faced by xenotransplantation is that the risk of introducing potential zoonotic disease into the community must be weighed along with the benefit to the patient. While most experts believe that zoonosis is manageable, apprehension over disease transmission from animal donors to human recipients remains a frequent concern of many who are undecided or opposed to clinical xenotransplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a scenario (rapid worldwide spread of a highly contagious novel zoonotic disease with no natural defense in humans) that would seem to justify apprehension, especially in the United States, which has largely avoided previous pandemic outbreaks. However, there are many differences between zoonosis found in the wild or after xenotransplantation that favor the safety of the latter. Still, these differences, as well as the benefits of xenotransplantation, are not widely understood outside of the field. We must therefore ask what impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on attitudes toward xenotransplantation.","Knoll, Michael F; Cooper, David K C; Bottino, Rita",Xenotransplantation,,377

In this study, we examine the effect of ESG performance on stock returns and volatility during the financial crisis resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. To quantify the impact, we use company-level daily ESG score data and United Nations Global Compact (GC) score data. In our dataset, ESG scores indicate ESG performance that is deemed important to financial materiality, and the GC score indicates the firm reputation for following UN rules. Our results indicate that during the pandemic, an increase in the ESG score, especially the E score component, is related to higher returns and lower volatility. Conversely, increasing GC scores is correlated with lower stock returns and higher volatility. In addition, we find that firms in lower return groups benefit more than other firms. Focusing on energy sector impacts, we show that although the non-energy sector benefits more than the energy sector from increasing E scores, energy sector firms can still reduce their stock price volatility by increasing these scores. Our study offers significant implications for ESG investment strategies during financial crises. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Yoo, S.; Keeley, A. R.; Managi, S.",Energy Policy,,377

METHODS: This was a prospective, controlled study conducted on patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalised. In this study, 55 patients were included. The patients were divided into two groups as the ozone and control group. Ozone therapy (major autohemotherapy) was applied to 37 patients who were being treated with the appropriate COVID-19 treatment protocol determined by the infectious diseases committee of our hospital. The ozone treatment protocol consisted of seven sessions (one session per day) of intravenous ozone administration, applied in a volume of 100 mL and a concentration of 30 µg/mL. Only the conventional COVID-19 treatment protocol was applied to 18 patients in the control group. Clinical follow-up was performed until the discharge of the patients from the hospital with successful treatment or until the mortality occurred. Factors affecting mortality were analysed using univariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalisation was required in 6 of the 37 patients who were treated with ozone (16.2%), while 4 of 18 patients in the control group required ICU treatment (22.2%) (P = .713). When the mortality rates between the two groups were compared, mortality was lower in the ozone group (P = .032). As a result of univariate logistic regression analysis performed to investigate the factors affecting mortality, treatment with ozone therapy was determined as a risk factor for mortality. Patients receiving ozone therapy appear to have a lower mortality risk (odds ratio [OR]: 0.149, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.026-0.863, P = .034). CONCLUSION: In this study, the findings suggested that the administration of ozone therapy along with the conventional medical treatment in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 could reduce mortality.","Çolak, Sahin; Genç Yavuz, Burcu; Yavuz, Mürsel; Özçelik, Burak; Öner, Metin; Özgültekin, Asu; Senbayrak, Seniha",Int J Clin Pract,,377

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cardiac involvement and of respiratory failure in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an academic hospital in Lombardy, one of the most affected Italian (and worldwide) regions by the epidemic. The study included 405 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward from February 25th to March 31st, 2020. Follow-up of surviving patients ended either at hospital discharge or by July 30th, 2020. Myocardial injury was defined on the basis of the presence of blood levels of hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Respiratory function was assessed as PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio. The primary end-point was death for any cause. During hospitalization, 124 patients died. Death rate increased from 7.9% in patients with normal hs-TnI plasma levels and no cardiac comorbidity to 61.5% in patients with elevated hs-TnI and cardiac involvement (p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, older age, P/F ratio < 200 (both p < 0.001) and hs-TnI plasma levels were independent predictors of death. However, it must be emphasized that the median values of hs-TnI were within normal range in non-survivors. Cardiac involvement at presentation was associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, but, even in a population of COVID-19 patients who did not require invasive ventilation at hospital admission, mortality was mainly driven by older age and respiratory failure.","Ghio, Stefano; Baldi, Enrico; Vicentini, Alessandro; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Di Matteo, Angela; Zuccaro, Valentina; Piloni, Davide; Corsico, Angelo; Gnecchi, Massimiliano; Speciale, Francesco; Sabena, Anna; Oltrona Visconti, Luigi; Perlini, Stefano",Intern Emerg Med,,377

More data were needed on the pathogenesis of this unusual clotting disorder. METHODS: We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4-heparin immunoassay. RESULTS: Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of 1 patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4-heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4-heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

From the onset of COVID-19 pandemic to March 2021, more than 141 million cases and 3 million deaths were documented worldwide with disruption of the economic and social activity, devastating material, physical and psychological consequences. Reports of unusual and severe thrombotic events, including cerebral and splanchnic venous thrombosis and other autoimmune adverse reactions such as immune thrombocytopenia or thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) in connection with some of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have caused a great deal of concern within the population and the medical community. This report is intended to provide practical answers following an overview of our knowledge on these thrombotic events that are extremely rare but have serious consequences. Vaccine hesitancy threatens to reverse the progress made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases. These adverse events must be put into perspective with an objective analysis of the facts and the issues of the vaccination strategy during this SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Healthcare professionals remain the most pertinent advisors and influencers regarding vaccination decisions; they have to be supported in order to provide reliable and credible information on vaccines. We need to inform, reassure and support our patients when the prescription is made. Facing these challenges and these observations, a panel of experts express their insights and propose a tracking algorithm for vaccinated patients based on a10-point guideline for decision-making on what to do and not to do.","Elalamy, Ismail; Gerotziafas, Grigoris; Alamowitch, Sonia; Laroche, Jean-Pierre; van Dreden, Patrick; Ageno, Walter; Beyer-Westendorf, Jan; Cohen, Alexander T; Jiménez, David; Brenner, Benjamin; Middeldorp, Saskia; Cacoub, Patrice",Thromb. haemost,,377

338959,"Massification, diversification and internationalisation of higher education in China: Critical reflections of developments in the last two decades",2021,"There remain unanswered questions concerning mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of SARS-CoV-2. Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples thus, definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. Forty studies of COVID-19 pregnancies reviewed suggest a lack of consensus on diagnostic strategy for congenital infection. While RT-PCR of neonatal swabs was universally performed, a wide range of clinical samples was screened including vaginal secretions (22.5%), amniotic fluid (35%), breast milk (22.5%) and umbilical cord blood. Neonatal COVID-19 was reported in eight studies, two of which were based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in neonatal blood. Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection. Viral interactions may utilise membrane receptors other than ACE-2 thus, tissue susceptibility may be broader than currently known. Further spatial-temporal studies are needed to determine the true potential for transplacental migration. This article is protected by copyright.

340353,Investigating Student Responses of Online Learning during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Performing Art Education,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence surveys provide crucial information on cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n = 3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81%-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95% CI 0.00%-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95% HDI 0.40%-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06% (95% HDI 2.97%-5.16%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95% HDI 3.18%-5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","Poljak, Mario; Ostrbenk Valencak, Anja; Strumbelj, Erik; Maver Vodicar, Polona; Vehovar, Vasja; Resman Rus, Katarina; Korva, Misa; Knap, Natasa; Seme, Katja; Petrovec, Miroslav; Zupan, Blaz; Demsar, Janez; Kurdija, Slavko; Avsic Zupanc, Tatjana",Clin. microbiol. infect,,377

Tackling these issues, Collison, Vize, Miller, and Lynam developed the Five Factor Machiavellianism Inventory (FFMI), comprising antagonism, agency, and planfulness. We aimed to replicate the MACH-IV psychopathy relations, demonstrate the validity of the FFMI by assessing its relations with the NEO-PI-R and the HEXACO facets, and link the FFMI to a broad range of work-related criteria. We replicated the MACH-IV psychopathy relations and found a very high ([Formula: see text] = .91) absolute profile similarity between the FFMI's correlations with the NEO-PI-R in our sample (N = 572) and the correlation profile for the same variables reported by Collison and colleagues. Both the NEO-PI-R and HEXACO-PI-R profiles for the FFMI found in the current study supported its distinctiveness from traditional measures of Machiavellianism, which converged greatly with the correlation profiles for the FFMI-antagonism dimension. A cluster analysis also showed a substantial proportion of Five Factor Machiavellian individuals. In addition, the FFMI displayed positive relations with a broad range of criteria for vocational and work-related success and was clearly distinct from psychopathy.","Kückelhaus, Bastian P; Blickle, Gerhard; Kranefeld, Iris; Körnig, Theresa; Genau, Hanna A",J Pers Assess,,377

To minimise this risk, UK Armed Forces (UKAF) recruits receive a prevention-focused dental care intervention during military training (known as 'Project MOLAR') before their entry to the trained strength of the Armed Forces.Aim To evaluate whether Project MOLAR is effective in preventing future dental emergency events and subsequent oral disease in UKAF recruits.Methods This is a retrospective cohort analysis of UKAF recruits who enlisted between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011, conducted by analysing electronic primary dental care records. Adverse outcomes were defined as: i) incidence of dental emergency events during the five-year follow-up period; and ii) further oral disease at 18 months measured by an increase in Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth (DMFT).Results In total, 7,361 recruits met the inclusion criteria. The total follow-up time for the cohort was 31,957 person-years (mean follow-up 4.3 years/recruit). Individuals whose treatment was completed under Project MOLAR were found to experience a 30% reduction in dental emergency incidence (RR: 0.70-95% CI: 0.63-0.76) (p <0.001) and a 64% reduction in the odds of DMFT increase at 18 months (OR: 0.36-95% CI: 0.28-0.47) (p <0.001) compared to individuals whose treatment was incomplete.Conclusions Defence dentistry's focus on delivering prevention-focused dentistry early in a recruit's military career confers a downstream benefit to personnel who complete the intervention, such that dental emergency occurrences and DMFT progression are significantly reduced.","Armstrong, Sarah; Dermont, Mark",Br Dent J,,377

Currently, a reliable method for the diagnosis of infected patients is a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The method is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, designing novel methods is important. In this paper, we used three deep learning-based methods for the detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients with the use of X-Ray images of lungs. For the diagnosis of the disease, we presented two algorithms include deep neural network (DNN) on the fractal feature of images and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods with the use of the lung images, directly. Results classification shows that the presented CNN architecture with higher accuracy (93.2%) and sensitivity (96.1%) is outperforming than the DNN method with an accuracy of 83.4% and sensitivity of 86%. In the segmentation process, we presented a CNN architecture to find infected tissue in lung images. Results show that the presented method can almost detect infected regions with high accuracy of 83.84%.

Tertiary education in developing countries and the implementation of the SDGs,2020,"INTRODUCTION: This paper improves the methodology of the first edition of the rapid living systematic review started in April 2020, with the aim to gather and present the current evidence informing rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 and/or describing the consequences due to the disease and its treatment. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The Cochrane methodology for a rapid living systematic review was applied. Primary research papers, published from 1 January to 30 June 2020, reporting patients' data, with no limits of study design were included. Studies were categorized for study design, research question, COVID-19 phase, limitations of functioning (disability) of rehabilitation interest and type of rehabilitation service involved. Methodological quality assessment was based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools, and the level of evidence table (OCEBM 2011) for all the other studies. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six, out of 3703 papers, were included.

347608,New law in the air transport during the COVID-19 era,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The new coronavirus disease 2019 is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus which has currently overwhelmed the world. Realizing a comprehensive set of infection prevention measures is a key to minimize the spread of this virus and its impacts in all healthcare settings. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the compliance towards COVID-19 preventive measures and associated factors among health professionals in selected public hospitals, southeast Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 660 health professionals in public hospitals of southeast Ethiopia from October 1 to 31, 2020. A multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected by interview using structured and pretested questionnaires. Ordinary logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio. To declare the statistical significance of factors associated with the outcome variable, P-value < 0.05 and 95% confidence interval were used. RESULTS: A total of 654 health professionals were involved in the study; of whom, 313 participants were nurses. The overall good compliance and knowledge of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures were 21.6 and 25.5%, respectively. Working in the general hospital (AOR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.38, 0.79), service year (AOR = 2.10; 95% CI 1.35, 3.21), knowledge (AOR = 1.80; 95% CI 1.14, 2.89), and water availability (AOR = 3.26; 95% CI 2.25, 4.72) were some of the factors found to have a statistically significant association to compliance of health professionals regarding COVID-19 preventive measures. CONCLUSION: In this study, nearly one fifth of health professionals had good compliance towards COVID-19 prevention practices. Thus, a consistent supply of COVID-19 prevention materials, facilities, and improving the knowledge of health professionals through on and off-job training are crucial.","Zenbaba, Demisu; Sahiledengle, Biniyam; Takele, Abulie; Tekalegn, Yohannes; Yassin, Ahmed; Tura, Birhanu; Abdulkadir, Adem; Tesa, Edao; Tasew, Alelign; Ganfure, Gemechu; Fikadu, Genet; Seyoum, Kenbon; Abduku, Mohammedawel; Assefa, Tesfaye; Morka, Garoma; Kemal, Makida; Gemechu, Adisu; Bekele, Kebebe; Tessema, Abdi; Haji, Safi; Haile, Gebisa; Girma, Alemu; Mama, Mohammedaman; Negero, Asfaw; Nigussie, Eshetu; Gezahegn, Habtamu; Atlaw, Daniel; Regasa, Tadele; Usman, Heyder; Esmael, Adem",Trop Med Health,,377
350218,Clustering of educational building load data for defining healthy and energy-efficient management solutions of integrated HVAC systems,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increased interest in studying social stigma. The concept of stigma is also included in political discourse, as evidenced, among other things, by Xi Jinping's speeches, in which the Chinese President urges to abandon further politicization and stigmatization of COVID-19. In this regard, the main aim of the article is to analyze the correlation between the novel coronavirus and stigmatization, not only from the traditional point of view (stigma associated with certain diseases), but also in terms of world politics. To explain the nature of social stigma, the author relies on evolutionary psychology, terror management theory and social identity theory. To analyze ongoing processes in international relations, some provisions of ""rogue states"" concept, leadership theories, and biopolitics are applied. The primary sources are documents of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Group of Seven (G7), statements by UN and WHO officials, speeches of Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump, public opinion polls, and media publications. During the course of the study, the following scientific results were obtained: the works on COVID-19-related stigma have been systematized, the issues considered in them and research gaps are highlighted;the consequences of stigma due the novel coronavirus have been summarized;some differences between stigma during the pandemic and stigma associated with other diseases are also identified;it is suggested to consider COVID-19 stigma not only at the level of interpersonal interactions, but also in international relations;the possible impact of the pandemic on the China's role on the world stage has been revealed. It is concluded that this research approach allows to take a fresh look at the possibility of restoring ties between states and their citizens in a post-COVID-19 world, as well as to assess the likelihood of a change of global leader. In the final part of the article, possible ways of further development of the situation are predicted and prospects for study on the issue are outlined.","Arsentyeva, II",Mgimo Review of International Relations,,377

355166,Advancing research into accounting and the UN Sustainable Development Goals,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has dramatically expedited global vaccine development efforts1-3, most targeting the viral 'spike' glycoprotein (S). S localizes on the virion surface and mediates recognition of cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4-6. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block S-ACE2 interaction7-9, or indirectly prevent membrane fusion10, constitute an attractive modality for vaccine-elicited protection11. However, although prototypic S-based vaccines show promise in animal models12-14, the immunogenic properties of S in humans are poorly resolved. In this study, we characterized humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell (cTFH) immunity against spike in recovered patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that S-specific antibodies, memory B cells and cTFH are consistently elicited after SARS-CoV-2 infection, demarking robust humoral immunity and positively associated with plasma neutralizing activity. Comparatively low frequencies of B cells or cTFH specific for the receptor binding domain of S were elicited. Notably, the phenotype of S-specific cTFH differentiated subjects with potent neutralizing responses, providing a potential biomarker of potency for S-based vaccines entering the clinic. Overall, although patients who recovered from COVID-19 displayed multiple hallmarks of effective immune recognition of S, the wide spectrum of neutralizing activity observed suggests that vaccines might require strategies to selectively target the most potent neutralizing epitopes.","Juno, Jennifer A; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Lee, Wen Shi; Reynaldi, Arnold; Kelly, Hannah G; Wragg, Kathleen; Esterbauer, Robyn; Kent, Helen E; Batten, C Jane; Mordant, Francesca L; Gherardin, Nicholas A; Pymm, Phillip; Dietrich, Melanie H; Scott, Nichollas E; Tham, Wai-Hong; Godfrey, Dale I; Subbarao, Kanta; Davenport, Miles P; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K",Nat Med,,377

However, literature reports addressing the challenges for its industrial application, particularly those related to compaction behavior of liquisolid systems, are scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of process parameters and formulation variables on the flowability, wetting, and compaction properties of the liquisolid systems prepared in a fluid bed processor. The experiments with microcrystalline cellulose, as a carrier, were performed according to 23 full factorial design. The effects of liquid content, spray air pressure, and liquid feed rate on the properties of liquisolid systems were investigated. Liquisolid admixtures with microcrystalline cellulose were compared with those prepared with novel carriers, Fujicalin® and Neusilin® US2. ""Out-die"" Heckel, modified Walker, and Kuentz-Leuenberger models were used to analyze the compressibility of liquisolid admixtures. The results obtained showed that an increase in liquid content (in the range of 10 to 15%) led to a decrease in flowability of liquisolid admixtures with microcrystalline cellulose, as well as more pronounced influence of spraying conditions. On the other hand, higher liquid content led to higher compressibility. Fujicalin® and Neusilin® US2 liquisolid admixtures were found to have superior flowability and compressibility in comparison with those with microcrystalline cellulose, despite the considerably higher liquid load (50-55% liquid content in Neusilin® US2 compacts). Acceptable compactibility of the investigated liquisolid systems was observed. The fluid bed processor was shown to be suitable equipment for production of liquisolid systems, but with careful adjustment of process parameters.","Aleksic, Ivana; German Ilic, Ilija; Cvijic, Sandra; Parojcic, Jelena",AAPS PharmSciTech,,377

Newly developed vaccines promise relief to people who live in high-income countries, although vaccines and expensive new treatments are unlikely to arrive in time to help people who live in low-and middle-income countries. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is characterized by endothelial dysfunction. Several widely available drugs like statins, ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have immunometabolic activities that (among other things) maintain or restore endothelial cell function. For this reason, we undertook an observational study in four Belgian hospitals to determine whether in-hospital treatment with these drugs could improve survival in 959 COVID-19 patients. We found that treatment with statins and ACEIs/ARBs reduced 28-day mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Moreover, combination treatment with these drugs resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the odds of hospital mortality (OR = 0.33; 95% CI 0.17-0.69). These findings were in general agreement with other published studies. Additional observational studies and clinical trials are needed to convincingly show that in-hospital treatment with statins, ACEIs/ARBs, and especially their combination saves lives.","Byttebier, Geert; Belmans, Luc; Alexander, Myriam; Saxberg, Bo E H; De Spiegeleer, Bart; De Spiegeleer, Anton; Devreker, Nick; Van Praet, Jens T; Vanhove, Karolien; Reybrouck, Reinhilde; Wynendaele, Evelien; Fedson, David S",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,377

Green Dead Ends and Ways Out of the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"Background: We are communicating the results of investigating statistics on SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonias in Russia: percentage, mortality, cases with other viral agents, cases accompanied by secondary bacterial pneumonias, age breakdown, clinical course and outcome. Methods: We studied two sampling sets (Set 1 and Set 2). Set 1 consisted of results of testing 3382 assays of out-patients and hospital patients (5-88 years old) with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia of yet undetermined aetiology. Set 2 contained results of 1204 assays of hospital patients (12-94 years old) with pneumonia and COVID-19 already diagnosed by molecular biological techniques in test laboratories. The results were collected in twelve Russian cities/provinces in time range 2 March - 5 May 2020. Assays were analysed for 10 bacterial, 15 viral, 2 fungal and 2 parasitic aetiological agents. Results: In Set 1, 4.35% of total pneumonia cases were related to SARS-CoV-2, with substantially larger proportion (18.75%) of deaths of pneumonia with COVID-19 diagnosed. However, studying Set 2, we revealed that 52.82% patients in it were also positive for different typical and atypical aetiological agents usually causing pneumonia. 433 COVID-19 patients (35.96%) were tested positive for various bacterial aetiological agents, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae infections accounting for the majority of secondary pneumonia cases. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2, a low-pathogenic virus itself, becomes exceptionally dangerous if secondary bacterial pneumonia attacks a COVID-19 patient as a complication. An essential part of the severest complications and mortality associated with COVID-19 in Russia in March-May 2020, may be attributed to secondary bacterial pneumonia and to a much less extent viral co-infections. The problem of hospital-acquired bacterial infection is exceptionally urgent in treating SARS-CoV-2 patients. The risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia and its further complications, should be given very serious attention in combating SARS-CoV-2.","Sharov, Konstantin S",J Glob Health,,377

Here we estimate the rate of detection of symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in France after lockdown through the use of virological3 and participatory syndromic4 surveillance data coupled with mathematical transmission models calibrated to regional hospitalizations2. Our findings indicate that around 90,000 symptomatic infections, corresponding to 9 out 10 cases, were not ascertained by the surveillance system in the first 7 weeks after lockdown from 11 May to 28 June 2020, although the test positivity rate did not exceed the 5% recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO)5. The median detection rate increased from 7% (95% confidence interval, 6-8%) to 38% (35-44%) over time, with large regional variations, owing to a strengthening of the system as well as a decrease in epidemic activity. According to participatory surveillance data, only 31% of individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms consulted a doctor in the study period.

It is caused due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). It has the tendency to spread rapidly through person-to-person. Currently, several molecular diagnostic platforms such as PCR, qRT-PCR, reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), CRISPR are utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. These conventional techniques are costly, time consuming and require sophisticated instrumentation facility with well trained personnel for testing. Hence, it is tough to provide testing en-masse to the people in developing countries. On the other hand, several serological biosensors such as lateral flow immunosensor, optical, electrochemical, microfluidics integrated electrochemical/fluorescence is currently utilized for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. In current pandemic situation, there is an urgent need of rapid and efficient diagnosis on mass scale of SARS-CoV-2 for early stage detection. Early monitoring of viral infections can help to control and prevent the spreading of infections in large chunk of population. In this review, the SARS-CoV-2 and their biomarkers in biological samples, collection of samples and recently reported potential electrochemical immunosensors for the rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed.","Ranjan, Pushpesh; Singhal, Ayushi; Yadav, Shalu; Kumar, Neeraj; Murali, S; Sanghi, Sunil K; Khan, Raju",Int Rev Immunol,,377

Therefore, to investigate the function of the DPV US3 protein, we used scarless Red recombination technology based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the DPV Chinese virulent strain (CHv) genome and successfully constructed and rescued a US3-deleted mutant and the corresponding revertant virus (BAC-CHv-&#916;US3 and BAC-CHv-&#916;US3R, respectively). For viral growth characteristics, compared to the parental and revertant viruses, the US3-deleted mutant showed an approximately 100-fold reduction in viral titers but no significant reduction in genome copies, indicating that the US3-deleted mutant exhibited decreased viral replication but not decreased viral DNA generation. In addition, the US3-deleted mutant formed viral plaques that were 33% smaller on average than those formed by the parental and revertant viruses, demonstrating that US3 protein affected the viral cell-to-cell spread of DPV. Finally, the results of electron microscopy showed that the deletion of US3 resulted in a large number of virions accumulating in the nucleus and perinuclear space, thus blocking virion nuclear egress. In this study, we found that the DPV US3 protein played pivotal roles in viral replication by promoting viral cell-to-cell spread and virion nuclear egress, which may provide some references for research on the function of the DPV US3 protein.","Deng, Liyao; Wang, Mingshu; Cheng, Anchun; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Jia, Renyong; Chen, Shun; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Zhang, Shaqiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Zhang, Ling; Liu, Yunya; Yu, Yanling; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Xiaoyue",Sci Rep,,377

In response to COVID-19, cities nationwide temporarily housed people experiencing homelessness in unused hotels. One such initiative in New Orleans also enacted a screening, counseling, and linkage-to-care model for HIV and HCV treatment for this temporarily housed population between May and July 2020. METHODS: A non-concurrent cohort study was performed assessing follow up in the treatment of HIV and HCV for this population. Outcome data was collected on seropositive patients' electronic medical record to assess patient progression through the treatment cascade. RESULTS: Of 102 unhoused residents, 25 (24.5%) tested HCV seropositive. Of the HCV positive 21/25 (84%) were connected to the associated clinic for follow up care and 10 (40%) obtained HCV treatment medication. Furthermore, all three patients who tested seropositive for HIV either started or re-initiated anti-viral treatment. The greatest barrier to providing medication for the HCV seropositive patients, once care was initiated, was loss-to-follow-up. CONCLUSION: Targeting homeless persons living in temporary residences for HCV and HIV screening can be effective at promoting access to care for those infected due to this population's high HCV seropositivity especially significant if the patient has a history of intravenous drug use or is over the age of 40. However, continued outreach strategies are needed to assist patients in retention of care.","Cironi, Katherine A; Jones, Austin T; Hauser, Elizabeth M; Olsen, Joseph W; Kissinger, Patricia J",Sex. transm. dis,,377

METHODS: Cardiovascular procedures performed at 30 hospitals across 6 Western states in 2 large, non-profit healthcare systems (Providence St. Joseph Health and Stanford Healthcare) from December 2018-June 2020 were analyzed for changes over time. Risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality was compared across pandemic phases with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 36,125 procedures (69% percutaneous coronary intervention, 13% coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 10% transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and 8% surgical aortic valve replacement), weekly volumes changed in 2 distinct phases after the initial inflection point on February 23, 2020: an initial period of significant deferral (COVID I: March 15-April 11) followed by recovery (COVID II: April 12 onwards). Compared to pre-COVID, COVID I patients were less likely to be female (P = .0003), older (P < .0001), Asian or Black (P = .02), or Medicare insured (P < .0001), and COVID I procedures were higher acuity (P < .0001), but not higher complexity. In COVID II, there was a trend toward more procedural deferral in regions with a higher COVID-19 burden (P = .05). Compared to pre-COVID, there were no differences in risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality during both COVID phases. CONCLUSIONS: Significant decreases in cardiovascular procedural volumes occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic, with disproportionate impacts by race, gender, and age. These findings should inform our approach to future healthcare disruptions.","Yong, Celina M; Spinelli, Kateri J; Chiu, Shih Ting; Jones, Brandon; Penny, Brian; Gummidipundi, Santosh; Beach, Shire; Perino, Alex; Turakhia, Mintu; Heidenreich, Paul; Gluckman, Ty J",Am Heart J,,377

We also examined the relationship between CT value and patient age to determine any age-dependent difference in viral load or test sensitivity. METHODS: We collected CT values obtained from the cobas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay corresponding to 1,213 combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens obtained from symptomatic individuals that were reported as positive or presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2. CT values were stratified by SARS-CoV target and patient age group. RESULTS: In total, 93.3% to 98.4% of specimens demonstrated CT values greater than 3× the assay LoD, at which point false-negative results would not be expected. The mean of CT values between age groups was statistically equivalent with the exception of patients in age group 80 to 89 years, which demonstrated slightly lower CTs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the distribution of observed CT values, including the small proportion of specimens with values near the assay LoD, there is a low risk of false-negative RT-PCR results in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens obtained from symptomatic individuals.","Buchan, Blake W; Hoff, Jessica S; Gmehlin, Cameron G; Perez, Adriana; Faron, Matthew L; Munoz-Price, L Silvia; Ledeboer, Nathan A",Am J Clin Pathol,,377

375470,Information management research and practice in the post-COVID-19 world,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Although many Medicare Advantage plans have waived cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations, these waivers are voluntary and may be temporary. To estimate the magnitude of potential patient cost sharing if waivers are not implemented or are allowed to expire, this study assesses the level and predictors of out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations in 2018 among elderly Medicare Advantage patients. METHODS: Using the Optum De-Identified Clinformatics DataMart, investigators identified Medicare Advantage patients aged &#8805;65 years hospitalized for influenza in 2018. For each hospitalization, out-of-pocket spending was calculated by summing deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. The mean out-of-pocket spending and the proportion of hospitalizations with out-of-pocket spending exceeding $2,500 were calculated. A 1-part generalized linear model with a log link and Poisson variance function was fitted to model out-of-pocket spending as a function of patient demographic characteristics, plan type, and hospitalization characteristics. Coefficients were converted to absolute changes in out-of-pocket spending by calculating average marginal effects. RESULTS: Among 14,278 influenza hospitalizations, the mean out-of-pocket spending was $987 (SD=$799). Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2,500 for 3.0% of hospitalizations. The factors associated with higher out-of-pocket spending included intensive care use, greater length of stay, and enrollment in a preferred provider organization plan (average marginal effect=$634, 95% CI=$631, $636) compared with enrollment in an HMO plan. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of elderly Medicare Advantage patients, the mean out-of-pocket spending for influenza hospitalizations was almost $1,000. Federal policymakers should consider passing legislation mandating insurers to eliminate cost sharing for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Insurers with existing cost-sharing waivers should consider extending them indefinitely, and those without such waivers should consider implementing them immediately.","Chua, Kao-Ping; Conti, Rena M",Am J Prev Med,,377

Introduction,2021,"Background: The clinical knowledge about the course, complications and treatment of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is so far limited. Aim: This systematic review summarizes the current scientific evidence regarding the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in hospitalized children based on available case series from China. In addition, first data from a nationwide pediatric hospital survey conducted by the German Society for Pediatric Infectious Diseases (DGPI) are presented. Methods: This study evaluated 12 case series from China with 6-2143 children infected with SARS-CoV­2, which were identified by a literature search in PubMed up to 31 March 2020. The database of the German nationwide DGPI COVID-19 survey was accessed on 6 April 2020. Results: The median patient age in the case series was between 2 and 7 years and 18-45% were infants <1 year of age. The duration of hospital stay was 5-20 days. Most commonly reported symptoms were fever and cough; in 40-100% of cases involvement of the lower respiratory tract was reported, usually confirmed by computed tomography (CT). Severe and critical courses of disease were reported in up to 8% of the children including 2 fatalities. So far the German DGPI COVID-19 survey reported 33 hospitalized children up to 6 April 2020, mostly with upper airway infections. Of these children, 45% were infants and 32% had an underlying medical condition. So far 3 children (9%) needed admission to an intensive care unit. Conclusion: COVID-19 in hospitalized children usually presented as an uncomplicated febrile upper airway infection or mild pneumonia. Severe cases or fatalities rarely occurred in children. Information on neonates and children with underlying chronic conditions as well as on therapeutic and preventive measures are urgently needed.","Streng, A; Hartmann, K; Armann, J; Berner, R; Liese, J G",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,377

378504,"Perceptions regarding Distance Learning in Higher Education, Smoothing the Transition",2021,"BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders are considered one of the greatest burdens to global public health and a leading cause of death. Stem cell therapies hold great promise for the cure of neurological disorders, as stem cells can serve as cell replacement, while also secreting factors to enhance endogenous tissue regeneration. Adult human multipotent stem cells (MSCs) reside on blood vessels, and therefore can be found in many tissues throughout the body, including palatine tonsils. Several studies have reported the capacity of MSCs to differentiate into, among other cell types, the neuronal lineage. However, unlike the case with embryonic stem cells, it is unclear whether MSCs can develop into mature neurons. METHODS: Human tonsillar MSCs (T-MSCs) were isolated from a small, 0.6-g sample, of tonsillar biopsies with high viability and yield as we recently reported. Then, these cells were differentiated by a rapid, multi-stage procedure, into committed, post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions. RESULTS: Here we describe for the first time the derivation and differentiation of tonsillar biopsy-derived MSCs (T-MSCs), by a rapid, multi-step protocol, into post-mitotic, neuron-like cells using defined conditions without genetic manipulation. We characterized our T-MSC-derived neuronal cells and demonstrate their robust differentiation in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our procedure leads to a rapid neuronal lineage commitment and loss of stemness markers, as early as three days following neurogenic differentiation. Our studies identify biopsy-derived T-MSCs as a potential source for generating neuron-like cells which may have potential use for in vitro modeling of neurodegenerative diseases or cell replacement therapies.","Arad, Michal; Brown, Robert A; Khatri, Raju; Taylor, Rodney J; Zalzman, Michal",Cell Mol Biol Lett,,377

Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus member of the family Arteriviridae from the order Nidovirales like the Coronaviridae. EAV causes respiratory and reproductive diseases in equids. Although two vaccines are available, the vaccination coverage of the equine population is largely insufficient to prevent new EAV outbreaks around the world. In this study, we present a high-throughput in vitro assay suitable for testing candidate antiviral molecules on equine dermal cells infected by EAV. Using this assay, we identified three molecules that impair EAV infection in equine cells: the broad-spectrum antiviral and nucleoside analog ribavirin, and two compounds previously described as inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), the fourth enzyme of the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. These molecules effectively suppressed cytopathic effects associated to EAV infection, and strongly inhibited viral replication and production of infectious particles. Since ribavirin is already approved in human and small animal, and that several DHODH inhibitors are in advanced clinical trials, our results open new perspectives for the management of EAV outbreaks.","Valle-Casuso, José-Carlos; Gaudaire, Delphine; Martin-Faivre, Lydie; Madeline, Anthony; Dallemagne, Patrick; Pronost, Stéphane; Munier-Lehmann, Hélène; Zientara, Stephan; Vidalain, Pierre-Olivier; Hans, Aymeric",Sci Rep,,377

RESULTS: A decrease in ED admissions was observed for MI (-20% for ST-segment elevation MI and-25% for non-ST-segment elevation MI) and stroke (-18% for ischaemic and-22% for haemorrhagic) during the lockdown. The decrease became significant earlier for stroke than for MI. No compensatory increase in ED admissions was observed at the end of the lockdown for these diseases. Important regional disparities in ED admissions were observed, without correlation with the regional levels of COVID-19 cases. The impact of lockdown on ED admissions was particularly significant in six regions (Ile-de France, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hauts-de-France and Bretagne). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in ED admissions for MI and stroke observed during the lockdown was probably caused by fear of COVID-19 and augmented by the lockdown, and was heterogeneous across the French territory. ED admissions were slow to return to the usual levels from previous years, without a compensatory increase. These results underline the need to reinforce messages directed at the population to encourage them to seek care without delay in case of cardiovascular symptoms.","Olié, Valérie; Carcaillon-Bentata, Laure; Thiam, Marie-Michèle; Haeghebaert, Sylvie; Caserio-Schönemann, Céline",Arch.

384731,Consumer responses to savings message framing,2020,"For much of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic upended social and economic life globally. In an effort to reduce COVID-19 risks in the U.S., state and local governments issued many recommendations and regulations to induce social distancing, adding to voluntary reductions in interpersonal contact. The responses to the epidemic helped contain spread, but also lead to high unintended societal costs. In the summer months, states took steps to revive the economy and lift social distancing regulations. However, as many epidemiologists expected, the scale of the epidemic has expanded very rapidly in the fall. In the week of October 14, the US generated around 57,000 new COVID-19 cases and 700 deaths each day. By November 15, the country was generating about 151,000 new cases and 1,200 deaths per day. These rapid increases in cases and deaths raise concerns about the capacity of local healthcare systems around the country. State governments are once again facing difficult choices about whether and how to use policies to address the spread of the virus. The incoming Biden-Harris administration faces an important challenge in trying to manage the epidemic as well as a large scale vaccination campaign. Although the epidemic is less than a year old, it has generated a huge volume of research by economists, epidemiologists, and others. This body of work may help inform policy decisions facing society in the coming months.","Gupta, S.; Simon, K. I.; Wing, C.",Working Paper Series National Bureau of Economic Research,,377

The doctor of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, Ibn Jatima from Almeria, wrote Treatise on the Plague, in which it may be found epidemiological and clinical similarities between both plagues. In the context of Greco-Arab medicine, he discovered respiratory and contact contagion of Pestis and attributed its physiopathology to a lack of pulmonary cooling of the innate heat, generated in the heart and carried by the blood humor. The process described was equivalent to the oxygen transport system. Furthermore, it was supposed to generate toxic residues, such as free radicals, leading to an irreversible multiple organ failure (MOF), considered a mortality factor as in Covid-19.

399292,The sustainable business model of spa tourism enterprise—results of research carried out in Poland,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Since its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, with particularly severe outcomes in healthcare institutions and congregate settings. To mitigate spread, healthcare systems have been cohorting patients to limit contacts between uninfected patients and potentially infected patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). A major challenge in managing the pandemic is the presence of currently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals capable of transmitting the virus, who could introduce COVID-19 into uninfected cohorts. The optimal combination of personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and other approaches to prevent these events is unclear, especially in light of ongoing limited resources. METHODS: Using stochastic simulations with a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered dynamic model, we quantified and compared the impacts of PPE use, patient and HCWs surveillance testing and subcohorting strategies. RESULTS: In the base case without testing or PPE, the healthcare system was rapidly overwhelmed, and became a net contributor to the force of infection. We found that effective use of PPE by both HCWs and patients could prevent this scenario, while random testing of apparently asymptomatic/presymptomatic individuals on a weekly basis was less effective. We also found that even imperfect use of PPE could provide substantial protection by decreasing the force of infection. Importantly, we found that creating smaller patient/HCW-interaction subcohorts can provide additional resilience to outbreak development with limited resources. CONCLUSION: These findings reinforce the importance of ensuring adequate PPE supplies even in the absence of testing and provide support for strict subcohorting regimens to reduce outbreak potential in healthcare institutions.","Qiu, Xueting; Miller, Joel C; MacFadden, Derek R; Hanage, William P",BMJ Open,,377

Currently there is no known effective therapy or vaccine for treatment of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting urgency around identifying effective therapies. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of hydroxychloroquine therapy alone and in combination with azithromycin in hospitalized patients positive for COVID-19. DESIGN: Multi-center retrospective observational study. SETTING: The Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) in Southeast Michigan: large six hospital integrated health system; the largest of hospitals is an 802-bed quaternary academic teaching hospital in urban Detroit, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with a COVID-related admission in the health system from March 10, 2020 to May 2, 2020 were included. Only the first admission was included for patients with multiple admissions. All patients evaluated were 18 years of age and older and were treated as inpatients for at least 48h unless expired within 24h. EXPOSURE: Receipt of hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin, azithromycin alone, or neither. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 2,541 patients, with a median total hospitalization time of 6 days (IQR: 4-10 days), median age was 64 years (IQR:53-76 years), 51% male, 56% African American, with median time to follow-up of 28.5 days (IQR:3-53). Overall in-hospital mortality was 18.1% (95% CI:16.6%-19.7%); by treatment: hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1% [95% CI: 17.3%-23.0%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5% [95% CI: 11.6%-15.5%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4% [95% CI: 16.0%-30.1%]), and neither drug, 108/409 (26.4% [95% CI: 22.2%-31.0%]). Primary cause of mortality was respiratory failure (88%); no patient had documented torsades de pointes. From Cox regression modeling, predictors of mortality were age>65 years (HR:2.6 [95% CI:1.9-3.3]), white race (HR:1.7 [95% CI:1.4-2.1]), CKD (HR:1.7 [95%CI:1.4-2.1]), reduced O2 saturation level on admission (HR:1.5 [95%CI:1.1-2.1]), and ventilator use during admission (HR: 2.2 [95%CI:1.4-3.3]). Hydroxychloroquine provided a 66% hazard ratio reduction, and hydroxychloroquine+azithromycin 71% compared to neither treatment (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact.","Arshad, Samia; Kilgore, Paul; Chaudhry, Zohra S; Jacobsen, Gordon; Wang, Dee Dee; Huitsing, Kylie; Brar, Indira; Alangaden, George J; Ramesh, Mayur S; McKinnon, John E; O039,; Neill, William; Zervos, Marcus",Int J Infect Dis,,377

406195,How do digital games utilization levels predict a teacher’s digital material development self-efficacy?,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To explore in-depth the views on Internet-based psychological therapies and their implementation from the perspective of National Health Service (NHS) commissioners and managers. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study. METHOD: Ten NHS commissioners and managers participated in a semi-structured, co-produced interview. Each transcribed interview was double-coded and thematically analysed using The Framework Method. RESULTS: Interviews generated three main themes. (1) Capacity issues across psychological therapy services create barriers to face-to-face therapies, and Internet-based interventions offer a solution. (2) Despite reservations, there is growing acceptance of Internet-based therapies. Different ways of connecting with patients are required, and Internet-based treatments are accessible and empowering treatment options, with guided self-help (GSH) preferred. Internet-based interventions may however exclude some individuals and be a threat to the therapeutic relationship between patient and practitioner. (3) Successful roll-out of Internet-based interventions would be facilitated by a strong empirical- or practice-based evidence, a national coordinated approach and timely training and supervision. Barriers to the roll-out include digital intervention set-up costs and delays due to NHS inflexibility. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights factors influencing access to Internet-based therapies, important given the rapid evolution of e-therapies, and particularly timely given increasing use of remote therapies due to COVID-19 restrictions. Interviewees were open to Internet-based approaches, particularly GSH interventions, so long as they do not compromise on therapy quality. Interviewees acknowledged implementation may be challenging, and recommendations were offered. PRACTITIONER POINTS: There is a shift in practice and increasingly positive views from NHS staff around remote psychological therapies and different ways of connecting with patients, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a strong preference for Internet-based psychological interventions that are guided and that include built-in outcome measures co-produced with service users. There is a need to raise awareness of the growing evidence base for Internet-based psychological therapies, including research examining therapeutic alliance across Internet-based and face-to-face therapies. Challenges implementing Internet-based psychological therapies include therapist resistance to changing working practices in general, and inflexibility of the NHS, and national, coordinated implementation efforts are encouraged.","Simon, Natalie; Ploszajski, Matt; Lewis, Catrin; Smallman, Kim; Roberts, Neil P; Kitchiner, Neil J; Brookes-Howell, Lucy; Bisson, Jonathan I",Psychol. psychother,,377

406197,How do digital games utilization levels predict a teacher’s digital material development self-efficacy?,2021,"In the realm of marine science, engaging with stakeholders (e.g., industry members, policy-makers, managers, NGOs) is an important method applied in many research projects. The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted this engagement in two ways. First, social distancing measures forbid most face-to-face participatory activities originally envisioned in projects. Second, the restrictions have caused hardships for the stakeholders being engaged by these projects. We assessed the impact of Covid-19 on stakeholder engagement activities in ongoing EU marine science projects by posing the following questions: What problems has Covid-19 caused for the workflow and outcomes of current research projects, (ii) how have scientists responsible for stakeholder engagement coped with the situation, and (iii) if alternative stakeholder activities were implemented, how have these been evaluated? Our survey was conducted nearly 2 months after the onset of Covid-19 lockdowns. It addressed researchers who engage with stakeholders in EU projects and delivers insights into the practical implications of Covid-19 for stakeholder engagement and the measures taken to tackle this challenge. The paper highlights the impacts of the pandemic on stakeholder engagement in marine science, outlines current coping strategies in different EU projects, and recommends seven practical actions to promote and maintain meaningful exchange with stakeholders in times of social distancing and lockdowns.","Köpsel, Vera de Moura Kiipper Gabriel Peck Myron A.",Maritime Studies,,377
406388,The seven sins of hunting tourism,2020,"The activities performed by Canadian workers in some occupations may increase the risk of exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This research note explores how occupational exposure risks vary by labor force characteristics using publicly available Canadian data in combination with a data set providing information on the level of physical proximity and frequency of exposure to infections or diseases faced by workers in different occupations. The results show important sociodemographic differences. First, women work in occupations associated with significantly higher average risks of exposure to COVID-19 than men. This is driven by their overrepresentation in high-risk broad occupational categories such as health occupations. Second, older workers (65 years or more), a group vulnerable to COVID-19, appear to work in occupations requiring performing activities characterized by a lower level of physical proximity than their younger colleagues, with minimal differences in the frequency of exposure to diseases or infections. Finally, workers in low-income occupations are employed in occupations that put them at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19 than other workers. This is especially the case for women, immigrants, and members of visible minority groups in low-income occupations. More broadly, this research note provides insights into the health-related dimension of the literature on occupational tasks and labor market stratification.","St-Denis, Xavier",Can Rev Sociol,,377

409740,Shifting streets COVID-19 mobility data: Findings from a global dataset and a research agenda for transport planning and policy,2021,"In recent years there has been growing interest in measuring time-varying functional connectivity between different brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the importance of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. Further, we contrast this approach with the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to achieve similar goals. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS matrices into recurring brain states.","Honari, Hamed; Choe, Ann S; Lindquist, Martin A",Neuroimage,,377

However, the spread of the virus has been uneven in both prevalence and speed of propagation. We analyse the association of social, economic, and demographic factors in the initial spread of the coronavirus disease COVID-19 across 23 European countries between March 1 and April 30, 2020. Diagnosed COVID-19 cases from Johns Hopkins University and data from the European Social Survey and other sources were used to estimate bivariate associations between cumulative reported case numbers at ten-day intervals and nine social, demographic, and economic variables. To avoid overfitting, we first reduce these variables to three factors by factor analysis before conducting a multiple regression analysis. We also perform a sensitivity analysis using rates and new cases between two time periods. Results showed that social and economic factors are strongly and positively associated with COVID-19 throughout the studied period, while the association with population density and cultural factors was initially low, but by April, was higher than the earlier mentioned factors. For future influenza-like pandemics, implementing strict movement restrictions from early on will be crucial to curb the spread of such diseases in economically, socially, and culturally vibrant and densely populated countries.

Exfoliated individual GONRs sequentially assemble into strings (â¼1 mg/mL), nanoplates (â¼20 mg/mL), and a macroporous scaffold (50 mg/mL) with increasing concentration. The GONR hydrogels exhibit viscoelastic shear-thinning behavior and can be shear-coated to form large-area GONR films on substrates. The entangled and stacked structure of the GONR film contributed to outstanding nanofiltration performance under high pressure, cross-flow, and long-term filtration, while the precise molecular separation with 100% rejection rate was maintained for sub-nanometer molecules.","Choi, Yunkyu; Kim, Sung-Soo; Kim, Ji Hoon; Kang, Junhyeok; Choi, Eunji; Choi, Seung Eun; Kim, Jeong Pil; Kwon, Ohchan; Kim, Dae Woo",ACS nano,,377

Traditional methods and datasets for sentiment analysis are, however, not suitable for the domain of political text as they do not consider the direction of sentiments expressed between entities. In this paper, we propose a novel NLP task of identifying directed sentiment relationship between political entities from a given news document, which we call directed sentiment extraction. From a million-scale news corpus, we construct a dataset of news sentences where sentiment relations of political entities are manually annotated. We present a simple but effective approach for utilizing a pretrained transformer, which infers the target class by predicting multiple question-answering tasks and combining the outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed method for social science research questions by analyzing positive and negative opinions between political entities in two major events: 2016 U.S. presidential election and COVID-19. The newly proposed problem, data, and method will facilitate future studies on interdisciplinary NLP methods and applications.","Park, Kunwoo; Pan, Zhufeng; Joo, Jungseock",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01033v2.pdf,377
414072,Tourism partnerships: localizing the SDG agenda in Fiji,2020,"The effects of COVID-19 are likely to be social stratified. Disease control measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic mean that people spend much more time in their immediate households, due to lockdowns, the need to self-isolate, and school and workplace closures. This has elevated the importance of certain household-level characteristics for individuals' current and future wellbeing. The multi-dimensional poverty and health inequalities literature suggests that poor health and socio-economic conditions cluster in the general population, which may exacerbate societal inequalities over time. This study investigates how COVID-19-related health- and socio-economic vulnerabilities occur at the household level, and how they are distributed across household types and geographical areas in the United Kingdom. Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of UK households and applying principal components analysis, we derived summary measures representing different dimensions of household vulnerabilities critical during the COVID-19 epidemic: health, employment, housing, financial and digital. Our analysis highlights four key findings. First, although COVID-19-related health risks are concentrated in retirement-age households, a substantial proportion of working age households also face these risks. Second, different types of households exhibit different vulnerabilities, with working-age households more likely to face financial and housing precarities, and retirement-age households health and digital vulnerabilities. Third, there are area-level differences in the distribution of household-level -vulnerabilities across England and the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. Fourth, in many households, different dimensions of vulnerabilities intersect; this is especially prevalent among working-age households. The findings imply that the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to significantly vary by household type. Policy measures that aim to mitigate the health and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider how vulnerabilities cluster and interact with one another across different household types, and how these may exacerbate already existing inequalities.","Mikolai, Júlia; Keenan, Katherine; Kulu, Hill",SSM Popul Health,,377

AIMS: In our study, we aim to research the secondary traumatization and associated factors among health care workers. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was applied through an online questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. RESULTS: Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (p < .001). Also, we found that being a woman, being in the first years of the work, living with a parent, having a chronic disease, having a trauma history and increased social media use are related to having higher scores from the secondary traumatization scale. CONCLUSION: The secondary traumatization exposure and the mental health conditions of the health care workers directly working with the COVID-19 patients should be taken into consideration. It is important to provide social support, examine and control riskier groups for mental health regularly during the pandemic.","Arpacioglu, Selim; Gurler, Meltem; Cakiroglu, Suleyman",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,377

We aimed to assess the construct validity of the Post-COVID-19 Functional Status (PCFS) Scale among adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19. METHODS: Adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19, who were members of an online panel and two Facebook groups for subjects with COVID-19 with persistent symptoms, completed an online survey after the onset of infection-related symptoms. The number and intensity of symptoms were evaluated with the Utrecht Symptom Diary, health-related quality of life (HrQoL) with the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire, impairment in work and activities with the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire and functional status with the PCFS Scale. RESULTS: 1939 subjects were included in the analyses (85% women, 95% non-hospitalized during infection) about 3 months after the onset of infection-related symptoms. Subjects classified as experiencing 'slight', 'moderate' and 'severe' functional limitations presented a gradual increase in the number/intensity of symptoms, reduction of HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities. No differences were found regarding the number and intensity of symptoms, HrQoL and impairment in work and usual activities between subjects classified as experiencing 'negligible' and 'no' functional limitations. We found weak-to-strong statistical associations between functional status and all domains of HrQoL (r: 0.233-0.661). Notably, the strongest association found was with the 'usual activities' domain of the 5-level EQ-5D questionnaire. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated the construct validity of the PCFS Scale in highly-symptomatic adult subjects with confirmed and presumed COVID-19, 3 months after the onset of symptoms.","Machado, Felipe V C; Meys, Roy; Delbressine, Jeannet M; Vaes, Anouk W; Goërtz, Yvonne M J; van Herck, Maarten; Houben-Wilke, Sarah; Boon, Gudula J A M; Barco, Stefano; Burtin, Chris; 039, van; t Hul, Alex; Posthuma, Rein; Franssen, Frits M E; Spies, Yvonne; Vijlbrief, Herman; Pitta, Fabio; Rezek, Spencer A; Janssen, Daisy J A; Siegerink, Bob; Klok, Frederikus A; Spruit, Martijn A",Health Qual Life Outcomes,,377

423327,"ICT for Education, Employment and Empowerment in India",2020,"Each year nearly three million individuals require inpatient hospitalization following a traumatic injury (e.g. gunshot wounds, injuries sustained in motor vehicle collisions, burns) in the United States. Approximately 20–40% of these individuals go on to develop posttraumatic stress disorder and/or depression one-year post-hospitalization. Despite the high rate of psychological morbidity in this population, the vast majority of hospitals do not address the emotional or behavioral health needs of this population. The Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program, a technology-assisted stepped-care program, was developed to address these needs in one hospital system and to create a scalable model. Telepsychotherapy is a key part of this model due to the unique needs of this population, including trauma center catchment area and barriers due to physical injury. This manuscript describes the use of telepsychotherapy to deliver evidence-based interventions to traumatic injury patients across the lifespan, presents challenges created by the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as efforts to address these challenges, adaptations to our training model, and considerations for the use of telepsychotherapy in the age of COVID-19 and beyond. The goal is to present a model for remote screening and treatment of individuals that can be applied to other settings and populations.","Anton, Margaret T.; Ridings, Leigh E.; Gavrilova, Yulia; Bravoco, Olivia; Ruggiero, Kenneth J.; Davidson, Tatiana M.",Couns.

What makes the situation even more complicated is the ambiguity about the duration and ultimate spread of the pandemic. It is especially critical for the governments, healthcare systems, and economic sectors to have an estimate of the future of this disaster. By using different mathematical approaches, including the classical susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and its derivatives, many investigators have tried to predict the outbreak of COVID-19. In this study, we simulated the epidemic in Isfahan province of Iran for the period from Feb 14th to April 11th and also forecasted the remaining course with three scenarios that differed in terms of the stringency level of social distancing. Despite the prediction of disease course in short-term intervals, the constructed SIR model was unable to forecast the actual spread and pattern of epidemic in the long term. Remarkably, most of the published SIR models developed to predict COVID-19 for other communities, suffered from the same inconformity. The SIR models are based on assumptions that seem not to be true in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic. Hence, more sophisticated modeling strategies and detailed knowledge of the biomedical and epidemiological aspects of the disease are needed to forecast the pandemic.","Moein, Shiva; Nickaeen, Niloofar; Roointan, Amir; Borhani, Niloofar; Heidary, Zarifeh; Javanmard, Shaghayegh Haghjooy; Ghaisari, Jafar; Gheisari, Yousof",Sci Rep,,377

So far, there is limited data on how recently commercially available, high-throughput immunoassays, using different recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens, perform with clinical samples. Focusing on IgG and total antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of four automated immunoassays (Abbott Architect&#8482; i2000 (N protein-based)), Roche cobas&#8482; e 411 analyzer (N protein-based, not differentiating between IgA, IgM or IgG antibodies), LIAISON®XL platform (S1 and S2 protein-based), VIRCLIA® automation system (S1 and N protein-based) in comparison to two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG (S1 protein-based) and Virotech SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (N protein-based)) and an in-house developed plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. When calculating the overall sensitivity, in a time frame of 49 days after first PCR-positivity, the PRNT as gold standard, showed the highest sensitivity with 93.3% followed by the dual-target assay for the VIRCLIA® automation system with 89%. The overall sensitivity in the group of N protein-based assays ranged from 66.7 to 77.8% and in the S protein-based-assays from 71.1 to 75.6%. Five follow-up samples of three individuals were only detected in either an S and/or N protein-based assay, indicating an individual different immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the influence of the used assay in the detection of IgG antibodies. This should be further analysed. The specificity of the examined assays was &#8805; 97%. However, because of the low or unknown prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, the examined assays in this study are currently primarily eligible for epidemiological investigations, as they have limited information in individual testing.","Kohmer, Niko; Westhaus, Sandra; Rühl, Cornelia; Ciesek, Sandra; Rabenau, Holger F",J Clin Virol,,377

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium is injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on days 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), (1 â 3)-ß-D-glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, 13 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA (&#8805; 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtually all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

432807,From Face-to-Face to FaceTime,2020,"Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses that are broadly classified into alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronavirus genera based on the viral genome. Coronavirus was not thought to be a significant problem in humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, but infections in animals, including pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry, have been problematic for a long time. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, drew special attention towards this virus once again. The intermediate host of this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is yet to be determined, but it has a very close genomic relationship with the bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV), RaTG13 strain, and the pangolin coronaviruses. As veterinary medicine has a long-term experience dealing with coronaviruses, this could be helpful in better understanding and detecting the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and drive human medicine towards the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs through the collaborative and transdisciplinary approaches of One Health.","Poudel, Uddab; Subedi, Deepak; Pantha, Saurav; Dhakal, Santosh",Open Vet.

433674,PRIMER: Shareholder Rights Directive II,2020,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the prime global health concern of the year 2020. Infecting more than 112 million individuals so far, this pandemic has already reported more than 2.4 million deaths around the world. With such high infectivity and mortality, effective treatment intervention is the need of the hour. The integration of medical science with nanotechnology may solve the current problem by exploring collective benefits. In this manuscript, we theoretically proposed the duo-combination of an approved antiviral i.e. favipiravir along with an immunomodulator i.e. tocilizumab loaded in protein-lipid nanovesicles as an effective anti-COVID-19 therapeutic. This proposed nanomedicine delivered through the respiratory mode may enhance the effectiveness of the antiviral and help in restricting the virus and associated complications, utilizing both anti-viral activity and immunomodulation in COVID-19 patients. This proposed nanomedicine could be an effective treatment modality for the severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients.","Thakur, Vikram; Ratho, Radha Kanta; Panda, Jiban Jyoti",Virusdisease,,377
433715,A Crucial Role for Antimicrobial Stewardship in the Midst of COVID-19,2021,"Nucleic acid vaccines are a method of immunization aiming to elicit immune responses akin to live attenuated vaccines. In this method, DNA or messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences are delivered to the body to generate proteins, which mimic disease antigens to stimulate the immune response. Advantages of nucleic acid vaccines include stimulation of both cell-mediated and humoral immunity, ease of design, rapid adaptability to changing pathogen strains, and customizable multiantigen vaccines. To combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and many other diseases, nucleic acid vaccines appear to be a promising method. However, aid is needed in delivering the fragile DNA/mRNA payload. Many delivery strategies have been developed to elicit effective immune stimulation, yet no nucleic acid vaccine has been FDA-approved for human use. Nanoparticles (NPs) are one of the top candidates to mediate successful DNA/mRNA vaccine delivery due to their unique properties, including unlimited possibilities for formulations, protective capacity, simultaneous loading, and delivery potential of multiple DNA/mRNA vaccines. This review will summarize the many varieties of novel NP formulations for DNA and mRNA vaccine delivery as well as give the reader a brief synopsis of NP vaccine clinical trials. Finally, the future perspectives and challenges for NP-mediated nucleic acid vaccines will be explored.","Ho, William; Gao, Mingzhu; Li, Fengqiao; Li, Zhongyu; Zhang, Xue-Qing; Xu, Xiaoyang",Adv Healthc Mater,,377

434657,"Useful funds, disappointing framework: tourism stakeholder experiences of INTERREG",2020,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) emerged in late 2019 in China and rapidly became pandemic. As with other coronaviruses, a preponderance of evidence suggests the virus originated in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) and may have infected an intermediate host prior to spillover into humans. A significant concern is that SARS-CoV-2 could become established in secondary reservoir hosts outside of Asia. To assess this potential, we challenged deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) with SARS-CoV-2 and found robust virus replication in the upper respiratory tract, lungs and intestines, with detectable viral RNA for up to 21 days in oral swabs and 6 days in lungs. Virus entry into the brain also occurred, likely via gustatory-olfactory-trigeminal pathway with eventual compromise to the blood-brain barrier. Despite this, no conspicuous signs of disease were observed, and no deer mice succumbed to infection. Expression of several innate immune response genes were elevated in the lungs, including IFN&#945;, IFNß, Cxcl10, Oas2, Tbk1 and Pycard. Elevated CD4 and CD8ß expression in the lungs was concomitant with Tbx21, IFNÎ³ and IL-21 expression, suggesting a type I inflammatory immune response. Contact transmission occurred from infected to naive deer mice through two passages, showing sustained natural transmission and localization into the olfactory bulb, recapitulating human neuropathology. In the second deer mouse passage, an insertion of 4 amino acids occurred to fixation in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein that is predicted to form a solvent-accessible loop. Subsequent examination of the source virus from BEI Resources determined the mutation was present at very low levels, demonstrating potent purifying selection for the insert during in vivo passage. Collectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease and neuropathogenesis, and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts in North America.","Fagre, Anna; Lewis, Juliette; Eckley, Miles; Zhan, Shijun; Rocha, Savannah M; Sexton, Nicole R; Burke, Bradly; Geiss, Brian; Peersen, Olve; Bass, Todd; Kading, Rebekah; Rovnak, Joel; Ebel, Gregory D; Tjalkens, Ronald B; Aboellail, Tawfik; Schountz, Tony",PLoS Pathog,,377

The imaging findings, clinical data, and laboratory data were evaluated.ResultsFifty of 51 patients (98%) had a history of contact with individuals from the endemic center in Wuhan, China. Fever (49 of 51, 96%) and cough (24 of 51, 47%) were the most common symptoms. Most patients had a normal white blood cell count (37 of 51, 73%), neutrophil count (44 of 51, 86%), and either normal (17 of 51, 35%) or reduced (33 of 51, 65%) lymphocyte count. CT images showed pure ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 39 of 51 (77%) patients and GGO with reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening in 38 of 51 (75%) patients. GGO with consolidation was present in 30 of 51 (59%) patients, and pure consolidation was present in 28 of 51 (55%) patients. Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral. There were more consolidated lung lesions in patients 5 days or more from disease onset to CT scan versus 4 days or fewer (431 of 712 lesions vs 129 of 612 lesions; P < .001). Patients older than 50 years had more consolidated lung lesions than did those aged 50 years or younger (212 of 470 vs 198 of 854; P < .001). Follow-up CT in 13 patients showed improvement in seven (54%) patients and progression in four (31%) patients.ConclusionPatients with fever and/or cough and with conspicuous ground-glass opacity lesions in the peripheral and posterior lungs on CT images, combined with normal or decreased white blood cells and a history of epidemic exposure, are highly suspected of having 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia.© RSNA, 2020.","Song, Fengxiang; Shi, Nannan; Shan, Fei; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shen, Jie; Lu, Hongzhou; Ling, Yun; Jiang, Yebin; Shi, Yuxin",Radiology,,377

The crystal symmetry is reduced from cubic at room temperature to tetragonal below 170 K and eventually to monoclinic below 122 K. These changes are tracked by the evolution of the non-cubic crystal-field splitting $\Delta$ measured by RIXS. Non-monotonic changes in $\Delta$ are ascribed to the competing effects of the tilt, rotation, and deformation of the IrBr$_6$ octahedra as well as tetragonal strain on the electronic levels of Ir$^{4+}$. The N\'eel temperature of $T_N=11.9$ K exceeds that of the isostructural K$_2$IrCl$_6$, and the magnitude of frustration on the fcc spin lattice decreases. We argue that the replacement of Cl by Br weakens electronic correlations and enhances magnetic couplings.","Khan, Nazir; Prishchenko, Danil; Upton, Mary H.; Mazurenko, Vladimir G.; Tsirlin, Alexander A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00206v1.pdf,377

It has impacted almost all countries in the world. The major source of COVID-19 is a novel beta coronavirus. COVID-19 had a great impact on world throughout the year 2020. Now, the situation is becoming normal due to the invention of the vaccine. All major countries started large vaccination drives. Mathematical models are used to study the impact of different measures used to decrease pandemics. Mathematical models such as susceptible-infected-removed model and susceptible-exposed-infected-removed are used to predict the spread of diseases. But these models are not suitable to predict COVID-19 spread due to various preventive measures (social distancing and quarantine) applied to reduce spread. Hence, in the present manuscript, a novel fractional mathematical model with a social distancing parameter has been proposed to provide early COVID-19 spread estimation. Fractional calculus provides flexibility in choosing arbitrary order of derivative which controls data sensitivity. The model has been validated with real data set. It has been observed that the proposed model is highly accurate in spread estimation.","Chandra, Saroj Kumar; Bajpai, Manish Kumar",Arab J Sci Eng,,377

With the global epidemic dynamics becoming more and more serious, the prediction and analysis of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 has become an important task. We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) for modeling of the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19. The confirmed cases and deaths data are collected from January 20 to November 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). By introducing root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (R), and mean absolute error (MAE), statistical indicators of the prediction model are verified and evaluated. The size of training and test confirmed cases and death base employed in the model is optimized. The best simulating performance with RMSE, R, and MAE is realized using the 7 past days' cases as input variables in the training and test dataset. And the estimated R are 0.9948 and 0.9683, respectively. Compared with different algorithms, experimental simulation shows that trainbr algorithm has better performance than other algorithms in reproducing the amount of the confirmed cases and deaths. This study shows that the ANN model is suitable for predicting the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 in the future. Using the ANN model, we also predict the confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from June 5, 2020 to November 11, 2020. During the predicting period, the R, RMSE, and MAE for new infected confirmed cases of COVID-19 are 0.9848, 17,554, and 12,229, respectively; the R, RMSE, and MAE for new confirmed deaths of COVID-19 are 0.8593, 631.8, and 463.7, respectively. The predicted confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 are very close to the actual confirmed cases and deaths. The results show that continuous and strict control measures should be taken to prevent the further spread of the epidemic.","Guo, Qingchun; He, Zhenfang",,,377

We aimed to understand migrant worker concerns and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic to address these during the crisis and inform on comprehensive support needed after the crisis. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with migrant workers diagnosed with COVID-19. The participants were recruited from a COVID-19 mass quarantine facility in Singapore through a purposive sampling approach. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis performed to derive themes in their collective experience during the crisis. RESULTS: Three theme categories were derived from 27 interviews: migrant worker concerns during COVID-19, coping during COVID-19 and priorities after COVID-19. Major stressors in the crisis included the inability to continue providing for their families when work is disrupted, their susceptibility to infection in crowded dormitories, the shock of receiving the COVID-19 diagnosis while asymptomatic, as well as the isolating conditions of the quarantine environment. The workers coped by keeping in contact with their families, accessing healthcare, keeping updated with the news and continuing to practise their faith and religion. They looked forward to a return to normalcy after the crisis with keeping healthy and having access to healthcare as new priorities. CONCLUSION: We identified coping strategies employed by the workers in quarantine, many of which were made possible through the considered design of care and service delivery in mass quarantine facilities in Singapore. These can be adopted in the set-up of other mass quarantine facilities around the world to support the health and mental well-being of those quarantined. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted policy intervention for migrant workers, in areas such as housing and working environments, equitable access to healthcare, and social protection during and after this crisis.","Yee, Kaisin; Peh, Hui Peng; Tan, Yee Pin; Teo, Irene; Tan, Emily U Tong; Paul, Justin; Rangabashyam, Mahalakshmi; Ramalingam, Mothi Babu; Chow, Weien; Tan, Hiang Khoon",BMJ Open,,377

451957,International student mobilities in a contagion: (Im)mobilising higher education?,2021,"We describe the optimisation of a simplified sample preparation method which permits rapid and direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA within saliva, using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Treatment of saliva samples prior to RT-LAMP by dilution 1:1 in Mucolyse&#8482;, followed by dilution in 10 % (w/v) Chelex© 100 Resin and a 98â¯°C heat step for 2â¯min enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in positive saliva samples. Using RT-LAMP, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in as little as 05:43â¯min, with no amplification detected in 3097 real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) negative saliva samples from staff tested within a service evaluation study, or for other respiratory pathogens tested (nâ¯=â¯22). Saliva samples can be collected non-invasively, without the need for skilled staff and can be obtained from both healthcare and home settings. Critically, this approach overcomes the requirement for, and validation of, different swabs and the global bottleneck in obtaining access to extraction robots and reagents to enable molecular testing by rRT-PCR. Such testing opens the possibility of public health approaches for effective intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic through regular SARS-CoV-2 testing at a population scale, combined with isolation and contact tracing.","Howson, Emma L A; Kidd, Stephen P; Armson, Bryony; Goring, Alice; Sawyer, Jason; Cassar, Claire; Cross, David; Lewis, Tom; Hockey, Jess; Rivers, Samantha; Cawthraw, Saira; Banyard, Ashley; Anderson, Paul; Rahou, Sabah; Andreou, Michael; Morant, Nick; Clark, Duncan; Walsh, Charlotte; Laxman, Shailen; Houghton, Rebecca; Slater-Jefferies, Joanne; Costello, Paula; Brown, Ian; Cortes, Nicholas; Godfrey, Keith M; Fowler, Veronica L",J Virol Methods,,377
451958,International student mobilities in a contagion: (Im)mobilising higher education?,2021,"BACKGROUND: In a global pandemic, digital technology offers innovative methods to disseminate public health messages. As an example, the messenger app WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). During a time when rumors and excessive news threaten psychological well-being, these services allow for rapid transmission of information and may boost resilience. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to accomplish the following: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic; (2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress; and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk. METHODS: Across 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak (March 7 to April 21, 2020), we conducted a survey of 1145 adults in Singapore. As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to the following: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics. RESULTS: Within the sample, 7.9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Depression scores were associated with increased time spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b=-0.07, t[863]=-2.04, P=.04). Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumors, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b=-0.05, t[863]=-2.13, P=.03). Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the amount of time spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium for disseminating pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly. In turn, this use may promote public well-being amid an ""infodemic.""

452149,Multidexterity—A New Metaphor for Open Innovation,2021,"The COVID-19 pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, requires its main protease (SC2MPro ) to digest two of its translated long polypeptides to form a number of mature proteins that are essential for viral replication and pathogenesis. Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replicating in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1MPro ), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2MPro inhibitors that contain ß-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2MPro active-site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with Ki values at or below 100â nM. The most potent compound, MPI3, has as a Ki value of 8.3â nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2MPro bound to seven inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and A549/ACE2 cells. Two inhibitors, MPI5 and MPI8, completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5â µM and A549/ACE2 cells at 0.16-0.31â µM. Their virus inhibition potency is much higher than that of some existing molecules that are under preclinical and clinical investigations for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study indicates that there is a large chemical space that needs to be explored for the development of SC2MPro inhibitors with ultra-high antiviral potency.","Yang, Kai S; Ma, Xinyu R; Ma, Yuying; Alugubelli, Yugendar R; Scott, Danielle A; Vatansever, Erol C; Drelich, Aleksandra K; Sankaran, Banumathi; Geng, Zhi Z; Blankenship, Lauren R; Ward, Hannah E; Sheng, Yan J; Hsu, Jason C; Kratch, Kaci C; Zhao, Baoyu; Hayatshahi, Hamed S; Liu, Jin; Li, Pingwei; Fierke, Carol A; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Xu, Shiqing; Liu, Wenshe Ray",ChemMedChem (Internet),,377

Here the degradation performance of different types of BPs was investigated in the natural environment. Their degradation levels followed the order of pure BPs> BP blends> claimed ""BP""&#8776; non-biodegradable plastic after 6-month incubation. Photo- and biodegradation were the main degradation mechanisms of these plastics in the air and soil, respectively. Poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) exhibited the highest weight loss potentials in both air (54.7 ± 9.1%) and soil (56.8 ± 4.8%), due to its special ether bond and the rich and diverse microorganisms on its biofilms. The microbiota on PPDO was distinct and enriched with Chloroflexi and Firmicutes that responsible for carbon cycle and organic degradation. The weight loss was only 1.1-8.0% for poly(lactic acid), and 0.8-6.8% for poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), and other plastics are basically non-degradable. Of note, numerous microplastics were formed after PPDO degradation, with 441 ± 326 and 2103 ± 131 item/g plastic in the air and soil, respectively. Taken together, the monitoring of BP biodegradation in the natural environment is of vital importance, and it is risky to promote large-scale application of BPs if the knowledge gap of their environmental behavior has not been well addressed.","Liao, Jin; Chen, Qiqing",J Hazard Mater,,377
453747,An Adaptive Learning Mode of “Public Psychology” Based on Creative Thinking with Virtual Simulation Technology,2020,"The surge of patients in the pandemic of COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may overwhelm the medical systems of many countries. Mask-wearing and handwashing can slow the spread of the virus, but currently, masks are in shortage in many countries, and timely handwashing is often impossible. In this study, the efficacy of three types of masks and instant hand wiping was evaluated using the avian influenza virus to mock the coronavirus. Virus quantification was performed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Previous studies on mask-wearing were reviewed. The results showed that instant hand wiping using a wet towel soaked in water containing 1.00% soap powder, 0.05% active chlorine, or 0.25% active chlorine from sodium hypochlorite removed 98.36%, 96.62%, and 99.98% of the virus from hands, respectively. N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of four-layer kitchen paper and one-layer cloth could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols. Medical mask-wearing which was supported by many studies was opposed by other studies possibly due to erroneous judgment. With these data, we propose the approach of mask-wearing plus instant hand hygiene (MIH) to slow the exponential spread of the virus. This MIH approach has been supported by the experiences of seven countries in fighting against COVID-19. Collectively, a simple approach to slow the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2 was proposed with the support of experiments, literature review, and control experiences.","Ma, Qing-Xia; Shan, Hu; Zhang, Hong-Liang; Li, Gui-Mei; Yang, Rui-Mei; Chen, Ji-Ming",J. med. virol,,377

Methods: Using prospectively collected data, we compared characteristics of RRT calls at our academic hospital from March 7 through May 31, 2020 (COVID-19 era) versus those from January 1 through March 6, 2020 (pre-COVID-19 era). We used negative binomial regression to test differences in RRT activation rates normalized to floor (non-ICU) inpatient census between pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 eras, including the sub-era of rapid COVID-19 census surge and plateau (March 28 through May 2, 2020). Results: RRT activations for respiratory distress rose substantially during the rapid COVID-19 surge and plateau (2.38 (95% CI 1.39-3.36) activations per 1000 floor patient-days v. 1.27 (0.82-1.71) during the pre-COVID-19 era; p = 0.02); all-cause RRT rates were not significantly different (5.40 (95% CI 3.94-6.85) v. 4.83 (3.86-5.80) activations per 1000 floor patient-days, respectively; p = 0.52). Throughout the COVID-19 era, respiratory distress accounted for a higher percentage of RRT activations in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients (57% vs. 28%, respectively; p = 0.001). During the surge, we adapted RRT guidelines to reduce in-room personnel and standardize personal protective equipment based on COVID-19 status and risk to providers, created decision-support pathways for respiratory emergencies that accounted for COVID-19 status uncertainty, and expanded critical care consultative support to floor teams. Conclusion: Increased frequency and complexity of RRT activations for respiratory distress during the COVID-19 surge prompted the creation of clinical tools and strategies that could be applied to other hospitals.","Mitchell, Oscar J L; Neefe, Stacie; Ginestra, Jennifer C; Baston, Cameron M; Frazer, Michael J; Gudowski, Steven; Min, Jeff; Ahmed, Nahreen H; Pascual, Jose L; Schweickert, William D; Anderson, Brian J; Anesi, George L; Falk, Scott A; Shashaty, Michael G S",Resusc Plus,,377

Hence, we compared anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in non-severe COVID-19 patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Records of non-severe COVID-19 patients admitted at our institution between April 10, 2020 and May 20, 2020 were retrieved. Qualitative detection of total (IgG + IgM) anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was performed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay in plasma samples collected at least 14 days post-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmation of diagnosis. RESULTS: Thirty-one non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. Nine patients (29%) had T2DM with mean HbA1c at admission of 8.3 ± 1.0%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was estimated at a median of 16 (14-17) days post-PCR confirmation of COVID-19 diagnosis. Only three patients (10%) were seronegative, and all had T2DM. Patients with T2DM were more likely to have non-detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies than those without DM (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with T2DM may not undergo seroconversion even after two weeks of diagnosis. Impaired seroconversion could theoretically increase the risk of reinfections in patients with DM. However, the finding requires validation in large-scale studies involving serial estimations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with and without DM.","Pal, Rimesh; Sachdeva, Naresh; Mukherjee, Soham; Suri, Vikas; Zohmangaihi, Deepy; Ram, Sant; Puri, Goverdhan Dutt; Bhalla, Ashish; Soni, Shiv Lal; Pandey, Navin; Bhansali, Anil; Bhadada, Sanjay Kumar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,377

Efforts to determine why these viral variants have improved fitness are limited to mutations in the viral spike (S) protein and viral entry steps using non-SARS-CoV-2 viral particles engineered to display S. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles can package and deliver exogenous transcripts, enabling analysis of mutations within all structural proteins and rapid dissection of multiple steps in the viral life cycle. Identification of an RNA packaging sequence was critical for engineered transcripts to assemble together with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins S, nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) into non-replicative SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles (SC2-VLPs) that deliver these transcripts to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-expressing cells. Using SC2-VLPs, we tested the effect of 30 individual mutations within the S and N proteins on particle assembly and entry. While S mutations unexpectedly did not affect these steps, SC2-VLPs bearing any one of four N mutations found universally in more-transmissible viral variants (P199L, S202R, R203M and R203K) showed increased particle production and up to 10-fold more reporter transcript expression in receiver cells.

High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are consistent with the formation of cobalt vacancies at tetrahedral sites and an increase in the lattice parameter of Co3O4 after the laser treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) further reveal increased disorder in the structure and a slight decrease in the average oxidation state of the cobalt oxide. Molecular dynamics simulation confirms the surface restructuring upon laser post-treatment on Co3O4. Importantly, the defect-induced PLPP was shown to lower the charge transfer resistance and boost the oxygen evolution activity of Co3O4. For the optimized sample, a 2-fold increment of current density at 1.7 V vs RHE is obtained and the overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 decreases remarkably from 405 to 357 mV compared to pristine Co3O4.

We aimed to describe the main characteristics and identify the early predictors for severe outcomes among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Spain. This was an observational, retrospective cohort study (BIOCOVID-Spain study) including COVID-19 patients admitted to 32 Spanish hospitals. Demographics, comorbidities and laboratory tests were collected. Outcome was in-hospital mortality. For analysis, laboratory tests values were previously adjusted to assure the comparability of results among participants. Cox regression was performed to identify predictors. Study population included 2873 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Nine variables were independent predictors for in-hospital mortality, including creatinine (Hazard ratio [HR]:1.327; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.040-1.695, p = .023), troponin (HR: 2.150; 95% CI: 1.155-4.001; p = .016), platelet count (HR: 0.994; 95% CI: 0.989-0.998; p = .004) and C-reactive protein (HR: 1.037; 95% CI: 1.006-1.068; p = .019). This is the first multicenter study in which an effort was carried out to adjust the results of laboratory tests measured with different methodologies to guarantee their comparability. We reported a comprehensive information about characteristics in a large cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, focusing on the analytical features.

481626,"What about the lonely? Bridging loneliness, pandemics, and I-O psychology",2021,"BACKGROUND: Psychological responses to potentially traumatic events tend to be heterogeneous, with some individuals displaying resilience. Longitudinal associations between resilience and mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between resilience and trajectories of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 6,008 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet-panel representative of the US adult population. Baseline data were collected between March 10 and March 31, 2020, with nine follow-up waves conducted between April 1 and August 4. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to examine the association between date and mental distress, stratified by resilience level (low, normal, or high). RESULTS: In contrast to the high resilience group, participants in the low and normal resilience groups experienced increases in mental distress in the early months of the pandemic (low: OR=2.94, 95% CI=1.93-4.46; normal: OR=1.91, 95% CI=1.55-2.35). Men, middle-aged and older adults, Black adults, and adults with a graduate degree were more likely to report high resilience, whereas adults living below the poverty line were less likely to report high resilience. LIMITATIONS: These associations should not be interpreted as causal, and resilience was measured at only one time-point. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of mental distress varied markedly by resilience level during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low-resilience adults reporting the largest increases in mental distress during this crisis. Activities that foster resilience should be included in broader strategies to support mental health throughout the pandemic.","Riehm, Kira E; Brenneke, Savannah G; Adams, Leslie B; Gilan, Donya; Lieb, Klaus; Kunzler, Angela M; Smail, Emily J; Holingue, Calliope; Stuart, Elizabeth A; Kalb, Luther G; Thrul, Johannes",J Affect Disord,,377

A planned breast reduction surgery was deemed adequate postlumpectomy therapy to prevent cancer recurrence, negating the need for chemotherapy or radiation therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which cosmetic breast reduction surgery will be used as postlumpectomy cancer recurrence risk mitigation for primary leiomyosarcoma of the breast. Patients with this malignancy have a relatively poor prognosis compared with other breast cancer types, with a 5-year disease-free survival of 33%-52%.

(Special Issue: Annual global trends: has tourism the resources and answers to a more inclusive society?)",2021,"Reports of new-onset diabetes and diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with COVID-19 have led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is directly cytotoxic to pancreatic islet ß cells. This would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host ß cells via cell surface co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the putative receptor and effector protease, respectively. To define ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the human pancreas, we examined six transcriptional datasets from primary human islet cells and assessed protein expression by immunofluorescence in pancreata from donors with and without diabetes. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts were low or undetectable in pancreatic islet endocrine cells as determined by bulk or single cell RNA sequencing, and neither protein was detected in &#945; or ß cells from these donors. Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in the islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and also found in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. The absence of significant ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression in islet endocrine cells reduces the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects pancreatic islet ß cells through these cell entry proteins.","Coate, Katie C; Cha, Jeeyeon; Shrestha, Shristi; Wang, Wenliang; Gonçalves, Luciana Mateus; Almaça, Joana; Kapp, Meghan E; Fasolino, Maria; Morgan, Ashleigh; Dai, Chunhua; Saunders, Diane C; Bottino, Rita; Aramandla, Radhika; Jenkins, Regina; Stein, Roland; Kaestner, Klaus H; Vahedi, Golnaz; Consortium, Hpap; Brissova, Marcela; Powers, Alvin C",,,377
481694,Covid-19 “tourism in flight mode”: a lost opportunity to rethink tourism – towards a more sustainable and inclusive society,2020,"The Rio Grande Valley of Texas has an exceptionally high number of COVID-19 cases and case fatality rate. The region makes up only 3% of the Texas population but, as of April 2021, accounted for 9% of the state's COVID-19 deaths. Additionally, during the summer of 2020, the Rio Grande Valley had one of the highest per capita infection rates in the United States. This paper explores the social-ecological elements that impact health-seeking behaviors in this community using interviews conducted with healthcare personnel and nonprofit leaders in the Rio Grande Valley between 2019 and 2020. Using this data, we found that anti-immigrant rhetoric has increased levels of fear among immigrants and mixed-status families, which has made them less willing to access healthcare. Additionally, we found that changes in the public charge rule has led to a decreasing number of children accessing government-provided health insurance. Our findings suggest that these outcomes likely contributed to the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak in the Rio Grande Valley.","Blackburn, C. C.; Sierra, L. A.",Health Security,,377

We evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) received endovascular treatment (EVT) in our institution. METHODS: AIS patients with LVO who underwent EVT in the period of January 1st to April 30th between 2015 and 2020 from our stroke center. The baseline characteristics, working flow time, safety and efficacy outcome and the hospitalization status were retrospectively reviewed, compared and analyzed. RESULTS: There is significant decline in the number of AIS patients with LVO treated compared with the previous year (36 Vs 72 patients) during the epidemic period. The door to puncture time was significantly prolong (225 minutes versus 115 minutes) as well as the length of hospital stay with increase of the hospitalization costs (P < 0.05 for all). There is no significant difference on the safety and efficacy outcome, such recanalization rate, incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, functional independence and mortality during the epidemic (P > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Prolongation of the working time flow during the COVID-19 epidemic did not influence the safety and efficacy of EVT in AIS patients with LVO. However, special policy and particular measures in this circumstances is still need to evolve to improve the treatment quality.","Huo, Xiaochuan; Sun, Xuan; Mo, Dapeng; Gao, Feng; Ma, Ning; Wang, Yilong; Wang, Yongjun; Miao, Zhongrong",Interv Neuroradiol,,377

METHODS: Simulated closed-loop extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits (1/4 and 3/8 inch) were prepared with a Quadrox-i pediatric and Quadrox-i adult oxygenator and blood primed. In addition, 1/4- and 3/8-inch circuits were also prepared without an oxygenator in series. A one-time dose of voriconazole was administered into the circuits, and serial pre- and post-oxygenator concentrations were obtained at 5 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 24 hour time points. Voriconazole was also maintained in a glass vial and samples were taken from the vial at the same time periods for control purposes to assess for spontaneous drug degradation. RESULTS: For the 1/4-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 64-67% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and mean of 15-20% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. For the 3/8-inch circuit, there was an approximate mean of 44-51% voriconazole loss with the oxygenator in series and a mean of 8-12% voriconazole loss without an oxygenator in series at 24 hours. The reference voriconazole concentrations remained relatively constant during the entire study period demonstrating that the drug loss in each size of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with or without an oxygenator was not a result of spontaneous drug degradation. CONCLUSION: This ex vivo investigation demonstrated substantial voriconazole loss within an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit with an oxygenator in series with both sizes of the Quadrox-i oxygenator at 24 hours and no significant voriconazole loss in the absence of an oxygenator. Further evaluations with multiple dose in vitro and in vivo investigations are needed before specific voriconazole dosing recommendations can be made for clinical application with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Cies, Jeffrey J; Moore, Wayne S; Giliam, Nadji; Low, Tracy; Marino, Daniel; Deacon, Jillian; Enache, Adela; Chopra, Arun",Perfusion,,377

Methods: Our online survey included 1591 participants from 31 provinces of China with 87% urban and 13% rural residents. We performed multiple linear regressions and path analysis to examine the relationship between rural status and behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, information appraisal, knowledge, variety of information source use, and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. Findings: Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to perform preventive behaviors, more likely to hold a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of performing preventive behaviors, and more likely to have lower levels of information appraisal skills. We identified information appraisal as a significant factor that might contribute to the rural/urban differences in preventive behaviors against COVID-19 through attitude, subjective norms, and intention. We found no rural/urban differences in behavioral intention, subjective norms, knowledge about preventive behaviors, or the variety of interpersonal/media source use. Conclusions: As the first wave of the pandemic inundated urban areas, the current media coverage about COVID-19 prevention may not fully satisfy the specific needs of rural populations. Thus, rural residents were less likely to engage in a thoughtful process of information appraisal and adopt the appropriate preventive measures. Tailoring health messages to meet rural populations' unique needs can be an effective strategy to promote preventive health behaviors against COVID-19.","Chen, Xuewei; Chen, Hongliang",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,377

We estimated the proportion and number of adults (&#8805; 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age &#8805; 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.","Rezende, Leandro F M; Thome, Beatriz; Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral; Souza-Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann",Rev Saude Publica,,377

Saturation genome editing (SGE) was recently reported as an innovative laboratory-based approach to assess the pathogenicity of BRCA1 variants. We combined clinical phenotypes and SGE score to identify the pathogenicity of BRCA1 VUSs detected in a cohort of 8,085 breast cancer patients. According to SGE function score, 33 out of 144 BRCA1 VUSs detected were classified into ""loss of function"" (n = 13), ""intermediate"" (n = 2), and ""functional"" (n = 18) groups. Compared with non-carriers, ""loss of function"" VUS carriers (n = 19) presented significantly worse clinicopathological characteristics. These included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis (44.4 years vs. 51.2 years, P = 0.01), stronger family history of any cancer (57.9% vs. 32.3%, P = 0.017) especially breast or ovarian cancer (47.4% vs. 9.3%, P < 0.001), more bilateral breast cancer (31.6% vs. 3.4%, P < 0.001), and triple-negative breast cancer (47.4% vs. 12.8%, P < 0.001), which were comparable to those of pathogenic variant carriers. In contrast, the clinical phenotypes of ""functional"" VUS carriers were similar to those of non-carriers. These results indicated that SGE was a reliable method in BRCA1 variant classification. Combining SGE function score and the available evidence, twelve out of 33 BRCA1 VUSs were reclassified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and one was benign.","Wan, Qiting; Hu, Li; Ouyang, Tao; Li, Jinfeng; Wang, Tianfeng; Fan, Zhaoqing; Fan, Tie; Lin, Benyao; Xu, Ye; Xie, Yuntao",Fam. cancer,,377
505679,National Disaster and Marine Tourism,2020,"INTRODUCTION: With over 500 000 infections and nearly 12 000 deaths, South Africa (SA) is the African epicenter of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence. METHOD: During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com. The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence. RESULTS: There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907(95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847). CONCLUSION: Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence.","Majam, Mohammed; Fischer, Alex; Phiri, Jane; Venter, Francois; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",PLoS One,,377

Polymerase chain reaction and serological testing platforms are not the only actors impacted by the crisis, transfusion services are facing important difficulties. A positive direct antiglobulin test is frequently observed for patients encountering COVID-19. Patients with severe symptoms may develop anaemia and become good candidates for blood transfusions. The interpretation of a positive direct antiglobulin test for patients recently transfused and suffering from COVID-19 is complex. The differentiation between COVID-19 induced antibodies and possible associated transfusion alloantibodies is therefore crucial. In this context, the elution technique incorporated in an appropriate decision-making process plays its full role. This intricate topic is presented through a case report followed by literature review and finally decision-making process for COVID-19 patients necessitating red blood cells administration.","Cabo, J; Brochier, A; Saussoy, P; van Dievoet, M-A; Capirchio, L; Delire, B; Deneys, V",Transfus. clin. biol,,377

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited MS patients, low-risk (university staff from non-clinical departments), and high-risk individuals (healthcare staff from COVID-19 wards) from 11 May to 15 June 2020. We used lateral flow immunoassay to detect SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM. We used t-test, Fisher's exact test, chi square test, or McNemar's test, as appropriate, to evaluate between-group differences. RESULTS: We recruited 310 MS patients (42.3 ± 12.4 years; females 67.1%), 862 low-risk individuals (42.9 ± 13.3 years; females 47.8%), and 235 high-risk individuals (39.4 ± 10.9 years; females 54.5%). The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM in MS patients (n = 9, 2.9%) was significantly lower than in the high-risk population (n = 25, 10.6%) (p < 0.001), and similar to the low-risk population (n = 11, 1.3%) (p = 0.057); these results were also confirmed after random matching by age and sex (1:1:1). No significant differences were found in demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory features. Among MS patients positive to SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM (n = 9), only two patients retrospectively reported mild and short-lasting COVID-19 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: MS patients have similar risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to the general population, and can be asymptomatic from COVID-19, also if using treatments with systemic immunosuppression.","Capasso, Nicola; Palladino, Raffaele; Montella, Emma; Pennino, Francesca; Lanzillo, Roberta; Carotenuto, Antonio; Petracca, Maria; Iodice, Rosa; Iovino, Aniello; Aruta, Francesco; Pastore, Viviana; Buonomo, Antonio Riccardo; Zappulo, Emanuela; Gentile, Ivan; Triassi, Maria; Brescia Morra, Vincenzo; Moccia, Marcello",,,377

508491,"Piety, authority and ""popular ijtihad"" in the online space of russian muslims during the pandemic",2021,": ACE2 receptor has a broad expression pattern in the cellular membrane and provides a protective action against the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, this enzyme has become of extreme interest during the pandemic infection of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). This virus invades alveolar epithelium and cardiomyocytes using ACE2 as a transmembrane receptor. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory peptide that degrades Ang II into Ang 1-7, thereby attenuating the biological effects of the AT1 receptor. The binding between the spike protein of COVID-19 and the enzyme is crucial for the virus to enter the target cells, but whether an increase in ACE2 activity could facilitate the infection is not yet demonstrated. However, this aspect has raised many concerns about the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in infected patients or patients at risk of infection. It appears that cellular infection leads to a reduction in ACE2 expression and an increase in the activity of the Ang II--AT1 axis, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ARDS, myocarditis, and hypercoagulability with the possibility of exacerbation of acute coronary syndrome, induction of pulmonary embolism, or appearance of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Therefore, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker drugs should be continued in infected patients, as their discontinuation can increase Ang II activity and induce injury to the lungs or cardiovascular system.","Barillà, Francesco; Bassareo, Pier Paolo; Calcaterra, Giuseppe; Romeo, Francesco; Mehta, Jawahar L",J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),,377
508492,"Piety, authority and ""popular ijtihad"" in the online space of russian muslims during the pandemic",2021,"The purpose of this paper is to extend to ordinal and nominal outcomes the measures of degree of necessity and of sufficiency defined by the authors for dichotomous and survival outcomes in a previous paper. A cause, represented by certain values of prognostic factors, is considered necessary for an event if, without the cause, the event cannot develop. It is considered sufficient for an event if the event is unavoidable in the presence of the cause. The degrees of necessity and sufficiency, ranging from zero to one, are simple, intuitive functions of unconditional and conditional probabilities of an event such as disease or death. These probabilities often will be derived from logistic regression models; the measures, however, do not require any particular model. In addition, we study in detail the relationship between the proposed measures and the related explained variation summary for dichotomous outcomes, which are the common root for the developments for ordinal, nominal, and survival outcomes. We introduce and analyze the Austrian covid-19 data, with the aim of quantifying effects of age and other potentially prognostic factors on covid-19 mortality. This is achieved by standard regression methods but also in terms of the newly proposed measures. It is shown how they complement the toolbox of prognostic factor studies, in particular when comparing the importance of prognostic factors of different types. While the full model's degree of necessity is extremely high (0.933), its low degree of sufficiency (0.179) is responsible for the low proportion of explained variation (0.193).","Gleiss, Andreas; Henderson, Robin; Schemper, Michael",Stat. med,,377

However, the exact role of Levamisole effect in clinical status of COVID-19 patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Levamisole on clinical status of patients with COVID-19 during their course of the disease. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial was performed in adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (room-air oxygen saturation > 94%) from late April 2020 to mid-August 2020. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 3-day course of Levamisole or placebo in combination with routine standard of care. RESULTS: With 25 patients in each arm, 50 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Most of the study participants were men (60%). On days 3 and 14, patients in Levamisole group had significantly better cough status distribution when compared to the placebo group (P-value = 0.034 and 0.005, respectively). Moreover, there was significant differences between the two groups in dyspnea at follow-up intervals of 7 (P-value = 0.015) and 14 (P-value = 0.010) days after receiving the interventions. However, no significant difference in fever status was observed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 in both groups (P-value > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that Levamisole may improve most of clinical status of patients with COVID-19. The patients receiving Levamisole had significantly better chance of clinical status including cough and dyspnea on day 14 when compared to the placebo.

In every case, the N-methylporphyrinoids exhibited weaker, bathochromically shifted UV-Vis absorptions compared to their core unsubstituted congeners. However, proton NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that these derivatives retained strong diamagnetic ring currents and the presence of the internal alkyl substituents had little effect on the global aromatic characteristics. Nevertheless, the UV-Vis spectra of N-methyl-oxybenzi- and N-methyl-oxypyriporphyrins were dramatically altered and gave greatly weakened absorptions. N-Methyl-oxybenzi- and N-methyltropiporphyrins reacted with palladium(II) acetate to give stable palladium(II) complexes, demonstrating that N-alkylation alters the metalation properties for these carbaporphyrinoids. The organometallic derivatives also retained strongly aromatic properties, and the proton NMR spectra showed the N-methyl resonances near -3 ppm. N-Methylcarbaporphyrin-2-carbaldehyde also gave a palladium(II) complex, but this gradually rearranged at higher temperatures to afford a C-methyl complex. The results demonstrate that core alkylation of porphyrinoids greatly alters the reactivity and spectroscopic properties for these systems.","Latham, Alissa N; Lash, Timothy D",J. org. chem,,377

Treatment of early stage low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer was deferred according to 49% (91/187) of respondents, with hormonal treatment as the option of therapy (31%; 56/178). A total of 77% (136/177) of respondents reported no changes in (surgical) treatment for early stage cervical cancer in COVID-19-negative patients, while treatment was postponed by 54% (96/177) of respondent, if the patient tested COVID-19-positive. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancers was considered by over one-third of respondents as well as hypofractionation of radiation treatment for locally advanced cervical cancers. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 affected the treatment of gynecologic cancers patients, both in terms of prioritization and identification of strategies to reduce hospital access and length of stay.

592095,Moral Suasion and the Private Provision of Public Goods: Evidence from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND: As mental illness continues to affect 1 in 5 individuals, and the need for support has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of digital mental health tools remains largely unrealized due to a lack of uptake by patients and providers. Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.","Strudwick, Gillian; McLay, David; Lo, Brian; Shin, Hwayeon Danielle; Currie, Leanne; Thomson, Nicole; Maillet, Éric; Strong, Vanessa; Miller, Alanna; Shen, Nelson; Campbell, Janis",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33885374/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25773,377

However, the shift caused several academic and social concerns for students, such as lack of academic support, lack of adequate resources to support online teaching, lack of socialization, stress, anxiety, and lack of motivation in attending classes. This research evaluates the impact of HEIs support, faculty support, and resources available on the academic and social concerns of students in HEIs during the pandemic. 11,114 students across the HEIs in Sultanate of Oman participated in an online national survey. Regression and factor analysis were used to verify the research model developed based on the literature review. Results showed that HEI support and faculty support significantly affect university students' academic and social concerns. Furthermore, resource availability was found to affect the academic concerns of students but not their social concerns. This research recommends strategies for HEIs and faculty to promote faculty-student interaction using both synchronous and asynchronous modes to reduce student concerns and motivate them to engage in online classes.","Al-Maskari, Azzah; Al-Riyami, Thurayya; Kunjumuhammed, Siraj K.",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10592-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34226817/,377

The precise mechanisms driving these sex differences in immunity are unknown. To investigate possible genetic factors, we quantify escape from X chromosome inactivation (XCI) for TLR7 and four other genes (RPS6KA3, CYBB, BTK, and IL13RA1) at the single plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) level. We observe escape from XCI for all investigated genes, leading to biallelic expression patterns. pDCs with biallelic gene expression have significantly higher mRNA levels of the respective genes. Unstimulated pDCs with biallelic TLR7 expression exhibit significantly higher IFNα/β mRNA levels, and IFNα exposure results in significantly increased IFNα/β protein production by pDCs. These results identify unanticipated heterogeneity in escape from XCI of several genes in pDCs and highlight the important contribution of X chromosome factors to sex differences in type I IFN responses, which might explain observed sex differences in human diseases.","Hagen, Sven Hendrik; Henseling, Florian; Hennesen, Jana; Savel, Hélène; Delahaye, Solenne; Richert, Laura; Ziegler, Susanne Maria; Altfeld, Marcus",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720314741; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720314741; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296655/,377

Novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets are still needed to differentiate between the cold and the flu, since the clinical course of influenza can be severe while that of rhinovirus is usually more mild. In our investigation of influenza and rhinovirus infection of human respiratory epithelial cells, we used a systems approach to identify the temporally changing patterns of host gene expression from these viruses. After infection of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) with rhinovirus, influenza virus or co-infection with both viruses, we studied the time-course of host gene expression changes over three days. We modeled host responses to these viral infections with time and documented the qualitative and quantitative differences in innate immune activation and regulation.","Kim, Taek-Kyun; Bheda-Malge, Anjali; Lin, Yakang; Sreekrishna, Koti; Adams, Rachel; Robinson, Michael K.; Bascom, Charles C.; Tiesman, Jay P.; Isfort, Robert J.; Gelinas, Richard",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26437235/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682215003608; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682215003608; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.08.014,377

METHODS: 1030 COVID-19 patients were retrospective collected, with baseline data on demographics, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and VTE risk assessment models (RAMs) including Padua Prediction Score (PPS), International Medical Prevention Registry (IMPROVE) and Caprini RAM. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality increased progressively from 2% in patients at low risk of VTE to 63% in those at high risk defined by PPS. Similar findings were also observed by IMPROVE and Caprini score. Progressive increases in VTE risk also were associated with higher SOFA score. The presence of high risk of VTE was independently associated with mortality regardless of adjusted gender, smoking status and some comorbidities with hazard ratios of 29.19, 37.37, 20.60 for PPS, IMPROVE and Caprini RAM, respectively (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Predictive accuracy of PPS (Area Under Curve, AUC, 0.900), IMPROVE (AUC, 0.917) or Caprini RAM (AUC, 0.861) as the risk of mortality was markedly well. CONCLUSIONS: We firstly investigate that the presence of high risk of VTE identifies a group of COVID-19 patients at higher risk for mortality.

597483,"Pedagogy, Partnership, and Collaboration: A Longitudinal, Empirical Study of Serious Educational Gameplay in Secondary Biology Classrooms",2021-01-04,"Mushroom irradiation has been considered a sustainable process to generate high amounts of vitamin D(2) due to the role of this vitamin for human health and of the global concerns regarding its deficient or inadequate intake. Mushrooms are also receiving increasing interest due to their nutritional and medicinal properties. However, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the effect of UV irradiation on mushroom bioactive compounds. In this study, two of the most cultivated mushroom species worldwide, Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus ostreatus, were irradiated with UV-B, and the effect of processing was investigated on the contents of vitamin D(2) as well as on antioxidant and antiglycation activities. UV irradiation increased vitamin D(2) up to 57 µg/g d.w, which is an adequate level for the fortification of a number of target foods. UV irradiation decreased the antioxidant activity when measured by the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6 trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical assay and the ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power assay, but did not decrease the mushroom’s ability to inhibit glycation of a target protein. These results open up a new area of investigation aimed at selecting mushroom species with high nutraceutical benefits for irradiation in order to maintain their potential properties to inhibit oxidative and glycation processes responsible for human diseases.","Gallotti, Francesca; Lavelli, Vera",Foods,https://doi.org/10.3390/foods9081087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784944/,377

The Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), the Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society (WAHRS), and the British Columbia Association People on Opiate Maintenance (BCAPOM) are truly concerned about the increasing overdose deaths that have continued since 2016 and have been exacerbated by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COVID-19) despite many unique and timely harm reduction announcements by the British Columbia (B.C.) government. Some of these unique interventions in B.C., although in many cases only mere announcements with limited scope, are based on the philosophy of safe supply to illegal street drugs. Despite all the efforts during the pandemic, overdose deaths have spiked by over 100% compared to the previous year. Therefore, we urge the Canadian federal government, specifically the Honorable Patty Hajdu, the federal Minister of Health, to decriminalize simple possession immediately by granting exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

601127,The influence of COVID-19 preventive measures on the air quality in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates),2021-04-04,"Although influenza A and B viruses are primarily known as respiratory viruses and mainly infected only the upper respiratory tract in humans, patients with influenza often develop signs and symptoms that are not due to the respiratory system. Frequently individuals with influenza develop headaches, meningismus, and even seizures in addition to their typical respiratory symptoms. In the past decades, influenza viruses have also been associated with serious non-respiratory signs. The famous 1918 strain of influenza was associated with von Economo's encephalitis lethargica and postencephalitic parkinsonism. In the 1960s influenza virus infections in children were associated with Reye's syndrome characterized often by fatty non-inflammatory hepatic disease and an encephalopathy with marked non-inflammatory cerebral edema. Intermittently children with influenza develop focal myalgia and myositis. Guillain–Barré syndrome was epidemiologically associated with the 1978 killed influenza vaccine but not subsequent vaccines. Although occasional children with influenza have developed encephalopathy, from 2000 through 2004 there was an increase in the number of serious cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy accompanying infection with the influenza A 2009 strain. The current H5N1 strain of bird influenza occasionally infects humans with a high mortality rate and some appear to have central nervous signs.

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Crossref, and Google Scholar electronic databases were searched on October 9, 2019, and March 21, 2020, for studies that measured and reported immunization coverage indicators in India. Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions were conducted. RESULTS: The authors' search identified 545 studies, and 2 were obtained by expert suggestion. Among these 68 studies and 6 surveys were included. They found that full immunization coverage has grown yearly at 2.65% and 0.82% in rural and urban areas, respectively whereas partial immunization coverage declined by −2.44% and −0.69%, respectively. Percentage of nonimmunized children did not show a statistically significant trend in either. CONCLUSION: While rural immunization coverage has seen a large increase over the past two decades, the progress in urban areas is weak and negligible. This was largely attributable to a focus on minimizing dropouts in rural areas. However, a lack of significant reduction in unimmunized children may indicate left-out children or pockets in both rural and urban areas. The poor performance of immunization programs in urban areas, coupled with a larger impact of COVID-19, warrants that India urgently adopts urban-sensitive and urban-focused policies and programs.

We report the clinical course of three children with MIS-C while focusing on the unique considerations for managing atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. All initially had normal electrocardiograms but developed bradycardia followed by either PR prolongation or QTc elongation. Two had mild left ventricular ejection fraction dysfunction prior to developing third-degree heart block and/or a junctional escape rhythm; one had moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction that normalized before developing a prolonged QTc. On average, our patients presented to the hospital 4 days after onset of illness. Common presenting symptoms included fevers, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Inflammatory and coagulation factors were their highest early on, and troponin peaked the highest within the first two days; meanwhile, peak brain-natriuretic peptide occurred at hospital days 3-4. The patient's lowest left ventricular ejection fraction occurred at days 5-6 of illness. Initial electrocardiograms were benign with PR intervals below 200 milliseconds (ms); however, collectively the length of time from initial symptom presentation till when electrocardiographic abnormalities began was approximately days 8-9. When comparing the timing of electrocardiogram changes with trends in c-reactive protein and brain-natriuretic peptide, it appeared that the PR and QTc elongation patterns occurred after the initial hyperinflammatory response. This goes in line with the proposed mechanism that such conduction abnormalities occur secondary to inflammation and edema of the conduction tissue as part of a widespread global myocardial injury process. Based on this syndrome being a hyperinflammatory response likely affecting conduction tissue, our group was treated with different regimens of intravenous immunoglobulin, steroids, anakinra, and/or tocilizumab. These medications were successful in treating third-degree heart block, prolonged QTc, and a junctional ectopic rhythm.","Carmona, Carlos A.; Levent, Fatma; Lee, Kelvin; Trivedi, Bhavya",Case Rep Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6124898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603810/,377

METHODS: We analyzed 184 patients hospitalized for Covid‐19 in Livingston, New Jersey for clinical characteristics associated with severe disease. RESULTS: The majority of Covid‐19 patients had diabetes mellitus (DM) (62.0%), Pre‐DM (23.9%) with elevated FBG, or a BMI > 30 with normal HbA1C (4.3%). SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was associated with new and persistent hyperglycemia in 29 patients, including several with normal HbA1C levels. Forty‐four patients required intubation, which occurred significantly more often in patients with DM as compared to non‐diabetics. CONCLUSIONS: Severe Covid‐19 occurs in the presence of impaired glucose metabolism in patients, including those with DM, PreDM and obesity. Covid‐19 is asociated with elevated FBG and several patients presented with new onset DM or in DKA. The association of dysregulated glucose metabolism and severe Covid‐19 suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 pathogenesis involves a novel interplay with glucose metabolism.

624408,An international perspective for ‘Improving teacher professional development for online and blended learning: a systematic meta-aggregative review’,2020-11-04,"BACKGROUND: Adults all over the world face serious issues from problematic smartphone use (PSU). It influences them negatively on a cognitive, behavioral, and emotional level, as well as on their tendencies and well-being. In Lebanon, the prevalence of PSU was shown to be 20.2% within the adult population, specifically with young adults (18–34 years old). This study investigates the validity and reliability of the Smartphone Addiction Scale (SAS) Arabic version. In addition, this study evaluates the association between PSU and affective temperaments and the mediating role of self-esteem in this association. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out between August and September 2020, using a sample of community-dwelling participants aged 18 to 29 years. The Smartphone Addiction Scale—Short Version was used to evaluate smartphone addiction among adolescents and adults. The five different temperaments of the patients were assessed by using the Affective temperament Scale (TEMPS‐A). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale was used to evaluate self-esteem. RESULTS: 461 participants were included in this study. All items of the SAS were extracted and yielded a one-factor solution with Eigenvalues > 1 (variance explained = 49.96%; α(Cronbach) = 0.886). The confirmatory analysis results consolidated those obtained from the factor analysis. Higher depressive temperament (B = 0.46) was significantly associated with more smartphone addiction, whereas higher self-esteem (B = − 0.28) was significantly associated with less smartphone addiction. Self-esteem was found to mediate the association between depressive and hyperthymic temperaments with smartphone addiction. CONCLUSION: This study added a better understanding of the high smartphone addiction rate among adults in Lebanon. It confirms the association between affective temperaments and PSU through the mediating effect of self-esteem on Lebanese adults.

We therefore conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study to evaluate the prognostic role of inflammatory markers. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of patients at admission, including C-reactive protein (CRP), were collected in four general ICUs from September 1, 2018, to August 1, 2019. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with nonsurvival. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to evaluate the effect size of different factors in predicting mortality during ICU stay. 3 -knots were used to assess whether alternative cut points for these biomarkers were more appropriate. RESULTS: A total of 813 patients were recruited, among whom 121 patients (14.88%) died during the ICU stay. The AUC-ROC values of PCT and CRP for discriminating ICU mortality were 0.696 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.650–0.743) and 0.684 (95% CI, 0.633–0.735), respectively. In the multivariable analysis, only APACHE II score (odds ratio, 1.166; 95% CI, 1.129–1.203; P = 0.000) and CRP concentration > 62.8 mg/L (odds ratio, 2.145; 95% CI, 1.343–3.427; P = 0.001), were significantly associated with an increased risk of ICU mortality. Moreover, the combination of APACHE II score and CRP > 62.8 mg/L significantly improved risk reclassification over the APACHE II score alone, with NRI (0.556) and IDI (0.013). Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed that CRP concentration > 62.8 mg/L was the optimal cut-off value for differentiating between surviving and nonsurviving patients. CONCLUSION: CRP markedly improved risk reclassification for prognosis prediction.","Qu, Rong; Hu, Linhui; Ling, Yun; Hou, Yating; Fang, Heng; Zhang, Huidan; Liang, Silin; He, Zhimei; Fang, Miaoxian; Li, Jiaxin; Li, Xu; Chen, Chunbo",BMC Anesthesiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33225902/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-020-01207-3,377

The kinetics of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population is not studied yet. To understand serological response in relation to age, gender, time period and severity of disease, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 test was used which analysed both IgM and IgG. One hundred and three COVID-19 patients were enrolled. Seropositivity was seen in 64% of patients, with 33% at ≤ 7 days, 62% between 8 and 15 days and 81% at ≥ 16 days from the time of admission. Men (65%) showed higher antibody response than women (59%), whereas no difference was observed in seropositivity with respect to age of the patients. Dynamics of antibody responses revealed individual variations. Patients in ICU had higher antibody reactivity with 67% positivity as compared to 60% positivity in non-ICU patients. Kinetics of antibody response during COVID-19 disease varied in relation to gender, age, time period and severity and these factors might play an important role in treatment and control of COVID-19.","Chidananda, Mohana Kumari; Zohmangaihi, Deepy; Ram, Sant; Soni, Shiv Lal; Suri, Vikas; Malhotra, Pankaj; Jassal, Ravjit Singh; Kaur, Jyotdeep; Verma, Indu; Sharma, Sadhna",Indian J Clin Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12291-021-00986-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177138/,377

Here, we identified a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-binding antibody, XG014, which potently neutralizes β-coronavirus lineage B (β-CoV-B), including SARS-CoV-2, its circulating variants, SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoV WIV1. Interestingly, antibody family members competing with XG014 binding show reduced levels of cross-reactivity and induce antibody-dependent SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, suggesting a unique mode of recognition by XG014. Structural analyses reveal that XG014 recognizes a conserved epitope outside the ACE2 binding site and completely locks RBD in the non-functional “down” conformation, while its family member XG005 directly competes with ACE2 binding and position the RBD “up”. Single administration of XG014 is effective in protection against and therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. Our findings suggest the potential to develop XG014 as pan-β-CoV-B therapeutics and the importance of the XG014 conserved antigenic epitope for designing broadly protective vaccines against β-CoV-B and newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

However, the lack of systemic illness, low PCR positivity and lack of consistent seroconversion have led some authors to postulate an epiphenomenon. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been identified in a limited number of skin biopsies in few publications, yet there remain conflicting reports regarding other SARS-CoV-2 associated proteins, the presence or absence of viral RNA, and a unifying pathophysiology. In cooperation with the COVID Human Genome Effort, our “COVID toes” biobank was established to identify both the genetic and immunologic basis and provide clinically relevant insights into targeted therapeutics. As of March 2021, we have enrolled 96 patients, creating a prospective biorepository with clinical data, saliva, serial blood collection, and skin biopsies. Here we aim to comprehensively investigate the conflicting findings, detail the inflammatory response, and identify the source of interferon signaling with multiplex immunofluorescence (IFA) and the RNAscope fluorescent assay to detect viral mRNA. Median patient age was 17 (range 2 – 72) and 44/96 (46%) were male. Preliminary IFA results demonstrate detection of SARS-CoV-2 components, robust MxA detection and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) colocalization, identifying PDCs as the likely primary source of IFN-I production and implicates an excessive localized IFN-I response in affected patients.","Moon, J.

643888,A brief review of socio-economic and environmental impact of Covid-19,2020-08-01,"Objective The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has infected millions worldwide and impacted the lives of many folds more. Many clinicians share new Covid-19-related resources, research, and ideas within the online Free Open Access to Medical Education (FOAM) community of practice. This study provides a detailed content and contributor analysis of Covid-19-related tweets among the FOAM community during the first months of the pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants In this social media content analysis study, Twitter was searched from November 1, 2019, to March 21, 2020, for English tweets discussing Covid-19 in the FOAM community. Tweets were classified into one of 13 pre-specified content categories: original research, editorials, FOAM resource, public health, podcast or video, learned experience, refuting false information, policy discussion, emotional impact, blatantly false information, other Covid-19, and non-Covid-19. Further analysis of linked original research and FOAM resources was performed. One-thousand (1000) randomly selected contributor profiles and those deemed to have contributed false information were analyzed. Results The search yielded 8541 original tweets from 4104 contributors. The number of tweets in each content category were: 1557 other Covid-19 (18.2%), 1190 emotional impact (13.9%), 1122 FOAM resources (13.1%), 1111 policy discussion (13.0%), 928 advice (10.9%), 873 learned experience (10.2%), 424 non-Covid-19 (5.0%), 410 podcast or video (4.8%), 304 editorials (3.6%), 275 original research (3.2%), 245 public health (2.9%), 83 refuting false information (1.0%), and 19 blatantly false (0.2%). Conclusions Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, the FOAM community used Twitter to share Covid-19 learned experiences, online resources, crowd-sourced advice, and research and to discuss the emotional impact of Covid-19. Twitter also provided a forum for post-publication peer review of new research. Sharing blatantly false information within this community was infrequent. This study highlights several potential benefits from engaging with the FOAM community on Twitter.","Prager, Ross; Pratte, Michael T; Unni, Rudy R; Bala, Sudarshan; Ng Fat Hing, Nicholas; Wu, Kay; McGrath, Trevor A; Thomas, Adam; Thoma, Brent; Kyeremanteng, Kwadwo",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33815994/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13594,377

However, the mask adoption rate in the US is still less than optimal. This study aims to understand the beliefs held by individuals who oppose the use of facial masks, and the evidence that they use to support these beliefs, to inform the development of targeted public health communication strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed a total of 771,268 US-based tweets between January to October 2020. We developed machine-learning classifiers to identify and categorize relevant tweets, followed by a qualitative content analysis of a subset of the tweets to understand the rationale of those opposed mask wearing. RESULTS: We identified 267,152 tweets that contained personal opinions about wearing facial masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of the tweets supported mask wearing, the proportion of anti-mask tweets stayed constant at about 10% level throughout the study period. Common reasons for opposition included physical discomfort and negative effects, lack of effectiveness, and being unnecessary or inappropriate for certain people or under certain circumstances. The opposing tweets were significantly less likely to cite external sources of information such as public health agencies’ websites to support the arguments. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Combining machine learning and qualitative content analysis is an effective strategy for identifying public attitudes toward mask wearing and the reasons for opposition. The results may inform better communication strategies to improve the public perception of wearing masks and, in particular, to specifically address common anti-mask beliefs.","He, Lu; He, Changyang; Reynolds, Tera L; Bai, Qiushi; Huang, Yicong; Li, Chen; Zheng, Kai; Chen, Yunan",J Am Med Inform Assoc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jamia/ocab047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690794/,377

METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight consecutive patients with T2DM (median age 70 years, 74 males) were retrospectively evaluated at the end of the lockdown period. Data on metabolic control were collected at different time: within three months before the lockdown (visit 0) and within the first six weeks after it (visit 1). RESULTS: During the lockdown, a significant increase in body weight (from 79.7 ± 18.7 kg to 81.4 ± 19.4 kg, p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI, from 29.5 ± 6 kg/m(2) to 30.1 ± 6.3 kg/m(2), p < 0.001), waist circumference (from 103.8 ± 13 cm to 105 ± 13.6 cm, p < 0.001), fasting plasma glucose (FPG; from 138.1 ± 29.4 mg/dL to 146.6 ± 36.4 mg/dL) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; from 7 ± 0.8 to 7.3 ± 0.9%, p < 0.001) was observed. Weight gain was directly associated with HbA1c increase (β 0.085, C.I. 95% 0.05–0.121; p < 0.001) while insulin therapy resulted to be the only significant independent predictor of HbA1c worsening at the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 2.40, C.I. 1.06–5.45; p = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on body weight and glucose control in T2DM patients, in particular in those on insulin treatment.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have reduced access to supplemental oxygen, whereas other nations have maintained and even improved access to supplemental oxygen. We examined whether variation in the nationally determined oxygen guidelines had any association with national mortality rates in COVID-19. Methods: Three independent investigators searched for, identified, and extracted the nationally recommended target oxygen levels for the commencement of oxygen in COVID-19 pneumonia from the 29 worst affected countries. Mortality estimates were calculated from three independent sources. We then applied both parametric (Pearson's R) and non-parametric (Kendall's Tau B) tests of bivariate association to determine the relationship between case fatality rate (CFR) and target SpO(2), and also between potential confounders and CFR. Results: Of the 26 nations included, 15 had employed conservative oxygen strategies to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. Of them, Belgium, France, USA, Canada, China, Germany, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, and the UK guidelines advised commencing oxygen when oxygen saturations (SpO(2)) fell to 91% or less. A statistically significant correlation was found between SpO(2) and CFR both parametrically (R = −0.53, P < 0.01) and non-parametrically (−0.474, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Our study highlights the disparity in oxygen provision for COVID-19 patients between the nations analysed. In those nations that pursued a conservative oxygen strategy, there was an association with higher national mortality rates. We discuss the potential reasons for such an association.","Mansab, Fatma; Donnelly, Harry; Kussner, Albrecht; Neil, James; Bhatti, Sohail; Goyal, Daniel K.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.580585; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327182/,377

There are no comparable quantitative data on naturally-acquired infections. METHODS: In a community-based study in Hong Kong in 2008, we followed up initially well individuals to quantify trends in viral shedding based on culture and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through the course of illness associated with seasonal influenza A and B virus infection. RESULTS: Trends in symptom scores more closely matched changes in molecular viral loads measured by RT-PCR for influenza A than influenza B. For influenza A virus infections, replicating viral loads measured by culture declined to undetectable levels earlier after illness onset than molecular viral loads. Most viral shedding occurred during the first 2–3 days after illness onset and we estimated that 1–8% of infectiousness occurs prior to illness onset. Only 14% of infections with detectable shedding by RT-PCR were asymptomatic, and viral shedding was low in these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ‘silent spreaders’ (i.e. individuals who are infectious while asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic) may be less important in the spread of influenza epidemics than previously thought.","Lau, Lincoln L.

Long-standing illegal wildlife trade in China and worldwide increases the risk of zoonotic infectious diseases. We sought to improve the understanding of China' legal system for the protection of wildlife, which has at its core the wildlife protection law, by systematically evaluating the laws and regulations of China's Wildlife Protection Framework. We examined how existing legal documents (e.g., the Wildlife Protection Law 2018) are directly or indirectly related to wildlife conservation. The inherent defects of wildlife protection legislation include a narrow scope of protection, insufficient public participation, and inconsistent enforcement among responsible agencies. Solutions to improve China's Wildlife Protection Law include expanding the legal protection of wildlife, and improving monitoring of wildlife protection. Strengthening legislation will be the basis for effective regulation of the use of wild animals. We advocate the establishment of a sound wildlife protection legal system for resolving conflicts between humans and wild animals and preventing zoonotic disease, such a system will have a profound impact on the sustainable development of China's wildlife resources.","Fang, Guirong; Liu, Hong; Wu, Ka; Wei, Tongqing; Wang, Qing",Conserv. biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585442/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13837,377
656485,Living on the edge,2006-03-16,"The burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.","Newell, Diane G.; Koopmans, Marion; Verhoef, Linda; Duizer, Erwin; Aidara-Kane, Awa; Sprong, Hein; Opsteegh, Marieke; Langelaar, Merel; Threfall, John; Scheutz, Flemming; der Giessen, Joke van; Kruse, Hilde",Int J Food Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160510000383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153070/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168160510000383,377

A Bayesian re-analysis of the RECOVERY randomised controlled trial,2021-06-19,"SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, and the global spread has caused significant medical/socioeconomic impacts. Other than vaccination, effective public health measures, including contact tracing, isolation and quarantine, is critical for deterring viral transmission, preventing infection progression and resuming normal activities. Viral transmission is affected by many factors but the viral load and vitality could be among the most important ones. Although in vitro studies have indicated that the amount of virus isolated from infected people affects the successful rate of virus isolation, whether the viral load carried at the individual level would determine the transmissibility was unknown. From the diagnostic point of view, we aimed to examine whether the Ct value, a measurement of viral load by RT-PCR assay, could differentiate the spreaders from the non-spreaders in a population of college students. Our results indicate that while at the population level the Ct value is lower, suggesting a higher viral load, in the symptomatic spreaders than that in the asymptomatic non-spreaders, there is significant overlap in the Ct values between the two groups. Thus Ct value, or the viral load, at the individual level could not predict the transmissibility. Our studies also suggest that a sensitive method to detect the presence of virus is needed to identify asymptomatic persons who may carry a low viral load but can still be infectious.","Tian, Di; Lin, Zhen; Kriner, Ellie M.; Esneault, Dalton J.; Tran, Jonathan; DeVoto, Julia C.; Okami, Naima; Greenberg, Rachel; Yanofsky, Sarah; Ratnayaka, Swarnamala; Tran, Nicholas; Livaccari, Maeghan; Lampp, Marla; Wang, Noel; Tim, Scott; Norton, Patrick; Scott, John; Hu, Tony Y.; Garry, Robert; Hamm, Lee; Delafontaine, Patrice; Yin, Xiao-Ming",J Mol Diagn,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmoldx.2021.05.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34102313/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S152515782100163X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152515782100163X?v=s5,377

Multiple organ damage is a common and lethal complication of the severe COVID-19 patients. Of 198 recruited participants, 65 patients (32.8 %) had coagulopathy. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the association of coagulopathy with organ dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The incidence of coagulopathy was associated with increased odds of acute liver injury, renal dysfunction and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by multivariable regression. Overall mortality was 65 % for the patients with coagulopathy and 3.76 % for the patients without coagulopathy. History of hypertension, leukocytosis and elevated CRP concentrations were associated with higher odds of coagulopathy. Patients with coagulopathy had similar levels of hepatic and renal functional enzymes prior to the onset of coagulopathy as the patients without coagulopathy, suggesting that coagulopathy is an association of the progression of multi-organ dysfunction in COVID-19. Plasma IL-6 was higher in patients with coagulopathy than controls, but it's not a risk factor for organ dysfunction by logistic regression. The present study shows that coagulopathy, overt DIC and non-overt DIC, associates with organ dysfunction and higher mortality rate in COVID-19. Thus, anticoagulant therapy may prevent organ dysfunction and increase survival rate in COVID-19.","Zhang, Rui; Liu, Yani; Zhang, Bei; Wu, Congqing; Zhou, Jinping; Zhang, Yu; Yang, Wei; Li, Zhenyu; Shi, Shaojun",EXCLI J,https://doi.org/10.17179/excli2020-2853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564286/,377

To better study the effect of the pandemic on PWE, members of the American Epilepsy Society were surveyed between April 30 and June 14, 2020. There were 366 initial responses (9% response rate) and 337 respondents remained for analysis after screening out noncompleters and those not directly involved with clinical care; the majority were physicians from the United States. About a third (30%) of respondents stated that they had patients with COVID-19 and reported no significant change in seizure frequency. Conversely, one-third of respondents reported new onset seizures in patients with COVID-19 who had no prior history of seizures. The majority of respondents felt that there were at least some barriers for PWE in receiving appropriate clinical care, neurophysiologic procedures, and elective surgery. Medication shortages were noted by approximately 30% of respondents, with no clear pattern in types of medication involved. Telehealth was overwhelmingly found to have value.

668233,Connecting During the Virtual Interview Process: Lessons from Experience,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has a temporal association with SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and can present similarly to Kawasaki disease (KD). After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a MIS-C case definition in May 2020, we implemented local diagnostic and management strategies to standardize the care for patients with MIS-C encouraging limited laboratory evaluation of non-toxic patients presenting with a febrile illness. We then sought to re-evaluate our diagnostic and management recommendations to ensure appropriate resource utilization for children with MIS-C and KD. METHODS: Patients with MIS-C and KD were identified via convenience sampling of Pediatric Infectious Diseases clinical records at Inova Children’s Hospital from May 1, 2020 to August 28, 2020. Manual chart review was done to extract clinical points of interest and the two cohorts were compared with descriptive statistics. Abdominal symptoms included pain, emesis, and diarrhea. Respiratory symptoms included shortness of breath, tachypnea, cough, and need for mechanical ventilation. Musculoskeletal symptoms included pain and edema. Neurologic symptoms included headache, dizziness, altered mental status, and irritability. RESULTS: 7 patients with KD and 14 patients with MIS-C were identified. No patients with KD had presenting hypotension and 9 patients with MIS-C had presenting hypotension (p < 0.01). Oral changes were seen in 5 patients with KD and 3 patients with MIS-C (p = 0.05). Conjunctival injection, rash, abdominal symptoms, musculoskeletal symptoms, and neurologic symptoms were seen in some patients with KD and MIS-C with no statistically significant occurrence of these symptoms between the two cohorts. The median initial absolute lymphocyte count was 2,860/µL in KD cases whereas it was 1,325/µL in MIS-C cases (p < 0.01). The median platelet count was 367,000/ µL in KD cases versus 193,000 in MIS-C cases (p = 0.03). The median initial C-reactive protein was 11.2 mg/dL in KD cases versus 23.2 mg/dL in MIS-C cases (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in the white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, alanine transaminase, B-natriuretic peptide, troponin I, or ferritin values between KD and MIS-C patients. Coronary artery dilation or prominence was seen in 4 patients with KD and in 8 patients with MIS-C (p > 0.99). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Following national recognition of MIS-C we saw approximately 1 MIS-C case per week. Presenting hypotension, an absolute lymphocyte count less than 1400/µL, a platelet count less than 200,000/µL, and a CRP greater than 20 mg/dL best predicted MIS-C versus KD. The initial white blood cell count, alanine transaminase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, B-natriuretic peptide, troponin I, ferritin, and initial coronary artery dilation did not readily distinguish KD from MIS-C. Thus, our diagnostic management recommending limited laboratory evaluation for non-toxic patients presenting with a febrile rash illness, fever and abdominal symptoms, or fever with conjunctival injection is reasonable.","Nuibe, Andrew; Rubbab, Beenish; Levorson, Rebecca",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,https://doi.org/10.1093/jpids/piab031.020,377

This species includes two types: (1) the river type, with 50 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 450 and 1000 kg and with an annual milk production of 1000–3000 kg; and (2) the swamp type, with 48 chromosomes, with an adult male weighing between 325 and 450 kg and with an annual milk production of up to 600 kg. The river buffalo is reared mainly for milk, whereas the swamp buffalo is reared mainly for draught. Only 3% of the world buffalo population is reared in the Mediterranean region. Significant numbers of buffaloes are at present found only in Italy, Romania, Egypt, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Iraq and Iran. In all these countries, buffaloes represent only a very small portion of total livestock, except in Egypt, where buffaloes are more numerous than cattle. Because of the strong market demand for buffalo cheese, the number of buffaloes has increased in Italy and there is a preference for buffalo dairy products compared to cows’ milk products in a few countries. Major morphological differences between the buffalo populations of different countries include (1) the variable size, ranging between a minimum of 280 and 300 kg liveweight for adult females and males, respectively, in Egypt to a maximum of 900 and 1000 kg in Iraq, the most frequent weights being 600 and 800 kg; (2) the shape of the horns; and (3) the coat color, from dark gray and dark brown to black, showing white spots in some cases.","Borghese, A.; Moioli, B.",Encyclopedia of Dairy Sciences,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744074002302; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744074002302,377

Retrospective analysis of all acute hospital admissions of SSc patients fulfilling the 2013 EULAR/ACR Classification Criteria, from a single-centre cohort of 95 patients, between 2010 and 2020. The total number of SSc patients registered in our hospital, in this period, was 123. Clinical data were collected from medical files of our institution and from the National Healthcare Registry platform. 53 patients needed acute hospitalization, in a total of 164 admissions. The most frequent causes for admission were: infectious diseases [27%; 70% due to pneumoniae, of which 74% had SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD)], cardiac disease (16.5%), peripheral vascular disease [12.8%; all due to digital ulcers], pulmonary hypertension (PH) (9.8%) and ILD (9.1%). There was an increase in admissions due to cardiac disease over the 10 years of follow-up, and a decrease of ILD over the last 5 years. Fourteen patients died (in-hospital mortality of 9%) mainly due to pneumoniae (36%), heart failure (21%), neoplastic diseases (21%), PH (14%) and ILD (7%). From all the admissions due to infection 70.5% were under immunosuppression at the time of the hospitalization. The frequency of acute admissions superior to 1 was associated with infection (OR 2.29, 95%CI 1.11–4.71). There were several factors associated with both acute admissions and mortality, including: gender, race, digital ulcers, cardiac dysfunction, ILD and PH. Infection was the principal cause of acute hospitalization and mortality, mainly due to pneumoniae. Although a high percentage of those had ILD, it has been decreasing in the last years in our cohort, as a direct cause of hospital admission and mortality, possibly reflecting the advances in its management.","Caetano, Joana; Batista, Frederico; Amaral, Marta C.; Oliveira, Susana; Alves, José D.",Rheumatol Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-04983-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480254/,377

677431,Numerical simulation and experimental validation of the ventilation system performance in a heated room,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide in 2020. Coronaviruses could mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans and multiple system infections in many animals. The coronavirus enters the host cell through the binding of surface spike glycoprotein (S Protein) with host angiotensin-converting enzyme-Ⅱ (ACE2) protein. METHODS: ACE2 sequences of various species were aligned with human ACE2, accordingly, homology models for different species were constructed. Then, S protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans. By comparing the free binding energies it were possible to identify potential viral hosts that could transmit the virus to human (risk of cross-species transmission). The predication showed that, besides human beings, SARS-CoV-2 may possibly infect Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius as well.","Guo, Sheng; Yang, Jing; Lei, Yu; Liu, Bin; Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Li; Zuo, Zhili",J Mol Graph Model,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmgm.2021.107893; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1093326321000620; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326321000620?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740562/,377

The causes of thrombosis in severely ill COVID-19 patients are still emerging, but the coincidence of critical illness with the timing of the onset of adaptive immunity could implicate an excessive immune response. We hypothesised that platelets might be susceptible to activation by anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and contribute to thrombosis. We found that immune complexes containing recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and anti-spike IgG enhanced platelet-mediated thrombosis on von Willebrand Factor in vitro, but only when the glycosylation state of the Fc domain was modified to correspond with the aberrant glycosylation previously identified in patients with severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we found that activation was dependent on FcyRIIA and we provide in vitro evidence that this pathogenic platelet activation can be counteracted by therapeutic small molecules R406 (fostamatinib) and ibrutinib that inhibit tyrosine kinases syk and btk respectively or by the P2Y12 antagonist cangrelor.","Bye, Alexander P; Hoepel, Willianne; Mitchell, Joanne L; Jégouic, Sophie; Loureiro, Silvia; Sage, Tanya; de Taeye, Steven; van Gils, Marit; Kriek, Neline; Cooper, Nichola; Jones, Ian; den Dunnen, Jeroen; Gibbins, Jonathan M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.26.437014,377
680870,Spiralling Pre-clerkship Concepts into the Clinical Phase: Augmenting Knowledge Transfer Using Innovative Technology-Enhanced Curriculum Activities,2021-06-22,"OBJECTIVES: During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, Northern Italy had to completely reorganize its hospital activity. In Lombardy, the hub-and-spoke system was introduced to guarantee emergency and urgent cardiovascular surgery, whereas most hospitals were dedicated to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study was to analyse the results of the hub-and-spoke organization system. METHODS: Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Monzino) became one of the four hubs for cardiovascular surgery, with a total of eight spokes. SARS-CoV-2 screening became mandatory for all patients. New flow charts were designed to allow separated pathways based on infection status. A reorganization of spaces guaranteed COVID-19-free and COVID-19-dedicated areas. Patients were also classified into groups according to their pathological and clinical status: emergency, urgent and non-deferrable (ND). RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were referred to the Monzino hub-and-spoke network. We performed 41 operations, 28 (68.3%) of which were emergency/urgent and 13 of which were ND. The screening allowed the identification of COVID-19 (three patients, 7.3%) and non-COVID-19 patients (38 patients, 92.7%). The newly designed and shared protocols guaranteed that the cardiac patients would be divided into emergency, urgent and ND groups. The involvement of the telematic management heart team allowed constant updates and clinical discussions. CONCLUSIONS: The hub-and-spoke organization system efficiently safeguards access to heart and vascular surgical services for patients who require ND, urgent and emergency treatment. Further reorganization will be needed at the end of this pandemic when elective cases will again be scheduled, with a daily increase in the number of operations.","Bonalumi, Giorgia; Giambuzzi, Ilaria; Barbone, Alessandro; Ranieri, Camilla; Cavallotti, Laura; Trabattoni, Piero; Naliato, Moreno; Polvani, Gianluca; Torracca, Lucia; Pelenghi, Stefano; Ragni, Franco; Russo, Claudio Francesco; Guerra, Francisco; Trimarchi, Santi; Civilini, Efrem; Romani, Federico; Bellosta, Raffaello; Losa, Sergio; Roberto, Maurizio; Alamanni, Francesco",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa204; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32584978/,377
685267,The future of value in digitalised higher education: why data privacy should not be our biggest concern,2020-11-19,"BACKGROUND: Stalled progress in controlling Plasmodium falciparum malaria highlights the need for an effective and deployable vaccine. RTS,S/AS01, the most effective malaria vaccine candidate to date, demonstrated 56% efficacy over 12 months in African children. We therefore assessed a new candidate vaccine for safety and efficacy. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2b trial, the low-dose circumsporozoite protein-based vaccine R21, with two different doses of adjuvant Matrix-M (MM), was given to children aged 5–17 months in Nanoro, Burkina Faso—a highly seasonal malaria transmission setting. Three vaccinations were administered at 4-week intervals before the malaria season, with a fourth dose 1 year later. All vaccines were administered intramuscularly into the thigh. Group 1 received 5 μg R21 plus 25 μg MM, group 2 received 5 μg R21 plus 50 μg MM, and group 3, the control group, received rabies vaccinations. Children were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to groups 1–3. An independent statistician generated a random allocation list, using block randomisation with variable block sizes, which was used to assign participants. Participants, their families, and the local study team were all masked to group allocation. Only the pharmacists preparing the vaccine were unmasked to group allocation. Vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy were evaluated over 1 year. The primary objective assessed protective efficacy of R21 plus MM (R21/MM) from 14 days after the third vaccination to 6 months. Primary analyses of vaccine efficacy were based on a modified intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who received three vaccinations, allowing for inclusion of participants who received the wrong vaccine at any timepoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03896724. FINDINGS: From May 7 to June 13, 2019, 498 children aged 5–17 months were screened, and 48 were excluded. 450 children were enrolled and received at least one vaccination. 150 children were allocated to group 1, 150 children were allocated to group 2, and 150 children were allocated to group 3. The final vaccination of the primary series was administered on Aug 7, 2019. R21/MM had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild, with the most common event being fever. None of the seven serious adverse events were attributed to the vaccine. At the 6-month primary efficacy analysis, 43 (29%) of 146 participants in group 1, 38 (26%) of 146 participants in group 2, and 105 (71%) of 147 participants in group 3 developed clinical malaria. Vaccine efficacy was 74% (95% CI 63–82) in group 1 and 77% (67–84) in group 2 at 6 months. At 1 year, vaccine efficacy remained high, at 77% (67–84) in group 1. Participants vaccinated with R21/MM showed high titres of malaria-specific anti-Asn-Ala-Asn-Pro (NANP) antibodies 28 days after the third vaccination, which were almost doubled with the higher adjuvant dose. Titres waned but were boosted to levels similar to peak titres after the primary series of vaccinations after a fourth dose administered 1 year later. INTERPRETATION: R21/MM appears safe and very immunogenic in African children, and shows promising high-level efficacy.

686439,Coping and scholarship during a pandemic,2021-08-02,"Collective migration occurs throughout the animal kingdom, and demands both the interpretation of navigational cues and the perception of other individuals within the group. Navigational cues orient individuals towards a destination, while it has been demonstrated that communication between individuals enhances navigation through a reduction in orientation error. We develop a mathematical model of collective navigation that synthesizes navigational cues and perception of other individuals. Crucially, this approach incorporates uncertainty inherent to cue interpretation and perception in the decision making process, which can arise due to noisy environments. We demonstrate that collective navigation is more efficient than individual navigation, provided a threshold number of other individuals are perceptible. This benefit is even more pronounced in low navigation information environments. In navigation 'blindspots', where no information is available, navigation is enhanced through a relay that connects individuals in information-poor regions to individuals in information-rich regions. As an expository case study, we apply our framework to minke whale migration in the northeast Atlantic Ocean, and quantify the decrease in navigation ability due to anthropogenic noise pollution.","Johnston, S T; Painter, K J",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583565/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2021.0383,377

Therefore, this paper aims to clarify the linkage structure of China’s housing market and its risk contagion routes. Given monthly data of provincial housing and stock-market capital returns from 2001M01 to 2019M12, on the basis of graph theory, this paper first explores the linkage structure of provincial housing markets. Relying on the linkage structure, this paper then simulates the effect of unexpected negative shocks from the stock market on the probabilities of a housing-market collapse based on the epidemic model. The results show that (i) consistently with practical evidence, the probability of housing-market collapse is relatively high in the southwest of China and (ii) reducing housing-market linkage, such as through a blocking mechanism, to prevent collapse is helpful.","Wang, Yehui; Liu, Jianxu; Tang, Yuxuan; Sriboonchitta, Songsak",Soft comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-021-05837-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967599/,377

As the pandemic evolves, informed policy-making and strategic resource allocation relies on accurate forecasts. To predict the spread of the virus within US counties, we curated an array of county-level demographic and COVID-19-relevant health risk factors. In combination with the county-level case and death numbers curated by John Hopkins university, we developed a forecasting model using deep learning (DL). We implemented an autoencoder-based Seq2Seq model with gated recurrent units (GRUs) in the deep recurrent layers. We trained the model to predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R . For most counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the COVID-19 spread. We hope that our forecasts and model can help local governments in the continued fight against COVID-19.","Zhang-James, Yanli; Hess, Jonathan; Salkin, Asif; Wang, Dongliang; Chen, Samuel; Winkelstein, Peter; Morley, Christopher P; Faraone, Stephen V",Res Sq,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013251/; https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-456641/v1,377
