Rice is a common constituent of pet food, and dogs often eat the same food on a continual daily basis for long periods of time. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the risk of chronic iAs exposure in rice-based diet-fed dogs. METHODS: Hair iAs level was measured in seven rice-based diet-fed dogs (mean age 3.8 years) and in nine dogs that did not consume any rice (mean age 4.4 years), using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The hair iAs level was significantly higher (P=0.005) in dogs fed a rice-based diet (mean 0.143 µg/g) than in dogs that did not consume any rice (mean 0.086 µg/g), while age and sex did not show associations with hair iAs level. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that eating a rice-based diet for long periods of time represents a risk for chronic iAs exposure in dogs.","Rosendahl, Sarah; Anturaniemi, Johanna; Hielm-Björkman, Anna",Vet Rec,628,16

This protein regulates the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) to restrain activity and inhibit the elongation stage of protein synthesis. Mounting evidence shows that eEF2K regulates the cell cycle, autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis in several types of cancers. The expression of eEF2K promotes survival of cancer cells, and the level of this protein is increased in many cancer cells to adapt them to the microenvironment conditions including hypoxia, nutrient depletion, and acidosis. The physiological function of eEF2K and its role in the development and progression of cancer are here reviewed in detail. In addition, a summary of progress for in vitro eEF2K inhibitors from anti-cancer drug discovery research in recent years, along with their structure–activity relationships (SARs) and synthetic routes or natural sources, is also described. Special attention is given to those inhibitors that have been already validated in vivo, with the overall aim to provide reference context for the further development of new first-in-class anti-cancer drugs that target eEF2K.","Zhang, Bin; Zou, Jiamei; Zhang, Qiting; Wang, Ze; Wang, Ning; He, Shan; Zhao, Yufen; Naman, C.

We also recorded continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) in the beluga, bottlenose dolphin, false killer whale, killer whale (Orcinus orca), and pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) to evaluate cardiorespiratory coupling while breathing spontaneously under voluntary control. The results show that cetaceans have a strong Respiratory Sinus Arrythmia (RSA), during which both f H and SV vary within the interbreath interval, making average values dependent on the breathing frequency (f R). The RSA-corrected f H was lower for all cetaceans compared to similarly sized terrestrial mammals breathing continuously. As compared with terrestrial mammals, the RSA-corrected SV and CO were either lower or the same for the dolphin and false killer whale, while both were elevated in the beluga. When plotting f R against f H for an inactive mammal, cetaceans had a greater cardiac response to changes in f R as compared with terrestrial mammals. We propose that these data indicate an important coupling between respiration and cardiac function that enhances gas exchange, and that this RSA is important to maximize gas exchange during surface intervals, similar to that reported in the elephant seal.","Fahlman, A; Miedler, S; Marti-Bonmati, L; Fernandez, D Ferrero; Caballero, P Muñoz; Arenarez, J; Rocho-Levine, J; Robeck, T; Blawas, A",The Journal of experimental biology,628,1

METHODS Databases were reviewed: EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Articles published from December 2009 to September 2018 pertaining to the selection of outcomes or development of PROMs/PREMs for children or families were included. The International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) Spectrum of Public Participation was used to classify levels of engagement across each article; IAP2 plots engagement on a spectrum across five stages (from minimal to most engagement): Inform, Consult, Involve, Collaborate, and Empower. RESULTS 9019 non-duplicate articles were screened; 36 articles met inclusion criteria, seven studies focused on the selection of outcomes, and 29 studies pertained to PROM/PREM development. Twenty-three articles adhered to 'Involve' level of engagement. Four articles were categorized as 'Collaborate,' seven articles were classified as 'Consult,' and three articles were categorized as 'Inform'. CONCLUSION Children and families were sparsely engaged as co-conductors or equal partners in the selection or development of PRO research; involvement remained on the mid-low end of the IAP2 Spectrum.

A simulated OSCE can aid examination preparation, but the COVID-19 pandemic prevented in-person simulation training. Therefore, we adapted our in-person simulated OSCE (SOSCE) as a Zoom-based telesimulation OSCE (ZOSCE), permitting examinees to participate remotely. Comparing this process with historical in-person SOSCE cohorts, we hypothesized that this telesimulation-based format would still be well received by the trainees as a substitute when it was not possible to provide in-person practice and formative assessment. Subsequently, the ABA proposed a virtual-format OSCE. Methods We conducted our 7-station ZOSCE according to the ABA content outline for all graduating third-year clinical anesthesia residents (CA-3) in 2020. From a main meeting room, the facilitator paired each CA-3 with a faculty proctor, assigned them to their own breakout room for each station, and rotated standardized patients in. The faculty proctor observed the CA-3's performance in real time using an assessment tool with objectives graded on a 0-2 scale. At the conclusion of the ZOSCE, proctors reviewed the assessment tool with the CA-3 and provided personalized global feedback. Assessment tool scores were used to calculate performance data for the study group that were compared with a SOSCE historical cohort from 2017 and 2018. All parties completed a Likert-style evaluation specific to the ZOSCE. Results A total of 22 CA-3 residents participated. Mean performance scores ranged from 82.2%-94.9% (minimum = 38%, maximum = 100%). Compared with the historical SOSCE cohort, ZOSCE scores for 5 of 7 stations were not different, but scores in communication with professionals (P = .007) and ultrasound (P < .001) stations were lower. Overall, CA-3 participants rated the learning experience positively and felt it was a reasonable substitution for in-person simulation, with responses similar to those of a historical in-person SOSCE cohort. Conclusions A telesimulation-based practice ZOSCE for formative examination preparation for the ABA OSCE resulted in similar institutional scoring for most stations compared with in-person SOSCE, but some stations may be better practiced in person or require modifications. The virtual format may permit flexible scheduling during nonclinical times or for learners in remote locations. These findings have implications for future formative exercises and the formal summative examination process.","Miller, Christina; Toy, Serkan; Schwengel, Deborah; Schwartz, Stefani; Schiavi, Adam",The journal of education in perioperative medicine : JEPM,628,30

Because cortisol has long been associated with adiposity, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize and compare the literature around CAR and HCC and their association with obesity or fat distribution indices. METHODS The PubMed, Web of Science (Web of Science Core Collection and Medline), EBSCO Information Services, Embase, and PsycNET databases were searched, and full-text articles investigating the association between CAR or HCC and markers of adiposity in humans were included. Meta-analyses were then performed to compare studies associating CAR or HCC with BMI (a marker of general adiposity) and waist circumference (a marker of fat distribution). RESULTS The results of this review highlight inconsistencies in cortisol sampling and CAR computation, which makes comparisons between studies difficult. It was found that adiposity indices are not associated with CAR but that they correlate significantly and positively with HCC. The subgroup analysis hinted to possible age differences in the magnitude of the association between HCC and BMI. CONCLUSIONS Trait rather than state measurement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity is associated with increased general and abdominal adiposity in humans.","Ostinelli, Giada; Scovronec, Anaïs; Iceta, Sylvain; Ouellette, Anne-Sophie; Lemieux, Simone; Biertho, Laurent; Bégin, Catherine; Michaud, Andréanne; Tchernof, André",Obesity,628,5

The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the evidence whether EAT and PAT volume can be reduced by weight-loss interventions (exercise, diet, bariatric surgery or pharmaceutical interventions). A systematic literature search identified 34 studies that were included in the qualitative synthesis (exercise, n = 10, diet, n = 5, bariatric surgery, n = 9 and pharmaceutical interventions, n = 10). Of the 34 studies, 10 reported sufficient data to be included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was only conducted for changes in EAT volume, since only few controlled studies reported changes in PAT (n = 3) or total cardiac adipose tissue volume (n = 1). A significant pooled effect size (ES) for reduction in EAT volume was observed following weight-loss interventions as compared with control interventions (ES = -0.89, 95% CI: -1.23 to -0.55, P < 0.001). When comparing the effect of exercise training versus control on EAT volume reduction, there was a significant pooled ES favouring exercise training (ES: -1.11, 95% CI: -1.57 to -0.65, P < 0.001). Similarly, the ES of pharmaceutical versus control interventions on EAT volume reduction was significant, favouring pharmaceutical interventions (ES: -0.79, 95% CI: -1.37 to -0.21, P < 0.0072). In conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that exercise, diet, bariatric surgery and pharmaceutical interventions can reduce cardiac adipose tissue volume.","Launbo, Natja; Zobel, Emilie H; von Scholten, Bernt Johan; Faerch, Kristine; Jørgensen, Peter G; Christensen, Regitse H",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,628,32

Therefore, for COVID-19 patients with tumors, the mortality rate may be significantly higher than other people. Clinical studies had found that some patients were complicated with cytokine storm in clinical treatment, which was also the direct cause of death for some patients.

Here, we report the impact of subnormothermic machine perfusion (SMP) preservation on the protection of >50% macrosteatotic livers. Dietary hepatic steatosis was induced in Wistar rats via 2-day fasting and subsequent 3-day re-feeding with a fat-free, carbohydrate-rich diet. This protocol induces 50-60% macrovesicular steatosis, which should be discarded when preserved via cold storage (CS). The fatty livers were retrieved and preserved for 4 h using either CS in histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate or SMP in polysol solution. Graft functional integrity was evaluated via oxygenated ex vivo reperfusion for 2 h at 37°C. SMP resulted in significant reductions in not only parenchymal alanine aminotransferase (p < 0.001), but also mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001) enzyme release. Moreover, portal venous pressure (p = 0.047), tissue adenosine triphosphate (p = 0.001), bile production (p < 0.001), high-mobility group box protein-1 (p < 0.001), lipid peroxidation, and tissue glutathione were all significantly improved by SMP. Electron microscopy revealed that SMP alleviated deleterious alterations of sinusoidal microvasculature and hepatocellular mitochondria, both of which are characteristic disadvantages associated with steatosis. SMP could protect 50-60% macrosteatotic livers from preservation/reperfusion injury, and may thus represent a new means for expanding available donor pools.","Okamura, Y; Hata, K; Tanaka, H; Hirao, H; Kubota, T; Inamoto, O; Kageyama, S; Tamaki, I; Yermek, N; Yoshikawa, J; Uemoto, S",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,628,33

The study aimed to assess whether the heterogenicity of testicular histopathology and seminiferous tubules can predict the outcome of microdissection testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) in men with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA).The study comprised a retrospective analysis of 94 patients with azoospermia who were referred from 2016 to 2017. Under optical magnification, they were classified into 2 groups based on the diameter of tubules intraoperatively, namely homogeneous tubules and heterogeneous tubules. Postoperatively, patients were divided into 2 groups of heterogeneous histopathology and homogeneous histopathology according to the 8 histopathological classification subgroups. The sperm retrieval rate was the main outcome.Testicular spermatozoa were successfully retrieved in 27 men (28%). The sperm retrieval rate in those with heterogeneous histopathology was higher than men with homogeneous histopathology (47% vs 12%; P < .001). The sperm retrieval rate of each histopathological subgroup in men who had the heterogeneous histopathology was higher, compared with the homogeneous histopathology (Sertoli cell only [SCO]: 30% vs 6%; maturation arrest [MA]: 38% vs 0%; tubular hyalinization: 42% vs 20%, respectively).

Vegetation and green spaces have shown reductive effects on air-borne pollutants concentrations, especially of particulate matter (PM). Guidance on green space utilisation for air quality control remains scarce, however, as does its application in practise. To strengthen the foundation for research and interventions, we undertook a critical review of the state of science from a public health perspective. We used inter-disciplinary search strategies for published reviews on green spaces and air pollution in key scientific databases. Using the PRISMA checklist, we systematically identified reviews with quantitative analyses. For each of the presented PM mitigation mechanisms, we conducted additional searches focused on the most recent articles published between 2016 and early 2021. The included reviews differentiate three mitigation mechanisms of green spaces for PM: deposition, dispersion and modification. The most studied mechanism is deposition, particularly measures of mass and settling velocity of PM on plant leaves. We consolidate how green space setups differ by scale and context in their potentials to reduce peak exposures, stationary (point) or mobile (line) pollution sources, and the potentially most harmful PM components. The assessed findings suggest diverse optimisation options for green space interventions, particularly concerning plant selection, spatial setup, ventilation and maintenance - all alongside the consideration of supplementary vegetation effects like on temperature or water. Green spaces' reductive effects on air-borne PM concentrations are considerable, multi-mechanistic and varied by scale, context and vegetation characteristics. Such effect-modifying factors must be considered when rethinking public space design, as accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Weak linkages amid involved disciplines motivate the development of a research framework to strengthen health-oriented guidance. We conclude on an urgent need for an integrated and risk-based approach to PM mitigation through green space interventions.","Diener, Arnt; Mudu, Pierpaolo",The Science of the total environment,628,7

METHODS Seventy-one patients [38 male, 33 female, mean age 47.2 years (range 18 to 81)] with surgery for an intracranial neuroepithelial tumor were included in this prospective single-center study. Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) and extensive neurocognitive testing (divided into the categories attention, memory, and executive functions and adjusted for age, sex, and education) were performed pre-(t0) and early postoperatively (t1). Part of the patient cohort (n = 32) also underwent neurocognitive testing during follow-up (t2). The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KPS) was used to assess patients' functional independence. Patients' quality of life was recorded by the Short Form 36 (SF 36) pre- and postoperatively in a part of the patient cohort. Pre- and postoperative comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon-test for paired samples. Post hoc Bonferroni correction was performed to adjust for multiple testing. To assess the influence of risk factors on neurocognitive functions, Spearman correlations and the chi-squared test were performed. Subgroup analyses for patients with low-grade and high-grade tumors were performed. RESULTS Postoperative deterioration was observed in 5 of 39 subtests of extensive neurocognitive testing in all 3 categories, whereas no improvement was shown. Patients with WHO Grade I tumors showed no deterioration of cognitive functions. Patients with WHO Grade II and III tumors showed significantly worse results in the executive functions category patients with WHO Grade IV tumors showed deterioration in the attention category. Significantly worse functional independence was recorded postoperatively and during follow-up (P < 0.001). Patients reported poorer physical health (SF 36, P = 0.001) at t1, whereas mental health did not differ significantly (P = 0.480). Risk factors for postoperative deterioration of cognition are low KPS scores, postoperative radiotherapy and tumor location in the temporal lobe. CONCLUSIONS After surgery on an intracranial neuroepithelial tumor, early postoperative deterioration of neurocognitive functions, functional independence and physical health occur. Similar results were also shown during follow-up suggesting that these effects are not only due to postoperative systemic factors or fatigue. This knowledge might improve perioperative surveillance of neurocognitive functions.","Bette, Stefanie; Gradtke, Corinna V; Cammardella, Jasmin Hernandez; Albertshauser, Jennifer; Wiestler, Benedikt; Barz, Melanie; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Ryang, Yu-Mi; Ringel, Florian; Gempt, Jens",Journal of neuro-oncology,628,1

Hypovolemia is associated with increased sympathetic nervous activity. However, many other stimuli, such as pain, also increase sympathetic activity. Since pain is often present in trauma patients, its effect on the indirect measures of hypovolemia needs to be clarified. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the effects of hypovolemia and pain on tissue oxygen saturation (measurement sites: cerebral, deltoid, forearm, and thenar) and finger photoplethysmographic perfusion index. DESIGN Experimental study. SETTING University hospital clinical circulation and research laboratory. SUBJECTS Twenty healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS Central hypovolemia was induced with lower body negative pressure (-60 mm Hg) and pain by the cold pressor test (ice water exposure). Interventions were performed in a 2×2 fashion with the combination of lower body negative pressure or not (normovolemia), and ice water or not (sham). Each subject was thus exposed to four experimental sequences, each lasting for 8 minutes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Measurements were averaged over 30 seconds. For each person and sequence, the minimal value was analyzed. Tissue oxygenation in all measurement sites and finger perfusion index were reduced during hypovolemia/sham compared with normovolemia/sham. Tissue oxygen saturation (except cerebral) and perfusion index were reduced by pain during normovolemia. There was a larger reduction in tissue oxygenation (all measurement sites) and perfusion index during hypovolemia and pain than during normovolemia and pain. CONCLUSIONS Pain (cold pressor test) reduces tissue oxygen saturation in all measurement sites (except cerebral) and perfusion index. In the presence of pain, tissue oxygen saturation and perfusion index are further reduced by hypovolemia (lower body negative pressure, -60 mm Hg). Thus, pain must be considered when evaluating tissue oxygen saturation and perfusion index as markers of hypovolemia in trauma patients.","Høiseth, Lars Ø; Hisdal, Jonny; Hoff, Ingrid E; Hagen, Ove A; Landsverk, Svein A; Kirkebøen, Knut A",Critical care medicine,628,16

While obliteration of covered branches in the anterior circulation is generally asymptomatic, this has not been studied within the posterior circulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between branch coverage and occlusion, as well as associated ischemic events in a cohort of patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively maintained databases at 8 academic institutions from 2009 to 2016 was performed to identify patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the Pipeline Embolization Device. Branch coverage following placement was evaluated, including the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, superior cerebellar artery, and posterior cerebral artery. If the Pipeline Embolization Device crossed the ostia of the contralateral vertebral artery, its long-term patency was assessed as well. RESULTS A cohort of 129 consecutive patients underwent treatment of 131 posterior circulation aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device. Adjunctive coiling was used in 40 (31.0%) procedures. One or more branches were covered in 103 (79.8%) procedures. At a median follow-up of 11 months, 11% were occluded, most frequently the vertebral artery (34.8%). Branch obliteration was most common among asymptomatic aneurysms (P < .001). Ischemic complications occurred in 29 (22.5%) procedures. On multivariable analysis, there was no significant difference in ischemic complications in cases in which a branch was covered (P = .24) or occluded (P = .16). CONCLUSIONS There was a low occlusion incidence in end arteries following branch coverage at last follow-up. The incidence was higher in the posterior cerebral artery and vertebral artery where collateral supply is high. Branch occlusion was not associated with a significant increase in ischemic complications.","Adeeb, N; Griessenauer, C J; Dmytriw, A A; Shallwani, H; Gupta, R; Foreman, P M; Shakir, H; Moore, J; Limbucci, N; Mangiafico, S; Kumar, A; Michelozzi, C; Zhang, Y; Pereira, V M; Matouk, C C; Harrigan, M R; Siddiqui, A H; Levy, E I; Renieri, L; Marotta, T R; Cognard, C; Ogilvy, C S; Thomas, A J",AJNR.

If all capillaries had identical extraction properties, this physical limitation would render vasodilation and increased blood flow insufficient means to meet increased metabolic demands in the brain, heart, and other organs. In 1920, Danish physiologist August Krogh was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his solution to this conceptual problem: Capillary recruitment, the opening of previously closed capillaries. Today, capillary recruitment mainly lives on i textbooks. When we suspect symptoms might represent hypoxia of a vascular origin, we search for relevant, flow-limiting conditions in our patients and rarely ascribe hypoxia or hypoxemia to short capillary transit times. This Primer describes how natural changes in capillary transit-time heterogeneity (CTH) and capillary hematocrit (across open capillaries) during increases in blood flow can match oxygen availability to metabolic demands in normal tissue, and how the assumption of negligible CTH lead us to underestimate capillaries' role in tissue oxygenation. CTH and capillary hematocrit depend on plasma viscosity, on the number, size and deformability of blood cells and their interactions with capillary endothelium, on the glycocalyx, endothelial cells, basement membrane, and pericytes that define the capillary lumen, and on any external compression. The Primer describes how risk factor- and disease-related changes in CTH and capillary hematocrit interfere with flow-metabolism coupling and tissue oxygenation, and discusses whether such capillary dysfunction contributes to vascular disease pathology.","Østergaard, Leif",Journal of applied physiology,628,1

The US government has sponsored the development of medical countermeasures, including vaccines, for public health emergencies; however, federally supported programs, including the Public Health and Emergency Preparedness program and Cities Readiness Initiative, have historically emphasized antibiotic pill dispensing over mass vaccination. While mass vaccination and pill dispensing programs share similarities, they also have fundamental differences that require dedicated preparedness efforts to address. To date, only a limited number of public assessments of local mass vaccination operational capabilities have been conducted. To fill this gap, we interviewed 37 public health and preparedness officials representing 33 jurisdictions across the United States. We aimed to characterize their existing mass vaccination operational capacities and identify challenges and lessons learned in order to support the efforts of other jurisdictions to improve mass vaccination preparedness. We found that most jurisdictions were not capable of or had not planned for rapidly vaccinating their populations within a short period of time (eg, 1 to 2 weeks). Many also noted that their focus on pill dispensing was driven largely by federal funding requirements and that preparedness efforts for mass vaccination were often self-motivated. Barriers to implementing rapid mass vaccination operations included insufficient personnel qualified to administer vaccinations, increased patient load compared to pill-dispensing modalities, logistical challenges to maintaining cold chain, and operational challenges addressing high-risk populations, including children, pregnant women, and non-English-speaking populations. Considering the expected availability of a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine for distribution and dispensing to the public, our findings highlight critical considerations for planning possible future mass vaccination events, including during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Hosangadi, Divya; Shearer, Matthew P; Warmbrod, Kelsey Lane; Kan, Lilly; Cantu, Michelle; Nuzzo, Jennifer",Health security,628,31

Telephone-based assessment may be of particular value during times when it is important to reduce in-person contract, such as during the Covid-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to investigate concurrent validity of the telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND for the assessment of manual ability in individuals with stroke. METHODS Using a cross-sectional study design, participants with stroke were invited to answer the ABILHAND questionnaire on 2 randomized occasions, face to face and by telephone, 5 to 7 days apart. The mean difference (MD) between the interviews was calculated (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) to investigate the concurrent validity. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and weighted κ coefficients were used to investigate the agreement between face-to-face and telephone-based administration. RESULTS One hundred two participants (50 men; mean age = 65 years, SD = 13 years) were included. No significant differences were observed between the mean scores obtained with face-to-face and telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND (MD = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.72 to 0.60). Very high agreement was found between face-to-face and telephone-based administration (ICC = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) on the ABILHAND total scores. Most of the individual items had moderate or substantial κ agreement. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Telephone-based administration of the ABILHAND is valid for the assessment of manual ability after stroke.

Aim of this work was evaluating use of a Lung Sealant System (Pleuraseal, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, U.S.A.) in pleural decortications for empyema thoracis. METHODS From January 2008 to December 2008, 46 consecutive patients received pleural decortications for empyema thoracis. Post-procedural and malignancy-related empyemas were excluded. After hydro-pneumatic test and surgical correction of AL (until satisfaction), patients were assigned (23 per group) to Control or Sealant group. Control group underwent no additional interventions. In Sealant group, lung sealant was applied over AL areas. Following variables were measured daily: patients with AL; time to chest drainage (CD) removal; CD drainage volume at removal, postoperative length of hospital stay, postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocyte counts. Personnel recording parameters were blinded to intervention. Two-tailed t-tests (normally distributed data) or Mann - Whitney U-test (not-normally distributed data) were used for evaluating significance of differences between group means or medians. Significance of any proportional differences in attributes were evaluated using Fisher's Exact Test. Statistical analysis was carried out using R-software (version 2.8.1). RESULTS Groups were similar regarding demographic and baseline characteristics. No patients were withdrawn from study; no adverse effects were recorded. There were no significative differences on CRP and leukocyte levels between two groups. Compared with the Control group, in Sealant group significantly fewer patients had AL (30 versus 78%, p = 0.012), and drains were inserted for a shorter time (medians, 3 versus 5 days, p = 0.05). Postoperative hospitalization time was shorter in Sealant group than in control group, but difference was not significant (0.7 days, p = 0.121). CONCLUSIONS Pleuraseal Lung Sealant System significantly reduces AL following pleural decortications for empyema and, despite of not-increased infectious indexes, is suitable for routinely use, even in procedures with contaminated pleura.","Bertolaccini, Luca; Lybéris, Paraskevas; Manno, Emilpaolo",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,628,1

Among the first promising repurposing agents proposed for treatment and prophylaxis, 2 antimalarial agents came into limelight: chloroquine and its less toxic derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Intense research and public debates have followed. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY As HCQ is still used and studied, future research may bring novel evidence, modifying the state-of-the-art. Despite the lack of a single randomized control trial (RCT) with positive results, there are currently (as for the search on 30th of August 2020) more than 250 RCT registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with HCQ in COVID patients, and more than 150 of them are ""still recruiting"" or ""not yet recruiting"" patients. DATA SOURCES Our study combines a therapeutic evaluation of RCT data with a sociological analysis of related controversies, examining scientific and public arena discourses. RESULTS Although any hope of a positive effect was brought exclusively by some and not all of the observational studies, none of the 7 RCT published until now have found any benefit. From a sociological perspective, the HCQ controversy is a useful case study for understanding the construction of plausibility in a cultural context polarized into competing versions of reality, with different epistemologies and ideologies. CONCLUSIONS The results of the first RCTs have been published, and they are disappointing; beneficial effects of HCQ could not be proven either for negative conversion on polymerase chain reactions of COVID patients or for postexposure prophylaxis. The question to be asked is: how many studies do we need until HCQ is abandoned? Argumentative time work, appealing to temporal properties of HCQ including its historical use, accumulation of evidence, alternative therapeutic scenarios, and sensationalist tempo for rhetorical purpose, plays a significant role in its continuing legitimation.","Rughiniş, Cosima; Dima, Lorena; Vasile, Sorina",American journal of therapeutics,628,1

The association of intravenous alteplase treatment and thrombus characteristics with recanalization over time is important for stroke triage and future trial design. Objective To examine recanalization over time across a range of intracranial thrombus occlusion sites and clinical and imaging characteristics in patients with ischemic stroke treated with intravenous alteplase or not treated with alteplase. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter prospective cohort study of 575 patients from 12 centers (in Canada, Spain, South Korea, the Czech Republic, and Turkey) with acute ischemic stroke and intracranial arterial occlusion demonstrated on computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Exposures Demographics, clinical characteristics, time from alteplase to recanalization, and intracranial thrombus characteristics (location and permeability) defined on CTA. Main Outcomes and Measures Recanalization on repeat CTA or on first angiographic acquisition of affected intracranial circulation obtained within 6 hours of baseline CTA, defined using the revised arterial occlusion scale (rAOL) (scores from 0 [primary occlusive lesion remains the same] to 3 [complete revascularization of primary occlusion]). Results Among 575 patients (median age, 72 years [IQR, 63-80]; 51.5% men; median time from patient last known well to baseline CTA of 114 minutes [IQR, 74-180]), 275 patients (47.8%) received intravenous alteplase only, 195 (33.9%) received intravenous alteplase plus endovascular thrombectomy, 48 (8.3%) received endovascular thrombectomy alone, and 57 (9.9%) received conservative treatment. Median time from baseline CTA to recanalization assessment was 158 minutes (IQR, 79-268); median time from intravenous alteplase start to recanalization assessment was 132.5 minutes (IQR, 62-238). Successful recanalization occurred at an unadjusted rate of 27.3% (157/575) overall, including in 30.4% (143/470) of patients who received intravenous alteplase and 13.3% (14/105) who did not (difference, 17.1% [95% CI, 10.2%-25.8%]). Among patients receiving alteplase, the following factors were associated with recanalization: time from treatment start to recanalization assessment (OR, 1.28 for every 30-minute increase in time [95% CI, 1.18-1.38]), more distal thrombus location, eg, distal M1 middle cerebral artery (39/84 [46.4%]) vs internal carotid artery (10/92 [10.9%]) (OR, 5.61 [95% CI, 2.38-13.26]), and higher residual flow (thrombus permeability) grade, eg, hairline streak (30/45 [66.7%]) vs none (91/377 [24.1%]) (OR, 7.03 [95% CI, 3.32-14.87]). Conclusions and Relevance In patients with acute ischemic stroke, more distal thrombus location, greater thrombus permeability, and longer time to recanalization assessment were associated with recanalization of arterial occlusion after administration of intravenous alteplase; among patients who did not receive alteplase, rates of arterial recanalization were low. These findings may help inform treatment and triage decisions in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Menon, Bijoy K; Al-Ajlan, Fahad S; Najm, Mohamed; Puig, Josep; Castellanos, Mar; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Calleja, Ana; Sohn, Sung-Il; Ahn, Seong H; Poppe, Alex; Mikulik, Robert; Asdaghi, Negar; Field, Thalia S; Jin, Albert; Asil, Talip; Boulanger, Jean-Martin; Smith, Eric E; Coutts, Shelagh B; Barber, Phil A; Bal, Simerpreet; Subramanian, Suresh; Mishra, Sachin; Trivedi, Anurag; Dey, Sadanand; Eesa, Muneer; Sajobi, Tolulope; Goyal, Mayank; Hill, Michael D; Demchuk, Andrew M",JAMA,628,19

Research into SDM has stemmed from primary and secondary care contexts, and research into the implementation of SDM in tertiary care settings has not been systematically reviewed. Furthermore, perspectives on SDM beyond those of patients and their treating clinicians may add insights into the implementation of SDM. This systematic review aimed to review literature exploring barriers and facilitators to implementing SDM in hospital settings from multiple stakeholder perspectives. METHODS The search strategy focused on peer-reviewed qualitative studies with the primary aim of identifying barriers and facilitators to implementing SDM in hospital (tertiary care) settings. Studies from the perspective of patients, clinicians, health service administrators, and decision makers, government policy makers, and other stakeholders (for example researchers) were eligible for inclusion. Reported qualitative results were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify behavioural barriers and facilitators to SDM. RESULTS Titles and abstracts of 8724 articles were screened and 520 were reviewed in full text. Fourteen articles met inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 12) were conducted in the last four years; only four reported perspectives in addition to the patient-clinician dyad. In mapping results to the TDF, the dominant themes were Environmental Context and Resources, Social/Professional Role and Identity, Knowledge and Skills, and Beliefs about Capabilities. A wide range of barriers and facilitators across individual, organisational, and system levels were reported. Barriers specific to the hospital setting included noisy and busy ward environments and a lack of private spaces in which to conduct SDM conversations. CONCLUSIONS SDM implementation research in hospital settings appears to be a young field. Future research should build on studies examining perspectives beyond the clinician-patient dyad and further consider the role of organisational- and system-level factors. Organisations wishing to implement SDM in hospital settings should also consider factors specific to tertiary care settings in addition to addressing their organisational and individual SDM needs.

MR scans were assessed by Tumour Volume Score (TVS), an estimation of the tumour volume as a percentage of the total synovial cavity. PET-CT scans were evaluated based on maximum standardized uptake value (SUV-max). Partial response was defined as more than 50% tumour reduction with TVS and a decrease of at least 30% on SUV-max. RESULTS Median duration of IM treatment was 7.0 (IQR 4.2-11.5) months. Twenty patients (80%) discontinued IM treatment for poor response or intended surgery. Twenty patients experienced an adverse event grade 1-2, three patients grade 3 (creatinine increment, neutropenic sepsis, liver dysfunction). MR assessment of all joints showed 32% (6/19) partial response and 63% (12/19) stable disease, with a mean difference of 12% (P = 0.467; CI -22.4-46.0) TVS between pre- and post-IM and a significant mean difference of 23% (P = 0.021; CI 4.2-21.6) in all knee lesions. PET-CT, all joints, showed a significantly decreased mean difference of 5.3 (P = 0.004; CI 1.9-8.7) SUV-max between pre- and post-IM treatment (58% (11/19) partial response, 37% (7/19) stable disease). No correlation between MR imaging and PET-CT could be appreciated in 15 patients with complete radiological data. CONCLUSION This study confirms the moderate radiological response of IM in diffuse-type TGCT. PET-CT is a valuable additional diagnostic tool to quantify response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Its value should be assessed further to validate its efficacy in the objective measurement of biological response in targeted systemic treatment of TGCT.","Mastboom, M J L; Lips, W; van Langevelde, K; Mifsud, M; Ng, C; McCarthy, C L; Athanasou, N A; Gibbons, C L M H; van de Sande, M A J",Surgical oncology,628,20

Urban site traffic emissions were the major contributor to the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, toluene, and xylenes, while benzene and PM1 concentrations were presented in significant spatial variations. K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, NO3-, Cl- and SO42- ions were analyzed for the chemical characterization of the collected PM samples. The results showed that Na+ cations and SO42- anions were the dominant species, during winter and summer, respectively, in both sites. The analysis of the synoptic scale and mesoscale atmospheric circulation during the experimental periods demonstrated that the meteorological conditions play a key role, not only in the variation but also in the distribution of the ionic concentrations at the three fractions of particulates and the dominant character (alkaline/acidic/neutral) of the particulates at the two sampling sites.","Pateraki, St; Maggos, Th; Michopoulos, J; Flocas, H A; Asimakopoulos, D N; Vasilakos, Ch",Chemosphere,628,16

Stressors originating in the workplace (job insecurity and remote work) and in the family (stressful familial social ties) were examined in a sample of 232 working adults in the southeastern United States. Individuals were more likely to reactivate their dormant ties when their job was insecure, and the magnitude of the reactivations was greater among individuals experiencing stressful social ties with family members than those not experiencing those stressors. We also found that there was a significant interaction between remote work and having a stressful tie within the household in dormant tie reactivation. Although previous theory has focused mostly on the benefits of frequent, active social relationships for coping, our results suggest that reactivating dormant ties might be a coping mechanism as well. Our study also suggests that workplace dormant tie research should broaden its focus beyond exchanged instrumental support to consider emotional support that might be transferred during reactivation.

Materials and Methods Consecutive patients aged 6 months to 2 years were enrolled at our institution between June 2013 and May 2017. Consenting patients were randomized to antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus no antibiotic. Patients had catheterized urine samples obtained at surgery and 6-10 days postoperatively. The primary outcome was bacteriuria and pyuria at postoperative urine collection. Secondary outcomes included symptomatic urinary tract infection and postoperative complications. Results 70 patients consented to the study, of which 35 were randomized to receive antibiotics compared to 32 who did not. Demographics, severity of hypospadias, and type of repair were similar between the groups. Patients in the treatment group had significantly less pyuria (18%) and bacteriuria (11%) present at stent removal compared to the nontreatment group (55% and 63%; p=0.01 and p < 0.001, resp.).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OROS hydromorphone extended-release (ER) compared with placebo in patients with moderate to severe pain associated with OA. METHODS This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, fixed-dose study. Patients received placebo or fixed-dose OROS hydromorphone ER (8 or 16 mg). The primary efficacy measure was pain intensity score (11-point Numeric Rating Scale) at Maintenance Week 12, analyzed with baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) imputation for missing data. RESULTS This study did not meet the primary efficacy measure using the BOCF imputation. Study discontinuation was high (52%). When analyzed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation, the prespecified alternate method, OROS hydromorphone ER 16 mg provided significantly better analgesia than placebo (P = 0.0009). Treatment was associated with significant improvements in patient global assessment (P = 0.01), the overall Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (P = 0.0003), and its subscales: pain (P = 0.0001), stiffness (P = 0.0023), and physical function (P = 0.0006). Gastrointestinal adverse events, such as constipation and nausea, were common among patients receiving OROS hydromorphone ER. CONCLUSIONS OROS hydromorphone ER failed to achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint using the prespecified imputation method (BOCF), likely due to the high discontinuation rate associated with the fixed-dose design. When data were analyzed according to an alternate method of imputation (LOCF), OROS hydromorphone ER demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain, stiffness, and physical function.","Rauck, Richard; Rapoport, Ronald; Thipphawong, John",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,628,29

Since Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) normally enters hosts via the mucosal surface of the lung, the best defense against Mtb is mucosal vaccines that are capable of inducing both systemic and mucosal immunity. Although Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin is the only licensed tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, its efficacy against adult pulmonary forms of TB is variable. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of a novel mucosal TB vaccine using recombinant human parainfluenza type 2 virus (rhPIV2) as a vaccine vector in BALB/c mice. Replication-incompetent rhPIV2 (M gene-eliminated) expressing Ag85B (rhPIV2-Ag85B) was constructed by reverse genetics technology. Intranasal administration of rhPIV2-Ag85B induced Mtb-specific immune responses, and the vaccinated mice showed a substantial reduction in the number of CFU of Mtb in lungs and spleens. Unlike other viral vaccine vectors, the immune responses against Ag85B induced by rhPIV2-Ag85B immunization had an advantage over that against the viral vector. In addition, it was revealed that rhPIV2-Ag85B in itself has an adjuvant activity through the retinoic acid-inducible gene I receptor. These findings provide further evidence for the possibility of rhPIV2-Ag85B as a novel TB vaccine.","Watanabe, Kenta; Matsubara, Akihiro; Kawano, Mitsuo; Mizuno, Satoru; Okamura, Tomotaka; Tsujimura, Yusuke; Inada, Hiroyasu; Nosaka, Tetsuya; Matsuo, Kazuhiro; Yasutomi, Yasuhiro",Vaccine,628,1

However, the prevalence of OSA among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and relationship to outcomes is poorly characterized, and the relevance of other sleep disorders remains unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of pre-existing sleep disorders and association with outcomes related to severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the University of Michigan Hospital System were included. Electronic medical records were queried for sleep disorders diagnostic codes. Data was extracted from polysomnography and home sleep testing in a subgroup with previous diagnostic testing at our center. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of sleep disorders with mechanical ventilation requirement, treatment with vasopressors, and death, and Cox proportional hazards regression for time to discharge. RESULTS Among N=572 adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 113 (19.8%) patients had OSA, 4 patients had central sleep apnea (CSA) (0.7%), 5 had hypoventilation (0.9%), 63 had insomnia (11.0%), and 22 had restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements disorder (RLS/PLMD) (3.9%). After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and race, no significant relationship was apparent between sleep disorders diagnoses or indices of sleep disordered breathing severity and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to determine the prevalence of OSA and other sleep disorders in a well-characterized cohort of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Once hospitalized, a significant contribution of sleep disorders to outcomes was not identified. Therefore, future evaluations should focus on earlier outcomes, such as infection or clinical manifestations after exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Goldstein, Cathy A; Rizvydeen, Muneer; Conroy, Deirdre A; O'Brien, Louise M; Gupta, Gita; Somers, Emily C; Sharma, Pratima; Golob, Jonathan L; Troost, Jonathan P; Burgess, Helen J",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,628,10

We propose that a quick and simple, novel, barbed technique without any exposed barbs on the tendon surface has comparable strength and a smaller cross-sectional area at the repair site than traditional methods of repair. METHODS Forty porcine flexor tendons were randomized to polybutester 4-strand barbed repair or to 4-strand Adelaide monofilament repair. The cross-sectional area was measured before and after repair. Biomechanical testing was carried out and 2-mm gap formation force, ultimate strength of repair, and method of failure were recorded. RESULTS The mean ultimate strength of the barbed repairs was 54.51 ± 17.9 while that of the Adelaide repairs was 53.17 ± 16.35. The mean 2-mm gap formation force for the barbed group was 44.71 ± 17.86 whereas that of the Adelaide group was 20.25 ± 4.99. The postrepair percentage change in cross-sectional area at the repair site for the Adelaide group and barbed group was 12.0 ± 2.3 and 4.6 ± 2.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that a 4-strand knotless, barbed method attained comparable strength to that of the traditional Adelaide repair technique. The barbed method had a significantly reduced cross-sectional area at the repair site compared with the Adelaide group. The 2-mm gap formation force was less in the barbed group than the Adelaide group. Barbed repairs show promise for tendon repairs; this simple method warrants further study in an animal model.","Joyce, Cormac W; Sugrue, Conor; Chan, Jeffrey C; Delgado, Luis; Zeugolis, Dimitrios; Carroll, Seam M; Kelly, Jack L",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

However, its efficacy is limited because of its low solubility and bioavailability. Therefore, the present study aimed to encapsulate 4-HIA using biocompatible copolymer polylactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) and evaluate its antioxidant and neuroprotective potential. Methods The nanoparticles (NPs) were fabricated by solid/oil/water (s/o/w) emulsion technique and characterized using XRD, SEM, HR-TEM, and FTIR spectroscopy. Antioxidant assays such as 1,1 diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), superoxide, and hydroxyl radical scavenging ability were performed to assess the antioxidant potential of the fabricated NPs. Results The bioactive component, 4-HIA, was efficiently encapsulated by the PLGA polymer and was found to be spherical and smooth with a size <10nm. 4-HIA showed better scavenging capability in DPPH and superoxide assays as compared to 4-HIA encapsulated PLGA and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). In contrast, 4-HIA encapsulated PLGA NPs exhibited a significant hydroxyl radical scavenging activity than 4-HIA and BHT alone. Further, the encapsulated NPs efficiently curtailed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Conclusion Our findings indicate that 4-HIA encapsulated PLGA NPs might be a therapeutic intervention towards the effective management of oxidative stress as it has exhibited efficient neuroprotective potential against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells.","Ravikiran, Tekupalli; Anand, Santosh; Ansari, Mohammad Azam; Alomary, Mohammad N; AlYahya, Sami; Ramachandregowda, Sowbhagya; Alghamdi, Saad; Sindhghatta Kariyappa, Anupama; Dundaiah, Bhagyalakshmi; Madhugiri Gopinath, Mamatha; Sultana, Sumreen; Punekar, Shital Manohar; Lakshmeesha, Thimappa Ramachandrappa",International journal of nanomedicine,628,20

METHODS This retrospective study involved subjects from seven centers that were admitted and found to be positive for H1N1 or COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction test. RESULTS A total of 143 patients with H1N1 and 309 patients with COVID-19 were involved in the study. H1N1 patients were younger than COVID-19 ones. While 58.7% of H1N1 patients were female, 57.9% of COVID-19 patients were male. Complaints of fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, myalgia, weakness, headache, and shortness of breath in H1N1 patients were statistically higher than in COVID-19 ones. The duration of symptoms until H1N1 patients were admitted to the hospital was shorter than that for COVID-19 patients. Leukopenia was more common in COVID-19 patients. C-reactive protein levels were higher in COVID-19 patients, while lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in H1N1 ones. The mortality rate was also higher in H1N1 cases. CONCLUSIONS The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic is a major public health problem that continues to affect the world with its high rate of contagion. In addition, no vaccines or a specific drug for the benefit of millions of people have been found yet. The H1N1 pandemic is an epidemic that affected the whole world about ten years ago and was prevented by the development of vaccines at a short period. Experience in the H1N1 pandemic may be the guide to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from a worse end.","Kant, Aydın; Kostakoğlu, Uğur; Saral, Özlem Bayraktar; Çomoğlu, Şenol; Arslan, Mustafa; Karakoç, Hanife Nur; Erkan, Gönül; Ertunç, Barış; Demir, Hanzade Duygu; Aydin, Murat; Öztürk, Sinan; Yilmaz, Gürdal",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,628,1

We used a centrifugal microfluidic disk (CMFD) to detect 6 important swine viruses, including foot-and-mouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory swine virus-North American genotype, porcine circovirus 2, pseudorabies virus, and porcine parvovirus. Through integrating the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method and microfluidic chip technology, the CMFD could be successfully performed at 62℃ in 60 min. The detection limit of the CMFD was 3.2 × 102 copies per reaction, close to the sensitivity of tube-type LAMP turbidity methods (1 × 102 copies per reaction). In addition, the CMFD was highly specific in detecting the targeted viruses with no cross-reaction with other viruses, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine rotavirus. The coincidence rate of CMFD and conventional PCR was ~94%; the CMFD was more sensitive than conventional PCR for detecting mixed viral infections. The positive detection rate of 6 viruses in clinical samples by CMFD was 44.0% (102 of 232), whereas PCR was 40.1% (93 of 232). Thirty-six clinical samples were determined to be coinfected with 2 or more viruses. CMFD can be used for rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of 6 swine viruses, offering a reliable assay for monitoring these pathogens, especially for detecting viruses in widespread mixed-infection clinical samples.","Yuan, Xiangfen; Lv, Jizhou; Lin, Xiangmei; Zhang, Chunyan; Deng, Junhua; Wang, Caixia; Fan, Xiaopan; Wang, Yonggui; Xu, Hui; Wu, Shaoqiang","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",628,1

Clinical series describing treatment methods and outcomes for upper abdominal tumors using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac are lacking. We present the first clinical series of upper abdominal tumors treated using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac along with the acquisition of intra-treatment quantitative imaging. MATERIALS/METHODS 10 patients with abdominal tumors were treated at our institution. Each patient enrolled in an IRB approved advanced imaging protocol. Both daily real-time adaptive and non-adaptive methods were used, and selection criteria are described. Adaptive plans were based on pre-beam motion-averaged or mid-position images derived from respiratory-correlated 4D-MRI. Quantitative intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging and T2 mapping were acquired during plan adaptation. Real-time motion monitoring using cine MRI was performed during beam-on. RESULTS Median patient age was 68.2, five patients were female. Tumor types included liver metastatic lesions from melanoma and sarcoma, primary liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and regional abdominal tumors included pancreatic metastatic lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) along with two cases of recurrent pancreatic cancer. Doses included 30 Gy in 6 fractions, 33 Gy in 5 fractions, 50 Gy in 5 fractions, 45 Gy in 3 fractions, and 60 Gy in 3 fractions, depending on the location and clinical circumstances. Treatments were feasible and were successfully completed in all patients without significant acute toxicity, technical complications, or need for back up CT based treatment plans.

BACKGROUND The use of robotic-assisted colon surgery is increasing. Robotic technology is more expensive and whether a robotically assisted approach is cost-effective remains to be determined. METHODS A decision-analytic model was constructed to evaluate the 1-year costs and quality-adjusted time between robotic, laparoscopic, and open colectomy. Model inputs were derived from available literature for costs, quality of life (QOL), and outcomes. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), defined as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effect of clinically reasonable variations in the inputs on our results. RESULTS Open colectomy cost more and achieved lower QOL than robotic and laparoscopic approaches. From the societal perspective, robotic colectomy costs $745 more per case than laparoscopy, resulting in an ICER of $2,322,715/QALY because of minimal differences in QOL. From the healthcare sector perspective, robotics cost $1339 more per case with an ICER of $4,174,849/QALY. In both models, laparoscopic colectomy was more frequently cost-effective across a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Sensitivity analyses suggest robotic colectomy becomes cost-effective at $100,000/QALY if robotic disposable instrument costs decrease below $1341 per case, robotic operating room time falls below 172 minutes, or robotic hernia rate is less than 5%. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic and robotic colectomy are more cost-effective than open resection. Robotics can surpass laparoscopy in cost-effectiveness by achieving certain thresholds in QOL, instrument costs, and postoperative outcomes. With increased use of robotic technology in colorectal surgery, there is a burden to demonstrate these benefits.","Simianu, Vlad V; Gaertner, Wolfgang B; Kuntz, Karen; Kwaan, Mary R; Lowry, Ann C; Madoff, Robert D; Jensen, Christine C",Annals of surgery,628,1

Coronaviruses constitute Nidovirales together with Arteriviridae. Most of human coronaviruses are known to cause mild illness and common cold. However, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2002, ten years after SARS epidemic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) emerged in 2012. Now, we face on a novel coronavirus which emerges in end of 2019. This novel coronavirus is named as SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is spread to worldwide within one to two months and causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), respiratory illness. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses possessing a positive-sense and large single stranded RNA genomes. The 5' two-thirds of the CoV genome consists of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs 1a and 1b) that encode non-structural proteins (nsps). The other one-third of the genome consists of ORFs encoding structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and accessory proteins. Upon infection of CoV into host cells, the translation of two precursor polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, occurs and these polyproteins are cleaved into 16 nsps by viral proteases. Structural proteins assemble to the vesicles located from ER to Golgi (ER Golgiintermediate compartment) and virions bud into the vesicles. Virions are released from infectedcells via exocytosis.","Kamitani, Wataru",Uirusu,628,31

Stress occurs and has potential of negative effects on tasks, teamwork, prioritization processes and cognitive control. Stress is not exclusively dictated by the situation-the individuals rate the situation of having the necessary skills that a particular situation demands. There are different occupational groups in the emergency medical services in Germany. Training, tasks and legal framework of these groups vary. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to identify professional group-specific stressors for emergency medical services. These stress situations can be used to design skills building tools to enable individuals to cope with these stressors. MATERIAL AND METHODS The participants were invited to the study via posters and social media. An expert group (minimum 6 months of experience) developed a set of items via a two-step online Delphi survey. The experts were recruited from all professional groups represented in the German emergency medical service. We evaluated the resulting parameters for relevance and validity in a larger collective. Lastly, we identified stress factors that could be grouped in relevant scales. In total 1017 participants (paramedics, physicians) took part in the final validation survey. RESULTS After validation, we identified a catalogue of stressors with 7 scales and 25 items for EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) paramedics (KMO [Kayser-Meyer-Olkin criterion] 0.81), 6 scales and 24 items for advanced paramedics (KMO 0.82) and 6 scales and 24 items for EMS (Emergency Medical Service) physicians (KMO 0.82). For the professional group of EMT basic, the quality parameters did not allow further processing of the items. Professional group-specific scales for EMT paramedics are ""professional limitations"", ""organizational framework"", ""expectations"" and ""questions of meaning"". For advanced paramedics ""appreciation"", ""exceptional circumstances"" and ""legal certainty"" were identified. The EMT physicians named ""handling third parties"", ""tolerance to ambiguity"", ""task management"" and ""pressure to act"". A scale that is representative for all professional groups is ""teamwork"". Organizational circumstances occur in all groups. The item ""unnecessary missions"" for EMT paramedics and ""legal concerns with the application of methods"" for advanced paramedics are examples. DISCUSSION Different stressors are relevant for the individual professional groups in the German emergency medical service. The developed catalogue can be used in the future to evaluate the subjective stress load of emergency service professionals. There are stressors that are inherent in the working environment (e.g. pressure to act) and others that can be improved through training (teamwork). We recommend training of general resistance as well as training of specific items (e.g., technical, nontechnical skills). All professionals mentioned items with respect to organizational factors. The responsible persons can identify potential for improvement based on the legal and organizational items. The EMT basic requires further subdivision according to task areas due to its variable applicability.","Eismann, Hendrik; Sieg, Lion; Palmaers, Thomas; Hagemann, Vera; Flentje, Markus",Der Anaesthesist,628,5

Preclinical studies have suggested that priming the immune system with various modalities in addition to checkpoint inhibition may overcome the relative T cell exhaustion or senescence; however, in this small dataset, radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibition did not appear to activate the anti-tumor immune response. BACKGROUND Extramedullary disease (EMD) is recognized as an aggressive subentity of multiple myeloma (MM) with a need for novel therapeutic approaches. We therefore designed a proof-of-principle pilot study to evaluate the synergy between the combination of the anti-PD-L1, avelumab, and concomitant hypofractionated radiotherapy. METHODS This was a single-arm phase II Simon two-stage single center study that was prematurely terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic after enrolling 4 patients. Key eligibility included patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who had exhausted or were not candidates for standard therapy and had at least one lesion amenable to radiotherapy. Patients received avelumab until progression or intolerable toxicity and hypofractionated radiotherapy to a focal lesion in cycle 2. Radiotherapy was delayed until cycle 2 to allow the avelumab to reach a study state, given the importance observed in previous studies suggesting that concomitant therapy is needed for the abscopal effect. RESULTS At a median potential follow-up of 10.5 months, there were no objective responses, one minimal response, and two stable disease as best response. The median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 2.5-7.1 months), and no deaths occurred. There were no grade ≥3 and five grade 1-2 treatment-related adverse events. CONCLUSION Avelumab in combination with radiotherapy for patients with RRMM and EMD was associated with very modest systemic clinical benefit; however, patients did benefit as usual from local radiotherapy. Furthermore, the combination was very well tolerated compared with historical RRMM treatment regimens.","Kazandjian, Dickran; Dew, Alexander; Hill, Elizabeth; Ramirez, Elizabeth Gil; Morrison, Candis; Mena, Esther; Lindenberg, Liza; Yuan, Constance; Maric, Irina; Wang, Hao-Wei; Calvo, Katherine; Dulau-Florea, Alina; Roswarski, Joseph; Emanuel, Michael; Braylan, Raul; Turkbey, Boris; Choyke, Peter; Camphausen, Kevin; Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice; Steinberg, Seth M; Figg, William D; Jones, Jennifer",The oncologist,628,1

Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. RECENT FINDINGS Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. This includes corneal transplantation, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in conjunctival swabs of infected patients, and the ocular surface may play an important role in viral entry. Several tissue transplantation organizations have guidelines in place regarding the screening of donors and tissue procurement procedures, including clinical and/or PCR screening of donors. The Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) is currently not recommending asymptomatic PCR screening. However, their antiseptic protocols may play an important role in viral inactivation. SUMMARY Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low. However, tissue screening guidelines need to be re-evaluated regularly as knowledge regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolves.","Ballouz, Dena; Mian, Shahzad I",Current opinion in ophthalmology,628,1

Employing multivariate analysis, significant associations were found between treatment and older age, junior high school education and above (OR=1.25, p＜0.05), being widowed rather than being married or cohabiting (OR=1.28, p＜0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.14, p＜0.05), ex-smoker (OR=1.19, p＜0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.72, p＜0.05), history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR=2.20, p＜0.05) and comorbidities, with a higher probability for those with obesity (OR=1.89, p＜0.05), central obesity (OR=1.10, p＜0.05), diabetes (OR=1.49, p＜0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.20, p＜0.05). Male sex (OR=0.91, p＜0.05), junior high school education and above (OR=1.28, p＜0.05), engaging in physical activity (OR=1.06, p＜0.05), history of CVD (OR=1.82, p＜0.05) and individuals who had diabetes (OR=1.52, p＜0.05) or dyslipidaemia (OR=1.05, p＜0.05) were associated with increased likelihood of control. Aged 80 years and older (OR=0.93, p＜0.05), habitual drinker (OR=0.73, p＜0.05) and central obesity (OR=0.94, p＜0.05) were negatively associated with control of hypertension. CONCLUSIONS We found a high prevalence of hypertension, but a low prevalence of treatment and control among Shenzhen elderly.","Ni, Wenqing; Yuan, Xueli; Zhang, Jia; Li, Ping; Zhang, Hong Min; Zhang, Yan; Xu, Jian",BMJ open,628,12

METHODS We searched three databases, PubMed, EMBASE and EMCARE to identify studies reporting diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection between December 2019 and May 2020. For accurate comparison, only those studies which had patients undergoing both, CT and RT-PCR were included. Pooled diagnostic accuracy of both the tests was calculated by using a bivariate random effects model. RESULTS Based on inclusion criteria, only 11 studies consisting of 1834 patients were included in the final analysis that reported diagnostic accuracy of both CT and RT-PCR, in the same set of patients. Sensitivity estimates for CT scan ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 and for RT-PCR varied ranging from 0.47 to 1.00. The pooled estimates of sensitivity for CT and RT-PCR was 0.91 [95% CI (0.84-0.97)] and 0.84 [95% CI (0.71-0.94)] respectively. On subgroup analysis, pooled sensitivity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.95 [95% CI (0.88-0.98)] and 0.91 [95% CI (0.80-0.96), p = o.ooo1]. The pooled specificity of CT and RT-PCR was 0.31 [95% CI (0.035-0.84)] and 1.00 [95% CI (0.96-1.00)]. CONCLUSION CT is more sensitive than RT-PCR in detecting COVID-19 infection, but has a very low specificity. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Since the results of a CT scan are available quickly, it can be used as an adjunctive initial diagnostic test for patients with a history of positive contact or epidemiological history.","Mair, Manish Devendra Devendra; Hussain, Mohammed; Siddiqui, Saad; Das, Sudip; Baker, Andrew; Conboy, Peter; Valsamakis, Theodoros; Uddin, Javed; Rae, Peter",The British journal of radiology,628,10

We aimed to identify the critical predictors that can effectively assess the disease conditions of patients with COVID-19 by analyzing the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS All consecutive patients (n = 294) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command of the PLA from February 6 to February 21, 2020, were enrolled. These patients were divided into the severe group and the nonsevere group according to disease severity during hospitalization. RESULTS The median neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) value of the severe patients was dramatically higher than that of the nonsevere patients (10.4 vs 2.6; P < .001). The NLR value equal to 5 was a boundary value worthy of reference, because more than 80% severe patients had an NLR value greater than 5 and over 80% nonsevere patients had an NLR value less than 5. The NLR value of these COVID-19 patients was positively and respectively correlated with the values of C-reactive protein (R = .5921, P < .001), lactate dehydrogenase (R = .4509, P < .001), procalcitonin (R = .5504, P < .001), fibrinogen (R = .4710, P < .001), and D-dimers (R = .4425, P < .001). However, the NLR value was merely and positively correlated with the interleukin-6 value (R = .3594, P < .05), but had no correlations with the values of interleukin-10, interleukin-4, interleukin-17, interferon-γ, and tumor necrosis factor-α (P > .05). DISCUSSION Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a critical predictor for assessment of disease severity in patients with COVID-19, and it has a close relation with the laboratory indicators related to disease conditions.","Liu, Lei; Zheng, Yaqiong; Cai, Liping; Wu, Wanlei; Tang, Shi; Ding, Yinjuan; Liu, Wanbing; Kou, Guomei; Xiong, Zhou; Wang, Shengdian; Zheng, Shangen",International journal of laboratory hematology,628,1

Changes in expression of G3BPs are correlated to several cancers including thyroid, colon, pancreatic and breast cancer. G3BPs are important regulators of stress granule (SG) formation and function. SG are ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that respond to cellular stresses to triage mRNA resulting in transcripts being selectively degraded, stored or translated resulting in a change of gene expression which confers a survival response to the cell. These changes in gene expression contribute to the development of drug resistance. Many RNA viruses, including Chikungunya (and potentially Coronavirus), dismantle SG so that the cell cannot respond to the viral infection. Non-structural protein 3 (nsP3), from the Chikungunya virus, has been shown to translocate G3BP away from SG. Interestingly in cancer cells, the formation of SG is correlated to drug-resistance and blocking SG formation has been shown to reestablish the efficacy of the anticancer drug bortezomib. METHODS Chikungunya nsP3 was transfected into breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF7 to disrupt SG formation. Changes in the cytotoxicity of bortezomib were measured. RESULTS Bortezomib cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines changed with a 22 fold decrease in its IC50 for T47D and a 7 fold decrease for MCF7 cells. CONCLUSIONS Chikungunya nsP3 disrupts SG formation. As a result, it increases the cytotoxicity of the FDA approved drug, bortezomib. In addition, the increased cytotoxicity appears to correlate to improved bortezomib selectivity when compared to control cell lines.","Lu, Xue; Alam, Umber; Willis, Charlene; Kennedy, Derek",Archives of medical research,628,17

We surveyed retail investors who are clients of Vanguard at three points in time: 1) on February 11-12, around the all-time stock market high, 2) on March 11-12, after the stock market had collapsed by over 20%, and 3) on April 16-17, after the market had rallied 25% from its lowest point. Following the crash, the average investor turned more pessimistic about the short-run performance of both the stock market and the real economy. Investors also perceived higher probabilities of both further extreme stock market declines and large declines in short-run real economic activity. In contrast, investor expectations about long-run (10-y) economic and stock market outcomes remained largely unchanged, and, if anything, improved. Disagreement among investors about economic and stock market outcomes also increased substantially following the stock market crash, with the disagreement persisting through the partial market recovery. Those respondents who were the most optimistic in February saw the largest decline in expectations and sold the most equity. Those respondents who were the most pessimistic in February largely left their portfolios unchanged during and after the crash.","Giglio, Stefano; Maggiori, Matteo; Stroebel, Johannes; Utkus, Stephen",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,628,11

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-two patients who underwent coil-protected liquid embolization for symptomatic cranial (n = 13) and spinal (n = 9) arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were identified. A total of 36 target feeder vessels were embolized with N-butyl cyanoacrylate and/or Onyx (Medtronic). This technique was used to promote delivery of a sufficient amount of liquid embolic agent into the target shunt or nidus in cases where tortuous feeding arteries preclude a microcatheter wedging techniqu and/or to prevent reflux of the liquid embolic agent in cases with a short safety margin. The procedure was considered technically successful if the target lesion was sufficiently filled with liquid embolic agent without unintentional reflux. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS Technical success was achieved for all 36 target feeders. Post-embolization angiographies revealed complete occlusion in 16 patients and near-complete and partial occlusion in three patients each. There were no treatment-related complications. Of the six patients who showed near-complete or partial occlusion, five received additional treatments: two received stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral AVM, two underwent surgical removal of cerebral AVM, and one underwent additional embolization by direct puncture for a mandibular AVM. Finally, all patients showed complete (n = 19) or near-complete (n = 3) occlusion of the target AVF or AVM on follow-up angiographies. The presenting neurological symptoms improved completely in 15 patients (68.2%) and partially in seven patients (31.8%). CONCLUSION The coil-protected technique is a safe and effective method for liquid embolization, especially in patients with various neurovascular shunts or malformations who could not be successfully treated with conventional techniques.","Park, Keun Young; Kim, Jin Woo; Kim, Byung Moon; Kim, Dong Joon; Chung, Joonho; Jang, Chang Ki; Kim, Jun Hwee",Korean journal of radiology,628,5

METHODS We conducted a single-center hospital-based study and consecutively recruited 122 suspected and 104 confirmed COVID-19 patients during January 24 to April 25, 2020. The clinical risk factors of COVID-19 were identified. The discriminative power of low calcium and phosphorus regarding the disease severity was evaluated. RESULTS Low calcium and low phosphorus are more prevalent in severe/critical COVID-19 patients than moderate COVID-19 patients (OR 15.07, 95%CI 1.59 -143.18 for calcium, OR 6.90, 95%CI 2.43 - 19.64 for phosphorus). The specificity in detecting the severe/critical patients among COVID-19 patients reached 98.5% (95%CI 92.0-99.7%) and 84.4% (95%CI 74.3-91.6%) by low calcium and low phosphorus, respectively, albeit with suboptimal sensitivity. Calcium and phosphorus combined with lymphocyte count could obtain the best discriminative performance for the severe COVID-19 patients (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80), and combined with oxygenation index was promising (AUC = 0.71). Similar discriminative performances of low calcium and low phosphorus were found between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS Low calcium and low phosphorus could indicate the severity of COVID-19 patients, and may be utilized as a promising clinical biomarker for discriminative diagnosis.

Au cours des formes graves, il a été noté une réponse inflammatoire exagérée connue sous le nom de ""orage cytokinique"". Ceci a soulevé la question de la sensibilité et de la gravité de l'infection par le SRAS-CoV2 chez les patients présentant une hyperactivation génétique de l'immunité innée tels que la fièvre méditerranéenne familiale (FMF). En outre, les patients avec FMF prennent de la colchicine au long cours, médicament qui a été testé chez des patients infectés par le SRAS-CoV2 avec des résultats contradictoires [1]. Étude menée sur l'infection par le SRAS-CoV2 chez les patients atteints de FMF suivis dans 2 sites du centre de référence national des maladies autoinflammatoires en région parisienne et inclus dans la JIR cohorte, une base de données européenne multicentrique. Les patients adultes et pédiatriques inclus répondaient aux critères internationaux de FMF et avaient un diagnostic génétique confirmé. Les patients identifiés (n = 627) ont été invités à répondre à un bref questionnaire soit en consultation, soit par téléphone, soit par courrier électronique sur une possible infection par le SARS-CoV2 pendant la période de mars à juin 2020 ;342 patients ont répondu à l'enquête. Le diagnostic était retenu si le patient présentait des symptômes cliniques avec PCR ou sérologie positive ou scanner thoracique typique. Au total, 27 patients FMF (7,8 % des répondants ;sexe ratio 1/1) ont contracté le virus. Tous les 27 patients FMF-COVID+ sauf un prenaient de la colchicine quotidiennement depuis une période médiane de 23 ans, la dose moyenne de colchicine était de 1 mg/jour. Quatre recevaient en plus un inhibiteur de l'IL-1. Parmi les 27 patients FMF-COVID+, sept symptomatiques ont été hospitalisés (25 %) et six ont eu besoin d'oxygène ;trois (11 %) ont développé un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë nécessitant des soins intensifs pour une ventilation mécanique et une hémodialyse. Deux patients sont décédés (7 %) mais présentaient respectivement 3 et 4 comorbidités pour une infection grave par le SRAS-CoV2 ;le troisième patient, âgé de 40 ans, souffrait d'hypertension et d'obésité. Les patients âgés de plus de 65 ans représentaient 17 % de l'ensemble de la cohorte FMF-COVID + ;75 % ont été hospitalisés et ont eu besoin d'oxygène ;l'un d'eux est décédé. Trois patients FMF-COVID + avaient une amylose AA : 2 ont été hospitalisés et un est décédé. Aucun traitement anti-viral supplémentaire n'a été administré. Les 5 survivants après hospitalisation sont rentrés chez eux. Aucun d'entre eux n'a présenté de signes cliniques de crise de FMF lors de l'infection par le SRAS-CoV2. Le profil des patients FMF atteints d'une forme grave ou potentiellement mortelle par le SRAS-CoV2 était le même que celui de la population générale. Ainsi, seuls les patients FMF présentant des facteurs de risque connus (tels que âge avancé, maladie rénale chronique, hypertension, maladie vasculaire, obésité et dysfonctionnement pulmonaire) ont développé une infection grave par le SARS-CoV2 [2]. Cette étude n'est pas en faveur d'un surrisque en soi de développer une infection sévère à SRAS-CoV2 en présence d'une maladie autoinflammatoire monogénique touchant un inflammasome. Aucune conclusion formelle ne peut être tirée sur l'effet préventif de la colchicinothérapie au long cours, bien que ce travail rétrospectif porte sur une large cohorte de patients traités par colchicine depuis plusieurs années. Il est difficile de conclure à l'efficacité du traitement par inhibiteur d'IL1 vis-à-vis l'infection par le SRAS-CoV-2 chez les patients FMF, mais 50 % des patients traités au long cours sont décédés mais avaient plusieurs comorbidités ;et des publications récentes semblent plaider en faveur de l'e ficacité de l'anakinra dans l'infection grave par le SRAS-CoV-2 [3]. La FMF ne semble pas constituer un facteur de risque de développer une forme sévère d'infection par SARS-CoV2 chez les patients traités au long cours par de la colchicine quotidienne, par rapport à la population générale.

In addition to the primary threat of infection, widespread secondary stressors associated with the pandemic have included social isolation, financial insecurity, resource scarcity, and occupational difficulties. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the impact of these disruptions on psychological distress during the initial adjustment phase to the pandemic in North America. METHOD: A sample of 2463 residents of the US and Canada completed both baseline and follow-up surveys across several weeks between March and May 2020. RESULTS: Those participants perceiving stress related to higher levels of personal threat to health and to the well-being of family members at baseline reported higher levels of depressive symptoms at follow-up, even after controlling for baseline depressive symptoms. In addition, pandemic-related secondary stressors (social isolation, financial insecurity, occupational difficulty, and resource scarcity) were all independently associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up, controlling for both baseline depression and perceived health threats. The results were robust and held up after controlling for demographic factors. Women, young adults, and those who reported lower income were all at higher risk for subsequent depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: Findings from the present study can help to identify key groups at risk for mental health problems during the pandemic, and indicate actionable areas for targeted intervention.","Zheng, Jason; Morstead, Talia; Sin, Nancy; Klaiber, Patrick; Umberson, Debra; Kamble, Shanmukh; DeLongis, Anita",Soc Sci Med,628,3

All teleconsultations of employees and students of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and UP Manila (UPM) during the two-week study period in October 2020 were included. Quantitative data was collected from different modes of patient entry into the UPHS telemedicine services: email, Online Consultation Request and Appointment (OCRA) System, and phone hotlines. Qualitative information was gathered as narrative descriptions of observations in the clinic’s service delivery areas. A focus group discussion was also conducted to illustrate the different steps of the pathway used for telemedicine. Results. The telemedicine services of UPHS consisted of virtual triage, COVID-19/non-COVID-19 consultation, and telemonitoring. The UPHS virtual triage received patient concerns through OCRA or the hotline numbers. On the other hand, the COVID-19 teleconsultation service provided care to employees and students who contacted the clinic regarding symptoms or exposure via email. The non-COVID-19 service had teleconsultation for patients with other medical concerns. Coordination among staff and presence of a consultant were identified as good practices, while the areas for improvement include the lack of written protocols in issuing fit-to-work clearance for difficult cases and the optional use of OCRA for UPHS consult. Conclusion. Telemedicine services at the UPHS included tele-triaging, teleconsultations, and telemonitoring with use of phone calls, short messaging service (SMS), emails, and OCRA. Timely coordination, on-site duty consultants, and use of technology were identified as good practices. Lack of protocols and inconsistent OCRA use are areas for improvement. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila. All rights reserved.","Anuran, G. O.; Villarante, K. L.; Mejia-Samonte, M.

OBJECTIVE: The sequential introduction of severe measures, intentionally aiming at reducing the number of new infections, also imposes sharp restrictions on populations with potentially unintended, detrimental effects on public mental health. METHOD: We used observational data reflecting the number of phone calls made to national crisis hotlines in Austria and Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic (January 2020-April 2020) to investigate the impact of government restrictions as well as their later revocations on public mental health. Importantly, both countries have comparable health care systems, are similar in their political and socio-economic idiosyncrasies, and took similar restrictive government measures in order to contain COVID-19-but implemented them at different points in time. RESULTS: Analysis indicated that the number of crisis hotline calls increased in both countries. This increase seemed to occur at around the same time as the implementation of restrictive governmental responses. Importantly, the revocation of these governmental restrictions (i.e., re-opening the economy, allowing more social contact) seemed to occur at around the same time as the decrease in the number of calls. CONCLUSIONS: The present study supports the notion that the implementation of severe measures affects public mental health. However, the negative mental health effects of COVID-19 may be reduced if severe governmental restrictions are kept in place as briefly as possible.","Arendt, Florian; Markiewitz, Antonia; Mestas, Manina; Scherr, Sebastian",Soc Sci Med,628,16

We did a systematic review to assess clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in migrant populations, indirect health and social impacts, and to determine key risk factors. Methods: We did a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42020222135). We searched multiple databases to 18/11/2020 for peer-reviewed and grey literature on migrants (foreign-born) and COVID-19 in 82 high-income countries. We used our international networks to source national datasets and grey literature. Data were extracted on primary outcomes (cases, hospitalisations, deaths) and we evaluated secondary outcomes on indirect health and social impacts and risk factors using narrative synthesis. Results: 3016 data sources were screened with 158 from 15 countries included in the analysis (35 data sources for primary outcomes: cases [21], hospitalisations [4]; deaths [15]; 123 for secondary outcomes). We found that migrants are at increased risk of infection and are disproportionately represented among COVID-19 cases. Available datasets suggest a similarly disproportionate representation of migrants in reported COVID-19 deaths, as well as increased all-cause mortality in migrants in some countries in 2020. Undocumented migrants, migrant health and care workers, and migrants housed in camps have been especially affected. Migrants experience risk factors including high-risk occupations, overcrowded accommodation, and barriers to healthcare including inadequate information, language barriers, and reduced entitlement. Conclusions: Migrants in high-income countries are at high risk of exposure to, and infection with, COVID-19. These data are of immediate relevance to national public health and policy responses to the pandemic. Robust data on testing uptake and clinical outcomes in migrants, and barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 vaccination, are urgently needed, alongside strengthening engagement with diverse migrant groups.","Hayward, Sally E; Deal, Anna; Cheng, Cherie; Crawshaw, Alison; Orcutt, Miriam; Vandrevala, Tushna F; Norredam, Prof Marie; Carballo, Manuel; Ciftci, Yusuf; Requena-Méndez, Ana; Greenaway, Chris; Carter, Jessica; Knights, Felicity; Mehrotra, Anushka; Seedat, Farah; Bozorgmehr, Prof Kayvan; Veizis, Apostolos; Campos-Matos, Ines; Wurie, Fatima; McKee, Prof Martin; Kumar, Prof Bernadette; Hargreaves, Sally",J Migr Health,628,16

Most importantly, the Dox in the DDS can induce significant ICD while Sfn was able to remodel the TME, downregulate Treg, activate effector T cells and relieve programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression. As a result, the synergistic effect of Dox and Sfn achieved strong immune response in CV/D-S treated mice, which is believed to open a new window for the design and development of future platforms for the more effective immunotherapy of cancer.","Wan, Jun; Wang, Jian; Zhou, Min; Rao, Zhanpeng; Ling, Xiean",,628,10

Basal data were collected from 9 December to 9 March and follow-up data from 3 June to 10 July in 2020 for the lockdown group, and during the same timeframes in 2019 for the control groups. Changes in HbA1c (&#916;HbA1c) and body mass index (&#916;BMI) during lockdown were compared among patients with different psychological well-being, as evaluated by tertiles of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBS). RESULTS: No difference in &#916;HbA1c was found between the lockdown and control groups (lockdown group -0.1% [-0.5%-0.3%] vs. control group -0.1% [-0.4%-0.2%]; p = .482).

Abnormal activation of RAS upregulates angiotensin II (Ang-II) and contributes to severe manifestations of COVID-19. Although RAS inhibitors (RASi) are a mainstay of antihypertensive therapy, they have been associated (in some animal studies) with an increase in angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that facilitate cellular entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nonetheless, current medical practice does not recommend curtailing RASi to protect hypertensive patients from COVID. On the contrary, there is clinical evidence to support a beneficial effect of RASi for hypertensive patients in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, although the precise mechanism for this is unclear. In this paper, we hypothesize that RASi reduces the severity of COVID-19 by promoting ACE2-AT1R complex formation at the cell surface, where AT1R mediates the major vasopressor effects of Ang-II. Furthermore, we propose that the interaction between ACE2 and AT1R impedes binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, thereby allowing ACE2 to convert Ang-II to the more beneficial Ang(1-7), that has vasodilator and anti-inflammatory activity. Evidence for ACE2-AT1R complex formation during reduced Ang-II comes from receptor colocalization studies in isolated HEK293 cells, but this has not been confirmed in cells having endogenous expression of ACE2 and AT1R. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus attacks the kidney, as well as the heart and lung, our hypothesis for the effect of RASi on COVID-19 could be tested in vitro using human proximal tubule cells (HK-2), having ACE2 and AT1 receptors. Specifically, colocalization of fluorescent labelled: SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, ACE2, and AT1R in HK-2 cells can be used to clarify the mechanism of RASi action in renal and lung epithelia, which could lead to protocols for reducing the severity of COVID-19 in both hypertensive and normotensive patients.","Sackin, Henry",Med Hypotheses,628,1

Uptake and scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among them has been slow. We used data from Princess PrEP, Thailand's largest KP-led PrEP programme, to operationalize PrEP service cascades. We identified gaps and pointed out where additional data are needed to inform a larger HIV prevention cascade. METHODS: Numbers of people tested for HIV, tested HIV negative, eligible for PrEP (defined as any of the following in the past three months: condomless sex with partners of unknown/uncertain HIV status or antiretroviral treatment or viral load status, multiple partners, engaging in sex work, sexually transmitted infections, injecting drugs, using amphetamine-type stimulants, or repeated use of post-exposure prophylaxis), offered PrEP and accepted PrEP during January to November 2019 were retrieved from Princess PrEP database to inform PrEP service cascades for MSM and TGW. Reasons for not accepting PrEP were documented. RESULTS: Of 6287 MSM who received HIV testing in Princess PrEP, 92.3% were HIV negative and 70.2% of them were eligible for PrEP. PrEP was offered to 94.7% of those eligible and 48.0% of those offered accepted it. Among 900 TGW who had HIV testing, 95.3% tested HIV negative and 64.8% of them met PrEP eligibility criteria. Of these, 95.0% were offered PrEP and 43.9% of them accepted it. Among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria, no or low-HIV-risk perception was the most common reason provided (46.7% of 2007 MSM and 41.9% of 296 TGW) for not accepting PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP service cascades from the Princess PrEP programme identified no or low-risk perception as key barrier to PrEP acceptance among MSM and TGW who met PrEP eligibility criteria. More implementation research studies are needed to explore PrEP motivation and access in larger communities outside of clinical services. This is to identify gaps and strategies to address them within motivation, access and effective use domains of the HIV prevention cascade.","Ramautarsing, Reshmie A; Meksena, Ratchadaporn; Sungsing, Thanthip; Chinbunchorn, Tanat; Sangprasert, Theeranat; Fungfoosri, Orawan; Meekrua, Dusita; Sumalu, Saman; Pasansai, Thapana; Bunainso, Witwasin; Wongsri, Tashada; Mainoy, Nuttakrit; Colby, Donn; Avery, Matthew; Mills, Stephen; Vannakit, Ravipa; Phanuphak, Praphan; Phanuphak, Nittaya",J Int AIDS Soc,628,5

Inhalation devices consist of nebulizers and handheld inhalers, such as dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs). Although pMDIs, DPIs and SMIs may be appropriate for most patients with COPD, certain patient populations may have challenges with these devices. Patients who have cognitive, neuromuscular, or ventilatory impairments (and receive limited assistance from caregivers), as well as those with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow may not derive the full benefit from handheld inhalers. A considerable number of patients are not capable of producing a peak inspiratory flow rate to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs. Furthermore, patients may have difficulty coordinating inhalation with device actuation, which is required for pMDIs and SMIs. However, inhalation devices such as spacers and valved holding chambers can be used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery. Nebulized treatment provides patients with COPD an alternative administration route that avoids the need for inspiratory flow, manual dexterity, or complex hand-breath coordination. The recent approval of two nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonists has added to the extensive range of nebulized therapies in COPD. Furthermore, with the availability of quieter and more portable nebulizer devices, nebulization may be a useful treatment option in the management of certain patient populations with COPD. The aim of this narrative review was to highlight recent updates and the treatment landscape in nebulized therapy and COPD. We first discuss the pathophysiology of patients with COPD and inhalation device considerations. Second, we review the updates on recently approved and newly marketed nebulized treatments, nebulized treatments currently in development, and technological advances in nebulizer devices. Finally, we discuss the current applications of nebulized therapy in patients with COPD.","Barjaktarevic, Igor Z; Milstone, Aaron P",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,628,6

The scenario of Internet of things in the post COVID era will be interesting indeed. Inorder to ensure public health, the social distancing and semi lockdown will continue in the foreseeable future, and therefore, the need of secure remote person authentication methods is being more and more critical especially in the Internet of things which is a multitude of networks consisting of a huge number of uniquely identifiable devices. As far as human_device authentication strategies are concerned, the one which needs less human involvement will be preferable in a post COVID-19 IoT scenario. Moreover, since the range of IoT devices may span from tiny sensors to complex machines, an authentication method which will be adaptable to each and every type of device will be more welcomed. Considering these facts, voice biometric authentication seems to be the most suitable one which can provide a balanced mix of security, adaptivity and convenience to such an advanced world of connectivity. Here, we introduce a lightweight text independent voice biometric method for IoT using extreme learning machines, and we perform a comparative analysis with a deep learning-based method of speaker identification using 3D convolutional neural networks. We have performed experimental study using different datasets and concluded that the extreme learning-based method is more suitable for IoT, considering the trade-off between the recognition accuracy and the training time requirements. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Saleema, A.; Thampi, S.

The objective of this study was to explore the experiences and perceptions of health care workers (HCWs) in primary health care in the management of COVID-19 with respect to medical response experiences, socio-cultural and religious reforms, psychological impressions, and lessons learned. METHODS: This was a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. Six focus group discussions were conducted across various stakeholders working frontline in the management of COVID-19 (managerial, public health/field/community and primary care health centers). They participated in semi-structured, in-depth group discussions from 11th to 20th May 2020. All discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Forty participants were involved in this study. Three themes emerged related to the medical response experiences, including the rapid re-structuring of the PHC services, use of technology and challenges of working on COVID-19. Perceptions on the socio-cultural and religious reforms included changes in social and religious norms, and anticipated gaps in accessing health care among the vulnerable groups (elderly, expatriates, and individuals with low economic status). Perceptions on psychological disturbances were themed as consequences of social distancing, management of dead bodies, exhaustion among the health care workers, and risk of exposure. Finally, lessons learned were centered around building on the existing epidemiological and public health capacities, improving access to health care and overcoming resistance to change. Most participants labelled their experience in COVID-19 as an ""experience of wisdom"" in which learning was a continuous process. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study amongst primary HCWs revealed certain aspects of response to COVID-19 in Muscat, Oman. Results has unfolded various aspects of COVID-19. The situation was perceived by primary HCWs as a new experience that challenged the primary health care; enforced the utilization of public health/epidemiological skills, and linked to unfavorable socio-religious and psychological events.","Al Ghafri, Thamra; Al Ajmi, Fatma; Anwar, Huda; Al Balushi, Lamya; Al Balushi, Zainab; Al Fahdi, Fatma; Al Lawati, Anwaar; Al Hashmi, Salwa; Al Ghamari, Aisha; Al Harthi, Mohamed; Kurup, PadmaMohan; Al Lamki, Mustafa; Al Manji, Asim; Al Sharji, Abdallah; Al Harthi, Saud; Gibson, Emma",J Prim Care Community Health,628,12

A major concern is whether such patients experience more severe form of disease thus higher risk of acute, irreversible liver injury. If serious, this may necessitate re-transplantation. It aims to raise awareness in this relatively under-researched domain. More studies are required to evaluate the issue since it has strong implications in healthcare resource allocation and clinical decision-making. Several potential research directions are proposed, including the possibility of prolonging bridging therapy for non-urgent LT cases in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and whether hepatoprotective agents play a role in liver-sparing during SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is also discussion of the relevance of lung injury in LT patients with COVID-19 since it is not uncommon regarding the high expression of ACE2 receptors in the lungs, and that lung injury remains the major cause of death in patients with chronic liver disease.","Ng, Alexander",Journal of Liver Transplantation,628,24

Patients did not benefit from CT angiography for various reasons: a contraindication, unavailability of the CT angiography, or a low clinical probability for pulmonary embolism. METHODS: We retrospectively describe the results of the V/Q SPECT/CT of five patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in the nuclear medicine departments of the Centre Cardiologique du Nord and of the Delafontaine hospital in Saint-Denis (Ile-de-France, France) between April 2, 2020, and April 10, 2020. These patients had persistent dyspnea or chest pain suggesting pulmonary embolism. RESULTS: The V/Q SPECT/CT allowed to diagnose a pulmonary embolism in one of these five patients. We also noted several characteristics of the perfusion and ventilation depending on the lung lesions on the CT scan. The areas affected by COVID-19 were most often responsible for ventilatory anomalies with a relatively preserved perfusion. In more advanced cases of pneumonia, with alveolar fillings, the perfusion was also reduced or absent in accordance with large ventilation defects. In addition, the healthy parenchyma appeared to benefit from an uptake in ventilation and perfusion. CONCLUSION: V/Q SPECT/CT can play a role in the management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 for the diagnosis of embolic complications with meticulous hygienic precautions. The different characteristics of the ventilatory and perfusion anomalies related to COVID-19 pneumonia will be confirmed with the next cases. In addition, in this pandemic context and facing a significant infectious risk, the utility of ventilation will also have to be specified.","Cobes, Nina; Guernou, Mohamed; Lussato, David; Queneau, Mathieu; Songy, Bernard; Bonardel, Gérald; Grellier, Jean-François",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,628,6

Qualitative data were gathered through 23 semi-structured interviews with key supply chain actors across the PSC in the UK.FindingsThe findings demonstrate that CAS, as a theory, provides a systemic approach to understanding PSC resilience by taking into consideration the various elements (environment, PSC characteristics, vulnerabilities and resilience strategies) that make up the entire system. It also provides explanations for key findings, such as the impact of power, conflict and complexity in the PSC, which are influenced by the interactions between supply chain actors and as such increase its susceptibility to the negative impact of disruption. Furthermore, the antecedents for building resilience strategies were the outcome of the decision-making process referred to as co-evolution from a CAS perspective.Originality/valueBased on the data collected, the study was able to reflect on the relationships, interactions and interfaces between actors in the PSC using the CAS theory, which supports the proposition that resilience strategies can be adopted by supply chain actors to enhance this service supply chain.

METHODS: CNN, widely applied in medical image classification, was used for bone scintigraphy image classification. The retrospective study included 778 sequential male patients who underwent whole-body bone scans. A nuclear medicine physician classified all the cases into 3 categories: (1) normal, (2) malignant, and (3) degenerative, which were used as the gold standard. RESULTS: An efficient CNN architecture was built, based on CNN exploration performance, achieving high prediction accuracy. The results showed that the method is sufficiently precise when it comes to differentiating a bone metastasis from other either degenerative changes or normal tissue (overall classification accuracy = 91.42% ± 1.64%). To strengthen the outcomes of this study the authors further compared the best performing CNN method to other popular CNN architectures for medical imaging, like ResNet50, VGG16 and GoogleNet, as reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction results reveal the efficacy of the proposed CNN-based approach and its ability for an easier and more precise interpretation of whole-body images in bone metastasis diagnosis for prostate cancer patients in nuclear medicine.

Collecting such datasets is time-consuming and expensive. Until now, very few annotated COVID-19 imaging datasets are available. Although self-supervised learning enables us to bootstrap the training by exploiting unlabeled data, the generic self-supervised methods for natural images do not sufficiently incorporate the context. For medical images, a desirable method should be sensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each anatomical region;here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach with two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on the regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph neural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical regions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences between each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph representation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in full resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods that do not account for the context. We use the learnt embedding to quantify the clinical progression of COVID-19 and show that our method generalizes well to COVID-19 patients from different hospitals.

However, the ethanopharmacology and chemical constituents of T. govanianum have not been effusively explored to date. The present study attempted to uncover the phytochemical constituents and quality parameters of T. govanianum rhizomes, along with an evaluation of the anti-inflammatory potential of the extract, fractions, and isolated steroidal saponins. Methods The quality of T. govanianum rhizomes was examined by standard guidelines of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC). The phytochemical composition of rhizomes was estimated by the spectroscopic method. The extract, fractions, and pure molecules were tested for their anti-inflammatory potential using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Besides that, computational pharmacokinetics properties of bioactive compounds were screened by using the Schrödinger software. Results The quality control parameters such as moisture content, ash value, pH, heavy metals, alpha toxins, residual pesticides, and microbial load were observed within the permitted limits as per AOAC guidelines, suggesting good quality and safe nature of T. govanianum rhizomes. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of steroidal saponins (78.3 ± 0.61 mg/g), phenolics (12.3 ± 2.76 mg/g), flavonoids (3.54 ± 0.24 mg/g), and carbohydrates (473 ± 2.27 mg/g) in the rhizomes. Macrophages cytocompatibility demonstrated that cell viability was not affected at any tested concentration of extract, fractions and pure compounds [diosgenin (1), borassoside D (2), and govanoside B (7)]. The LPS-stimulated macrophages secreted nitric oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6), which were inhibited by the extract, fractions, and compounds 1, 2, and 7 in a concentration-independent manner. Additionally, in silico pharmacokinetics revealed that compound 1 has good membrane-permeability followed by compound 2, while compound 7 showed the non-membrane permeability. Conclusion This study validates the traditional uses of rhizomes of T. govanianum in the treatment of inflammation, and this activity might be due to the presence of steroidal saponins.","Suresh, Patil Shivprasad Singh Prithvi Pal Sharma Anamika Padwad Yogendra S.; Sharma, Upendra",Biocatalysis and Agricultural Biotechnology,628,16

( ) Small increments in clinical improvement will still be possible in the future, but for the most part, the potential for major advancement using these techniques has been exhausted' (Frank Hanley, MD; Stanford). Personalized medicine, rapid genetic diagnostics, RNA and extracellular vesicle biology, epigenetics, gene editing, gene and stem cell-derived therapy are exemplary areas where specialized training for paediatric/congenital cardiology physician scientists will be increasingly needed to further advance the field. About a decade ago, a series in Circulation discussed academic career models and highlighted the major challenges facing the cardiovascular 'clinician scientist' (syn. physician scientist), which have not abated since. To develop the skills and expertise in both clinical congenital cardiology and basic research, the training of fellows must be focused and integrated. The current pandemic COVID-19 puts additional pressure and hurdles on fellows-in-training (FIT) and early career investigators (ECI) who aim to establish, consolidate or expand their own research group.

The lungs are highly susceptible to ROS-mediated damage. Oxidative stress (OS) caused by this redox imbalance leads to the pathogenesis of multiple pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). OS causes damage to important cellular components in terms of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA histone modification. Inflammation further enhances ROS production inducing changes in transcriptional factors which mediate cellular stress response pathways. This deviation from normal cell function contributes to the detrimental pathological characteristics often seen in pulmonary diseases. Although antioxidant therapies are feasible approaches in alleviating OS-related lung impairment, a comprehensive understanding of the updated role of ROS in pulmonary inflammation is vital for the development of optimal treatments. In this chapter, we review the major pulmonary diseases-including COPD, asthma, ARDS, COVID-19, and lung cancer-as well as their association with ROS.","Zuo, Li; Wijegunawardana, Denethi",Adv Exp Med Biol,628,20

The objective of this review is to identify and appraise the available evidence (clinical trials and laboratory studies on masks and respirators, epidemiological studies, and air sampling studies), clarify key concepts and necessary conditions for airborne transmission, and shed light on knowledge gaps in the field. We find that, except for aerosol-generating procedures, the overall data in support of airborne transmission-taken in its traditional definition (long-distance and respirable aerosols)-are weak, based predominantly on indirect and experimental rather than clinical or epidemiological evidence. Consequently, we propose a revised and broader definition of ""airborne,"" going beyond the current droplet and aerosol dichotomy and involving short-range inhalable particles, supported by data targeting the nose as the main viral receptor site. This new model better explains clinical observations, especially in the context of close and prolonged contacts between health care workers and patients, and reconciles seemingly contradictory data in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. The model also carries important implications for personal protective equipment and environmental controls, such as ventilation, in health care settings.

Healthcare staff, as the frontline population fighting the pandemic, are exposed to a high risk of infection. Therefore, developing a protective intervention for medical staff is of significant importance. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-&#945;) nasal drops for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through administering it to medical staff. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label clinical trial with parallel intervention assignment conducted on 2944 medical staff including both doctors and nurses from Taihe Hospital, Shiyan City, Hubei Province, China from January 21, 2020 to July 30, 2020. The participants were bifurcated into two groups of low risk and high risk groups according to the level of direct exposure to COVID-19 patients. The individuals of the low-risk group received rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops for one month in addition to first level protection, and the high-risk group received a combination of rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops coupled with thymosin-&#945;1 with either second or third-level protection protocol. Moreover, the new-outset of COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosed by chest computed tomography (CT), after thirty days, was the primary outcome. The adverse reactions were recorded in all participants. RESULTS: 2415 of 2944 individuals belonged to the low-risk group, while 529 to the high-risk group. There was no COVID-19 pneumonia in either of the group after thirty days. The pulmonary CT scans were negative for COVID-19 pneumonia in both the groups with no new clinical symptoms. No serious adverse event was observed during the course of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The rhIFN-&#945; nasal drops along with augmented safeguards based on standard physical isolation could effectively protect medical staff against COVID-19 pneumonia.","Meng, Zhongji; Wang, Tongyu; Chen, Li; Chen, Xinhe; Li, Longti; Qin, Xueqin; Li, Hai; Luo, Jie",Curr Top Med Chem,628,16

The influence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) medication and IBD itself on COVID-19 is controversial. Additionally, IBD focused guidance is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine COVID-19 prevalence/exposure, perception and information sources, medication compliance, patient behaviour and physician contact among patients with IBD compared with non-IBD controls. METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous survey of patients with IBD (N=415) at one university IBD clinic and one gastroenterology practice, matched 4:1 with control participants (N=116), was performed. RESULTS: Patients with IBD had high fear of infection. The fear was more pronounced in patients taking immunosuppressants and it extended to hospitals, private practices and public places, such as supermarkets. IBD patients reported leaving their homes less frequently than their peers without IBD. A total of 90% of patients with IBD reported washing their hands more frequently. Patients taking immunosuppressants were concerned about interactions between medication and COVID-19, whereas patients taking 5-aminosalicylates were not. Nonetheless, 96.4% of patients adhered to continuing their medication. Patients sought guidance primarily from television and internet news sites. Video consultations were found to be a suitable solution for a subset of patients who are young, have a high level of fear and leave their home less frequently than their peers, whereas overall acceptance of video consultations was limited. CONCLUSION: Patients with IBD are significantly more affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than their non-IBD peers, but they continue to adhere to their medication regimens. IBD focused COVID-19 information should be actively conveyed.","Grunert, P C; Reuken, P A; Stallhofer, J; Teich, N; Stallmach, A",J. crohns. colitis,628,20

This study evaluated the utility of two SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection methods. METHODS: We evaluated two types of antigen detection methods using immunochromatography (Espline) and quantitative chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Lumipulse). RT-PCR was performed as a standard procedure for COVID-19 diagnosis. Lumipulse and RT-PCR were performed for all 486 nasopharyngeal swabs and 136 saliva samples, and the Espline test was performed for 271 nasopharyngeal swabs and 93 saliva samples. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the Espline test were 10/11 and 260/260 (100%), respectively for the nasopharyngeal swabs and 3/9 and 84/84 (100%), respectively for the saliva samples. High sensitivities for both saliva (8/9) and nasopharyngeal swabs (22/24) were observed in the Lumipulse test. The specificities of the Lumipulse test for nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples were 460/462 (99.6%) and 123/127 (96.9%), respectively. CONCLUSION: The Espline test is not effective for saliva samples but is useful for simple and rapid COVID-19 tests using nasopharyngeal swabs because it does not require special devices. The Lumipulse test is a powerful high-throughput tool for COVID-19 diagnosis because it has high detection performance for nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples.","Ishii, Toshiaki; Sasaki, Masakazu; Yamada, Kageto; Kato, Daiki; Osuka, Hiroyoshi; Aoki, Kotaro; Morita, Toshisuke; Ishii, Yoshikazu; Tateda, Kazuhiro",J Infect Chemother,628,10

Conditions and structures of caring for people with dementia differ widely, depending on the country and the care context. Our study aimed to describe the experiences and opinions of nursing experts and managers with regard to facilitators and barriers to the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using individual interviews based on qualitative vignettes as a useful stimulus to generate narrations allowing to study peoples' perceptions and beliefs. The study took place in nursing homes in the German-speaking part of Switzerland and in the Principality of Liechtenstein using purposive sampling. We intended to conduct the interviews face-to-face in a quiet room according to the participant's choice. However, due to the lockdown of nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020, we performed interviews face-to-face and by video. We analysed data thematically following Braun and Clarke to achieve a detailed, nuanced description. To verify our interpretation and to ensure congruence with participants' perspectives, we conducted member checks. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) served to structure our manuscript. RESULTS: Six dyads of nursing home managers and nursing experts from six nursing homes took part in our study (n = 12). Our thematic analysis yielded seven themes reflecting facilitators and barriers to implementing nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care: «A common attitude and cohesion within the organization¼, «Commitment on several levels¼, «A needs-oriented implementation¼, «The effect and the public perception of the intervention¼, «A structured and guided implementation process¼, «Supporting knowledge and competencies¼, as well as «Resources for implementing the intervention¼. CONCLUSIONS: To support the implementation of nurse-led interventions in long-term dementia care, active commitment-building seems essential. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible.Commitment-building is the precondition to reach the persons involved, such as nursing home managers, nursing staff, residents and relatives. Furthermore, nurses should precisely inform about the intervention. It is necessary that the value of the intervention is perceptible. In addition, nurses should adjust the interventions to the situational needs of people with dementia, thus. Therefore, it is important to support dementia-specific competencies in long-term care. Findings indicate that the barrier is determined by the intervention and its implementation - and not by the behaviour of the person with dementia.","Hirt, Julian; Karrer, Melanie; Adlbrecht, Laura; Saxer, Susi; Zeller, Adelheid",BMC Geriatr,628,29

The study aimed to demonstrate such an effectiveness in the alteration of the epidemic curves from theory to practice. METHODS: The empirical data on the daily reported COVID-19 cases were extracted from open source. A computer simulation design in conjunction with the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) type model was applied to evaluating confinement measures in Italy with adjustment for underreported cases; isolation and quarantine in Taiwan; and NPIs and vaccination in Israel. RESULTS: In Italy scenario, the extents of confinement measures were 34% before the end of March and then scaled up to 70% after then. Both figures were reduced to 22-69% after adjusting for underreported cases. Approximately 44% of confinement measures were implemented in the second surge of pandemic in Italy. Fitting the observational data on Taiwan assuming the initial outbreak similar to Wuhan, China, 44% of isolation and quarantine were estimated before March 23rd, 2020. Isolation and quarantine were scaled up to 90% and at least 60% to contain community-acquired outbreaks from March 24th, 2020 onwards.

Early diagnosis is key; catching a disease in its early stages can be the difference between fatality and treatment. The challenge with many diseases is that detectability of the disease scales with disease progression. Since single molecule sensors, e.g., nanopores, can sense biomolecules at low concentrations, they have the potential to become clinically relevant in many of today's medical settings. With nanopore-based sensing, lower volumes and concentrations are required for detection, enabling it to be clinically beneficial. Other advantages to using nanopores include that they are tunable to an enormous variety of molecules and boast low costs, and fabrication is scalable for manufacturing. We discuss previous reports and the potential for incorporating nanopores into the medical field for early diagnostics, therapeutic monitoring, and identifying relapse/recurrence.","Lastra, Lauren S; Sharma, Vinay; Farajpour, Nasim; Nguyen, Michelle; Freedman, Kevin J",Nanomedicine,628,10

It is critical for kidney transplant centers to understand the behaviors, concerns and wishes of transplant recipients and waiting list candidates. METHODS: French kidney patients were contacted to answer an online electronic survey at the end of the lockdown. RESULTS: At the end of the first wave of the pandemic in France (11 May 2020), 2112 kidney transplant recipients and 487 candidates answered the survey. More candidates than recipients left their home during the lockdown, mainly for health care (80.1% vs. 69.4%; P<0.001). More candidates than recipients reported being exposed to Covid-19 patients (2.7% vs. 1.2%; P=0.006). Many recipients and even more candidates felt inadequately informed by their transplant center during the pandemic (19.6% vs. 54%; P<0.001). Among candidates, 71.1% preferred to undergo transplant as soon as possible, 19.5% preferred to wait until Covid-19 had left their community, and 9.4% were not sure what to do.

We obtained statistical estimates of the active cases based the probabilistic method and on the confirmed cases data.
