6840,6840,6840,Pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus-associated pneumonitis in ICR mice: possible involvement of superoxide radicals,9.3788395,7.128737,1992,"During the past few decades, intensive collaborative research in the fields of chronic and acute inflammatory disorders has resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiology and diagnosis of these diseases. Modern therapeutic approaches are still not satisfactory and shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure remain the great challenge in intensive care medicine. However, the treatment of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis or psoriasis also represents an unresolved problem. Many factors contribute to the complex course of inflammatory reactions. Microbiological, immunological and toxic agents can initiate the inflammatory response by activating a variety of humoral and cellular mediators. In the early phase of inflammation, excessive amounts of interleukins and lipid-mediators are released and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction. Arachidonic acid (AA), the mother substance of the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, is released from membrane phospholipids in the course of inflammatory activation and is metabolised to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Various strategies have been evaluated to control the excessive production of lipid mediators on different levels of biochemical pathways, such as inhibition of phospholipase A(2), the trigger enzyme for release of AA, blockade of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways and the development of receptor antagonists against platelet activating factor and leukotrienes. Some of these agents exert protective effects in different inflammatory disorders such as septic organ failure, rheumatoid arthritis or asthma, whereas others fail to do so. Encouraging results have been obtained by dietary supplementation with long chain ω-3 fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). In states of inflammation, EPA is released to compete with AA for enzymatic metabolism inducing the production of less inflammatory and chemotactic derivatives.","Heller, Axel; Koch, Thea; Schmeck, Joachim; van Ackern, Klaus",Drugs,616,1

It is most commonly recommended in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient who is treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics as a strategy to reduce antimicrobial pressure of empirical broad-spectrum therapy and prevent antimicrobial resistance, yet this has not been convincingly demonstrated in a clinical setting. Even if it appears beneficial, ADE may have some unwanted side effects: it has been associated with prolongation of antimicrobial therapy and could inappropriately be used as a justification for unrestricted broadness of empirical therapy. Also, exposing a patient to multiple, sequential antimicrobials could have unwanted effects on the microbiome. For these reasons, ADE has important shortcomings to be promoted as a quality indicator for appropriate antimicrobial use in the ICU. Despite this, ADE clearly has a role in the management of infections in the ICU. The most appropriate use of ADE is in patients with microbiologically confirmed infections requiring longer antimicrobial therapy. ADE should be used as an integral part of an ICU antimicrobial stewardship approach in which it is guided by optimal specimen quality and relevance. Rapid diagnostics may further assist in avoiding unnecessary initiation of broad-spectrum therapy, which in turn will decrease the need for subsequent ADE.","De Waele, Jan J.; Schouten, Jeroen; Beovic, Bojana; Tabah, Alexis; Leone, Marc",Intensive Care Med,616,1

However, their small size complicates their toxin- and virus-neutralizing capacity. We isolated 27 VHHs binding Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin and expressed these in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The most potent neutralizing VHH (LT109) was N-glycosylated, resulting in a large increase in molecular mass. This suggests that N-glycosylation of LT109 improves its neutralizing capacity. Indeed, deglycosylation of LT109 decreased its neutralizing capacity three- to fivefold. We also studied the effect of glycosylation of two previously isolated VHHs on their ability to neutralize foot-and-mouth disease virus. For this purpose, these VHHs that lacked potential N-glycosylation sites were genetically fused to another VHH that was known to be glycosylated. The resulting fusion proteins were also N-glycosylated. They neutralized the virus at at least fourfold-lower VHH concentrations as compared to the single, non-glycosylated VHHs and at at least 50-fold-lower VHH concentrations as compared to their deglycosylated counterparts. Thus, we have shown that N-glycosylation of VHHs contributes to toxin- and virus-neutralizing capacity.","Harmsen, M. M.; van Solt, C. B.; Fijten, H. P. D.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,616,17

Data for the present research were collected from secondary sources. The results revealed numerous inconsistencies among the ASEAN countries in legislation pertaining to the online safety of children. The present study argues that these inconsistencies could be used by criminals to easily exploit children. The study identified loopholes in legislation on age of consent, possession of child pornography, cyber bullying and sexual grooming of children. Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam have no clear definition of the term child pornography, which means it may be possible for criminals to evade conviction for production, possession and distribution of child pornography. Legislation in Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam does not prohibit an individual from possessing child pornography. Only three ASEAN nations have a legal framework regarding child grooming for sexual purposes, while only two have policies regarding cyberbullying, and just three ASEAN nations have a formal global alliance with international law enforcement initiatives. Based on these findings, the study argues that the legal inconsistencies among ASEAN nations might result in cross-border sexual abuse and exploitation of children. Accordingly, it is suggested that countries in the ASEAN region need to urgently identify these legal inconsistencies and collaborate to improve the safety of their children in cyberspace.","Rahamathulla, Mubarak",Int J Child Maltreat,616,1

We review the existing literature characterizing these bone turnover markers in children and adolescents with T1D and by meta-analysis examine whether alterations in OCN, P1NP, and CTX are evident and if potential changes correlate to the metabolic control (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c). Systematic searches at MEDLINE and EMBASE were conducted in January 2018 identifying all studies describing OCN, P1NP, or CTX in children and adolescents with T1D. A total of 26 studies were included, representing data from more than 1000 patients with T1D. Pooled analyses of standard mean difference and summary effects analysis were performed when sufficient data were available. Pooled analysis revealed mean OCN to be significantly lower in children and adolescents with T1D compared to healthy controls (standard mean difference: -1.87, 95% confidence interval, CI: -2.83; -0.91) whereas both P1NP and CTX did not differ from the controls. Only data on OCN was sufficient to make pooled correlation analysis revealing a negative correlation between OCN and HbA1c (-0.31 95% CI: -0.45; -0.16). In conclusion, OCN is decreased in children and adolescents with T1D, whether CTX and P1NP are affected as well is unclear, due to very limited data available. New and large studies including OCN, P1NP, and CTX (preferably as z-scores adjusting for age variability) is needed to further elucidate the status of bone turnover in children and adolescents with T1D.","Madsen, Jens O B; Jørgensen, Niklas R; Pociot, Flemming; Johannesen, Jesper",Pediatric diabetes,616,1

Proteogenomics is an alternative approach that can identify novel proteins encoded by regions previously considered as non-coding. This study aimed to confidently identify and confirm the existence of previously unknown protein-coding sequences in the Eucalyptus grandis genome. To this end, we used a modified spectral correlation strategy and a dedicated de novo peptide sequencing pipeline. Upon the strategy used here, we confidently identified 41 novel peptide forms and six peptides containing at least one single amino acid substitution. The most representative genomic class of novel peptides was identified as originating from alternative reading frames. In contrast, no clear single amino acid substitution pattern was identified. Validation of the identifications was carried out using a parallel reaction monitoring approach that provided further mass spectrometry support for the existence of the novel peptide sequences.

Several studies reported that B lymphocyte depletion with RTX is effective to treat some aspects within the disease spectrum, by reducing disease activity and affecting the inflammation and lymphoid organization that occur in target tissues. Notwithstanding, randomized controlled trials failed to confirm such evidence. With the recent release of several RTX biosimilars on the market, their efficacy and safety compared to the originator must be ascertained across different indications. This study aimed at comparing efficacy and safety of RTX originator and CT-P10 RTX biosimilar in pSS patients in a real-life setting. Methods: Clinical and laboratory records of pSS patients referring to a tertiary rheumatology clinic were retrospectively evaluated. Patients having received at least two courses of either RTX originator or CT-P10 with complete data at baseline and after 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks of treatment were enrolled. Disease activity was assessed with the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and its clinical version without the biological domain (clinESSDAI). Patient-reported symptoms were assessed with the EULAR Sjögren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI). Adverse events (AEs) occurring during the study period were also recorded. Results: Nine patients who received RTX originator and eight patients who received CT-P10 were enrolled. Baseline clinical and serological features, including ESSDAI and ESSPRI, were similar in the two treatment groups. An efficient depletion of circulating CD19+ B lymphocytes was achieved in both treatment arms. Both RTX originator and CT-P10 significantly reduced ESSDAI and clinESSDAI by week 24, and no difference between the groups was observed at any timepoint. Conversely, changes of ESSPRI overtime did not differ between the two treatment arms and were not statistically significant compared to corresponding baseline values. With regard to safety, at 48 weeks of follow-up, only four mild AEs (two in the RTX originator and two in the CT-P10 group) were observed. Conclusion: Our study provides the first evidence that, at 48 weeks of follow-up, RTX originator and CT-P10 display similar efficacy and safety profiles in pSS.","Pavlych, Viktoriya; Di Muzio, Claudia; Alunno, Alessia; Carubbi, Francesco",Frontiers in medicine,616,20

In March 2018, using a modified Delphi method, we convened a panel of 13 expert MDS clinicians for three iterative rounds to discuss a minimum safe Hb for this population. While the panel was unable to reach the pre-set consensus of 75% for a specific Hb threshold, there was 100% consensus that it be no greater than 7.5 g/dL.

61325,61325,61325,Single-incision laparoscopic splenectomy.,8.986098,3.713458,2014,"BACKGROUND Radial access is now considered the preferred approach for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention because of the low risk of vascular complications. However, radial access failure is not uncommon, leading to crossover to a different access site. The CHA2DS2-VASc score is used to estimate stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Our study aimed to assess the CHA2DS2-VASc score in predicting failure of the transradial approach, resulting in crossover to transfemoral access (TFA) for coronary angiography. METHODS We performed a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective study. The study included 1775 patients who underwent coronary angiography with or without subsequent percutaneous intervention between July 2018 and October 2019. The study population was divided into three groups based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score: low (≤2), intermediate (3-4), and high score (≥5) groups. The association between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and radial access failure was evaluated and compared between the groups. RESULTS A total of 197 patients (11.1%) had crossover to the femoral artery. A large percentage of patients (19.2%) had radial access failure in the high CHA2DS2-VASc score group (≥5) compared with 12.5% in the intermediate score group (3-4) and only 6.3% in the low score group (≤2). The highest crossover rate (42.9%) was observed in patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 8. Higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores were also associated with increased fluoroscopy time, contrast administration, and radiation exposure. CONCLUSION The CHA2DS2-VASc score can predict failure of the transradial approach, with a score of ≥5 having the highest correlation of failure requiring crossover to TFA.","Tahir, Hassan; Livesay, James; Fogelson, Benjamin; Coombes, Tyler; Patel, Chirag; Baljepally, Raj",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,616,16

It is believed that further integration will bring direct health benefits, mainly through improved socioeconomic conditions, but there are also risks associated with the EU expansion, in particular cross-border health risks, such as the impact of the internal EU market policy of free movement and migration on communicable disease patterns. Against this background, this article examines communicable disease policy development in Finland, Norway and Sweden in response to changing European political frontiers, in particular the EU accession of the Baltic States. The emphasis is on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. METHODS The study is based on a qualitative and quantitative approach, using two complementary methods: documentary analysis and stakeholder analysis. RESULTS The article identifies a distinct pattern in communicable disease policy development between 1990 and 2005. The turn of the new millennium saw a sharp increase in national attention and the priority assigned to communicable diseases in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The article argues that this development is likely to be related to the rising national, regional and European awareness of the public health challenges associated with communicable diseases in today's borderless Europe. It also shows that the Baltic health situation is a particular concern for Finland. CONCLUSIONS Although there is increasing national and regional activity within the communicable disease area, there is a need for a more effective European approach to tackle the future communicable disease challenges that may follow in an increasingly interdependent and integrated Europe.","Bernitz, Brita Kaltenbrunner",Scandinavian journal of public health,616,14

The significance of soluble MER in pediatric populations, however, is unclear. We sought to investigate if soluble MER concentrations change in response to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in pediatric patients. In parallel, we also sought to investigate for correlations between the change in soluble MER concentration and specific patient, bypass, and postoperative data. DESIGN We quantified the change in plasma soluble MER concentration post- compared with precardiopulmonary bypass for each patient in a cohort of pediatric patients. Linear regression, correlation coefficients, and t tests were used to compare innate patient characteristics (i.e., sex, age, cyanotic vs acyanotic cardiac lesion), cardiac bypass data (i.e., total cardiac bypass time, total aortic cross-clamp time, perioperative steroid administration), and postcardiac bypass data (total postoperative ventilator days, total postoperative vasoactive medication days, and total postoperative ICU days) with change in soluble MER concentrations. SETTING Whole blood samples were obtained intraoperatively at a single tertiary care children's hospital from April to October 2019. SUBJECTS Our patient cohort included 24 pediatric patients ages ranging from birth to 19 years old with both cyanotic and acyanotic cardiac lesions. INTERVENTIONS Retrospective analyses of pediatric blood specimens, as well as patient, bypass, and postoperative data, were performed.

Food fortification is a promising strategy to curb vitD deficiency. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of utilizing vitD fortification in staple foods to improve 25hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and to reduce the prevalence of vitD deficiency among healthy children. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of vitD fortified food products compared to no fortification among healthy children aged 1-18 years old. We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, and Cochrane (CENTRAL) databases from database inception until May 2019. Independently, six reviewers in pairs screened titles and abstracts, assessed the full text for eligibility, and performed data extraction and quality assessment. The primary outcome is the impact of fortification on 25(OH)D concentration. The secondary outcomes included the impact of fortification on the prevalence of vitD deficiency, school performance, cognitive function, school absences, infection rate, hospital admission length, and compliance with fortified food product consumption. RESULTS We identified 2229 articles. After assessing eligibility, 20 RCTs met the inclusion criteria. The eligible RCTs assessed the fortification of milk, cereal, juice, bread, yogurt, and cheese compared with no fortification. All RCTs, except for three, had a low risk of bias. Food fortification improved 25(OH)D concentration by a mean difference (MD) of 15.51 nmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.28, 24.74; I2 = 99%), which resulted in a mean increase of 3 nmol/l for every 100 IU of vitD, when adjusted for baseline 25(OH)D concentration and country latitude. Additionally, the prevalence of vitD deficiency decreased by a risk ratio of 0.53 (95% CI 0.41, 0.69; I2 = 95%), and cognitive function improved by a MD of 1.22 intelligence quotient (IQ) points (95% CI 0.65, 1.79; I2 = 0%). The overall evidence quality was high. CONCLUSION VitD food fortification is an effective way to improve 25(OH)D concentration, prevent vitD deficiency, and improve IQ levels.

64138,64138,64138,Safety and Efficacy of Polymeric Clips for Appendiceal Stump Closure.,9.042447,3.6658459,2016,"BACKGROUND Patients who have chronic pain with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) (CPD) often have difficulty taking oral medication and, as such, alter their medications by crushing or chewing in an attempt to make it easier to swallow. Such manipulation of currently marketed, extended-release (ER) opioid analgesics can significantly alter the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the formulations, resulting in poor treatment outcome or serious adverse events. There is an unmet medical need for oral ER opioid formulations suitable for patients with CPD. OBJECTIVE The primary objectives of this study were to conduct in vitro studies to evaluate alternate means of administration of a new, extended-release (ER), abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone for patients with CPD. Specifically, these studies investigated the in vitro equivalence of drug release rates from Oxycodone DETERx® ER intact capsules (control condition) and administration via alternate modes-opening the capsule and sprinkling the microspheres onto soft foods or administration through enteral tubes. Secondary objectives were to compare alternate modes of administration of Oxycodone DETERx® to a commercially available ER-morphine product. METHODS Soft food study: Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres were sprinkled onto and mixed with several soft foods (ie, applesauce, vanilla pudding, strawberry jam, yogurt, and vanilla ice cream); the effect of drug contact time (0, 30, and 60 minutes) on drug release was studied. Enteral tube study: Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres were administered through varying sizes of nasogastric (10 and 12 Fr.) tubes and a 16 Fr. gastrostomy tube using 5 different delivery vehicles (ie, water, liquid nutritional feeds [Jevity®, Ensure®], and milk [whole milk and 2% milk]). Drug release rate was characterized using a standard in vitro dissolution methodology; dissolution of intact Oxycodone DETERx® capsules served as the control for both the soft food and enteral tube studies. Oxycodone concentration was measured using a standardized high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Similarity factor (f2) analysis was used to compare similarity of the dissolution profiles of test and control conditions. RESULTS The mean dissolution profile of Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres sprinkled onto and mixed with each of the soft foods were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Study drug-food contact time did not impact dissolution profiles. The dissolution data obtained from Oxycodone DETERx® microspheres passed through enteral feeding tubes of varying sizes were similar (f2 > 50) to that of the control. Unlike a marketed morphine sulfate ER pellet formulation, Oxycodone DETERx® did not clog any of the studied enteral tubes. CONCLUSION A new ER, abuse-deterrent, microsphere-in-capsule formulation of oxycodone can be administered by sprinkling onto soft food without affecting the drug release profile of the formulation. The formulation can also be administered directly via enteral tubes without affecting drug release and without clogging enteral tubes. Oxycodone DETERx® may offer physicians and patients with CPD an alternate treatment option, especially in those patients who have dysphagia or an aversion to swallowing monolithic tablet/capsule formulations and for whom analgesic patches or other opioid formulations are not a viable therapeutic option.","Fleming, Alison B; Carlson, Douglas R; Varanasi, Ravi K; Grima, Michael; Mayock, Stephen P; Saim, Said; Kopecky, Ernest A",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,616,16

IFITM3 localizes to endosomes and can potently restrict the replication of influenza A viruses (IAV) and several other viruses that also enter host cells through the endocytic pathway. Here, we investigate whether IFITMs are involved in protection in ducks, the natural host of influenza virus. We identify and sequence duck IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFITM5. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we demonstrate the upregulation of these genes in lung tissue in response to highly pathogenic IAV infection by 400-fold, 30-fold, 30-fold, and 5-fold, respectively. We express each IFITM in chicken DF-1 cells and show duck IFITM1 localizes to the cell surface, while IFITM3 localizes to LAMP1-containing compartments. DF-1 cells stably expressing duck IFITM3 (but not IFITM1 or IFITM2) show increased restriction of replication of H1N1, H6N2, and H11N9 IAV strains but not vesicular stomatitis virus. Although duck and human IFITM3 share only 38% identity, critical residues for viral restriction are conserved. We generate chimeric and mutant IFITM3 proteins and show duck IFITM3 does not require its N-terminal domain for endosomal localization or antiviral function; however, this N-terminal end confers endosomal localization and antiviral function on IFITM1. In contrast to mammalian IFITM3, the conserved YXXθ endocytosis signal sequence in the N-terminal domain of duck IFITM3 is not essential for correct endosomal localization. Despite significant structural and amino acid divergence, presumably due to host-virus coevolution, duck IFITM3 is functional against IAV. IMPORTANCE Immune IFITM genes are poorly conserved across species, suggesting that selective pressure from host-specific viruses has driven this divergence. We wondered whether coevolution between viruses and their natural host would result in the evasion of IFITM restriction. Ducks are the natural host of avian influenza A viruses and display few or no disease symptoms upon infection with most strains, including highly pathogenic avian influenza. We have characterized the duck IFITM locus and identified IFITM3 as an important restrictor of several influenza A viruses, including avian strains. With only 38% amino acid identity to human IFITM3, duck IFITM3 possesses antiviral function against influenza virus. Thus, despite long coevolution of virus and host effectors in the natural host, influenza virus evasion of IFITM3 restriction in ducks is not apparent.","Blyth, Graham A D; Chan, Wing Fuk; Webster, Robert G; Magor, Katharine E",Journal of virology,616,17

Approximately three quarters of the week occurs outside of typical working hours, and the need for support in care of serious and terminal illness during these times is commonplace. Evidence on relevant interventions is unclear. Aim: To review systematically the evidence on the effect of out-of-hours specialist or generalist palliative care for adults on patient and caregiver outcomes, and costs and cost-effectiveness. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted. We searched Embase, MEDLINE [Ovid], Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Allied and Complementary Medicine [Ovid], PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, EconLit (Ovid), and grey literature published between 1 January 2000 and 12 th November 2019. Studies that comparatively evaluated the effect of out-of-hours specialist or generalist palliative care for adults on patient and caregiver outcomes, and on costs and cost-effectiveness were eligible, irrespective of design. Only English-language studies were eligible. Two reviewers independently examined the returned studies at each stage (title and abstract review, full-text review, and quality assessment). Results: We identified one eligible peer-reviewed study, judged as insufficient quality. Other sources returned no eligible material. The systematic review therefore included no studies. Conclusions: The importance of integrated, 24-hour care for people in line with a palliative care approach is not reflected in the literature, which lacks evidence on the effects of interventions provided outside typical working hours.

A further level of complexity opens up as soon as we look at diseases whose pathogenesis and therapy involve different immunological signaling pathways, which are potentially affected by COVID-19. Medical treatments must often be reassessed and questioned in connection with this infection. This article summarizes the current knowledge of COVID-19 in the light of major dermatological and allergological diseases. It identifies medical areas lacking sufficient data and draws conclusions for the management of our patients during the pandemic. We focus on common chronic inflammatory skin diseases with complex immunological pathogenesis: psoriasis, eczema including atopic dermatitis, type I allergies, autoimmune blistering and inflammatory connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, and skin cancers. Since several other inflammatory skin diseases display related or comparable immunological reactions, clustering of the various inflammatory dermatoses into different disease patterns may help with therapeutic decisions. Thus, following these patterns of skin inflammation, our review may supply treatment recommendations and thoughtful considerations for disease management even beyond the most frequent diseases discussed here.","Buhl, Timo; Beissert, Stefan; Gaffal, Evelyn; Goebeler, Matthias; Hertl, Michael; Mauch, Cornelia; Reich, Kristian; Schmidt, Enno; Schön, Michael P; Sticherling, Michael; Sunderkötter, Cord; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Werfel, Thomas; Wilsman-Theis, Dagmar; Worm, Margitta",Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft = Journal of the German Society of Dermatology : JDDG,616,23

STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. SAMPLE POPULATION Ovine cadaveric bladders (n = 48). METHODS A 4-cm ventral cystotomy was performed in each bladder. Bladders were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 12 each group) and sutured in an open setting with a single-layer appositional or a double-layer inverting pattern of unidirectional 2-0 barbed or an analogous monofilament suture. Intraluminal pressure at initial leakage and leakage location were recorded. Analysis of variance was used to compare initial leak pressure between the 4 groups (P < .05). RESULTS Ovine urinary bladders closed with double-layer inverting closures leaked at intraluminal pressures about twofold greater than bladders closed with single-layer appositional closures (P < .0001) whether barbed or nonbarbed suture was used (P ≥ .987). Bladders most commonly leaked at the suture hole after single-layer closure. Bladders that had been repaired with a double-layer closure leaked at the knot in nonbarbed closures or at the preconstructed end loop in barbed closures. CONCLUSION Double-layer closure increased leakage pressures compared with single-layer closures, irrespective of the suture type used. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE This study provides evidence to support double-layer rather than single-layer closure of cystotomies in clinical cases. The use of barbed suture may be suitable for cystorrhaphy in sheep.","Duffy, Daniel J; Kindra, Cameron G; Moore, George E",Veterinary surgery : VS,616,5

All-causes mortality in Portugal increased during March and April 2020 compared to previous years, but this increase is not explained by COVID-19 reported deaths. The aim of this study was to analyze and consider other criteria for estimating excessive all-cause mortality during the early COVID-19 pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS Public data was used to estimate excess mortality by age and region between March 1 and April 22, proposing baselines adjusted for the lockdown period. RESULTS Despite the inherent uncertainty, it is safe to assume an observed excess mortality of 2400 to 4000 deaths. Excess mortality was associated with older age groups (over age 65). DISCUSSION The data suggests a ternary explanation for early excess mortality: COVID-19, non-identified COVID-19 and decrease in access to healthcare. The estimates have implications in terms of communication of non-pharmaceutical actions, for research, and to healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION The excess mortality occurred between March 1 and April 22 was 3 to 5 fold higher than what can be explained by the official COVID-19 deaths.","Nogueira, Paulo Jorge; Nobre, Miguel De Araújo; Nicola, Paulo Jorge; Furtado, Cristina; Vaz Carneiro, António",Acta medica portuguesa,616,27

An association between regular working hours and reduced time to initiation of intravenous thrombolysis has been reported. However, its influence on mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains uncertain. We aimed to analyze the effects of admission time on door-to-groin time and stroke outcome in a large prospective stroke registry of the Neurovascular Net Ruhr in Germany. Methods Procedural times of a total of 512 patients treated with MT were analyzed. Admission to hospital during regular working days and hours (Monday to Friday, 8 am to 4 pm) was compared with admission outside these times. Door-to-groin time and the difference in NIH Stroke Scale between admission and discharge served as primary outcome parameters. Long-term functional outcome was centrally assessed with modified Rankin scale. Results MT outside regular working hours was associated with a significant mean initiation delay of 20 min. By multivariate regression analysis, every 20 min delay of MT reduced the difference in NIHSS score between admission and discharge by 0.76 points (95% CI -1.24 to -0.28, p = 0.002). Favorable long-term outcome did not differ between both treatment groups. Conclusions Treatment outside regular working hours caused a significant delay in the initiation of MT, which was associated with a decreased short-term clinical efficacy of thrombectomy. Strategies like compulsory attendance of the interventional neuroradiologist at the hospital 24/7 might result in shorter door-to-groin times and consecutive in better stroke outcome.","Hoepner, Robert; Weber, Ralph; Reimann, Gernot; Berger, Klaus; Kitzrow, Martin; Fischer, Sebastian; Weimar, Christian; Eyding, Jens; Krogias, Christos",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,616,27

In adults, it is the most frequent cause of nephrotic syndrome. In ~80% of patients, there is no underlying cause of MN (primary MN) and the remaining cases are associated with medications or other diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis virus infection or malignancies. MN is an autoimmune disease characterized by a thickening of the glomerular capillary walls due to immune complex deposition. Identification of the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) as the major antigen in adults in 2009 induced a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis and monitoring and several other antigens have since been characterized. Disease outcome is difficult to predict and around one-third of patients will undergo spontaneous remission. In those at high risk of progression, immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids has substantially reduced the need for kidney replacement therapy. Owing to carcinogenic risk, other treatments (calcineurin inhibitors and CD20-targeted B cell depletion therapy (rituximab)) have been developed. However, disease relapses are frequent when calcineurin inhibitors are stopped and the remission rate with rituximab is lower than with cyclophosphamide, particularly in patients with high PLA2R antibody titres.

Evidence demonstrates differences in gendered exposures and inequities during acute crises such as natural disasters and pandemics, including Covid-19, and longer-term emergencies such as climate change. These patterns, without intervention, may be perpetuated in future crises. Threats to women's health in times of emergency can arise from restricted access to health care, economic disadvantages, and harmful social norms. During crises, women face additional barriers to accessing maternal, contraceptive, and abortion care, likely exacerbating existing inequities in reproductive health outcomes. Gendered inequalities in financial and economic stability can become even more stark. Globally, women perform the majority of health care and unpaid caregiving work, but face barriers to affording costs of living and obtaining health insurance due to over-representation in low-wage jobs. Finally, gendered expectations of social roles contribute to increased vulnerabilities, such as displacement and poverty. Violence against women rises in times of emergency and pathways to escaping trauma can be limited. In addition to directly addressing women's unique barriers and providing support in times of emergency through bolstering health care access, economic, and social support systems, thoughtful solutions such as trauma-informed care, increasing the number of women in leadership roles, educational initiatives, and advocacy from health professionals are needed to protect and advance women's health.","Lee, Yeonsoo S; Behn, Maya; Rexrode, Kathryn M",Journal of women's health,616,29

However, RAR patterns in the general population and specifically the role of demographic characteristics in RAR pattern have not been comprehensively assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe RAR patterns among non-institutionalized US adults and age, sex, and race/ethnicity variation using accelerometry data from a nationally representative population. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. Participants aged ≥20 years who were enrolled in the physical activity monitoring examination and had at least four 24-h periods of valid wrist accelerometer data were included in the present analysis. 24-h RAR metrics were generated using both extended cosinor model (amplitude, mesor, acrophase and pseudo-F statistic) and nonparametric methods (interdaily stability [IS] and intradaily variability [IV]). Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between RAR and age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS Eight thousand two hundred participants (mean [SE] age, 49.1 [0.5] years) were included, of whom 52.2% were women and 67.3% Whites. Women had higher RAR amplitude and mesor, and also more robust (pseudo-F statistic), more stable (higher IS) and less fragmented (lower IV) RAR (all P trend < 0.001) than men. Compared with younger adults (20-39 years), older adults (≥ 60 years) exhibited reduced RAR amplitude and mesor, but more stable and less fragmented RAR, and also reached their peak activity earlier (advanced acrophase) (all P trend < 0.001). Relative to other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest amplitude and mesor level, and most stable (highest IS) and least fragmented (lowest IV) RAR pattern (P trend < 0.001). Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest peak activity level (lowest amplitude) and least stable (lowest IS) RAR pattern (all P trend < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In the general adult population, RAR patterns vary significantly according to sex, age and race/ethnicity. These results may reflect demographic-dependent differences in intrinsic circadian rhythms and may have important implications for understanding racial, ethnic, sex and other disparities in morbidity and mortality risk.","Li, Jingen; Somers, Virend K; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Di, Junrui; Covassin, Naima",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,616,5

This study aimed to evaluate our initial experience with S-LAVH compared with the more conventional three-port LAVH in women with benign uterine diseases. METHODS Between April 2009 and April 2010, S-LAVH was attempted on 183 patients with benign uterine diseases through a transumbilical incision for a 12-mm trocar, and conventional LAVH was performed on 275 patients by the same surgeon. The medical records of patients were reviewed. The age, body mass index, operative time, blood loss, and uterine weight on pathologic report were compared. RESULTS Two of 183 patients in the S-LAVH group were converted to two- or three-port surgery, compared with none in the conventional group. Data analysis was done for 181 patients in the S-LAVH group and 275 patients in the conventional LAVH group. No major complications, including ureteral or bladder injuries, occurred in any of the patients. No statistically significant differences were found in mean age, mean body mass index, mean operative time, mean anesthesia time, mean estimated blood loss, or mean postoperative days to passage of flatus, but the mean uterine weights on the pathologic reports were significantly reduced in the S-LAVH group. CONCLUSION S-LAVH could be a feasible alternative method for removal of the uterus with a better cosmetic outcome resulting from single wound in selected patients. For patients with large-sized uterus, more surgical experience and improvement in instruments suitable for S-LAVH are needed.","Jung, Min Hyung; Lee, Bo Yeon",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Gavi-supported countries continue to implement and report strategies that aim to address implementation challenges and improve equity. This paper summarizes the first mapping of these strategies from country reports. METHODS Thirteen Gavi-supported countries were purposively selected with emphasis on Gavi's priority countries. Following a scoping of different documents submitted to Gavi by countries, 47 Gavi Joint Appraisals (JAs) for the period 2016-2019 from the 13 selected countries were included in the mapping. We used a consolidated framework synthesized from 16 different equity and health systems frameworks, which incorporated UNICEF's coverage and equity assessment approach - an adaptation of the Tanahashi model. Using search terms, the mapping was conducted using a combination of manual search and the MAXQDA qualitative analysis tool. Pro-equity strategies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and compiled in an Excel database, and then populated on a tableau visualization dashboard. RESULTS In total, 258 pro-equity strategies were implemented by the 13 sampled Gavi-supported countries between 2016 and 2019. The framework determinants of social norms, utilization, and management and coordination accounted for more than three-quarters of all pro-equity strategies implemented in these countries. The median number of strategies reported per country was 17. Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Uganda reported the highest number of strategies that we considered as pro-equity. CONCLUSION Findings from this mapping can be useful in addressing equity gaps, reaching partially immunized, and 'zero-dose' vaccinated children, and valuable resource for countries planning to implement pro-equity strategies, especially as immunization stakeholders reimagine immunization delivery in light of COVID-19, and as Gavi finalizes its fifth organizational strategy. Future efforts should seek to identify pro-equity strategies being implemented across additional countries, and to assess the extent to which these strategies have improved immunization coverage and equity.","Dadari, Ibrahim; Higgins-Steele, Ariel; Sharkey, Alyssa; Charlet, Danielle; Shahabuddin, Asm; Nandy, Robin; Jackson, Debra",Vaccine,616,12

After 12 weeks from the beginning of the pandemic, the number of confirmed cases stoods at 5781 in Aragon: 46% hospitalised, 5% admitted to intensive care unit, and 15% died. The absence of controlled trials in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the fast progression of the disease has promoted the use of treatments with unproven potential benefit. The objective of this study is to define the prescription profile in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalised in Aragon, Spain during the pandemic and its adaptation to the official recommendations. PATIENTS AND METHODS Descriptive retrospective study of the consumption and inpatient dispensation of drugs in a sample of COVID-19 infected inpatients (with positive PCR test result) admitted to hospitals of Aragon, between 1 March and 8 May 2020. Data were collected by an inpatient dispensation software program. RESULTS 1482 positive COVID-19 patients were analysed: 54.9% male, median age 75 years (IQR 62-85); 12% were admitted to the intensive care unit. Median prescription: 13 active ingredients per patient (IQR 9-19). 73% (1093 patients) received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, or azithromycin, 81% as combination therapy. 4.3% (52) received other antivirals. 46% received corticosteroids (84% methylprednisolone, 8.7% dexamethasone) and 2.2% tocilizumab. DISCUSSION At the time of the study period there was not enough quality evidence to issue a recommendation on any treatment. There are several clinical trials ongoing to clarify what is the best treatment for patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Alvarez, Adriana; Cabia, Laura; Trigo, Cristina; Bandrés, Ana Cristina; Bestué, María",European journal of hospital pharmacy : science and practice,616,26
73268,73268,73268,A hybrid technique for recurrent incisional hernia repair.,8.954839,3.8845499,2009,"Musculoskeletal simulations are an essential tool for studying functional implications of pathologies and of potential surgical outcomes, e.g., for the complex shoulder anatomy. Most shoulder models rely on line-segment approximation of muscles with potential limitations. Comprehensive shoulder models based on continuum-mechanics are scarce due to their complexity in both modeling and computation. In this paper, we present a surface-based modeling approach for muscles, which simplifies the modeling process and is efficient for computation. We propose to use surface geometries for modeling muscles, and devise an automatic approach to generate such models, given the locations of the origin and insertion of tendons. The surfaces are expressed as higher-order tensor B-splines, which ensure smoothness of the geometrical representation. They are simulated as membrane elements within a finite element simulation. This is demonstrated on a comprehensive model of the upper limb, where muscle activations needed to perform desired motions are obtained by using inverse dynamics. In synthetic examples, we demonstrate our proposed surface elements both to be easy to customize (e.g., with spatially varying material properties) and to be substantially (up to 12 times) faster in simulation compared to their volumetric counterpart. With our presented automatic approach of muscle wrapping around bones, the humeral head is exemplified to be wrapped physiologically consistently with surface elements. Our functional simulation is shown to successfully replicate a tracked shoulder motion during activities of daily living. We demonstrate surface-based models to be a numerically stable and computationally efficient compromise between line-segment and volumetric models, enabling anatomical correctness, subject-specific customization, and fast simulations, for a comprehensive simulation of musculoskeletal motion.","Péan, Fabien; Goksel, Orcun",Medical engineering & physics,616,16

A possible relationship between the type of ventilation used in the operating room and surgical site infection has been reported. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate this relationship. METHODS A systematic literature search up to May 2020 identified 14 studies with 590,121 operations, 328,183 operations of which were performed under laminar airflow ventilation and 261,938 of which were performed operations under conventional ventilation. These articles reported relationships between type of operating-room ventilation with its different categories and surgical site infection: 10 studies were related to surgical site infection in the total hip replacement; 7 studies in total knee arthroplasties; and 3 studies in different abdominal and open vascular surgery. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated comparing surgical site infection prevalence and type of operating room ventilation using the dichotomous method with a random-effects or fixed-effects model. RESULTS No significant difference was found between operation performed under laminar airflow ventilation and conventional ventilation in total hip replacement (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.56, P = .09), in total knee arthroplasties (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.62-2.09; P = .67), and in different abdominal and open vascular surgery (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.43-1.33; P = .33). The impact of the type of operating room ventilation may have no influence on surgical site infection as a tool for decreasing its occurrence. CONCLUSIONS Based on this meta-analysis, operating under laminar airflow or conventional ventilation may have no independent relationship with the risk of surgical site infection. This relationship forces us not to recommend the use of laminar airflow ventilation because it has a much higher cost compared to conventional ventilation.","Bao, Jian; Li, Jianhua",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,616,12

76508,76508,76508,Impact of the Surgical Experience on Leak Rate After Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy.,9.2864485,3.6542158,2016,"INTRODUCTION Uterine morcellation in minimally invasive surgery has recently come under scrutiny because of inadvertent dissemination of malignant tissue, including leiomyosarcomas commonly mistaken for fibroids. Identification of preoperative risk factors is crucial to ensure that oncologic care is delivered when suspicion for malignancy is high, while offering minimally invasive hysterectomies to the remaining patients. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to characterize risk factors for uterine leiomyosarcomas by reviewing preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data with an emphasis on the presence of concurrent fibroids. METHODS A retrospective case-control study of women undergoing hysterectomy with pathologic diagnosis of uterine leiomyosarcoma at a tertiary care center between January 2005 and April 2014. RESULTS Thirty-one women were identified with leiomyosarcoma and matched to 124 controls. Cases with leiomyosarcoma were more likely to have undergone menopause and to present with larger uteri (19- vs 9-week sized), with the most common presenting complaint being a pelvic mass (35.5% vs 8.9%). Controls were ten times more likely to have undergone a tubal ligation (30.6% vs 3.2%). Endometrial sampling detected malignancy preoperatively in only 50% of cases. Leiomyosarcomas were more commonly present when pelvic masses were identified in addition to fibroids on preoperative imaging. Most leiomyosarcoma cases (77.4%) were performed by oncologists via an abdominal approach (83.9%), with only 2 of 31 leiomyosarcomas being morcellated. Comparative analysis of preoperative imaging and postoperative pathology showed that in patients with leiomyosarcoma, fibroids were misdiagnosed 58.1% of the time, and leiomyosarcomas arose directly from fibroids in only 6.5% of cases. CONCLUSIONS Leiomyosarcoma risk factors include older age/postmenopausal status, enlarged uteri of greater than 10 weeks, and lack of previous tubal ligation. Preoperative testing failed to definitively identify leiomyosarcomas, although the presence of synchronous pelvic masses in fibroid uteri should raise clinical suspicion. Given the difficulty of preoperative identification, future efforts should focus on the development of safer minimally invasive techniques for uterine morcellation.","Peters, Ann; Sadecky, Amanda M; Winger, Daniel G; Guido, Richard S; Lee, Ted T M; Mansuria, Suketu M; Donnellan, Nicole M",International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,616,17

The virus contains five major protein classes viz., four structural proteins [nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E) and spike glycoprotein (S)] and replicase polyproteins (R), synthesized as two polyproteins (ORF1a and ORF1ab). Due to the severity of the pandemic, most of the SARS-CoV-2-related research are focused on finding therapeutic solutions. However, studies on the sequences and structure space throughout the evolutionary time frame of viral proteins are limited. Besides, the structural malleability of viral proteins can be directly or indirectly associated with the dysfunctionality of the host cell proteins. This dysfunctionality may lead to comorbidities during the infection and may continue at the post-infection stage. In this regard, we conduct the evolutionary sequence-structure analysis of the viral proteins to evaluate their malleability. Subsequently, intrinsic disorder propensities of these viral proteins have been studied to confirm that the short intrinsically disordered regions play an important role in enhancing the likelihood of the host proteins interacting with the viral proteins. These interactions may result in molecular dysfunctionality, finally leading to different diseases. Based on the host cell proteins, the diseases are divided in two distinct classes: (i) proteins, directly associated with the set of diseases while showing similar activities, and (ii) cytokine storm-mediated pro-inflammation (e.g. acute respiratory distress syndrome, malignancies) and neuroinflammation (e.g. neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases). Finally, the study unveils that males and postmenopausal females can be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the androgen-mediated protein transmembrane serine protease 2.","Sen, Sagnik; Dey, Ashmita; Bandhyopadhyay, Sanghamitra; Uversky, Vladimir N; Maulik, Ujjwal",Briefings in bioinformatics,616,19

However, little is known about the regulatory role of FTO in the expression of FASN and de novo lipogenesis through m6 A modification. In this study, we used FTO siRNA to explore the effects of FTO knockdown on hepatic lipogenesis and its underlying epigenetic mechanism in HepG2 cells. We found that knockdown of FTO increased m6 A levels in total RNA and enhanced the expression of YTH domain family member 2 (YTHDF2) which serves as the m6 A-binding protein. The de novo lipogenic enzymes and intracellular lipid content were significantly decreased under FTO knockdown. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO dramatically enhanced m6 A levels in FASN mRNA, leading to the reduced expression of FASN mRNA through m6 A-mediated mRNA decay. The protein expressions of FASN along with acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) were further decreased, which inhibited de novo lipogenesis, thereby resulting in the deficiency of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and the induction of cellular apoptosis. The results reveal that FTO regulates hepatic lipogenesis via FTO-dependent m6 A demethylation in FASN mRNA and indicate the critical role of FTO-mediated lipid metabolism in the survival of HepG2 cells. This study provides novel insights into a unique RNA epigenetic mechanism by which FTO mediates hepatic lipid accumulation through m6 A modification and indicates that FTO could be a potential target for obesity-related diseases and cancer.

Several studies have shown the potential effectiveness of online support groups, such as reducing psychological distress (eg, depression) among individuals with mental health problems. However, online support groups often do not aim at effectiveness regarding distress relief-related outcomes. OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine whether the use frequency of online support group platform functions (U2plus) is associated with lower stigma and higher consumer activation. METHODS A total of 350 U2plus users participated in a web-based survey. They were asked what therapy they had received in the past and how often they logged on to it, used each of its functions, and completed the following questionnaires: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Devaluation-Discrimination Scale, and the General Help-Seeking Questionnaire. RESULTS Regarding the therapy received, 88% (308/350) of participants had taken medication for mental health problems, and 66.6% (233/350) had received psychotherapy or mental health counseling. Regarding use frequency, 21.7% (74/341) of the participants signed in to U2plus and used its functions more than once a week. The use frequency of U2plus functions was not correlated with perceived stigma, but the use frequency of some functions was weakly correlated with help-seeking intentions from formal sources (eg, doctors and psychologists). However, multiple regression analyses revealed that the use frequency of those functions did not uniquely predict help-seeking intentions. CONCLUSIONS It was suggested that online support groups may serve as an alternative treatment option for those who are already undergoing pharmacological treatment and are willing to seek help from whatever source they deem helpful.","Kobori, Osamu; Yoshinaga, Naoki",JMIR formative research,616,31

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 2VD on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) isolated from spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and compare them with those produced by AM and SAC. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using tetrazolium dye MTT assay and flow cytometry. Cell migration was evaluated by scrape-wound migration assay.

Non-toxic plasmatic concentrations (10 μg L-1) of 2VD and AM inhibited VSMCs proliferation stimulated with 5% fetal bovine serum and impaired cell migration. In further flow cytometry analysis 2VD treatment resulted in a partial cell cycle arrest at G2 phase. The OSCs tested were able to prevent ROS increase after angiotensin II stimulation and surprisingly 2VD induced higher total antioxidant status compared with AM and SAC. Our results showed that 2VD produces equivalent or superior beneficial effects on VSMCs to those reported for other bioavailable compounds of garlic. This preliminary evidence suggests that 2VD intake could also exert important protective effects against arterial remodeling in hypertension.","Torres-Palazzolo, Carolina; de Paola, Matilde; Quesada, Isabel; Camargo, Alejandra; Castro, Claudia",Plant foods for human nutrition,616,12

As the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection increases in the community, migration into the acute care hospital setting intensifies, creating confusion when fever develops postoperatively. The transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 make it difficult to adequately gauge and pinpoint risk groups with questionnaires at the time of hospital admission. This is particularly problematic when asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 require urgent surgery and cannot be screened effectively. One approach is to treat every patient as though they were SARS-CoV-2-positive in preparation for surgery, but doing so could exacerbate shortages of personal protective equipment and staffing limitations. Uncertainty regarding the etiology of postoperative fever could be significantly reduced by universal SARS-CoV-2 testing of all surgical patients at the time of hospital admission in addition to routine screening, but testing capacity and a rapid turnaround time would be required.","Bourget-Murray, Jonathan; Heard, Bryan J; Bansal, Rohit; Johnson, Andrew S; Powell, James",Canadian journal of surgery.

Lack of animal models expressing these genes as authentic cis-haplotypes blocks our understanding for the role of HLA-DP haplotypes in immunity. Methods To explore the potential cis-acting control elements involved in the transcriptional regulation of the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 gene, we performed the expression analysis using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based transgenic humanized mice in the C57BL/6 background, which carried the entire HLA-DP401 gene locus. We further developed a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia in HLA-DP401 humanized transgenic mice, and performed the analysis on the expression pattern of HLA-DP401 and immunological responses in the model. Results In this study, we screened and identified a BAC clone spanning the entire HLA-DP gene locus. DNA from this clone was analyzed for integrity by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and then microinjected into fertilized mouse oocytes to produce transgenic founder animals. Nine sets of PCR primers for regional markers with an average distance of 15 kb between each primer were used to confirm the integrity of the transgene in the five transgenic lines carrying the HLA-DPA1/DPB1 gene. Transgene copy numbers were determined by real-time PCR analysis. HLA-DP401 gene expression was analyzed at the mRNA and protein level. Although infection with S aureus Newman did not alter the percentage of immune cells in the spleen and thymus from the HLA-DP401-H2-Aβ1 humanized mice. Increased expression of HLA-DP401 was observed in the thymus of the humanized mice infected by S aureus. Conclusions We generated several BAC transgenic mice, and analyzed the expression of HLA-DPA1/DPB1 in those mice. A model of S aureus-induced pneumonia in the HLA-DP401-H2-Aβ1-/- humanized mice was further developed, and S aureus infection upregulated the HLA-DP401 expression in thymus of those humanized mice. These findings demonstrate the potential of those HLA-DPA1/DPB1 transgenic humanized mice for developing animal models of infectious diseases and MHC-associated immunological diseases.","Li, Feng; Zhu, Meng-Min; Niu, Bo-Wen; Liu, Ling-Ling; Peng, Xiu-Hua; Yang, Hua; Qin, Bo-Yin; Wang, Meixiang; Ren, Xiaonan; Zhou, Xiaohui",Animal models and experimental medicine,616,28

The aim of this study was to determine circulation and immunological testicular disorders after inguinal hernia mesh repair which can be related with infertility. METHODS From February 2010 to December 2010, 43 male patients who underwent inguinal hernia mesh repair were included in a prospective study. Testicular, capsular and intratesticular arterial flow dynamics were measured by Color Doppler ultrasound before the operation, in early and late postoperative period. The antisperm antibodies were analyzed before hernia repair and 5 months after. RESULTS The difference between patients who underwent laparoscopic (Group I) and anterior open tension-free hernia repair (Group II) in age, duration of symptoms and hernia characteristics were not significant. Statistically significant differences were found in peak-systolic and end-diastolic velocity in testicular and intratesticular arteries in Group II and in peak-systolic velocity on all levels in Group I. Only Group I had significant differences in resistive index of intratesticular arteries. All the values returned to basal in late postoperative period except testicular peak-systolic velocity in Group I which stayed in normal range. Wilcox matched pair test showed significant difference between preoperative and late postoperative measurements of the antisperm antibodies only in Group II, but it was within normal range in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Inguinal hernia mesh repair do not have clinically significant influence on testicular flow and immunological response.","Stula, I; Družijanić, N; Sršen, D; Capkun, V; Perko, Z; Sapunar, A; Kraljević, D; Bošnjak, N; Pogorelić, Z",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,616,1

No direct treatments are available as yet, highlighting the importance of prevention through suitable vaccination regimes. The viral spike (S) protein has been characterized as a key target antigen for vaccines. In particular, S protein domains have been utilized to produce high titers of neutralizing antibodies. Areas covered: Since the first report of MERS-CoV infection, a limited number of MERS-CoV-specific patents have been filed. Patents related to MERS-CoV are categorized into three areas: treatments, antibodies, and vaccines (receptor-related). This review mainly focuses on the types and efficacies of vaccines, briefly covering treatments and antibodies against the virus. MERS-CoV vaccine forms and delivery systems, together with comparable development strategies against SARS-CoV are additionally addressed. Expert opinion: Vaccines must be combined with delivery systems, administration routes, and adjuvants to maximize T-cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody production. High immune responses require further study in animal models, such as human receptor-expressing mice, non-human primates, and camels. Such a consideration of integrated actions should contribute to the rapid development of vaccines against MERS-CoV and related coronaviruses.","Choi, Jiwon; Kim, Mi-Gyeong; Oh, Yu-Kyoung; Kim, Young Bong",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,616,1

Previously, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV-encoded ORF8b strongly inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of the interferon beta (IFN-β) promoter activities. Here, we report that ORF8b seem to regulate MDA5 or RIG-I differentially as protein levels of MDA5 were significantly down-regulated while those of RIG-I were largely unperturbed. In addition, ORF8b seemed to efficiently suppress phosphorylation of IRF3 at the residues of 386 and 396 in cells transfected with RIG-I while total endogenous levels of IRF3 remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, ORF8b was able to inhibit all forms of RIG-I; full-length, RIG-I-1-734, and RIG-I-1-228, last of which contains only the CARD domains. Taken together, it is tempting to postulate that ORF8b may interfere with the CARD-CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS. Further detailed analysis is required to delineate the mechanisms of how ORF8b inhibits the MDA5/RIG-I receptor signaling pathway.","Lee, Jeong Yoon; Kim, Seong-Jun; Myoung, Jinjong",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,616,31

In the authors' experience, these types of behaviors are associated with exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Given this overlap, the authors studied the percentage of ACEs among trainees and physicians referred for fitness-for-duty evaluations and patterns between the types of ACEs experienced and the reason for referral. METHOD A final sample of 123 cases of U.S. trainees and physicians who had been referred to a Midwestern center for assessment and remediation of professionalism issues from 2013 to 2018 was created. Included professionalism lapses fell within 3 categories: boundary violation, disruptive behavior, or potential substance use disorder concerns. All participants completed a psychosocial developmental interview, which includes questions about ACE exposure. Overall rate of reported ACEs and types of ACEs reported were explored. RESULTS Eighty-six (70%) participants reported at least 1 ACE, while 27 (22%) reported 4 or more. Compared to national data, these results show significantly higher occurrence rates of 1 or more ACEs and a lower occurrence rate of 0 ACEs. ACEs that predicted reasons for referral were physical or sexual abuse, feeling unwanted or unloved, witnessing abuse of their mother or stepmother, or caretaker substance use. CONCLUSIONS In this sample, ACE exposure was associated with professionalism issues. Remediating individuals with professionalism issues and exposure to ACEs can be complicated by heightened responses to stressful stimuli, difficulties with collaboration and trust, and decreased self-efficacy. Adoption of a trauma-informed medical education approach may help those that have been impacted by trauma rebuild a sense of control and empowerment. The findings of this study may be useful predictors in identifying those at risk of problematic behavior and recidivism prior to a sentinel event.","Williams, Betsy White; Welindt, Dillon; Hafferty, Frederic W; Stumps, Anna; Flanders, Phillip; Williams, Michael V",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,616,19

METHODS In this retrospective observational study carried out in Osaka Prefecture, Japan, we enrolled patients aged ≥60 years with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 from January to November 2020. The main outcome was mortality during the observation period, based on the Infectious Diseases Control Law. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between epidemiological factors and mortality among older patients with coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS Older patients accounted for 21.5% (3192/14 846) of the registered patients with coronavirus disease 2019. The number of patients according to age was as follows: 60-69 years, 1140 (35.7%); 70-79 years, 1058 (33.1%); 80-89 years, 749 (23.5%); and ≥90 years, 245 (7.7%). The proportion of deaths during the observation period was 8.5% (271/3192). The proportion of deaths increased with increasing age category (from 1.9% to 20.4%, P for trend <0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, patients aged 70-79, 80-89 and ≥90 years had higher hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of death (2.62 [1.63-4.23], 5.99 [3.77-9.50] and 10.24 [6.03-17.40], respectively) than those aged 60-69 years. Factors such as male sex, presence of comorbidities, cluster cases in medical institutions and moderate/severe symptoms at diagnosis were also associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS This study shows the epidemiological characteristics of older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Osaka Prefecture, Japan.

METHODS We analyzed furin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, triglycerides, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein in serum from 166 children in the Pediatric Osteoporosis Prevention (POP) study collected at mean age (SD) 9.9 (0.6) years. Children were classified as low-to-normal weight, overweight or obese. Total body fat mass (kg), trunk fat mass (kg) and total body lean mass (kg) were measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body fat percentage (%) was calculated. RESULTS We found that circulating furin levels were higher in children with obesity and overweight compared to children with low-to-normal weight (p<0.001 and p=0.006 respectively). Also, there were positive correlations between circulating furin, total body fat mass, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, triglycerides, adipokines and pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION This study indicates associations between furin, adiposity, and a pro-inflammatory milieu in children. We suggest that future studies investigate the role of furin in fat tissue inflammation and associated increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases in children. Studies should also investigate if higher furin levels could be a link between obesity and severe coronavirus disease 2019 in children.","Swärd, Per; Rosengren, Björn E; Jehpsson Statistician, Lars; Karlsson, Magnus K",Acta paediatrica,616,17

More recent investigations have shown that startle can act as an early trigger for prepared actions, suggesting a brainstem role in the preparation and initiation of actions. However, in order to attribute any startle-triggered voluntary responses to activation in subcortical structures it is necessary to measure a startle-related activity in these structures. The current study investigated the most effective stimulus for eliciting a detectible startle reflex. While more intense stimuli are more likely to elicit a startle reflex, the current study examined whether broadband noise is more likely than a pure tone to produce a startle at various intensities above 100 dB. Participants performed a button release reaction time task in response to either a 1 kHz tone or a broadband noise pulse with intensities ranging from 82 to 124 dB. Reaction time and EMG from the wrist extensors and the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) were measured. Results showed that startle-related SCM EMG was elicited more frequently by broadband noise compared to pure tones. The higher proportion of startle reflexes observed in SCM was associated with a higher incidence of the voluntary task being triggered early. A higher incidence of startle following broadband noise is attributed to the activation of a larger proportion of the basilar membrane; thus, a lower intensity broadband noise stimulus may be used to elicit startle reflex at a similar rate as a higher intensity pure tone.","Carlsen, Anthony N",Physiological reports,616,7

This population-based household survey assessed breastfeeding and dietary intake, anthropometric assessment of nutritional status, and micronutrient deficiencies by blood biomarkers in children under five years of age. The data were obtained with a probability sample, with stratification by the five geographic regions in the country and clustering by census enumeration areas (CEAs). The sample was calculated at 15,000 households distributed in 1,500 CEAs, with 300 allocated in each of Brazil's five major geographic regions and 10 eligible households per CEA, sampled using inverse sampling. The required population parameters were thus estimated to reach the study's objectives. The basic sampling design weights were calculated as the inverse probabilities of the households' inclusion in the study. Imputation was used to compensate for non-response to items in the target variables, except for data on the blood biomarkers. Finally, calibration used population totals of children in 60 post-strata, defined by cross-classification of the following variables: major geographic region, sex, and age. The final sample included 14,558 children residing in 12,524 households, distributed in 1,382 CEAs in the 26 states of Brazil and the Federal District.

STUDY DESIGN A cohort study of extremely low gestational age newborns. Adverse outcome was defined as early mortality before 72 hours of life, acquired severe periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage, or severe cystic leukomalacia. Perfusion Index values were obtained from the plethysmographic signal of a pulse oximeter. Perfusion Index signals were separated into low-frequency (trend) and high-frequency (detrend) components. Three features were extracted during four 6-hour epochs: mean of the trend component (mean-trend), SD of the trend component (SD-trend), and SD of the detrend component (SD-detrend). The SD features represent long-term variability (SD-trend) and short-term variability (SD-detrend) of the Perfusion Index. A mixed-effects model was fitted to each feature. RESULTS Ninety-nine infants were included in the analysis. Quadratic-time mixed-effects models provided the best fit for all 3 features. The mean-trend component was lower for the adverse outcome compared with the normal outcome group with a difference of 0.142 Perfusion Index (P = .001). SD-detrend component was also lower for the adverse compared with the normal outcome group, although this difference of 0.031 Perfusion Index/days2 was dependent on time (P < .001). CONCLUSION Low values and reduced short-term variability of Perfusion Index on day 1 are associated with adverse outcome.","Van Laere, David; O'Toole, John M; Voeten, Michiel; McKiernan, Joanne; Boylan, Geraldine B; Dempsey, Eugene",The Journal of pediatrics,616,6

Therefore, the aim of this work was to compare Compton imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) by using the same imaging platform of whole gamma imaging (WGI). WGI is a concept that combines PET with Compton imaging by inserting a scatterer ring into a PET ring. This concept utilizes diverse types of gamma rays for 3D tomographic imaging. In this paper, we remodeled our previous WGI prototype for small animal imaging, and we developed an image reconstruction method based on a list-mode ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm incorporating detector response function (DRF) modeling, random correction and normalization (sensitivity correction) for either PET and Compton imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world's first realization of a full-ring Compton imaging system. We selected89Zr as an imaging target because a89Zr nuclide emits a 909 keV single-gamma ray as well as a positron, and we can directly compare Compton imaging of 909 keV photons with PET, a well-established modality. We measured a cylindrical phantom and a small rod phantom filled with89Zr solutions of 10.3 MBq and 10.2 MBq activity, respectively, for 1 hour each. The uniform radioactivity distribution of the cylindrical phantom was reconstructed with normalization in both PET and Compton imaging. Coefficients of variation for region-of-interest values were 4.2% for Compton imaging and 3.3% for PET; the difference might be explained by the difference in the detected count number. The small rod phantom experiment showed that the WGI Compton imaging had spatial resolution better than 3.0 mm at the peripheral region although the center region had lower resolution. PET resolved 2.2-mm rods clearly at any location. We measured a mouse for 1 hour, 1 day after injection of 9.8 MBq89Zr oxalate. The89Zr assimilated in the mouse bony structures was clearly depicted, and Compton imaging results agreed well with PET images, especially for the region inside the scatterer ring. In conclusion, we demonstrated the performance of WGI using the developed Compton image reconstruction method. We realized Compton imaging with a quality approaching that of PET, which is supporting a future expectation that Compton imaging outperforms PET.","Tashima, Hideaki; Yoshida, Eiji; Wakizaka, Hidekatsu; Takahashi, Miwako; Nagatsu, Kotaro; Tsuji, Atsushi B; Kamada, Kei; Parodi, Katia; Yamaya, Taiga",Physics in medicine and biology,616,17

However, limited information is available about HMs genes in grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). RESULTS Here, we described detailed genome-wide identification of HMs gene families in grapevine. We identified 117 HMs genes in grapevine and classified these genes into 11 subfamilies based on conserved domains and phylogenetic relationships with Arabidopsis. We described the genes in terms of their chromosomal locations and exon-intron distribution. Further, we investigated the evolutionary history, gene ontology (GO) analysis, and syntenic relationships between grapes and Arabidopsis. According to results 21% HMs genes are the result of duplication (tandem and segmental) events and all the duplicated genes have negative mode of selection. GO analysis predicted the presence of HMs proteins in cytoplasm, nucleus, and intracellular organelles. According to seed development expression profiling, many HMs grapevine genes were differentially expressed in seeded and seedless cultivars, suggesting their roles in seed development. Moreover, we checked the response of HMs genes against powdery mildew infection at different time points. Results have suggested the involvement of some genes in disease resistance regulation mechanism. Furthermore, the expression profiles of HMs genes were analyzed in response to different plant hormones (Abscisic acid, Jasmonic acid, Salicylic acid, and Ethylene) at different time points. All of the genes showed differential expression against one or more hormones. CONCLUSION VvHMs genes might have potential roles in grapevine including seed development, disease resistance, and hormonal signaling pathways. Our study provides first detailed genome-wide identification and expression profiling of HMs genes in grapevine.","Wang, Li; Ahmad, Bilal; Liang, Chen; Shi, Xiaoxin; Sun, Ruyi; Zhang, Songlin; Du, Guoqiang",BMC plant biology,616,1

METHODS We examined agreement of BIA (Tanita 310) measures of total body water (TBW) and percent body fat (%fat) before (T0) and 12 months (T12) after bariatric surgery, and change between T0 and T12 with reference measures: deuterium oxide dilution for TBW and three-compartment model (3C) for %fat in a subset of participants (n = 50) of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2. RESULTS T0 to T12 median (IQR) change in deuterium TBW and 3C %fat was -6.4 L (6.4 L) and -14.8% (13.4%), respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between deuterium and BIA determined TBW [median (IQR) difference: T0 -0.1 L (7.1 L), p = 0.75; T12 0.2 L (5.7 L), p = 0.35; Δ 0.35 L(6.3 L), p = 1.0]. Compared with 3C, BIA underestimated %fat at T0 and T12 [T0 -3.3 (5.6), p < 0.001; T12 -1.7 (5.2), p = 0.04] but not change [0.7 (8.2), p = 0.38]. Except for %fat change, Bland-Altman plots indicated no proportional bias. However, 95% limits of agreement were wide (TBW 15-22 L, %fat 19-20%). CONCLUSIONS BIA may be appropriate for evaluating group level response among severely obese adults. However, clinically meaningful differences in the accuracy of BIA between individuals exist.","Widen, Elizabeth M; Strain, Gladys; King, Wendy C; Yu, Wenwen; Lin, Susan; Goodpaster, Bret; Thornton, John; Courcoulas, Anita; Pomp, Alfons; Gallagher, Dympna",Obesity surgery,616,1

Chronic breathlessness is a characterizing symptom of symptomatic heart failure resulting in substantial disability and healthcare utilization and is the primary reason for emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In spite of the variable evidence, oxygen therapy is commonly administered both acutely and chronically. Moreover, the role of oxygen therapy to relieve chronic breathlessness in heart failure is not well described, particularly in normoxemic or mild or intermittent hypoxemic states. In fact, several studies have shown the detrimental effects of oxygen therapy with normal oxygen saturation levels. A systematic review using PRISMA guidelines. Four databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were systematically searched from January 2001 to January 2019 investigating the use of oxygen in heart failure. Duplicate articles were removed from the review. Titles and abstracts were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The remaining full-text articles were reviewed and hand-searched for additional references. The quality of the full-text articles was assessed using standardized critical appraisal instruments by the Joanna Briggs Institute. A total of 11 studies, including three intervention and eight non-interventions studies, were included in this review from 1072 non-duplicated records retrieved. Sample size ranged from 4 to 5862. In spite of common usage, this review suggests that there are scant data available to justify the use of oxygen in individuals with non-hypoxemic chronic heart failure and chronic breathlessness.","Asano, Reiko; Mathai, Stephen C; Macdonald, Peter S; Newton, Phillip J; Currow, David C; Phillips, Jane; Yeung, Wing-Fai; Davidson, Patricia M",Heart failure reviews,616,1

The system comprises a carbon nanotube sponge preconcentrator, an electronic pressure control (EPC) unit, a temperature-programmable column module, and a fast-response photoionization detector. A built-in tablet computer controls instrumental parameters and chromatogram display functions. The compact GC with dimensions of 35 cm (l) × 26 cm (w) × 15 cm (h) is self-contained, weighing less than 5 kg without a battery pack, and uses no auxiliary compressed gases. Our design has three main advantages over conventional portable GCs: recharging configuration of ambient air as the carrier gas using a miniature diaphragm pump, precise control of column flow by the built-in canister and EPC system, and rapid thermal desorption of the preconcentrator facilitated by intrinsic resistivity of the carbon nanotube sponge. A 30 m, 0.28 mm I.D. capillary column operated at a head pressure of 14 psi provided a peak capacity of 55 for a 10 min isothermal analysis. The temperature-programmability feature could decrease the analysis time of less than 5 min for vapor mixture of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene. More than a 100-fold increase in sensitivity by preconcentrating a sample adsorption volume of 90 mL resulted in improved detection limits of 0.13 (benzene), 0.20 (toluene), 0.23 (ethylbenzene), and 0.28 (o-xylene) ppb (v/v). Our instrument displayed good stability and reproducibility of retention times (< 0.14% RSD) and intensities (< 4.5% RSD) for continuous measurements using the preconcentrator over 10 h. Thus, continuous and on-site determinations of trace volatile organic compounds in air samples with this instrument appear feasible.","You, Dong-Wook; Seon, Yeong-Sik; Jang, Yeonhee; Bang, Juyeon; Oh, Jun-Sik; Jung, Kwang-Woo",Journal of chromatography.

While successful, these approaches are losing effectiveness in view of parasite resistance to drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides. Clearly, new approaches to fight this deadly disease need to be developed. Recently, one such approach-engineering mosquito resident bacteria to secrete anti-parasite compounds-has proven in the laboratory to be highly effective. However, implementation of this strategy requires approval from regulators as it involves introduction of recombinant bacteria into the field. A frequent argument by regulators is that if something unexpectedly goes wrong after release, there must be a recall mechanism. This report addresses this concern. Previously we have shown that a Serratia bacterium isolated from a mosquito ovary is able to spread through mosquito populations and is amenable to be engineered to secrete anti-plasmodial compounds. We have introduced a plasmid into this bacterium that carries a fluorescent protein gene and show that when cultured in the laboratory, the plasmid is completely lost in about 130 bacterial generations. Importantly, when these bacteria were introduced into mosquitoes, the bacteria were transmitted from one generation to the next, but the plasmid was lost after three mosquito generations, rendering the bacteria non-recombinant (wild type). Furthermore, no evidence was obtained for horizontal transfer of the plasmid to other bacteria either in culture or in the mosquito. Prior to release, it is imperative to demonstrate that the genes that thwart parasite development in the mosquito are safe to the environment. This report describes a methodology to safely achieve this goal, utilizing transient expression from a plasmid that is gradually lost, returning the bacterium to wild type status.","Huang, Wei; Wang, Sibao; Jacobs-Lorena, Marcelo",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,616,1

BACKGROUND The experience of being a newly qualified nurse is stressful and isolating. Support from colleagues and peers can enhance perceptions of competence and confidence in newly qualified nurses, improve well-being and aid retention. However, despite initiatives such as preceptorship, support needs may remain unmet in busy clinical environments. Online support has potential to offer a partial solution to professional isolation, but there is a lack of research into how technology can support nurses' emotional and social well-being. DESIGN A qualitative exploratory study was designed, employing semi-structured focus groups, analysed using thematic analysis. The study is reported in accordance with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist. METHODS Eight focus groups, supplemented by one individual interview, were conducted with newly qualified nurses between June 2018-January 2019. FINDINGS Two main themes arose. The first was Drowning, a lot of the time with two sub-themes: (i) Feelings and emotions about being a Newly Qualified Nurse: 'Absolutely terrified' and (ii) Support within the role: 'Somebody you can count on'. The second was Potential advantages and disadvantages of online modality: 'Somebody is going to get in that phone!' which included three sub-themes (i) Potential advantages, (ii) Potential disadvantages and (iii) Preferences and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that if barriers can be overcome, then online support has potential to contribute to newly qualified nurses' well-being. Further research is needed to explore technical and ethical issues around online support and evaluate its effectiveness for newly qualified nurses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Online support has the potential to add to existing strategies to support nurses during stressful times. This may be particularly relevant when many staff are working under increased pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jenkins, Catharine; Oyebode, Jan; Bicknell, Sarah; Webster, Natalie; Bentham, Peter; Smythe, Analisa",Journal of clinical nursing,616,7

DESIGN Retrospective case note study (2005-2009). SETTING Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Armand Trousseau Children's Hospital, Paris, France. PATIENTS Eleven patients who underwent endoscopic cleft closure as a primary (n = 8) or secondary (n = 3) procedure among 22 patients treated for laryngotracheal clefts. We report patients' demographics, symptoms leading to the diagnosis, endoscopic evaluation method, medical examination results, and surgical techniques. INTERVENTION Endoscopic closure of the cleft under spontaneous ventilation via 2-layer interrupted sutures after excision of the mucosal edge using a carbon dioxide laser in 10 patients and a thulium laser in 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Analysis of postoperative complications, revision surgery, need for intensive care unit admission, closure of the cleft, and long-term symptom results. RESULTS Successful closure of the 11 clefts (with revision surgery in 3 patients) without the need for intubation or intensive care unit admission enabled the elimination of aspiration in 10 patients and significant improvement in 1 patient with bilateral vocal cord paralysis. There were no significant postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic closure of laryngotracheal clefts is a reliable technique that significantly reduces perioperative and postoperative morbidity. The results of this technique are entirely satisfactory, and we suggest that it is suitable as a primary procedure for the treatment of type I, II, and III clefts extending to the cervical trachea, including in neonates.","Garabedian, Eréa-Noël; Pezzettigotta, Stéphane; Leboulanger, Nicolas; Harris, Robert; Nevoux, Jérôme; Denoyelle, Françoise; Roger, Gilles",Archives of otolaryngology--head & neck surgery,616,1

Numerous recommendations and suggestions have been published to prevent the acquisition and spread of the SARS-CoV-2, especially to protect health workers and front-line caregivers. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by aerosol, rendering air defense with suitable ventilation and adequate mask use pivotal. Recently, locally applied antiseptic, antiviral, or structure competitive receptor blockers were suggested to attack the virus at its main point of invasion, the nasal mucosa, and nasopharynx. We discuss the most plausible and safe ideas to reduce viral load at the point of entry, and subsequently the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the lower respiratory tract, lungs and other organs. In addition, we will discuss the value and recommend clinical trials employing topical trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a substance well known from dermatologic and cosmetic procedures. It has been proven to successfully block the nasal entry for airborne allergens, preventing the development of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and to be curative for early stages of viral infections entering through the oral mucosa. For SARS-CoV-2, TCA in a single, short-time application is expected to remodel the nasal and nasopharyngeal epithelia, eliminating both the receptors and cells responsible for viral entry and subsequent viral spread to the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, this may have therapeutic benefits for those recently infected by reducing local viral replication. Such procedures are cheap, safe, and can be conducted in almost every setting especially in regions with inadequate financial and logistic resources. This article is protected by copyright.

AIM Investigating HCWs' perceptions of PPE compliance and barriers, as well as influencing factors, in order to develop methods to combat the rise in their infection rates. METHODOLOGY During the 'second wave' surge, a cross-sectional correlational analysis was conducted over a one-month period. It consists of HCWs from various hospital sectors that admit COVID-19 patients using an online self-administered predesigned tool. RESULTS Of the 285 recruited participants, 36.1% had previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. Around 71% received training on PPEs use. The perceived compliance was good for (PPEs) usage (mean 2.60 ± 1.10). A significant higher compliance level was correlated with previous diagnosis with COVID-19, working with patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and having a direct contact with a family member older than 45 years old (p<0.01). The main perceived barriers to the use of PPEs were: unavailability of full PPEs (35%), interference with their ability to provide patient care (29%), not enough time to comply with the rigors of PPEs (23.2%), and working in emergency situation (22.5%). With regards to perceived barriers those working with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who reported having a direct contact with a family member older than 45 years old showed significantly higher level of barriers.

T cell priming against type 2 collagen is suppressed in Tarm1-/- mice and antigen-presenting ability of GM-CSF-induced dendritic cells (GM-DCs) from Tarm1-/- mouse bone marrow cells is impaired. We show that type 2 collagen is a functional ligand for TARM1 on GM-DCs and promotes DC maturation. Furthermore, soluble TARM1-Fc and TARM1-Flag inhibit DC maturation and administration of TARM1-Fc blocks the progression of CIA in mice.

Type I IFN and TLR7 signals were critical for induction of IFN-stimulated gene expression and CCR2 ligand upregulation in the BM microenvironment in response to LCMV infection. Experiments utilizing BM chimeric mice demonstrated that type I IFN and TLR7 signaling on either hematopoietic or nonhematopoietic cells was sufficient to initiate monocytosis in response to LCMV infection. BM plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) generated type I IFN directly ex vivo, suggesting that pDCs are a hematopoietic contributor of type I IFN in the BM early during LCMV infection. Overall, we describe novel roles for type I IFN and TLR7 signaling in nonhematopoietic cells and BM pDCs in directing IFN-stimulated gene and CCR2 ligand expression in the BM to initiate an increase in blood inflammatory monocytes during viral infection.","Buechler, Matthew B; Gessay, Griffin M; Srivastava, Shivani; Campbell, Daniel J; Hamerman, Jessica A",European journal of immunology,616,24

METHODS The study takes an inductive approach, drawing on the reported experiences of 40 officials at different levels of government across four purposefully selected regions in July 2020. Interviewees were asked about the guidance they received to contain COVID-19, the source of that guidance, their challenges and successes in implementing the guidance, and if and how they adapted the guidance to their particular setting. FINDINGS The interviews depict considerable challenges, including a lack of supplies and resources; enforcing physical distancing, contact tracing and surveillance; and dealing with fear and stigma. At the same time, they also provide evidence of innovation and adaptation among street-level bureaucrats. Respondents overwhelmingly praise the President, whose limited national response is seen as helpful to reduce fear and stigma. CONCLUSIONS Other scholars have highlighted the potential dangers of street-level discretion if local officials may ""make policy"" in ways that contradict their agencies' stated goals.

However, successful catheterization of the distal parent artery in giant intracranial aneurysms with a microcatheter can be extremely challenging. Forming a microcatheter loop in the aneurysm sac can aid distal catheterization. CLINICAL PRESENTATION We report the use of a Solitaire FR stent as an adjunctive tool in the successful treatment of 2 giant intracranial unruptured aneurysms with a Pipeline Embolization Device. After having formed a loop inside the aneurysm sac, the microcatheter was anchored distally by a Solitaire FR stent. With the Solitaire FR device opened, the loop in the giant aneurysm sac was completely reduced without loss of the microcatheter position in the distal parent artery. A Pipeline Embolization Device could be delivered in both cases without any difficulty. There were no complications. CONCLUSION The technique described results in ideal microcatheter alignment with a secure distal position before deployment of a flow-diverting stent.","Clarençon, Frédéric; Wyse, Gerald; Fanning, Noel; Di Maria, Federico; Gaston, André; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader",Neurosurgery,616,1

This additional burden can prevent achieving the global targets of TB elimination. Management of LTBI has been a low priority target for National TB Elimination Programs (NTEP) due to various challenges in the field settings. Areas covered: This article reviews the most recent advances in the field of LTBI management including newer diagnostics, treatments, vaccines, programmatic challenges, and gaps and suggests a way forward that can be adopted by NTEPs for LTBI. We searched the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2010 to 2020 using MeSH terms: Latent TB Diagnosis, TB preventive therapy, Vaccines, LTBI, and HIV/ COVID. Expert opinion: NTEPs of developing countries should offer a better, point-of-care diagnostic, and effective treatment for LTBI to reduce the number of new TB cases arising from people infected with M.tb. Awareness about LTBI should be increased among the health system staff and the public. More funding is needed to advance research as well as implement the newer findings in the NTEP to achieve the End TB targets by 2035.","Padmapriyadarsini, Chandrasekaran; Sachdeva, Kuldeep S; Nair, Dina; Ramachandran, Ranjani",Expert review of respiratory medicine,616,1

METHODS AND RESULTS Between March 2009 and December 2017, 313 ISR lesions in patients undergoing an OCT guided PCI in five hospitals were retrospectively enrolled. Neoatherosclerosis was defined as a lipid neointima or calcified neointima. We examined the association between neoatherosclerosis and the clinical driven (CD-TLR) rates. In 313 ISR lesions, 64 lesions (20.4%) had bare metal stents and 241 lesions (77.0%) had drug eluting stents (DES). Among them, 47.0% of lesions (147 lesions) had neoatherosclerosis. A multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that eGFR (odds ratio (OR), 0.986; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.974-0.998; P=0.023), the time from the PCI to the ISR (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.22; P<0.001) and DES-ISR (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.18-5.43; P=0.019 ) were independent predictors with neoatherosclerosis. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that neoatherosclerosis was an independent predictor of CD-TLR. CONCLUSIONS In the multicenter ISR registry, OCT imaging demonstrated that eGFR, the time from the PCI to the ISR and DES-ISR were independent predictors for neoatherosclerosis and neoatherosclerosis in ISR lesions had a worse impact on the CD-TLR.","Nakamura, Daisuke; Dohi, Tomoharu; Ishihara, Takayuki; Kikuchi, Atsushi; Mori, Naoki; Yokoi, Kensuke; Shiraki, Tatsuya; Mizote, Isamu; Mano, Toshiaki; Higuchi, Yoshiharu; Yamada, Takahisa; Nishino, Masami; Sakata, Yasushi",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,616,1

It can exhibit its immunomodulatory effects by enhancing antigen processing and presentation, increasing leukocyte trafficking, inducing an anti-viral state, boosting the anti-microbial functions and affecting cellular proliferation and apoptosis. A complex interplay between immune cell activity and IFN-γ through coordinated integration of signals from other pathways involving cytokines and Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as Interleukin (IL)-4, TNF-α, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Type-I Interferons (IFNS) etc. leads to initiation of a cascade of pro-inflammatory responses. Microarray data has unraveled numerous genes whose transcriptional regulation is influenced by IFN-γ. Consequently, IFN-γ stimulated cells display altered expression of many such target genes which mediate its downstream effector functions. The importance of IFN-γ is further reinforced by the fact that mice possessing disruptions in the IFN-γ gene or its receptor develop extreme susceptibility to infectious diseases and rapidly succumb to them. In this review, we attempt to elucidate the biological functions and physiological importance of this versatile cytokine. The functional implications of its biological activity in several infectious diseases and autoimmune pathologies are also discussed. As a counter strategy, many virulent pathogenic species have devised ways to thwart IFN-γ endowed immune-protection. Thus, IFN-γ mediated host-pathogen interactions are critical for our understanding of disease mechanisms and these aspects also manifest enormous therapeutic importance for the annulment of various infections and autoimmune conditions.","Kak, Gunjan; Raza, Mohsin; Tiwari, Brijendra K",Biomolecular concepts,616,5

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, factorial, in vivo. ANIMALS Eighteen purpose-bred, mature male, and female hound dogs. METHODS Eighteen adult hound dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups designated by postoperative day of assessment. Six skin incisions were made along the dorsum in the thoracolumbar region of each dog with an equal number (n=3) randomly assigned to closure with barbed or non-barbed suture. Six dogs were euthanatized on postoperative days 3, 10, and 14, respectively. Two additional incisions were made on each dog after euthanasia for baseline data (Day 0). The skin incision specimens were harvested for biomechanical testing and histologic evaluation. RESULTS Non-barbed closure had significantly higher maximum load at failure (P<.001) and stiffness (P<.001) than barbed closure regardless of day. The average tissue reaction score was significantly higher for barbed closure (P=.008), regardless of day. Suturing time for barbed closures was significantly shorter. There was no significant difference in frequency of complications between closures. CONCLUSION Barbed Glycomer™ 631 closures had a significantly lower maximum load at failure and stiffness, and higher average tissue reaction scores, but showed no difference in short term outcome for intradermal closure of dorsally located skin incisions in dogs.","Law, Andy Y; Butler, James R; Patnaik, Sourav S; Cooley, James A; Elder, Steven H",Veterinary surgery : VS,616,6

In this study, we explored the correlation between the anastomosis method and the incidence of SSI. METHODS A total of 110 patients underwent ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy for the excision of colon cancer. Two methods (open and closed, 28 and 82 patients, respectively) of functional end-to-end anastomosis were adopted. RESULTS Increased perioperative blood loss (p = 0.029214), a longer hospital stay (p = 0.026668) and the development of SSI (p = 0.000181) were significantly correlated with the open method. There was no correlation between SSI and the body mass index, or between SSI and the length of the surgery or diabetes mellitus. However, patients that developed SSI tended to be obese. CONCLUSION The open method was associated with a higher incidence of SSI. Therefore, it is necessary to consider potential contamination of the surgical field at the time of anastomosis to reduce the incidence of SSI.","Ojima, Hitoshi; Sohda, Makoto; Ando, Hiroyuki; Sano, Akihiko; Fukai, Yasuyuki; Ogawa, Atsushi; Mochida, Yasushi; Kuwano, Hiroyuki",Surgery today,616,12

A survey was conducted with aim to determine the digestive surgery services provided during the COVID-19 pandemic, optimize safety for patients and clinicians, and safeguard health-care services. METHODS An online survey was conceived and circulated to members of the Indonesian Society of Digestive Surgeons. The survey was conducted in two phases, in April 2020 and July 2020, to evaluate changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS Early in the pandemic (April 2020), the median number of major digestive surgeries performed monthly declined from 20 cases (range. 3-100 cases) to 1 case (range. 0-10 cases) (P < .001; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Most of the cases in April 2020 addressed emergency problems, but more definitive surgeries were performed during the later period of the survey. The importance of screening for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction has increased over time, and a more comprehensive screening methodology incorporating real-time polymerase chain reaction, chest CT, and rapid antibody test were evident in 31.37% of July 2020 responses.

The safety and hemodynamic response to high-load (HL) RE remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic response during both HL-RE and LL-RE prior to cardiac rehabilitation. Forty-three patients with coronary artery disease and/or percutaneous coronary intervention performed three sets of leg-press exercise using HL-RE (eight repetitions at the intensity of 80% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)) and LL-RE (16 repetitions at the intensity of 40% 1-RM) in a randomized crossover sequence. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and rating of perceived exertion were measured at baseline, after each set of RE and post-exercise. No clinically relevant changes in HR and BP or in patient-reported symptoms were recorded during HL-RE or LL-RE. Compared with baseline, HR and SBP increased during LL-RE (from 66 bpm to 86 bpm, time effect: p < 0.001; from 129 mmHg to 146 mmHg, time effect: p < 0.001) and HL-RE (from 68 bpm to 86 bpm, time effect: p < 0.001; from 130 mmHg to 146 mmHg, time effect: p < 0.001). Compared with HL-RE, the increase in HR was greater after the final set of LL-RE (32% vs. 28%, p = 0.015), without significant differences in SBP and DBP between LL-RE and HL-RE. Rating of perceived exertion was higher after the 1st set of HL-RE compared with LL-RE (median (interquartile range): 6 (5-7) vs. 6 (5-6), p = 0.010). In patients with coronary artery disease, both HL-RE and LL-RE were safe and well-tolerated. Hemodynamic changes were similar and within the physiological response to RE.","Kambic, Tim; Hadžić, Vedran; Lainscak, Mitja",International journal of environmental research and public health,616,27

In this paper, a pixel-level annotation-free framework was proposed to classify normal tissue, LUAD and LUSC slides. This framework can be divided into two stages: tumor classification and localization, and subtype classification. In the first stage, EM-CNN was utilized to distinguish tumor slides from normal tissue slides and locate the discriminative regions for subsequent analysis with only image-level labels provided. In the second stage, a multi-scale network was proposed to improve the accuracy of subtype classification. This method achieved an AUC of 0.9978 for tumor classification and an AUC of 0.9684 for subtype classification, showing its superiority in lung pathological image classification compared with other methods.","Xu, Xiaowei; Hou, Runping; Zhao, Wangyuan; Teng, Haohua; Sun, Jianqi; Zhao, Jun",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

It is relatively expensive and can be a challenging technique. A recent development in laparoscopic surgery is the single-port technique (single-incision laparoscopic surgery, SILS). The SILS port is a flexible multichannel port for transumbilical laparoscopic surgery. Even though not developed for transanal use the port could be ideal because of its shape and texture. METHODS 12 patients underwent transanal resection using an SILS port and normal laparoscopic instruments. RESULTS 10 out of 12 patients were treated successfully with the SILS port. Two polyps were resected using an open transanal technique because the distance between the SILS port and the polyp was too small. The average operative time was 55 min (range 40-80 min). All patients could be discharged on the first postoperative day. There were no major complications. CONCLUSION Our current data show that transanal surgery using a single port is a relatively easy procedure with operative times comparable to TEM. More surgeons will therefore be able to perform transanal endoscopic surgery.","van den Boezem, P B; Kruyt, P M; Stommel, M W J; Tobon Morales, R; Cuesta, M A; Sietses, C",Digestive surgery,616,1

METHODS Three anaesthetists performed a PEAA with a scalpel, bougie and cuffed tracheal tube, 12 times each. Recorded times included: loading the tracheal tube onto the bougie and advancing the tube over the bougie to the skin, advancing the tube through the skin into the trachea and completion of the whole procedure. Subjective opinion regarding the ease of tube insertion was recorded by visual analogue scoring. RESULTS Subjective opinion, overall time and time to complete each component of the procedure were not significantly affected by the type of tube used. The mean time for three novice anaesthetists to complete PEAA on a cadaver was 37.5 (8.8) s, after 1 h of training. In two of the 12 cadavers, the cricothyroid membrane could not be palpated or located with the scalpel.

RESULTS Among 107 participants, 59% were attending for alcohol treatment and 41% for opioid treatment. Most ATOP items (76%) reached above 0.7 (good) or 0.9 (excellent) agreement between face-to-face and telephone use. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the ATOP is a suitable instrument for telephone monitoring of recent substance use, health and social functioning among AOD clients. Its validation for remote use over the telephone will support staff to monitor clients' risks and outcomes-of particular relevance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in which services are increasingly relying on telework approaches to client monitoring.","Deacon, Rachel M; Mammen, Kristie; Holmes, Jennifer; Dunlop, Adrian; Bruno, Raimondo; Mills, Llewellyn; Graham, Robert; Lintzeris, Nicholas",Drug and alcohol review,616,17

The antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to shorten duration of disease while interferon beta-1b may speed up viral clearance. The results with hydroxychloroquine have thus far been rather disappointing. Trials with selective cytokine blockers including anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6), have shown some promise in more severe cases, with further confirmation being required from large-scale phase-3 randomised controlled trials. The likelihood is that combination therapy addressing both upstream and downstream pathways may be required to prevent progression of severe COVID-19 infection in susceptible older patients with comorbidities and we believe further studies are now warranted to specifically target such at-risk groups who are more prone to worse outcomes.","Lipworth, Brian; Kuo, Chris RuiWen; Chan, Rory",The journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh,616,1

In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the correlation of respiratory impedance at rest with exertional ventilatory parameters, including exercise tolerance, has scarcely been reported. In addition, the utility of oscillometric parameters might differ between the inspiratory and expiratory phases due to airflow obstruction during expiration, but the hypothesis had not been validated. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether oscillometric parameters are associated with exertional ventilatory parameters in patients with COPD. Methods Fifty-five subjects with COPD who attended clinics at the National Hospital Organization Osaka Toneyama Medical Center performed spirometry, oscillometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) within 2 weeks. The correlations between parameters of spirometry, oscillometry, and CPET were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, univariate, and multivariate analyses. Results Respiratory reactance had better correlations with the CPET parameters than respiratory resistance. Moreover, inspiratory reactance at rest correlated with the CPET parameters stronger than expiratory reactance. In particular, inspiratory resonant frequency (Fres-ins) correlated with peak oxygen uptake (rS=-0.549, p<0.01) and dead space to tidal volume ratio at peak exercise (rS=0.677, p<0.01) and the best predicted expiratory tidal volume (VT ex) at peak exercise of all the oscillometric parameters (rS=-0.679, p<0.01). However, the correlation between Fres-ins and V T ex at peak exercise became weak in subjects with severe and very severe COPD during exercise. Conclusion Measurement of respiratory reactance is useful for the effortless evaluation of not only exertional ventilatory parameters but exercise tolerance in patients with COPD. The correlation of respiratory impedance with exertional ventilatory parameters can become weak in patients with advanced COPD; thus, the measurement of oscillometry might not be appropriate for evaluating exertional ventilatory parameters of patients with advanced COPD.","Yamamoto, Yuji; Miki, Keisuke; Matsuki, Takanori; Fukushima, Kiyoharu; Oshitani, Yohei; Kagawa, Hiroyuki; Tsujino, Kazuyuki; Yoshimura, Kenji; Miki, Mari; Kida, Hiroshi",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,616,8

METHODS The Japan-Prediction of neurological Outcomes in patients post cardiac arrest (J-POP) registry is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study to test whether rSO2 predicts neurological outcomes after OHCA. We measured rSO2 in OHCA patients immediately after hospital arrival using a near-infrared spectrometer placed on the forehead with non-blinded fashion. The primary endpoint was ""neurological outcomes"" at 90 days after OHCA. RESULTS EMS providers are not permitted to terminate CPR in the field in Japan, and so most patients with OHCA who are treated by EMS personnel are transported to emergency hospitals. Among 1017 OHCA patients, 672 patients including 52 comatose patients with pulses detectable (8%) and 620 cardiac arrest patients (92%) at hospital arrival were enrolled prospectively and consecutively. Twenty-nine patients with good neurological outcome had a significantly higher value of rSO2 at hospital arrival than 643 patients with poor neurological outcome (mean [±SD] 55.6±20.8% vs. 19.7±11.0%, p<0.001). Receiver operating curve analysis indicated an optimal rSO2 cutoff point of >42% for predicting good neurological outcome, with sensitivity 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.92), specificity 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.96), positive predictive value, 0.41 (95% CI, 0.28-0.55), negative predictive value, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.98-1.00), and area under the curve 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92).

Premature piglets received parenteral nutrition for 48-hours after delivery, followed by enteral feeds every three hours until death or euthanasia at 96-hours. Continuous A-NIRS, systemic oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate were measured while monitoring for clinical signs of NEC. Blood samples obtained at 6-hour intervals were used to determine pI-FABP levels by ELISA. Piglets were classified as fulminant-NEC (f-NEC), non-fulminant-NEC (nf-NEC) and No-NEC according to severity of clinical and histologic features. Of 38 piglets, 37% (n=14) developed nf-NEC, 18% (n=7) developed f-NEC and 45% (n=17) had No-NEC. There were significant differences in baseline heart rate (p=0.008), SpO2 (p<0.001) and A-NIRS (p<0.001) among the three groups. A-NIRS values of NEC piglets remained lower throughout the study with mean for f-NEC of 69±3.8%, 71.9±4.04% for nf-NEC, and 78.4±1.8% for No-NEC piglets (p<0.001). A-NIRS <75% predicted NEC with 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity. NEC piglets demonstrated greater variability from baseline in A-NIRS than healthy piglets (10.1% vs. 6.3%; p=0.04). Mean pI-FABP levels were higher in animals that developed NEC compared to No-NEC piglets (0.66 vs. 0.09 ng/mL;p<0.001). In f-NEC piglets, pI-FABP increased precipitously after feeds (0.04 to 1.87 ng/mL;p<0.001). pI-FABP levels increased in parallel with disease progression and a value >0.25ng/mL identified animals with NEC (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity). NIRS is a real-time, non-invasive tool that can serve as a diagnostic modality for NEC. In premature piglets, low A-NIRS in the early neonatal period and increased variability during initial feeds are highly predictive of NEC, which is then confirmed by rising plasma I-FABP levels. These modalities may help identify neonates with NEC prior to clinical manifestations of disease.","Zamora, Irving J; Stoll, Barbara; Ethun, Cecilia G; Sheikh, Fariha; Yu, Ling; Burrin, Douglas G; Brandt, Mary L; Olutoye, Oluyinka O",PloS one,616,17
101776,101776,101776,Laparoscopic roux limb placement over a fistula defect without mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis: a modified technique for surgical management of chronic proximal fistulas after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.,9.250293,3.6389534,2014,"BACKGROUND Minimally invasive incisional hernia repair has been established as a safe and efficient surgical option in most centres worldwide. Laparoscopic technique includes the placement of an intraperitoneal onlay mesh with fixation achieved using spiral tacks or sutures. An additional step is the closure of the fascial defect depending upon its size. Key outcomes in the evaluation of ventral abdominal hernia surgery include postoperative pain, the presence of infection, seroma formation and hernia recurrence. TACKoMESH is a randomised controlled trial that will provide important information on the laparoscopic repair of an incisional hernia; 1) with fascial closure, 2) with an IPOM mesh and 3) comparing the use of an articulating mesh-fixation device that deploys absorbable tacks with a straight-arm mesh-fixation device that deploys non-absorbable tacks. METHODS A prospective, single-centre, double-blinded randomised trial, TACKoMESH, will establish whether the use of absorbable compared to non-absorbable tacks in adult patients undergoing elective incisional hernia repair produces a lower rate of pain both immediately and long-term. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomized to surgery with one of two tack-fixation devices and followed up for a minimum one year. Secondary outcomes to be explored include wound infection, seroma formation, hernia recurrence, length of postoperative hospital stay, reoperation rate, operation time, health related quality of life and time to return to normal daily activity. DISCUSSION With ongoing debate around the best management of incisional hernia, continued trials that will add substance are both necessary and important. Laparoscopic techniques have become established in reducing hospital stay and rates of infection and report improvement in some patient centered outcomes whilst achieving similarly low rates of recurrence as open surgical techniques. The laparoscopic method with tack fixation has developed a reputation for its tendency to cause post-operative pain. Novel additions to technique, such as intraoperative-sutured closure of a fascial defect, and developments in surgical technology, such as the evolution of composite mesh design and mesh-fixation devices, have brought about new considerations for patient and surgeon. This study will evaluate the efficacy of several new technical considerations in the setting of elective laparoscopic incisional hernia repair.

HRV was the most commonly detected virus (30%), in which 70% were diagnosed as either pneumonia or bronchiolitis. Children with single HRV infections presented with significantly higher rate of hypoxia than those infected with respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza virus (PIV)-3 (12·4% vs. 3·8% and 0%, respectively, P < 0·05), higher rate of chest retraction than PIV-1 (57·3% vs. 34·5%, P = 0·028), higher rate of wheezing than influenza A (63·2% vs. 42·3%, P = 0·038). HRV-C did not differ to HRV-A clinically. The genetic diversity and changes of types over time were observed and may explain the year-round circulation of HRV.

Hyperoxia enhances endurance performance by increasing O2 availability to locomotor muscles. We investigated whether hyperoxia can also improve prolonged self-paced exercise under conditions of elevated thermal and cardiovascular strain. What is the main finding and its importance? Hyperoxia improved self-paced exercise performance in hot and cool conditions. However, the extent of the improvement (increased work rate relative to normoxia) was greater in cool conditions. This suggests that the development of thermal and cardiovascular strain during prolonged self-paced exercise under heat stress may attenuate the hyperoxia-mediated increase in O2 delivery to locomotor muscles. ABSTRACT This study sought to determine whether breathing hyperoxic gas when self-paced exercise performance is impaired under heat stress enhances power output. Nine well-trained male cyclists performed four 40 min cycling time trials: two in 18 °C (COOL) and two in 35 °C (HOT). For the first 30 min participants breathed ambient air and for the remaining 10 min normoxic (FiO2 : 0.21, NOR) or hyperoxic (FiO2 : 0.45, HYPER) air. During the first 30 min of the time trials power output was lower in the HOT (∼250 W) compared with COOL (∼273 W) conditions (P < 0.05). In the final 10 min, power output was higher in HOT-HYPER (264 ± 25 W) than HOT-NOR (244 ± 31 W; P = 0.008), and COOL-HYPER (315 ± 28 W) than COOL-NOR (284 ± 25 W; P < 0.001). The increase in absolute power output in COOL-HYPER was greater than in HOT-HYPER (∼12 W; P = 0.057), as was normalized power output (∼30%; P < 0.001). SpO2 increased in HOT-HYPER and COOL-HYPER (P < 0.05), with COOL-HYPER being higher than HOT-HYPER (P < 0.01). Heart rate was higher during the HOT compared with COOL trials (P < 0.01), as were mean skin temperature (P < 0.001) and peak rectal temperature (HOT: ∼39.5 °C and COOL: ∼38.9 °C; P < 0.01). Thermal discomfort was also higher in the HOT compared with COOL (P < 0.01), whereas ratings of perceived exertion were similar (P > 0.05). Hyperoxia enhanced performance during the final 25% of a 40 min time trial in both HOT and COOL conditions compared with normoxia. However, the attenuated increase in absolute and normalized power output noted in the HOT condition suggests that heat stress may mitigate the influence of hyperoxia.

METHODS A cross-sectional study of women completing a televisit with an FPMRS specialist at our institution from June 19, 2020 to July 17, 2020 was conducted. A telephone questionnaire was administered to patients to assess satisfaction and savings (travel costs/time avoided). Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect patient demographics and comorbidities, CC, and televisit outcomes (e.g., face-to-face (F2F) exam scheduled, orders placed). Logistic regression was used to analyze predictors of satisfaction and need for F2F follow-up. RESULTS One hundred eighty-seven of 290 (64.5%) women called completed the survey, of whom 168 (89.8%) were satisfied with their televisit. Eighty-eight (48.1%) saved at least an hour and 54 (28.9%) saved more than $25 on transportation. There were no significant associations between patient characteristics, CC, or televisit outcomes and satisfaction. Ninety-nine (52.9%) televisits resulted in F2F follow-up, with CC of prolapse (odds ratio [OR] = 4.2 (1.7-10.3); p = 0.002), new patient (OR = 2.2 (1.2-4.2); p = 0.01), and Hispanic ethnicity (OR = 3.9 (1.2-13.6); p=.03) as significant predictors. CONCLUSION Most patients were satisfied with FPMRS televisits at our urban academic center. Televisits resulted in patient travel time and cost savings. Women presenting with prolapse and for new patient visits would likely benefit from initial F2F visits instead of televisits. Televisits are an important mode of health care and in some cases can replace F2F visits.","Shin, Christina; Allen, Ariel Z; Zhu, Denzel; Tellechea, Laura; Watts, Kara L; Abraham, Nitya E",Neurourology and urodynamics,616,33

We present our model for facility preparation based on colour-coded zones, social distancing, hand hygiene, rapid triage and separate management of symptomatic patients, and attention to infection transmission prevention between HCWs in communal staff areas. This model specifically addresses the challenges in preparing a facility for COVID-19 in a low-resource setting and in rural areas. In addition, we include links to resources to allow workers in low-resource settings to prepare their facilities adequately.","Wilkinson, L S; Moosa, S; Cooke, R; Muller, A M; Boyles, T H",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,616,31

Midgut symbiotic bacteria can be genetically exploited to express molecules within the vectors, altering vector competency and potential for disease transmission. Therefore, identification of mosquito gut inhabiting microbiota is of ample importance before developing novel vector control strategies that involve modification of vectors. Method Adult mosquitoes of Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex gelidus, and Mansonia annulifera were collected from selected Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in the Gampaha district of Sri Lanka. Midgut lysates of the field-caught non-blood-fed female mosquitoes were cultured in Plate Count Agar medium, and Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA partial genes of the isolated bacteria colonies were amplified followed by DNA sequencing. Diversity indices were used to assess the diversity and richness of the bacterial isolates in three mosquito species. The distribution pattern of bacterial isolates between different mosquito species was assessed by Distance-Based Redundancy Analysis (dbRDA). Results A total of 20 bacterial species (Staphylococcus pasteuri, Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus cohnii, Pantoea dispersa, Staphylococcus chromogenes, Bacillus aquimaris, Staphylococcus arlettae, Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus warneri, Moraxella osloensis, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella michiganensis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptomyces sp., Bacillus niacin, Cedecea neteri, Micrococcus luteus, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, and Bacillus licheniformis) were identified. All of these species belonged to three phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, out of which phylum Firmicutes (71.1%) was the most prominent. The least number of species was recorded from Actinobacteria. The relative distribution of midgut microbes in different mosquito species differed significantly among mosquito species (Chi-square, χ 2 = 486.091; df = 36; P ≤ 0.001). Midgut microbiota of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. gelidus indicated a similarity of 21.51%, while Ma. annulifera shared a similarity of 6.92% with the cluster of above two species. The gut microbiota of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was also significantly more diverse and more evenly distributed compared to Ma. annulifera. Simpson's diversity, Margalef's diversity, and Menhinick's diversity indices were higher in Cx. gelidus. Of the recorded species, P. dispersa and strains of nonpathogenic species in Bacillaceae family (B. megaterium, B. niacini, B. licheniformis, and L. sphaericus) can be recommended as potential candidates for paratransgenesis. Conclusion The relative distribution of midgut microbes in different mosquito species differed significantly among the three studied adult mosquito species. The present data strongly encourage further investigations to explore the potential usage of these microbes through paratransgenic approach for novel eco-friendly vector control strategies.","Gunathilaka, Nayana; Ranasinghe, Koshila; Amarasinghe, Deepika; Rodrigo, Wasana; Mallawarachchi, Harendra; Chandrasena, Nilmini",BioMed research international,616,1

Large health disparities exist, defined by many factors including race/ethnicity, sex, age, geography, and socioeconomic status. Studying disparities relies on measures of disease burden. Traditional measures, such as mortality, may be less applicable to neurological disorders, which often lead to substantial morbidity and lower quality of life, without necessarily causing death. Measures such as disability-adjusted life-years or healthy life expectancy may be more appropriate for assessing neurological disease and permit comparisons across diseases and communities. There are many approaches that can be used to study disparities. Analyses of population-based observational studies, patient registries, and administrative data all contribute to the understanding of disparities in humans. Animal and other experimental designs, including clinical trials, may be used to identify mechanisms and strategies to reduce disparities. All of these approaches have strengths and weaknesses. Ultimately, understanding and mitigating disparities will require use of all of these methods. Crucially, a focus on not only improving outcomes among all individuals in society but minimizing or eliminating differences between those with better outcomes and those who have historically been disadvantaged should drive the ongoing investigations into disparities. This review is focused on epidemiological approaches to examining the depth and determinants of racial-ethnic disparities in the United States related to stroke, stroke care, and stroke outcomes.","Elkind, Mitchell S V; Lisabeth, Lynda; Howard, Virginia J; Kleindorfer, Dawn; Howard, George",Stroke,616,1

It is critical to understand the mental and physical health of adolescent athletes during this time. OBJECTIVE To describe the health of athletes during COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations. DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING A national sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS A total of 13 002 US adolescent athletes (age = 16.3 ± 1.2 years, females = 52.9%, males = 47.0%) completed an anonymous online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Demographic information collected was sex, grade, sport(s) played, and zip code. Assessments used were the General Anxiety Disorder 7-Item for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity, and health-related quality-of-life variables were compared among sex, grade, sport(s) played, and poverty level using means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from the survey-weighted analysis of variance. RESULTS Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females = 43.7% versus males = 28.2%). The Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale score was highest (best) for grade 9 (mean = 14.5, 95% CI = 14.0, 15.0) and lowest for grade 11 (mean = 10.9, 95% CI = 10.5, 11.3. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest in individual sport (64.9%) participants. The total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high: mean = 74.5, 95% CI = 73.7, 75.3; middle: mean = 78.9, 95% CI = 78.0, 79.8; and low: mean = 78.3, 95% CI = 77.4, 79.1). CONCLUSIONS The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19-related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation, and level of poverty. Health policy experts should consider these findings in the future when creating and implementing policies to improve the health of adolescents in the United States.","McGuine, Timothy A; Biese, Kevin M; Petrovska, Labina; Hetzel, Scott J; Reardon, Claudia; Kliethermes, Stephanie; Bell, David Robert; Brooks, Alison; Watson, Andrew M",Journal of athletic training,616,16

Recently, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was identified and the specific interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV spike protein and DPP4 was determined by crystallography. Animal studies identified rhesus macaques but not hamsters, ferrets, or mice to be susceptible for MERS-CoV. Here, we investigated the role of DPP4 in this observed species tropism. Cell lines of human and nonhuman primate origin were permissive of MERS-CoV, whereas hamster, ferret, or mouse cell lines were not, despite the presence of DPP4. Expression of human DPP4 in nonsusceptible BHK and ferret cells enabled MERS-CoV replication, whereas expression of hamster or ferret DPP4 did not. Modeling the binding energies of MERS-CoV spike protein RBD to DPP4 of human (susceptible) or hamster (nonsusceptible) identified five amino acid residues involved in the DPP4-RBD interaction. Expression of hamster DPP4 containing the five human DPP4 amino acids rendered BHK cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, whereas expression of human DPP4 containing the five hamster DPP4 amino acids did not. Using the same approach, the potential of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4s of common Middle Eastern livestock was investigated. Modeling of the DPP4 and MERS-CoV RBD interaction predicted the ability of MERS-CoV to bind the DPP4s of camel, goat, cow, and sheep. Expression of the DPP4s of these species on BHK cells supported MERS-CoV replication. This suggests, together with the abundant DPP4 presence in the respiratory tract, that these species might be able to function as a MERS-CoV intermediate reservoir. IMPORTANCE The ongoing outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 701 laboratory-confirmed cases to date, with 249 fatalities. Although bats and dromedary camels have been identified as potential MERS-CoV hosts, the virus has so far not been isolated from any species other than humans. The inability of MERS-CoV to infect commonly used animal models, such as hamster, mice, and ferrets, indicates the presence of a species barrier. We show that the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 plays a pivotal role in the observed species tropism of MERS-CoV and subsequently identified the amino acids in DPP4 responsible for this restriction. Using a combined modeling and experimental approach, we predict that, based on the ability of MERS-CoV to utilize the DPP4 of common Middle East livestock species, such as camels, goats, sheep, and cows, these form a potential MERS-CoV intermediate host reservoir species.","van Doremalen, Neeltje; Miazgowicz, Kerri L; Milne-Price, Shauna; Bushmaker, Trenton; Robertson, Shelly; Scott, Dana; Kinne, Joerg; McLellan, Jason S; Zhu, Jiang; Munster, Vincent J",Journal of virology,616,1

Systematic protocols to guide telehealth-centered interventions in response to COVID-19 outbreaks have yet to be delineated. This article is intended to inform PA/LTC facilities and neighboring health care partners how to collaboratively utilize telehealth-centered strategies to improve outcomes in facility outbreaks. Methods: The University of Virginia rapidly developed a multidisciplinary telehealth-centered COVID-19 facility outbreak strategy in response to a LTC facility outbreak in which 41 (out of 48) facility residents and 7 staff members tested positive. This strategy focused on supporting the facility team remotely using rapidly deployed technologic solutions. Goals included (1) early identification of patients who need their care escalated, (2) monitoring and treating patients deemed safe to remain in the facility, (3) care coordination to facilitate bidirectional transfers between the skilled nursing facility (SNF) and hospital, and (4) daily facility needs assessment related to technology, infection control, and staff well-being. To achieve these goals, a standardized approach centered on daily multidisciplinary virtual rounds and telemedicine consultation was provided. Results: Over a month since the outbreak began, 18 out of 48 (38%) facility residents required hospitalization and 6 (12.5%) died. Eleven facility residents have since returned back to the SNF after recovering from their hospitalization. No staff required hospitalization. Conclusions: Interventions that reduce hospitalizations and mortality are a critical need during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality and hospitalization rates seen in this PA/LTC facility outbreak are significantly lower than has been documented in other facility outbreaks. Our multidisciplinary approach centered on telemedicine should be considered as other PA/LTC facilities partner with neighboring health care systems in responding to COVID-19 outbreaks. We have begun replicating these services to additional PA/LTC facilities facing COVID-19 outbreaks.","Harris, Drew A; Archbald-Pannone, Laurie; Kaur, Jasveen; Cattell-Gordon, David; Rheuban, Karen S; Ombres, Rachel L; Albero, Kimberly; Steele, Rebecca; Bell, Taison D; Mutter, Justin B",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,616,24

Important considerations need to be given to retrograde embolic migration or perforator involvement while treating these fistulas endovascularly with a liquid embolic agent. We report a lateral spinal artery feeding the DAVF, the recognition of which is important to avoid potential catastrophic complications during definitive therapy, and which has not been described before. OBJECTIVE To discuss the anatomy of the lateral spinal artery (LSA) and its communications with pial arteries such as the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) that may have important implications in the management of neurovascular diseases in and around the foramen magnum. METHODS A retrospective analysis of cerebral angiograms and 3-dimensional rotational angiograms of a patient with medullary-bridging vein DAVF treated by transarterial embolization under balloon protection was performed after the patient developed lateral medullary syndrome in the postoperative period. RESULTS Detailed analysis revealed a dural branch from the LSA feeding the DAVF which anastomosed with rudimentary PICA. CONCLUSION LSA has important anastomoses with perforating arteries of the medulla and cervical cord and, hence, it is important to recognize and identify LSA prospectively in the vascular pathologies of the foramen magnum to avoid fatal neurological complications during endovascular therapy. This is especially important while treating neurovascular pathologies using liquid embolic agents such as Onyx or SQUID, because they can percolate retrogradely through the anastomoses into PICA or other vertebrobasilar perforators.","Kannath, Santhosh; Rajan Jayadevan, Enakshy",Operative neurosurgery,616,31

This work reports on the application of MR angiographic (MRA) and venographic (MRV) techniques in assessing the extracranial vasculature in MS patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS A standardized MRI protocol containing 2D TOF-MRV and dynamic 3D contrast-enhanced (CE) MRAV was run for 170 MS patients and 40 healthy controls (HC). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) was measured at three neck levels in all subjects for both MRV techniques to determine the presence of venous stenoses. All data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS For the values where both methods showed signal, the 3D method showed larger CSA measurement values compared to 2D methods in both IJVs, in both MS and HC subjects which was confirmed with student paired t-tests. Of the 170 MS patients, 93 (55%) in CE-MRAV and 103 (61%) in TOF-MRV showed stenosis in at least one IJV. The corresponding numbers for the 40 HC subjects were 2 (5%) and 4 (10%), respectively. Carotid ectasias with IJV stenosis were seen in 26 cases (15%) with 3D CE-MRAV and were not observable with 2D TOF-MRV. Carotid ectasias were not seen in the HC group. In the 2D TOF-MRV data, banding of the IJVs related to slow flow was seen in 58 (34%) MS cases and in no HC cases. MS patients showed lower average CSAs than the HC subjects. CONCLUSION The 3D CE MRAV depicted the vascular anatomy more completely than the 2D TOF-MRV. However, the 3D CE MRAV does not provide any information about the flow characteristics which are indirectly available in the 2D TOF-MRV in those cases where there is slow flow.","Rahman, M Tamizur; Sethi, Sean K; Utriainen, David T; Hewett, J Joseph; Haacke, E Mark",Magnetic resonance imaging,616,20

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to determine whether interventions providing whole grain or whole pseudo-grain for dietary consumption improved CVD-related outcomes compared with refined grain or placebo in adults with or without chronic disease and/or associated risk factors. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared whole-grain vs refined-grain or placebo consumption by human adults was conducted. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched for studies of 12 weeks (or 2 weeks for inflammatory outcomes) duration until 21 February 2020. Data were extracted for 14 types of CVD risk factors (40 outcomes in total). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method was used to determine confidence in the pooled effects and to inform a clinical recommendation. RESULTS Twenty-five randomized controlled trials were included and 22 were meta-analyzed. Interventions ranged from 2 to 16 weeks; most samples were healthy (n = 13 studies) and used mixed whole grains (n = 11 studies). Meta-analysis found that whole-grain oats improved total cholesterol (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.54, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.12) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.31), whole-grain rice improved triglycerides (SMD = 0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.01), and whole grains (all types) improved hemoglobin A1c (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.04) and C-reactive protein (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.00). CONCLUSIONS For adults with or without CVD risk factors, consuming whole grains as opposed to refined grains can improve total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the whole grains as opposed to refined grains for the prevention and treatment of CVD. Further interventional research is needed to better understand the preventive and treatment potential of whole-grain and whole pseudo-grain dietary intake for cardiovascular disease, particularly among those with existing CVD risk factors.","Marshall, Skye; Petocz, Peter; Duve, Emily; Abbott, Kylie; Cassettari, Tim; Blumfield, Michelle; Fayet-Moore, Flavia",Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,616,12

Even though some surgeons have shown equal lymph node ratio and oncologic radicality for laparoscopic surgery of pancreatic cancer, oncologic surgeons still take reasonably conservative views of the use of minimally invasive techniques for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, especially if located in the head of the pancreas. Laparoscopic abdominal approaches on the other hand have a potential advantage of better visualization, decreased postoperative pain, decreased use of analgetics, and shorter hospital stay. We demonstrate in this technical surgical report the first description of a total laparoscopic pancreatoduodenectomy and reconstruction via laparoscopic pancreatogastrostomy in a 74-year-old female patient with a periampullary tumor. DISCUSSION After pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy by superior mesenteric artery, first approach including standard lymphadenectomy, the reconstruction involved total laparoscopic end-to-side running-suture hepaticojejunostomy, double-layer running-suture antecolic pylorojejunostomy to the first jejunal loop, and pancreatogastrostomy via posterior gastrotomy secured by two anchoring and purse-string sutures.","Keck, Tobias; Küsters, Simon; Wellner, Ulrich Friedrich; Hopt, Ulrich Theodor; Karcz, Konrad Wojciech",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,616,29

Downstream, this culminates in natural killer T (NKT) cell activation and cytokine secretion. To determine whether apoE antagonism would protect against septic mortality in mice, apoE-LDLR binding was antagonized using heparin, which can inhibit apoE's LDLR-binding site. METHODS C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and heparin infusion. Serum partial thromboplastin time and alanine aminotransferase were measured at 24 hours, and survival was monitored for 7 days after CLP. LDLR+/+ and LDLR-/- fibroblasts were incubated with apoE and heparin to measure apoE internalization. Hepatic NKT cells and cytokine levels were quantified via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. RESULTS Heparin decreased CLP-induced mortality by 50% versus saline-treated controls, independent of anticoagulation. LDLR+/+ fibroblasts displayed decreased uptake of apoE when treated concurrently with heparin for 12 hours. In septic mice, hepatic alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatic NKT cells, and plasma cytokine levels decreased after heparin treatment. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that heparin protects against septic mortality independent of its anticoagulant effect. This protective effect is associated with the inhibition of apoE-LDLR binding, diminished NKT proliferation and cytokine production, and hepatic dysfunction. These findings indicate a potential clinical role for apoE antagonism in the treatment of sepsis.","Chuang, Kelley I; Leung, Briana; Hsu, Nancy; Harris, Hobart W",American journal of surgery,616,1

All international multicenter registries have reported on the progressive occlusion of aneurysms with time and have implied that an occluded aneurysm would not recanalize given the protective effect of the altered hemodynamics. Recanalization of an occluded aneurysm after placement of a flow-diverting stent has not been reported in the literature. The authors here describe a case of aneurysm recanalization after immediate thrombotic occlusion of the aneurysm with a flow-diverting stent. A 46-year-old male chronic smoker with chronic hypertension and hypercholesterolemia had a recurrent internal carotid artery aneurysm 1 year after embolization. Immediate thrombotic occlusion of the aneurysm and cessation of blood flow to the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) occurred immediately after activating a flow-diverting stent, with corresponding ischemic complications. However, 3 months after insertion of the stent, follow-up MR angiography showed recanalization of the aneurysm as well as of the PCoA. Additional angiography studies at 6 months showed near-total occlusion of the aneurysm with the restoration of blood flow to the PCoA.","Wong, George Kwok Chu; Yu, Simon Chun Ho; Siu, Deyond Yung Woon; Poon, Wai Sang",Journal of neurosurgery,616,25

We encountered a patient with thoracic pneumatosis after frequent displacement of the tracheal tube with an overinflated cuff. CASE PRESENTATION We admitted a 62-year-old man to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure. We secured his airway using a cuffed 8.5-mm tracheal tube. However, air leakage did not stop with the regular intracuff pressure (25 cm H2O) because the diameter of his trachea was too large for the tracheal tube inserted. In addition, a chest X-ray examination revealed rostral tube displacement. Therefore, we applied a higher intracuff pressure (35 cm H2O) to prevent air leakage and tracheal tube movement. However, severe coughing episodes developed, and 3 days after ICU admission, a chest X-ray and CT scan revealed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax. We did not have larger tracheal tubes in stock. We decided to use a tracheostomy tube instead, which we expected to be placed securely and to prevent tube displacement. After tracheostomy, the severe coughing episodes became infrequent. Finally, we weaned the patient from mechanical ventilation 12 days after ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS The clinical signs and symptoms in our patient point to tracheal tube size mismatch as the cause of pneumothorax.","Tachiiri, Yuka; Inoue, Satoki; Kawaguchi, Masahiko",JA clinical reports,616,31

However, the sensitivity of PCR tests also complicates clinical interpretation, as the presence of small amounts of viral targets may not necessarily have clinical relevance. We performed a prospective case-control study in asymptomatic and symptomatic young children. PCR detection of 14 respiratory viruses was performed in nasal washes, and results were quantified in copies per milliliter. A total of 141 cases and 157 controls were included. In 72% of the cases and 28% of the controls, at least one virus was identified. When stratified for age, at least one virus was identified in 47% of the controls younger than 1 year old. Rhinovirus (RV) was frequently detected in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for quantitative rhinovirus detection showed that cutoff values for clinical relevance are feasible for RV. In contrast to rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was rarely detected in controls, suggesting that a positive RSV test result is almost always of clinical relevance, independent of viral quantity. In conclusion, our study shows that asymptomatic carriage of a respiratory virus occurs frequently in young children. However, significant differences in the amount of virus present were observed between cases and controls. This suggests that defining cutoff levels should be feasible and represents the next necessary step for diagnosing viral respiratory infections using molecular tests.","Jansen, Rogier R; Wieringa, Joanne; Koekkoek, Sylvie M; Visser, Caroline E; Pajkrt, Dasja; Molenkamp, Richard; de Jong, Menno D; Schinkel, Janke",Journal of clinical microbiology,616,24

Among adults, it represents a spectrum of neoplasms with reserved prognosis. There is no consensus on the treatment of choice of these lesions, justifying a systematic review of the literature on treatment options, prognostic factors, and survival. MATERIAL/METHODS a systematic review of articles published in Pubmed, Medline, LiLacs e SciElo, from 1966 to March/2019, presenting the keywords: primary-liver-sarcoma and primary-hepatic-sarcoma was undertaken. Studies including patients older than 18 years, and published in English, Portuguese and Spanish were included. Case reports, metastatic tumors and multiple oncologic diagnosis were excluded. The initial search listed 1,318 articles. 1,206 did not meet the inclusion criteria. After reviewing 112 eligible articles, 15 were selected (14 case series and 1 retrospective-cohort). RESULTS proposed treatment modalities for primary liver sarcoma included surgery and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy or liver transplantation. The most common histological types were angiosarcoma (32%), leiomyosarcoma (29%), epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (15%) and embryonal sarcoma (7%). Histology, degree of differentiation and R0 resection were mentioned positive prognostic factors. Median survival ranged from two to 23 months. Five-year survival rate varied from 0% to 64%, on average 21%. CONCLUSION surgical resection (R0 resection) is the main treatment for primary liver sarcomas. Development of effective systemic therapies are required to improve prognosis of patients harboring this type of tumor.","Martins, Antonio Cavalcanti DE Albuquerque; Costa Neto, DuÍlio Cabral DA; Silva, JÚlio Dourado DE-Matos E; Moraes, Ygor Monteiro; LeÃo, Cristiano Souza; Martins, Carolina",Revista do Colegio Brasileiro de Cirurgioes,616,1

Thus, the main goal of this study was to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weight measured during the first trimester of pregnancy among Brazilian women so as to assess whether self-reported pre-pregnancy weight is reliable and can be used for calculation of BMI and GWG. METHODS Data from the Brazilian Maternal and Child Nutrition Consortium (BMCNC, n = 5563) and the National Food and Nutritional Surveillance System (SISVAN, n = 393,095) were used to evaluate the agreement between self-reported pre-pregnancy weight and weights measured in three overlapping intervals (30-94, 30-60 and 30-45 days of pregnancy) and their impact in BMI classification. We calculated intraclass correlation and Lin's concordance coefficients, constructed Bland and Altman plots, and determined Kappa coefficient for the categories of BMI. RESULTS The mean of the differences between self-reported and measured weights was < 2 kg during the three intervals examined for BMCNC (1.42, 1.39 and 1.56 kg) and about 1 kg for SISVAN (1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 kg). Intraclass correlation and Lin's coefficient were > 0.90 for both datasets in all time intervals. Bland and Altman plots showed that the majority of the difference laid in the ±2 kg interval and that the differences did not vary according to measured first-trimester BMI. Kappa coefficient values were > 0.80 for both datasets at all intervals. Using self-reported pre-pregnancy or measured weight would change, in total, the classification of BMI in 15.9, 13.5, and 12.2% of women in the BMCNC and 12.1, 10.7, and 10.2% in the SISVAN, at 30-94, 30-60 and 30-45 days, respectively. CONCLUSION In Brazil, self-reported pre-pregnancy weight can be used for calculation of BMI and GWG when an early measurement of weight during pregnancy is not available. These results are especially important in a country where the majority of woman do not initiate prenatal care early in pregnancy.","Rangel Bousquet Carrilho, Thaís; M Rasmussen, Kathleen; Rodrigues Farias, Dayana; Freitas Costa, Nathalia Cristina; Araújo Batalha, Mônica; E Reichenheim, Michael; O Ohuma, Eric; Hutcheon, Jennifer A; Kac, Gilberto",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,616,31

For QOL to be accurately measured in these children, pediatric QOL must first be conceptualized. Some theoretical models and definitions have been proposed to understand QOL, but they were not developed for the pediatric population. The purpose of this review is to build on existing frameworks of QOL and develop a framework and definition of pediatric QOL for measurement purposes, by integrating the findings of multiple qualitative studies involving children and adolescents with physical disabilities. METHODS A systematic search was conducted on four databases. Inclusion criteria were qualitative studies with participants with common neurological and neuromuscular conditions. The content of studies had to involve the lived experiences of children and adolescents with disabilities. Thematic synthesis was conducted. RESULTS 48 studies were included. Results generated a schema of the causes and the mitigators of QOL. This consisted of casual indicators of QOL, mitigators, and components of QOL. Themes under QOL included thoughts and feelings, fitting in, self-image, about the future, and independence. A new framework and definition of pediatric QOL were proposed. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, pediatric QOL for children with disabilities is formed by their thoughts and feelings, being accepted by society, being able to forge an identity that is beyond their disability, having autonomy, and having a hope for the future. The resulting QOL framework proposed here can also aid future development of QOL measures in children with physical disabilities.","Ow, Nikki; Appau, Adriana; Matout, Mohamad; Mayo, Nancy E","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",616,16

Especially, in preparation for expected mass casualty incident it is necessary to distinguish early and efficiently between outpatient and inpatient treatment including the need for intensive care therapy. METHODS We present a model for a safe and efficient triage, which is established and used in the university hospital of Essen, Germany. It is intended for a non-disaster situation. This model is a combination of clinical assessment by using vital parameters and Manchester triage scale (MTS). Possible additional parameters are POCT (point-of-care-testing) values, electrocardiogram, CT pulmonary angiography, SARS-Cov2-PCR as well as detailed diagnostic of laboratory values. The model was validated by 100 consecutive patients. We demonstrate three patients to illustrate this model. RESULTS During the first two weeks after implementing this model in our normal operation at the emergency department, we had an efficient selectivity between need for inpatient and outpatient treatment. 16 patients were classified as ""inpatients"" according to initial assessment. Among 84 patients who were initially classified as ""outpatients"", 7 patients returned to our emergency department within 14 days. Three of these patients returned due to complaints other than COVID19. One female patient had to be admitted due to progressive dyspnea. CONCLUSIONS This introduced triage-model seems to be an efficient concept. Adjustment might be necessary after further experience and after a growing number of patients.","Fistera, David; Risse, Joachim; Manegold, Randi; Pabst, Dirk; Konik, Margarete; Dolff, Sebastian; Witzke, Oliver; Schaarschmidt, Benedikt Michael; Taube, Christian; Kill, Clemens; Holzner, Carola",Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,616,12

Eight weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection5,6. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, targeting a number of different RBD epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors5-8. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy.","Wang, Zijun; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Muecksch, Frauke; Barnes, Christopher O; Finkin, Shlomo; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Cipolla, Melissa; Gaebler, Christian; Lieberman, Jenna A; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Yang, Zhi; Abernathy, Morgan E; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; West, Kamille A; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G; Ramos, Victor; Silva, Justin Da; Xu, Jianliang; Colbert, Robert A; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O'Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Gazumyan, Anna; Caskey, Marina; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Casellas, Rafael; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature,616,30

Meisn., which comes from the roots of buckwheat, a type of Chinese herbal medicine, was first recorded in ""Bencao Shiyi"". WMN has inhibitory effects on multiple cancer types and is widely used in clinical practice; however, the mechanism underlying the anti-tumor effect of WMN is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY To investigate the effect of WMN on the cellular activity and apoptosis of mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells, and caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS Luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer 4T1-luc2 cells were inoculated into the mouse breast pad to establish a luciferase-labeled mouse breast cancer cell model. BALB/C-nu mice were randomly divided into model, WMN, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) groups (n=10). Another 10 mice served as the normal control group (no cancer cell injection). The WMN group was administered WMN 250 mg/kg per day for 14 days, the LMWH group was given LMWH (1500 U/kg) daily for 14 days by intraperitoneal injection, and the model and normal control groups were given an equal dose of 0.9% NaCl. The number and distribution of transplanted tumors in 4T1-luc2 breast cancer cells were observed in nude mice by an in vivo imaging system at the time of inoculation after successful modeling, and on days 7 and 14 after drug administration. Tumor cell apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method; caspase-3 mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting was applied to detect the levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression. RESULTS The apoptosis index (AI) of the WMN group was detected by the TUNEL method, and the AI increased with the increase of treatment time. Compared with the model group, the mRNA expression of caspase-3 and the protein levels of caspase-3 and cleaved-caspase-3 were notably elevated in the WMN group. After in vivo bioluminescent imaging, the total photon number of the WMN group was found to be lower than that of the LWMH group on day 14 after administration. Additionally, the AI and expression levels of caspase-3 mRNA, caspase-3, and cleaved-caspase-3 protein of the WMN group were higher than those of the LWMH group. CONCLUSION WMN can effectively suppress the growth of 4T1-luc2 breast cancer xenografts in mice, and promote the apoptosis of breast cancer cells by upregulating the expression of caspase-3.","Ke, Haoliang; Wang, Xiuping; Zhou, Zhen; Ai, Wang; Wu, Zhaoyan; Zhang, Yingwen",Journal of ethnopharmacology,616,12

OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of multicomponent pediatric obesity treatment interventions on self-esteem and body image. METHODS A systematic search of published literature up to June 2019 was undertaken using electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO. Eligible studies implemented an obesity treatment intervention, including a dietary and physical activity component with/without a behavioral component, in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity, and assessed self-esteem and/or body image. Data were extracted by one reviewer and cross-checked. Meta-analysis was used to combine outcome data and moderator analysis conducted to identify intervention characteristics influencing outcomes. RESULTS 64 studies were identified. Meta-analysis of 49 studies (n = 10471) indicated that pediatric obesity treatment results in increased self-esteem postintervention (standardized mean difference, [SE] 0.34 [0.03], P < .001, I2 87%), maintained at follow-up (0.35 [0.05] P < .001, I2 79%, 17 studies). Similarly, meta-analysis of 40 studies (n = 2729) indicated improvements in body image postintervention (0.40 [0.03], P < .001, I2 73%), maintained at follow-up (0.41 [0.08], P < .001, I2 89%, 16 studies). CONCLUSIONS Pediatric obesity treatment improves self-esteem and body image in the short and medium term. These findings may underpin improvements in other psychological outcomes.","Gow, Megan L; Tee, Melissa S Y; Garnett, Sarah P; Baur, Louise A; Aldwell, Katharine; Thomas, Sarah; Lister, Natalie B; Paxton, Susan J; Jebeile, Hiba",Pediatric obesity,616,20

While many diagnostic criteria have been proposed, a gold standard for diagnosis is lacking. Use of multiple diagnostic criteria within the joint arthroplasty community raises concerns in patient treatment and comparison of research pertaining to PJI. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We (1) determined the variation in existing diagnostic criteria, (2) compared the existing criteria to a proposed new set of criteria that incorporates aspirate cell count analysis, and (3) investigated the variations between the existing criteria and the proposed criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively identified 182 patients undergoing 192 revision knee arthroplasties who had a preoperative joint aspiration analysis at our institution between April 2002 and November 2009. We excluded 20 cases due to insufficient laboratory parameters, leaving 172 cases for analysis. We applied six previously published sets of diagnostic criteria for PJI to determine the variation in its incidence using each set of criteria. We then compared these diagnostic criteria to our proposed new criteria and investigated cases where disagreement occurred. RESULTS We identified 41 cases (24%) in which at least one established criteria set classified the case as infected while at least one other criteria set classified the case as uninfected. With our proposed criteria, the infected/uninfected ratio was 92/80. The proposed criteria had a large variance in sensitivity (54%-100%), specificity (39%-100%), and accuracy (53%-100%) when using each of the established criteria sets as the reference standard. CONCLUSIONS The discrepancy between definitions of infection complicates interpretation of the literature and the treatment of failed TKAs owing to PJI. Based on our findings, we suggest establishing a common set of diagnostic criteria utilizing aspirate analysis to improve the treatment of PJI and facilitate interpretation of the literature.

Common challenges with intracorporeal neobladder formation relate to fashioning a tension-free urethro-ileal anastomosis. In this paper, we describe a series of maneuvers to overcome these challenges that we believe will be of great utility to surgeons performing intracorporeal neobladder. OBJECTIVE To describe maneuvers to overcome challenges during intracorporeal urethro-ileal anastomosis formation and to report postoperative outcomes for patients in whom these maneuvers were used. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of medical records of patients who underwent RARC with intracorporeal neobladder performed by one surgeon (G.-P.H.) at our tertiary center from January 2012 to February 2015 in which at least one additional maneuver was required beyond preservation of urethral length, removal of the sigmoid colon from the pelvis, and careful ileal loop selection. The primary end point was 90-d complications. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 36 mo, and 16 patients had at least 1-yr follow-up. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RARC with intracorporeal neobladder formation. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES Clinical and operative data collected from a prospectively maintained, institutional review board-approved database. Maneuvers used during intracorporeal urethro-ileal anastomosis were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate postoperative outcomes. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Nineteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean operative time was 486 min (standard deviation: 112 min) with median hospitalization of 7 d (interquartile range: 7-9 d). Seven patients (36.8%) experienced a complication, with one (5.3%) major complication thought to be unrelated to surgery. No open conversions were required. There was no 90-d mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our stepwise approach can help overcome challenges of urethro-ileal anastomosis during intracorporeal neobladder formation. PATIENT SUMMARY When performing intracorporeal neobladder formation, challenges are often encountered in fashioning the urethro-ileal anastomosis. We describe a series of maneuvers that, when used in a stepwise manner, help overcome these challenges.","Almassi, Nima; Zargar, Homayoun; Ganesan, Vishnu; Fergany, Amr; Haber, Georges-Pascal",European urology,616,24

BACKGROUND Functional TR is common and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There are no reported transcatheter tricuspid valve repairs. We describe a transcatheter extracardiac tricuspid annuloplasty device positioned in the pericardial space and delivered by puncture through the right atrial appendage. We demonstrate acute and chronic feasibility in swine. METHODS Transatrial intrapericardial tricuspid annuloplasty (TRAIPTA) was performed in 16 Yorkshire swine, including 4 with functional TR. Invasive hemodynamics and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at baseline, immediately after annuloplasty and at follow-up. RESULTS Pericardial access via a right atrial appendage puncture was uncomplicated. In 9 naïve animals, tricuspid septal-lateral and anteroposterior dimensions, the annular area and perimeter, were reduced by 49%, 31%, 59%, and 24% (p < 0.001), respectively. Tricuspid leaflet coaptation length was increased by 53% (p < 0.001). Tricuspid geometric changes were maintained after 9.7 days (range, 7 to 14 days). Small effusions (mean, 46 ml) were observed immediately post-procedure but resolved completely at follow-up. In 4 animals with functional TR, severity of regurgitation by intracardiac echocardiography was reduced. CONCLUSIONS Transatrial intrapericardial tricuspid annuloplasty is a transcatheter extracardiac tricuspid valve repair performed by exiting the heart from within via a transatrial puncture. The geometry of the tricuspid annulus can interactively be modified to reduce severity of functional TR in an animal model.","Rogers, Toby; Ratnayaka, Kanishka; Sonmez, Merdim; Franson, Dominique N; Schenke, William H; Mazal, Jonathan R; Kocaturk, Ozgur; Chen, Marcus Y; Faranesh, Anthony Z; Lederman, Robert J",JACC.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this systematic review was to identify health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth aged 5-17 years. METHODS A systematic search of two electronic databases (MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus) was conducted in September 2020. Only peer-reviewed studies that developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth were eligible provided they included (1) youth aged 5-17 years from the general population; (2) at least one quantitative assessment of CRF (e.g., peak oxygen uptake [[Formula: see text]O2peak]); (3) at least one quantitative assessment of health (e.g., cardiometabolic risk); (4) a criterion for health; and (5) a quantitative analysis (e.g., receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve) of at least one health-related cut-point for CRF. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the results of the included studies. RESULTS Collectively, 29 included studies developed health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among 193,311 youth from 23 countries. CRF cut-points, expressed as [Formula: see text]O2peak, estimated using the 20-m shuttle run test, demonstrated high discriminatory ability (median area under the curve [AUC] ≥ 0.71) for both cardiometabolic and obesity risk. Cut-points derived from maximal cycle-ergometer tests demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability (median AUC 0.64-0.70) for cardiometabolic risk, and low discriminatory ability for early subclinical atherosclerosis (median AUC 0.56-0.63). Cut-points for CRF using submaximal treadmill exercise testing demonstrated high discriminatory ability for cardiometabolic risk, but only moderate discriminatory ability for obesity risk. CRF cut-points estimated using submaximal step testing demonstrated high discriminatory ability for cardiometabolic risk and moderate discriminatory ability for high blood pressure, while those for the 9-min walk/run test demonstrated moderate-to-high discriminatory ability for obesity risk. Collectively, CRF cut-points, expressed as [Formula: see text]O2peak, demonstrated moderate-to-high discriminatory ability (median AUC ≥ 0.64) for cardiometabolic risk, obesity risk, and high blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS Currently, there is too wide a range of health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF among youth to suggest universal age- and sex-specific thresholds. To further inform the development of universal cut-points, there is a need for additional research, using standardized testing protocols and health-risk definitions, that examines health-related criterion-referenced cut-points for CRF that are age, sex, and culturally diverse.

Similar differences even among females in different hormonal balance might influence microvascular response during cold provocation testing. The aim of the present study was to measure sex hormone levels, cold and cold pain perception thresholds and compare them to cutaneous laser-Doppler flux response during local cooling in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. In the luteal phase a more pronounced decrease in laser-Doppler flux was observed compared to follicular phase during local cooling at 15°C (significant difference by Dunnett's test, p<0.05). In addition, statistically significant correlations between progesterone level and laser-Doppler flux response to local cooling were observed during the follicular (R=-0.552, p=0.0174) and during the luteal phases (R=0.520, p=0.0271). In contrast, the correlation between estradiol level and laser-Doppler flux response was observed only in the follicular phase (R=-0.506, p=0.0324). Our results show that individual sensitivity to cold influences cutaneous microvascular response to local cooling; that microvascular reactivity is more pronounced during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle; and that reactivity correlates with hormone levels.

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical validity of the Hand CAC 30 in enterocolic side-to-side anastomosis after colonic or enteric resections. METHODS A non-randomized prospective data collection was performed for patients undergoing a side-to-side anastomosis using the Hand CAC 30. Eligibility criteria for the use of the Hand CAC 30 were for anastomoses between the colon and the ileum or between two small bowels. The primary short-term endpoint was the rate of anastomotic leakage. Other clinical outcomes, including intra- and postoperative complications, length of operation time and hospital stay, and the clip elimination time were recorded. RESULTS A total of 63 patients (male, 36) underwent an enteric or right-sided colonic resection followed by a side-to-side anastomosis using the Hand CAC 30. Laparoscopic surgery was performed in 36 patients, in whom one patient who underwent a laparoscopic right hemicolectomy was converted to an open procedure (1/32, 3.1%). One patient with ascending colon cancer showed postoperative anastomotic leakage and died of co-morbid ischemic heart disease. There were no other surgical mortalities. The exact date of expulsion of the clip could not be recorded because most patients were not aware of clip elimination. No patients manifested clinical symptoms of anastomotic stricture.

BACKGROUND Healthcare service providers have worked to augment efforts to protect the public from the impact of epidemic events. While constituting the major healthcare taskforce, nurses are frequently tasked with fronting the response to an infectious disease outbreak. Given the crucial role of nurses in the management of prevailing epidemics, the constituents of their preparedness in epidemic events should be identified. DESIGN A systematic search was undertaken to identify eligible studies from the literature. A narrative synthesis approach was employed to extract and synthesise findings of the reviewed qualitative studies. METHODS Seven qualitative studies on nurses' experience and perceptions of epidemic events were examined for scientific quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Qualitative Checklist. Findings of these studies were synthesised adopting a narrative synthesis approach. RESULTS Three interplaying themes were identified as follows: (i) personal resources, (ii) workplace resources and (iii) situational influences. The findings suggest that an effective epidemic outbreak response would require further effort to reinforce the interplay between individual nurses, healthcare institutions and the governments. CONCLUSIONS The practical interplay among individual nurses, healthcare institutions and the governments is crucial in establishing an effective epidemic response. Further research on the understanding of the dynamic process of preparedness development is recommended to set future directions in research. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This study offers important insights for devising future strategies in enhancing nurses' preparedness and response to an epidemic event. These include recommendations on providing education and training to nurses regarding infectious diseases, fostering institutional assistance and support in an outbreak and revising government policies and planning.","Lam, Stanley K K; Kwong, Enid W Y; Hung, Maria S Y; Pang, Samantha M C; Chiang, Vico C L",Journal of clinical nursing,616,1

Circular RNA HIPK3 (CircHIPK3) is reported to be abnormally expressed in various disease tissues and affects the occurrence and development of the disease. However, the role and underlying mechanism of CircRNA HIPK3 in osteoarthritis are still unclear. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of CircRNA HIPK3 on osteoarthritis and analyze its regulatory mechanism. PATIENTS AND METHODS We took human OA tissues, normal knee cartilage, human OA chondrocytes and normal chondrocytes as the research objects. Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect CircHIPK3 expression level, its target gene miRNA 124 (miR-124) and downstream target molecule SOX8. Flow cytometry analysis was applied to discover the apoptosis of CircHIPK3 and miR-124 on OA cartilage in different transfection situations. Moreover, Western blot and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression of caspase-3 in OA chondrocytes. The binding site of CircRNA HIPK3 and miR-124, miR-124, and SOX8 were verified by using Dual-Luciferase assay. RESULTS High expressed CircHIPK3 and low expressed miR-124 were found in OA tissues and OA chondrocytes. In addition, the Dual-Luciferase report showed CircHIPK3 acted as a sponge of miR-124 in OA chondrocytes. CircHIPK3 and miR-124 expression in OA tissue were confirmed to be negatively correlated. To our surprise, knocking down CircHIPK3 and transfected miR-124 mimics both inhibited the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes. Further experiments verified that the downstream target molecule of miR-124 was SOX8 in OA chondrocytes. Besides, miR-124 inhibitors reversed the knockdown of CircHIPK3 while si-SOX8 reversed the miR-124 inhibitors effect of apoptosis on OA chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrated that CircHIPK3 was significantly upregulated in OA cartilage tissue and cells. Low expression of CircHIPK3 promoted the apoptosis of OA chondrocytes by promoting miR-124 to suppress SOX8 expression. The molecular mechanism of CircHIPK3 in present study is expected to provide new ideas for the treatment of osteoarthritis.","Wu, Q; Yuan, Z-H; Ma, X-B; Tang, X-H",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,616,1

Studies summarising COVID-19 mitigation strategies designed and implemented by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to avoid delays, deferrments and interruptions of radiotherapy services are lacking. Materials and methods A systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guideline. Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles that reported measures adopted by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Information on different strategies were extracted from the included studies and textual narrative synthesis was conducted. Results Of 60 articles retrieved, eleven were included. Majority of the studies were conducted in China. Ten of the included studies employed a qualitative design. Four themes were identified: preparing and equipping staff; reinforcing infection prevention and control policies; strengthening coordination and communication; and maintaining physical distancing. Studies reported that radiotherapy centres had: formed COVID-19 response multidisciplinary team; maximised the use of telehealth; adjusted the layout of waiting areas; divided staff into teams; dedicated a room for isolating suspected cases; and adopted triage systems. Conclusions Local adaptation of established global strategies coupled with timely development of guidelines, flexibility and innovation have allowed radiotherapy leaders to continue to deliver radiotherapy services to cancer patients in LMICs during the COVID-19 crisis.

DATA SOURCES Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION Observational studies and randomized clinical trials studying hemostatic effectiveness of andexanet alfa or prothrombin complex concentrate for acute reversal of factor Xa inhibitor-associated hemorrhage. DATA EXTRACTION Two independent reviewers extracted the data from the studies. Visualization and comparison of hemostatic effectiveness using Sarode et al or International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis Scientific and Standardization Committee criteria at 12 and 24 hours, (venous) thrombotic event rates, and inhospital mortality were performed by constructing Forest plots. Exploratory analysis using a logistic mixed model analysis was performed to identify factors associated with effectiveness and venous thromboembolic event. DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 21 studies were included (andexanet: 438 patients; prothrombin complex concentrate: 1,278 patients). The (weighted) mean effectiveness for andexanet alfa was 82% at 12 hours and 71% at 24 hours. The (weighted) mean effectiveness for prothrombin complex concentrate was 88% at 12 hours and 76% at 24 hours. The mean 30-day symptomatic venous thromboembolic event rates were 5.0% for andexanet alfa and 1.9% for prothrombin complex concentrate. The mean 30-day total thrombotic event rates for andexanet alfa and prothrombin complex concentrate were 10.7% and 3.1%, respectively. Mean inhospital mortality was 23.3% for andexanet versus 15.8% for prothrombin complex concentrate. Exploratory analysis controlling for potential confounders did not demonstrate significant differences between both reversal agents. CONCLUSIONS Currently, available evidence does not unequivocally support the clinical effectiveness of andexanet alfa or prothrombin complex concentrate to reverse factor Xa inhibitor-associated acute major bleeding, nor does it permit conventional meta-analysis of potential superiority. Neither reversal agent was significantly associated with increased effectiveness or a higher rate of venous thromboembolic event. These results underscore the importance of randomized controlled trials comparing the two reversal agents and may provide guidance in designing institutional guidelines.","Nederpelt, Charlie J; Naar, Leon; Krijnen, Pieta; le Cessie, Saskia; Kaafarani, Haytham M A; Huisman, Menno V; Velmahos, George C; Schipper, Inger B",Critical care medicine,616,16

Older adults are the most sedentary age group, and decreasing sitting time represents an intervention target for improving health. Determinants of sedentary behavior have been examined in older adults living in their own homes, yet less is known about sedentary behavior of older adults in residential care facilities. The purpose of this study was to explore factors contributing to sedentary behavior among residents of independent and assisted living facilities. We conducted eight focus groups with residents (n = 44) and semi-structured interviews with staff (n = 6) across four living facilities. Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative, inductive approach. Three salient themes were identified. Residents and staff both viewed sedentary behavior negatively unless it was in the context of social engagement. Additionally, fear of falling was discussed as a significant contributor to sedentary behavior. Finally, residents felt the community living environment contributed to their sedentary behavior while staff did not. Our findings provide valuable insight for designing targeted interventions for older adults in residential facilities and suggest thinking beyond the individual and considering environmental influences on sedentary behavior in the residential care setting.","Kotlarczyk, Mary P; Hergenroeder, Andrea L; Gibbs, Bethany Barone; Cameron, Flor de Abril; Hamm, Megan E; Brach, Jennifer S",International journal of environmental research and public health,616,1

Objective The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and preventability of hospital admissions to a geriatric ward related to ADEs, to identify medications involved in these ADEs and to describe potential preventability aspects of ADE-related admissions. Setting University Hospital Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. Methods This cross-sectional study evaluated acute hospital admissions to the geriatric ward of University Hospital Hradec Králové over a period of nine months (April-December 2017). Medication reviews were performed in order to identify ADE-related hospital admissions. Causality was assessed using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre criteria. Modified Schumock-Thornton algorithm was used to assess the preventability of ADEs. Main outcome measure 9-month-prevalence of ADE-related hospital admissions. Results A total of 366 hospital admissions were included. The 9-month-prevalence of ADE-related hospital admissions was 11.75% [95% confidence interval 8.45-15.05]. Antithrombotic agents and diuretics represented the most common medication classes associated with ADEs (30.2% each). Electrolyte disturbances and gastrointestinal haemorrhages and ulcerations were the most frequently observed ADEs associated with hospital admission. Out of 43 ADE-related hospitalisations, 23 (53.5%) were considered potentially preventable. Conclusion The contribution of ADEs to hospital admission to the geriatric ward was not negligible. Our results also suggest that 53.5% of identified ADE-related admissions could be potentially prevented. This finding demonstrates just how important the research on the preventability of medication-related hospitalisations is. Further studies and implementations are still needed aiming to minimize the risk of medication-related harm.","Maříková, Martina; Očovská, Zuzana; Nerad, Vladimír; Kuběna, Aleš Antonín; Blaha, Vladimír; Vlček, Jiří",International journal of clinical pharmacy,616,17

The successes of mobility interventions demonstrate how policies can help limit the person-to-person interactions that are essential to infection. With significant community spread, experts predict this virus will continue to be a threat until safe and effective vaccines have been developed and widely deployed. We aim to understand mobility changes during the first major quarantine period in the United States, measured via mobile device tracking, by assessing how people changed their behavior in response to policies and to weather. Here, we show that consistent national messaging was associated with consistent national behavioral change, regardless of local policy. Furthermore, although human behavior did vary with outdoor air temperature, these variations were not associated with variations in a proxy for the rate of encounters between people. The independence of encounters and temperatures suggests that weather-related behavioral changes will, in many cases, be of limited relevance for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Both of these results are encouraging for the potential of clear national messaging to help contain any future pandemics, and possibly to help contain COVID-19.","Wu, Yihan; Mooring, Todd A; Linz, Marianna",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,616,1

The end result is an incision that can be strategically placed in the umbilicus for a perceived scarless abdomen. The authors rationalized that a randomized controlled trial was important given the rapid popularization of this approach. METHODS An institutional review board-approved prospective randomized trial compared patients undergoing SILS (SILS-A) and conventional laparoscopic (LAP-A) appendectomy at a free-standing children's hospital during a median follow-up period of 2.2 years. RESULTS A total of 50 patients (50 % boys and 67 % Hispanics) were randomized equally to SILS-A and LAP-A. The patients ranged in age from 3 to 15 years without a difference between the two groups. Half (50 %) of these patients were younger than 8 years. The technique for SILS-A involved a single supraumbilical curvilinear skin incision with three fascial incisions. Ports were inserted to varying depths to minimize restriction of instrument movement. Coaxial visualization was improved by the use of a 30° scope. To achieve technical comparability with the LAP-A, a stapler device was used, which required upsizing a 5 mm port to a 12 mm port. The mean duration of the operation was 46.8 ± 3.7 min (range, 22-120 min) compared with 34.8 ± 2.5 min (range, 18-77 min) for standard LAP-A (p = 0.010). No conversions occurred, and the two groups did not differ in hospital length of stay. The postoperative complications consisted of one wound seroma in the SILS-A group (nonsignificant difference), and no hernias were seen. No difference in readmissions, diet tolerance, fever, or postoperative pain was noted between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The findings show the SILS approach to be feasible in the pediatric population despite the limited abdominal domain in younger children. Although SILS operating room times currently are longer than for LAP-A, they are comparable, and no other outcomes differed appreciably between the two techniques at the time of hospitalization or during the follow-up period.","Perez, Eduardo A; Piper, Hannah; Burkhalter, Lorrie S; Fischer, Anne C",Surgical endoscopy,616,17

METHODS In this mixed methods study, semi-structured interviews were performed with parents whose infants were enrolled in an existing longitudinal cohort study of therapeutic hypothermia between 2011 and 2014. RESULTS Thematic saturation was achieved after 20 interviews. Parental experience of communicating with clinicians was characterized by 3 principle themes. Theme 1 highlighted that a fragmented communication process mirrored the chaotic maternal and neonatal course. Parents often received key information about neonatal encephalopathy and therapeutic hypothermia from maternal clinicians. Infant medical information was often given to 1 family member (60%), who felt burdened by the responsibility to relay that information to others. Families universally valued the role of the bedside nurse, who was perceived as the primary source of communication for most (75%) families. Theme 2 encompassed the challenges of discussing the complex therapy of therapeutic hypothermia: families appreciated clinicians who used lay language and provided written material, and they often felt overwhelmed by technical information that made it hard to understand the ""big picture"" of their infant's medical course. Theme 3 involved the uncertain prognosis after neonatal encephalopathy. Parents appreciated specific expectations about their infant's long-term development, and experienced long-term distress about prognostic uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS Communicating complex and large volumes of information in the midst of perinatal crisis presents inherent challenges for both clinicians and families. We identified an actionable set of communication challenges that can be addressed with targeted interventions.","Lemmon, Monica E; Donohue, Pamela K; Parkinson, Charlamaine; Northington, Frances J; Boss, Renee D",Pediatrics,616,30

Updated estimates of pneumonia that has been confirmed radiographically and with the use of current laboratory diagnostic tests are needed. METHODS We conducted active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization among children younger than 18 years of age in three hospitals in Memphis, Nashville, and Salt Lake City. We excluded children with recent hospitalization or severe immunosuppression. Blood and respiratory specimens were systematically collected for pathogen detection with the use of multiple methods. Chest radiographs were reviewed independently by study radiologists. RESULTS From January 2010 through June 2012, we enrolled 2638 of 3803 eligible children (69%), 2358 of whom (89%) had radiographic evidence of pneumonia. The median age of the children was 2 years (interquartile range, 1 to 6); 497 of 2358 children (21%) required intensive care, and 3 (<1%) died. Among 2222 children with radiographic evidence of pneumonia and with specimens available for bacterial and viral testing, a viral or bacterial pathogen was detected in 1802 (81%), one or more viruses in 1472 (66%), bacteria in 175 (8%), and both bacterial and viral pathogens in 155 (7%). The annual incidence of pneumonia was 15.7 cases per 10,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9 to 16.5), with the highest rate among children younger than 2 years of age (62.2 cases per 10,000 children; 95% CI, 57.6 to 67.1). Respiratory syncytial virus was more common among children younger than 5 years of age than among older children (37% vs. 8%), as were adenovirus (15% vs. 3%) and human metapneumovirus (15% vs. 8%).

However, the full bacterial communities that contaminate in-use stethoscopes have not been investigated. METHODS We used bacterial 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing, analysis, and quantification to profile entire bacterial populations on stethoscopes in use in an intensive care unit (ICU), including practitioner stethoscopes, individual-use patient-room stethoscopes, and clean unused individual-use stethoscopes. Two additional sets of practitioner stethoscopes were sampled before and after cleaning using standardized or practitioner-preferred methods. RESULTS Bacterial contamination levels were highest on practitioner stethoscopes, followed by patient-room stethoscopes, whereas clean stethoscopes were indistinguishable from background controls. Bacterial communities on stethoscopes were complex, and community analysis by weighted UniFrac showed that physician and patient-room stethoscopes were indistinguishable and significantly different from clean stethoscopes and background controls. Genera relevant to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were common on practitioner stethoscopes, among which Staphylococcus was ubiquitous and had the highest relative abundance (6.8%-14% of contaminating bacterial sequences). Other HAI-related genera were also widespread although lower in abundance. Cleaning of practitioner stethoscopes resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial contamination levels, but these levels reached those of clean stethoscopes in only a few cases with either standardized or practitioner-preferred methods, and bacterial community composition did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS Stethoscopes used in an ICU carry bacterial DNA reflecting complex microbial communities that include nosocomially important taxa. Commonly used cleaning practices reduce contamination but are only partially successful at modifying or eliminating these communities.","Knecht, Vincent R; McGinniss, John E; Shankar, Hari M; Clarke, Erik L; Kelly, Brendan J; Imai, Ize; Fitzgerald, Ayannah S; Bittinger, Kyle; Bushman, Frederic D; Collman, Ronald G",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,616,1

The objective of the study was to review the management of these children in Hong Kong over the past 2 decades. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Hospital records from subjects receiving mechanical ventilation for >3 months were retrieved. Demographic characteristics and medical information of subjects (≤21 y old) under the care of the ventilator program at the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital between 1997 and 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS There were a total of 96 subjects, with male predominance (75%). Twenty-five subjects (26%) required invasive mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy, and the median age of starting ventilation was much lower than for subjects receiving noninvasive ventilation (1.6 vs 11.2 y, P .003). Underlying causes included neuromuscular diseases (50%); abnormal ventilatory control related to neurological, metabolic, or genetic conditions (25%); airway problems (18%); and chronic lung diseases (6%). Comorbidities were frequent, with significantly more subjects receiving invasive mechanical ventilation who required gastrostomy or nasogastric tube feeding and had intellectual impairment. Despite their medical complexities, most of our subjects (87.5%) could be discharged and resided in the community. Social reasons were the obstacles for discharge in 12 subjects receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen subjects who died were receiving noninvasive ventilation, and most had progressive neuromuscular diseases. Only 8% subjects could be weaned off of ventilator support. At the time of the report, about one third of the subjects have reached adult age. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed a steady growth in the number of children receiving long-term mechanical ventilation, similar to that in western countries, yet these children have distinct demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, comorbidities, and outcomes. Home care is feasible in the majority of these children despite a lack of in-home nursing care provision. Prolonged survival of these subjects necessitates the enhancement of transitional care to adult service.","Chau, Shuk-Kuen; Yung, Ada Wing-Yan; Lee, So-Lun",Respiratory care,616,1

This study focuses on a research capacity strengthening project supporting seven test facilities in Africa conducting studies on mosquito vector control products towards Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) certification. It captures the primary effects of the project on each facility's research capacity, the secondary effects at the individual and institutional level, and the ripple effects that extend beyond the research system. The relationships between effects at different levels are identified and compared to an existing framework for the evaluation of research capacity strengthening initiatives. Methods: To capture the views of individuals engaged in the project at all levels within each facility, a maximum-variation purposive sampling strategy was used. This allowed triangulation between different data sources. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals in three facilities and a combination of email and remote video-call interviews were conducted with individuals at two further facilities. Results: We found that, despite a focus of the GLP certification project at the institutional level, the project had effects also at individual (including enhanced motivation, furtherment of careers) and national/international levels (including development of regional expertise). In addition, we detected ripple effects of the project which extended beyond the research system. Conclusion: This study shows that research capacity strengthening interventions that are focussed on institutional level goals require actions also at individual and national/international levels. The effects of engagement at all three levels can be amplified by collaborative actions at the national/international level. These findings show that research capacity strengthening projects must develop plans that address and evaluate impact at all three levels. Capturing the ripple effects of investment in research capacity strengthening should also be planned for from the beginning of projects to support further engagement of all stakeholders.","Begg, Sara; Wright, Alexandra; Small, Graham; Abdoulaye, Diabate; Kisinza, William; Koudou, Benjamin; Moore, Sarah; Mosha, Franklin; Edi, Constant; Kirby, Matthew; Kija, Patrick; Malima, Robert; Moore, Jason; Bates, Imelda",Gates open research,616,17

The goal of this study was to determine the safety of pDMEK grafts for 24 hours before surgery by analyzing endothelial cell loss (ECL) using 2 image analysis software programs. METHODS A total of 18 cadaveric corneas were prepared for DMEK using a standardized technique and loaded in a modified Jones tube injector. Nine of the corneas were injected into Calcein AM vital dye after 1 minute (controls), and the remaining 9 corneas were left preloaded for 24 hours before injection into vital dye for staining. The stained corneas were imaged using an inverted confocal microscope. ECL was then analyzed and quantified by 2 different graders using 2 image analysis software programs. RESULTS The control DMEK tissue resulted in 22.0% ± 4.0% ECL compared with pDMEK tissue, which resulted in 19.2% ± 7.2% ECL (P = 0.31). Interobserver agreement was 0.93 for MetaMorph and 0.92 for Fiji. The average time required to process images with MetaMorph was 2 ± 1 minutes and with Fiji was 20 ± 10 minutes. Intraobserver agreement was 0.97 for MetaMorph and 0.93 for Fiji. CONCLUSIONS Preloading DMEK tissue is safe and may provide an alternative technique for tissue distribution and surgery for DMEK. The use of MetaMorph software for quantifying ECL is a novel and accurate imaging method with increased efficiency and reproducibility compared with the previously validated Fiji.","Wolle, Meraf A; DeMill, David L; Johnson, Lauren; Lentz, Stephen I; Woodward, Maria A; Mian, Shahzad I",Cornea,616,31

One alarming concern during the pandemic is the rise of racism against Asians all over the world. However, little explored behind media reports are the legacies, tensions and challenges left by imperial domination inherited from the past, especially within the postcolonial regimes in Asia, such as Hong Kong and China. Drawing upon postcolonialism as a critical lens, this article makes perceptible the intractable issues of health politics. Postcolonial challenges shown by COVID-19 include immigration, changing politico-juridical definitions of identity, the legacy left by the Soviet era which poses an obstacle to modernising China's healthcare system, and the boom of birth tourism welcomed by the marketised turn of health and tourism policy in Hong Kong in the post-SARS era.

The age-related gene-expression changes of the Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene have been well-documented in humans and rodents. However, data is lacking from other relevant species, including dogs. Therefore, we quantified the CDKN2A mRNA abundance in dogs of different ages, in four tissue types: the frontal cortex of the brain, temporal muscle, skin, and blood. We found a significant, positive correlation between CDKN2A relative expression values and age in the brain, muscle, and blood; however, no correlation was detected in the skin. The strongest correlation was detected in the brain tissue (CDKN2A/GAPDH: r = 0.757, p < 0.001), similarly to human findings, while the muscle and blood showed weaker, but significant correlation. Our results suggest that CDKN2A might be a potential blood-borne biomarker of aging in dogs, although the validation and optimization will require further, more focused research. Our current results also clearly demonstrate that the role of CDKN2A in aging is conserved in dogs, regarding both tissue specificity and a pivotal role of CDKN2A in brain aging.","Sándor, Sára; Tátrai, Kitti; Czeibert, Kálmán; Egyed, Balázs; Kubinyi, Enikő",Frontiers in veterinary science,616,31

It responds to three main questions: Why did an unexpected case lead to the organization of a new sustainable policy? How was this achieved despite national competency over the given policy sector? How did the new policy succeed in covering the enlarged EU? The explanation combines political factors and public health issues. European integration and eastern enlargement made transborder disease management a political necessity. Treaties gave legitimacy to EU policy, while the AIDS matrix furnished the practical procedures: networking, data harmonization, peer-conducted policy coaching, and participation. This pattern of public health management is compatible with national competency, and it is consistent with the democratic values the EU promotes throughout and beyond the enlarged EU. From a theoretical point of view, these patterns of activities constitute the empirically grounded content of the much used but less defined concept of cognitive Europeanization.","Steffen, Monika","Journal of health politics, policy and law",616,24

METHODS Dixon images were acquired of 14 subjects and segmented in dielectric models with an eight-channel local transmit array positioned around the torso for cardiac imaging. EM simulations were done to calculate SAR distributions. Based on the SAR distributions, temperature simulations were performed for exposure times of 6 min and 30 min. Peak local SAR and temperature rise levels were calculated for different RF shim settings. A statistical analysis of the resulting peak local SAR and temperature rise levels was performed to arrive at safe power limits. RESULTS For RF shim vectors with random phase and uniformly distributed power, a safe average power limit of 35.7 W was determined (first level controlled mode). When RF amplitude and phase shimming was performed on the heart, a safe average power limit of 35.0 W was found. According to Pennes' model, our numerical study suggests a very low probability of exceeding the absolute local temperature limit of 40 °C for a total exposure time of 6 min and a peak local SAR of 20 W/kg. For a 30 min exposure time at 20 W/kg, it was shown that the absolute temperature limit can be exceeded in the case where perfusion does not change with temperature. CONCLUSION Safe power constraints were found for 7 T cardiac imaging with an eight-channel local transmit array, while considering the inter-subject variability of B1 + , SAR and temperature rise.","Steensma, Bart R; Meliadò, Ettore F; Luijten, Peter; Klomp, Dennis W J; van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Raaijmakers, Alexander J E",NMR in biomedicine,616,31

Immediately after the administration of rocuronium, pulse rate increased to 120 beats/min and blood pressure dropped to 77/36 mmHg. At the same time, generalized urticaria and tongue edema were observed. Epinephrine was administered and the surgery was postponed. Reoperation was planned two weeks after the event. Four days after the anaphylactic episode, rocuronium was confirmed to be the cause by the skin prick test.

Risk factor evaluation and prevention of this complication are important tasks for pancreatic surgeons. METHODS One hundred and six patients who underwent DP using a stapler for pancreatic division were retrospectively investigated. The relationship between clinicopathological factors and the incidence of POPF was statistically analyzed. RESULTS Clinically relevant, Grade B or C POPF by International Study Group of Pancreatic Fistula criteria occurred in 52 patients (49.1 %). Age, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, body mass index, and concomitant gastrointestinal tract resection did not influence the incidence of POPF. Use of a double-row stapler and a thick pancreatic stump were significant risk factors for POPF in multivariate analysis. Compression index was also shown to be an important factor in cases in which the pancreas was divided by a stapler. CONCLUSIONS The most important risk factor for POPF after DP was suggested to be the thickness of the pancreatic stump, reflecting the volume of remnant pancreas. A triple-row stapler seemed to be superior to a double-row stapler in preventing POPF. However, triple-row stapler use in a thick pancreas is considered to be a future problem to be solved.","Sugimoto, Motokazu; Gotohda, Naoto; Kato, Yuichiro; Takahashi, Shinichiro; Kinoshita, Takahiro; Shibasaki, Hidehito; Nomura, Shogo; Konishi, Masaru; Kaneko, Hironori",Journal of hepato-biliary-pancreatic sciences,616,16

This study aims to assess how oncological disease impacts on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 1st March to 30th April 2020, 96 COVID-19 patients were classified according to clinical outcome as severe (n=67) and moderate (n=29). Demographic data, medical history, admission lymphocytes, procalcitonin (PCT), c-reactive-protein (CRP), D-dimer, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were collected. RESULTS A statistically significant association was found between hypertension (p=0.007) and three or more comorbidities with severe outcomes (p=0.034). No statistical differences were found between the severe and moderate groups with regards to the rate of patients with past oncological history. However, no patient allocated in the moderate group had received oncological treatment within 12 months.

We characterized the mechanical properties and composition of thromboemboli from clinical cases and compared them with commonly used EAs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Thromboemboli were obtained from patients with AIS by using aspiration devices and from carotid atherosclerotic plaques harvested during endarterectomy. In the laboratory, common EAs were created by varying blood donor species (human, porcine, and bovine), thrombin concentration, and presence of barium sulfate. Stiffness and elasticity of the specimens were measured with DMA. Scanning electron microscopy and histology were used to investigate the ultrastructure and composition of all specimens. RESULTS Red thromboemboli from patients composed mainly of fibrin and erythrocytes were much softer than the calcified and cholesterol-rich material. Of the EAs created in the laboratory, those made from bovine blood presented the highest stiffness that was independent of thrombin concentration. Addition of thrombin increased the stiffness and elasticity of human and porcine EAs (P < .05). The presence of barium sulfate significantly reduced the elasticity of all EAs (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular device testing and development requires realistic EAs. The stiffness and elasticity of the cerebral thromboemboli analyzed in this study were closely matched by recalcified porcine EAs and thrombin-induced human EAs. Stiffness of the thrombus extracted from carotid endarterectomy specimens was similar with that of the thrombin-induced bovine and porcine EAs.","Chueh, J Y; Wakhloo, A K; Hendricks, G H; Silva, C F; Weaver, J P; Gounis, M J",AJNR.

However, the role of acute respiratory infections caused by respiratory viruses (RV) has not been clearly established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiology, clinical presentation and outcome of acute respiratory infections in children with FN. METHODS Patients, <18 years of age admitted to the Pediatric Oncology-Hematology Unit after developing FN between November 2010 and December 2013, were prospectively included in the study. Children were evaluated by clinical examination and laboratory tests. Nasopharyngeal sample was obtained for detection of RV. RESULTS There was a total of 112 episodes of FN in 73 children admitted to the hospital during a 32-month period. According to disease severity, 33% of the episodes were considered moderate or severe. Rhinovirus was the most frequently detected RV (66.6%; 24/36), followed by parainfluenza. On regard to clinical outcome, RV-infected children developed fewer episodes of moderate or severe FN compared with non-RV infected children (16.7% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS A great proportion of children with FN admitted to a tertiary hospital had a RV isolation. The rate of this RV isolation was significantly higher when a rapid molecular test was used compared with conventional microbiological methods. Rhinovirus was the most frequently isolated, although its role as an active agent of acute infection was not clear. Children with FN and a RV isolate had a lower rate of severe disease.","Cerdeira Barreiro, Natalia; Santiago-García, Begoña; Casas, Inmaculada; Pozo, Francisco; Santos Sebastián, Mar; Navarro, Marisa; Mata, Cristina; Garrido-Colino, Carmen; Catalán, Pilar; Hernández-Rupérez, Belén; Huerta, Jorge; Rincón-López, Elena; Beléndez, Cristina; García-Morín, Marina; Cela, Elena; Hernández-Sampelayo, Teresa; Saavedra-Lozano, Jesús",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,616,16

The objective of this study is to assess the status of the Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics to respond against COVID-19. METHODS A cross sectional study was conducted with the focal persons of COVID hospitals and COVID clinics using a semi-structured questionnaire from April 26, 2020 to May 27, 2020 via face to face interview with onsite observation and telephonic interview in few unreachable health facilities. Results: Government of Nepal designated COVID hospitals and COVID clinics demonstrated efforts in establishing preparedness plans and committees such as COVID management core team (96.7% and 86%), provision of coordination with the government authority (both 100% ), preparedness response plan (93.3% and 84%), and infection prevention and control committee (63.3% and 65.6%) to respond to COVID-19 respectively. The participants reported differences in training provided to their health care workers with maximum COVID hospitals (80%) providing training on use of personal protective equipment and least (43.3%) on handling dead bodies. Only half of the COVID clinics (49.5%) had provision of triage systems. CONCLUSIONS COVID hospitals and COVID clinics in Nepal demonstrated different status of COVID pandemic preparedness and readiness.

METHODS Publicly available data of PM2.5 concentrations from reference monitoring systems at sites across Scotland were extracted for the 31-day period immediately following the imposition of lockdown rules on 23 March 2020. Similar data for 2017, 2018 and 2019 were gathered for comparison. Mean period values were calculated from the hourly data and logged values compared using pairwise t-tests. Weather effects were corrected using meteorological normalisation. RESULTS NO2 concentrations were significantly lower in the 2020 lockdown period than in the previous 3 years (p<0.001). Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 were much lower than during the same period in 2019 (p<0.001). However, despite UK motor vehicle journeys reducing by 65%, concentrations in 2020 were within 1 µg/m3 of those measured in 2017 (p=0.66) and 2018 (p<0.001), suggesting that traffic-related emissions may not explain variability of PM2.5 in outdoor air in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS The impact of reductions in motor vehicle journeys during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions may not have reduced ambient PM2.5 concentrations in some countries. There is also a need for work to better understand how movement restrictions may have impacted personal exposure to air pollutants generated within indoor environments.","Dobson, Ruaraidh; Semple, Sean",Occupational and environmental medicine,616,27

METHODS We examine CSCs in 35 states and code how they approach disability, comparing states that have revised their plans to those that have not. We offer ethical and legal analyses evaluating to what extent changes to state policy aligned with disability rights law and ethics during the early pandemic and subsequently, as stakeholder engagement grew. FINDINGS While disability rights views were not well represented in CSCs that were not updated or updated early in the pandemic, states that revised their plans later in the pandemic were more aligned with advocate priorities. However, many CSCs continue to include concerning provisions, especially the reliance on long-term survival, which implicates considerations of both disability rights and racial justice. CONCLUSIONS The disability rights movement's successes in influencing state triage policy should inform future CSCs and set the stage for further work on how stakeholders influence bioethics policy debates. We offer thoughts for examining bioethics policymaking reflecting the processes by which activists seek policy change and the tension policymakers face between expert delegation and mediating values conflicts.","Ne'eman, Ari; Ashley Stein, Michael; Berger, Zackary D; Dorfman, Doron","Journal of health politics, policy and law",616,5

OBJECTIVE To explore the sex disparity in COVID-19 cases and outcomes using New York City (NYC) population level data. SETTING NYC surveillance data from February 29 to June 12, 2020. PARTICIPANTS Individuals tested for COVID-19 in metropolitan NYC.Outcome Measurements and Statistical Analysis: Outcomes of interest included rates of COVID-19 case positivity, hospitalization and death. Relative risks and case fatality rates were computed for all outcomes based on sex and were stratified by age groups. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS 911,310 individuals were included, of whom 434,273 (47.65%) were male and 477,037 (52.35%) were female. Men represented the majority of positive cases (n=106,275, 51.36%), a majority of hospitalizations (n=29,847, 56.44%), and a majority of deaths (n=13,054, 59.23%). Following population level adjustments for age and sex, testing rates of men and women were equivalent. The majority of positive cases and hospitalizations occurred in men for all age groups except age >75 years, and death was more likely in men of all age groups. Men were at a statistically significant greater relative risk of case positivity, hospitalization, and death across all age groups except those <18 years of age. The most significant difference for case positivity was observed in the 65–74 age group (RR 1.22, 95%CI 1.19–1.24), for hospitalization in the 45–65 age group (RR 1.85, 95% 1.80–1.90), and for death in the 18–44 age group (RR 3.30, 95% CI 2.82–3.87). Case fatality rates were greater for men in all age-matched comparisons to women. Limitations include the use of an evolving surveillance data set and absence of further demographic characteristics such as ethnographic data. CONCLUSION Men have higher rates of COVID-19 positivity, hospitalization, and death despite greater testing of women; this trend remains after stratification by age.

After a 4-h preincubation with cathepsin L, this compound became even more potent, demonstrating an IC(50) of 1.0 nM. The thiocarbazate was determined to be a slow-binding and slowly reversible competitive inhibitor. Through a transient kinetic analysis for single-step reversibility, inhibition rate constants were k(on) = 24,000 M(-1)s(-1) and k(off) = 2.2 x 10(-5) s(-1) (K(i) = 0.89 nM). Molecular docking studies were undertaken using the experimentally derived X-ray crystal structure of papain/CLIK-148 (1cvz. pdb). These studies revealed critical hydrogen bonding patterns of the thiocarbazate with key active site residues in papain. The thiocarbazate displayed 7- to 151-fold greater selectivity toward cathepsin L than papain and cathepsins B, K, V, and S with no activity against cathepsin G. The inhibitor demonstrated a lack of toxicity in human aortic endothelial cells and zebrafish.

METHODS This retrospective study included 157 diarrhea cases form 564 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Wuhan Union Hospital from January 20 to February 29, 2020. Clinical characteristics, the course and the outcome of patients with diarrhea were analyzed. The correlation between diarrhea and fecal presence of coronavirus was also determined. RESULTS The overall morbidity of diarrhea was 27.8% (157/564) in COVID-19 patients. Among them, 38 cases presented only with diarrhea, and 119 cases in both diarrhea and respiratory symptoms. Patients with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms had higher levels of inflammatory activity, longer hospital stay (27.5 vs. 23.0 vs. 22.0 days, p = .029) and higher odds ratio of mortality (3.2 times and 2.2 times, respectively) than those with diarrhea only or respiratory symptoms only. However, patients with diarrhea had longer time from onset to admission (14.5 days vs. 11.0 days, p = .04), higher positive viral RNA in stool (80.0% vs. 52.4%, p = .016) than those with both diarrhea and respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Diarrhea caused by high enteric viral burden may lead to long course and poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. The patients with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms were prone to serious condition, and had worse outcomes. However, the patients with diarrhea alone showed mild illness but delayed health-seeking.","Shang, Haitao; Bai, Tao; Chen, Yuhua; Huang, Chao; Zhang, Shengyan; Yang, Pengcheng; Zhang, Lei; Hou, Xiaohua",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,616,28

OBJECTIVES This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of an adapted MBCT program for AYA, aged 16-29, with IBD. METHODS Sixty-four AYAs were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 31). Primary outcome measure was the depression score on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, stress, IBD-related quality of life, coping, mindfulness, post-traumatic growth, medication adherence, IBD activity, inflammatory markers, microbiome characteristics and brain functional connectivity. RESULTS Study recruitment rate was 75%, retention rate 70%, and session attendance 92%. Intention to treat analyses revealed that, compared to TAU group, MBCT group had significantly lower depression (∆ = -6.0; 95%CI = -10.8 to -1.2; P = 0.015) and stress (∆ = -5.1; 95%CI = -10.1 to -0.0; P = 0.049), higher active coping (∆ = 1.0;95%CI = 0.1-1.9; P = 0.022), and total mindfulness scores (∆ = 10.9;95%CI = 1.1-20.8; P = 0.030) at 8 weeks (post-therapy), and improved coping by positive reframing (∆ = 1.1;95%CI = 0.0-2.2; P = 0.043) and planning (∆ = 0.9;95%CI = 0.0-1.9; P = 0.045), mindful awareness (∆ = 5.2.;95%CI = 2.0-8.5; P = 0.002) and total mindfulness scores (∆ = 10.8.;95%CI = 0.4-21.1; P = 0.042) at 20 weeks. On per protocol analysis, MBCT group had significantly lower depression (∆ = -6.3; 95%CI = -11.4 to -1.2; P = 0.015), stress (∆ = -6.0; 95%CI = -11.2 to -0.5; P = 0.032), increased active coping (∆ = 0.9;95%CI = 0-1.7; P = 0.05) at 8 weeks, and mindful awareness (∆ = 5.4; 95%CI = 2.1-8.6; P = 0.001) at 20 weeks.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate clinical outcomes with and without the interpositional placement of a porcine dermal collagen graft (PDCG) for prevention of syndrome occurrence. METHODS We conducted a 20-year retrospective study including the patients who had undergone ""formal"" (superficial, total, or subtotal) parotidectomies for benign pathologies. The inclusion criteria also involved patients that were (i) regularly monitored about clinical symptoms related to syndrome, and (ii) examined with Minor starch-iodine test. The severity of the diagnosed syndrome was retrospectively evaluated according to the grading score system of Luna-Ortiz. To assess group differences in terms of the extent of dissection in operating sites, we estimated the tumor and histological specimen volumes using the available dimensions. RESULTS We included 73 patients who had undergone 76 formal parotid surgeries. The surgical sites were divided into 2 groups: (1) Group A consisted of 44 sites that were reconstructed with a SMAS flap, and (2) Group B, comprised 32 sites where a PDCG was additionally applied as an artificial preventive barrier. At a mean follow-up of 26.3 months, a significantly lower incidence of clinically diagnosed Frey's syndrome was found after the use of dermal collagen interpositional barrier (P = .031). Specifically, subjective symptoms were reported at an incidence of 31.8% in Group A and 6.7% in Group B. Minor's test was positive at an incidence of 59.09% in Group A and 21.87% in Group B (P = .004, 95% CI). Severe Frey's syndrome was observed in 31.82% of the patients of Group A and in 3.12% of the patients of Group B (P = .002, 95% CI). Since there were no statistical significant differences between the volumes of the removed tumors and the excised histological specimens, the extent of dissection was not proved to influence the occurrence of Frey's syndrome in the compared groups. CONCLUSION Porcine dermal collagen is a safe, practical, and useful means for parotid reconstruction, since it seems to contribute in prevention of Frey's syndrome when increased amount of glandular tissue has to be removed. Additional randomized controlled studies with bigger samples are required to better assess the PDCG use in parotid surgery.","Vahtsevanos, Kostas; Chatziavramidis, Angelos; Papadiochos, Ioannis Yiannis; Koloutsos, Georgios; Stefanidis, Anastasios; Kitikidou, Kyriaki; Ntomouchtsis, Aris; Patrikidou, Anna","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",616,31

This review describes these epidemics and other causes of epidemic viral pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS The recent literature highlights the rapidity with which these emerging viral infections can be characterized and how management strategies, including supportive care, antiviral therapy and infection control precautions, can be rapidly shared and implemented. SUMMARY The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was too short to allow management protocols to be tested in a research environment. The current 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic is fortunately not associated with as high a mortality rate as the avian influenza A (H5N1), another potential pandemic candidate virus. Prior pandemic planning as well as research planning has allowed a rapid response to this outbreak, with a significant amount of literature generated in a few months. Other common seasonal viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza, as well as previously poorly recognized viruses such as hantavirus, have the ability to cause significant respiratory morbidity and mortality.","Lapinsky, Stephen E",Current opinion in infectious diseases,616,24

Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures.

During several essential steps of the membrane processing, an intensive employment of ZrO2 milling balls is usually inevitable. However, how these milling balls affect the final LWO-Mo membranes, is still largely unknown. Employing comprehensive transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, the residual Zr was found to segregate to the grain boundaries (GBs) of the LWO-Mo, either as thin layers or as individual nanograins. At atomic scale, structural and chemical analyses on these GB features were carried out quantitatively. The segregated Zr took more than half of the W sites of the LWO-Mo, resulting in a strained LWO structure and locally concentrated oxygen vacancies. To minimize any Zr contamination, either a competent alternative for ZrO2 or a careful introduction of certain secondary phases (SPs) was proposed. Our results unravel the processing-induced GB behaviors in LWO-Mo, which pave the way towards further optimized processing for various types of functional membranes.","Ran, Ke; Deibert, Wendelin; Ivanova, Mariya E; Meulenberg, Wilhelm A; Mayer, Joachim",Nanoscale,616,31

METHODS Coronary computed tomography angiography using SDCT was performed on 42 patients with coronary artery calcifications. Stenosis grading by diameter and area of calcified plaques and free lumen using VMI from 70 to 140 keV was performed and compared with measurements by conventional images. In addition, interobserver reliability and subjective image quality were assessed by 2 experienced readers. RESULTS A total of 61 coronary arteries were evaluated. Stenosis grading by diameter and area showed significant incremental decrease, from 48.86% to 22.82% and from 41.18% to 11.33%, respectively, with increasing VMI (P < 0.05). Interobserver reliability was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.99). Overall image quality was best at 80 keV. CONCLUSIONS Calcium blooming significantly decreases at higher monoenergetic levels from SDCT, increasing luminal dimensions and decreasing stenotic grading, with best overall subjective image quality using 80-keV VMI.","Van Hedent, Steven; Große Hokamp, Nils; Kessner, Rivka; Gilkeson, Robert; Ros, Pablo R; Gupta, Amit",Journal of computer assisted tomography,616,1

There are several diagnostic methods used to identify NDMs, however, repeated laboratory isolation at different time points is recommended to validate pathogenicity. With NDM and mixed infection (dermatophytes plus NDM) onychomycosis on the rise, accurate clinical diagnosis along with mycological tests are recommended. Systemic antifungal agents such as itraconazole and terbinafine (e.g. pulse regimen: 1 pulse = every day for one week, followed by no treatment for three weeks) have shown efficacy in treating onychomycosis caused by various NDM pathogens such as Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, and Onychocola canadensis. Studies investigating topical therapy and devices for NDM onychomycosis treatment are limited. The emergence of antifungal resistance necessitates the incorporation of antifungal susceptibility testing into diagnosis, when possible, for the management of recalcitrant infections. Case studies documented in the literature show newer azoles such as posaconazole and voriconazole as sometimes effective in treating resistant NDM onychomycosis following determination of their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Treatment with broad-spectrum antifungal agents (e.g. itraconazole and efinaconazole) and other combination therapy (oral+oral and/or oral+topical) may be considerations in the management of NDM onychomycosis.","Gupta, A K; Summerbell, R C; Venkataraman, M; Quinlan, E M",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,616,5

Many advances have already been made, but there is still a long way to go to solve the molecular mechanisms related to the process of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as the particularities of the disease, its course and the complex host-pathogen relationships. However, a lot has been theorized and associated with COVID-19, like the worst prognosis of the disease among individuals with some comorbidities, like diabetes mellitus. In this perspective, diabetic patients are repeatedly associated with more severe cases of COVID-19 when compared to non-diabetic patients. Even though ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) was recognized as the host cell receptor for both binding and entering of SARS-CoV-2 particles, it was also pointed out that this enzyme plays an important protective role against pulmonary damage. Therefore, paradoxically as it may seem, the low baseline level of this receptor in people with diabetes is directly linked to a more expressive loss of ACE2 protective effect, which could be one of the possible factors for the worst prognosis of COVID-19. Still, COVID-19 may also have a diabetogenic effect. From this point of view, the main topics that will be highlighted are (i) the mechanism of the viral entry, with special attention to the cellular receptor (ACE2) and the viral binding protein (spike), (ii) the relationship among the renin-angiotensin system, the infection process and the patients' prognosis, (iii) the glucose control and the medicines used in this event, and (iv) a brief analysis on diabetes triggered by COVID-19.","da Silva, Pedro Henrique Abreu; Garcia, Andressa Santos; Alves, Fábio Aguiar; Dos Santos, André Luis Souza; Sodré, Cátia Lacerda",Current topics in medicinal chemistry,616,16

This image analysis produced two coefficients that represent the fraction of co-localizing objects in each component of a dual-channel image. The generation of test objects with a Gaussian intensity distribution, at well-defined positions in both components of dual-channel images, allowed an accurate investigation of the reliability of the procedure. To do that, the co-localization coefficients were determined before degrading the image with background, cross-talk and Poisson noise. These synthesized sources of image deterioration represent sources of deterioration that must be dealt with in practical confocal imaging, namely dark current, non-specific binding and cross-reactivity of fluorescent probes, optical cross-talk and photon noise. The degraded images were restored by filtering and cross-talk correction. The co-localization coefficients of the restored images were not significantly different from those of the original undegraded images. Finally, we tested the procedure on images of real biological specimens. The results of these tests correspond with data found in the literature. We conclude that the co-localization coefficients can provide relevant quantitative information about the positional relation between biological objects or processes.","Manders, E M M; Verbeek, F J; Aten, J A",Journal of microscopy,616,15

Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressings have been suggested to reduce SSIs. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to assess the effects of incisional NPWT on the incidence of SSI in closed groin incisions after arterial surgery. METHODS A study protocol for this systematic review of RCTs was published in Prospero (CRD42018090298) a priori, with predefined search, inclusion and exclusion criteria. The records generated by the systematic research were screened for relevance by title and abstract and in full text by two of the authors independently. The selected articles were rated for bias according to the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. RESULTS Among 1567 records generated by the search, seven RCTs were identified, including 1049 incisions. Meta-analysis showed a reduction in SSI with incisional NPWT (odds ratio (OR) 0·35, 95 per cent c.i. 0·24 to 0·50; P < 0·001). The heterogeneity between the included studies was low (I2 = 0 per cent). The quality of evidence was graded as moderate. Two studies had multiple domains in the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool rated as high risk of bias. A subgroup meta-analysis of three studies of lower limb revascularization procedures only (363 incisions) demonstrated a similar reduction in SSI (OR 0·37, 0·22 to 0·63; P < 0·001; I2 = 0 per cent). CONCLUSION Incisional NPWT after groin incisions for arterial surgery reduced the incidence of SSI compared with standard wound dressings. The risk of bias highlighted the need for a high-quality RCT with cost-effectiveness analysis.","Svensson-Björk, R; Zarrouk, M; Asciutto, G; Hasselmann, J; Acosta, S",The British journal of surgery,616,1

METHODS Retrospective data on PED visits at British Columbia Children's Hospital were collected between December 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020, and for 2 previous years. An interrupted time-series analysis was performed to estimate the difference in daily visits after stay-at-home orders on March 17, 2020, as well as before and after. Further analysis was performed to estimate the drop and recovery of admission and visits by age and acuity. RESULTS After adjustment for year and seasonality, we documented a drop in the expected number of daily visits of 83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 78-89) after stay-at-home orders. Thereafter, daily visits increased by 12.9 (95% CI, 11.3-14.4) every month. Probability of admission adjusted for seasonality and acuity increased 6.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-9.0%) after stay-at-home orders and decreased in the odds of -0.7% (95% CI, -1% to -0.4%) monthly thereafter. CONCLUSIONS The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has had a dramatic and lasting impact on the number of PED visits, with contracted rates 6 months into the pandemic. Further increase in acuity-adjusted rate of admissions after stay at home orders suggests that individuals may be delaying arrival to the emergency department.

Although technology offers many benefits including increasing access to care, the advantages of such tools are restricted by their implementation into the program. The goal of this study is to better understand the current usage of technology, clinical needs, and digital literacy in Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs. METHODS An online survey of CSC staff and clinicians assessed their attitudes, preparedness, and comfort with technology implementation into care. RESULTS In total, 42 programs from 30 states responded to the web-based survey. Of the six key roles of CSC, the role believed to be most capable for technology to augment was Family Education and Support by 90% (38/42) of participants. Eighty-two per cent (34/42) of clinicians and staff felt that they would benefit from and have interest in receiving digital skills training (41% [17/42] strongly agree, 41% [17/42] agreed). Evaluation of respondent sentiments towards technology revealed that 70 per cent (29/42) (""agree"", or ""strongly agree"") believe that technology can integrate into care easily. CONCLUSIONS Survey responses show overall positive sentiments towards technology implementation in early psychosis care. Findings also reveal that the digital tool would be better sustained if CSC staff and clinicians received digital skills education. This survey demonstrates that technology can augment early psychosis care while improving quality of care and expanding access to care.","Camacho, Erica; Torous, John",Early intervention in psychiatry,616,1

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES Studies reporting sex-based differences in the incidence of second ACL injury in athletes attempting to return-to-sports and who were followed for at least 1 year following primary ACL reconstruction. RESULTS Nineteen studies were included in this review, with seven studies excluded from the primary meta-analysis due to high risk of bias. The remaining 12 studies (n=1431 females, n=1513 males) underwent meta-analysis, with all 19 studies included in a sensitivity analysis. Total second ACL injury risk was 21.9% (females: 22.8%, males: 20.3%). Females were found to have 10.7% risk of an ipsilateral ACL injury and 11.8% risk of a contralateral ACL injury. Males were found to have 12.0% risk of an ipsilateral ACL injury and 8.7% risk of a contralateral ACL injury. No statistically significant differences were observed for total second ACL injury risk (risk difference=-0.6%, 95% CI -4.9 to 3.7, p=0.783, I2=41%) or contralateral ACL injury risk (risk difference=1.9%, 95% CI -0.5% to 4.4%, p=0.113, I2=15%) between sexes.

So far, the absence of a vaccine against the new coronavirus has led people worldwide to seek various therapeutic alternatives, including use of cholecalciferol. DESIGN AND SETTING Narrative review developed by a research group at a public university in Recife (PE), Brazil. METHODS We searched the literature on the use of cholecalciferol for prevention or treatment of COVID-19, using the MEDLINE and LILACS databases, with the keywords ""vitamin D"", ""cholecalciferol"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus"", from January 1, 2020, to June 10, 2020. Narrative reviews, cohort studies and ecological studies were selected. RESULTS We retrieved 32 references, of which 8 were considered eligible for intensive review and critical analysis. These comprised five narrative reviews, two observational studies and one protocol proposal. Most of the studies selected reported positive effects from use of vitamin D for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. However, there was little quantitative data to assess the real impact of using this vitamin as an intervention against this disease. CONCLUSIONS Current studies on vitamin D used for purposes other than bone health promotion cannot be taken as support to justify its use in a disease as recent as COVID-19. Studies of greater robustness, with higher levels of clinical evidence, need to be conducted. Rational use of this vitamin needs to be ensured, thereby minimizing the impacts on the patient and the public healthcare system.","Chagas, Stephanye Carolyne Christino; Moreira, Francisca Sueli Monte; Barbosa, Irla Carla França; Leal Júnior, Osvaldo de Sousa; Leal, Leila Bastos; Santana, Davi Pereira de",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,616,1

American adults (N = 822) were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic using Amazon mTURK and structural equation modeling was used to examine how trait hope predicted outcomes approximately one month later. Higher hope was associated with greater well-being and perceived emotional control, as well as lower levels of anxiety and COVID-19 perceived stress. Results also indicated an indirect effect of hope with all outcomes via perceived emotional control.

Along their evolutionary history, they adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: (a) 30 Kg/cm2; (b) 80 Kg/cm2; (c) 150 Kg/cm2, or (d) 200 Kg/cm2 They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 Kg/cm2 (close to 200 atm), equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions. We discuss these extreme performances as related to the morphological characteristics and physiological responses to diving in these insects.","Leonardi, Maria Soledad; Crespo, José E; Soto, Florencia A; Vera, Ricardo B; Rua, Julio C; Lazzari, Claudio R",The Journal of experimental biology,616,16

METHODS The present study was a single-institution retrospective study. Of the 173 obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing gastric bypass surgery between January 2000 and July 2004, 78 patients (45%) were followed for at least 10 years. The control group consisted of 80 diabetic obese patients from the same period with similar body mass index, age, race, and severity of diabetes. The median follow-up was 11 years for both the groups. RESULTS The group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had greater percentage of excess weight loss than the control group-66% versus -1.6%, respectively. Forty-one patients (52.6%) in the surgery group had complete remission of diabetes and 5 (6.4%) had partial remission. Twelve patients (15.4%) had diabetes recurrence after initial remission. No patient in the control group had remission of diabetes. Compared with the control group, the group undergoing gastric bypass surgery had a significantly reduced incidence of microvascular complications-46.3% versus 11.5%, and macrovascular complications-20.3% versus 5%, respectively (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that after 10 years of follow-up, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery, compared with nonsurgical medical management, resulted in significantly greater weight loss, reduction in hemoglobin A1c, and use of antidiabetic medications, and very importantly a lower incidence of both microvascular and macrovascular complications in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.","Chen, Yijun; Corsino, Leonor; Shantavasinkul, Prapimporn Chattranukulchai; Grant, John; Portenier, Dana; Ding, Laura; Torquati, Alfonso",Annals of surgery,616,5

Currently, targeted therapies are not a primary standard of care in CC. This information could be crucial for developing directed therapies and patient screening for biomarkers that would allow personalised treatment of CC. This systematic review aimed to estimate the prevalence of potential therapeutic targets such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MAPK pathways in patients with CC, identified through genomic and non-genomic testing. Studies were identified through an ad-hoc search strategy from the available on MEDLINE (Ovid), CENTRAL, LILACS, SCOPUS, through the Clinical Trial registry on Clinicaltrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, RENIS (Argentine National Registry of Health Research) and grey literature sources. We included 74 studies which represented a total pool of 7,862 participants. Forty-five studies informed mutations of EGFR, with a combined positivity rate of 53% (95%CI: 45%-60%; I2 = 95%). Twenty studies informed the presence of mutations in PIK3CA with a combined positivity rate of 30% (95%CI: 21%-39%; I2 = 96%). Twenty-three studies reported a mutation in Ras, with a combined positivity rate of 14% (95%CI: 8%-21%; I2 = 95%). Raf mutations were informed in six studies. Six studies informed the presence of Akt mutations, two studies informed mTOR mutations and only one study reported mutations of MAPK. The most frequently described therapeutic targets were EGFR, and the PIK3CA and Ras pathways, though inconsistency in positivity rates was significant. Our study did not allow the identification of any specific clinical characteristics that might explain the observed heterogeneity. Despite the overall good quality of the included studies, the applicability of these results to patients' general population with CC is still unclear.","Patrono, Maria Guadalupe; Calvo, Maria Florencia; Franco, Juan Victor Ariel; Garrote, Virginia; Vietto, Valeria",Ecancermedicalscience,616,28

While correlative studies of human ccRCC and functional studies using human ccRCC cell lines have implicated HIF-1α as an inhibitor and HIF-2α as a promoter of aggressive tumour behaviours, their roles in tumour onset have not been functionally addressed. Herein we show using an autochthonous ccRCC model that Hif1a is essential for tumour formation whereas Hif2a deletion has only minor effects on tumour initiation and growth. Both HIF-1α and HIF-2α are required for the clear cell phenotype. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that HIF-1α regulates glycolysis while HIF-2α regulates genes associated with lipoprotein metabolism, ribosome biogenesis and E2F and MYC transcriptional activities. HIF-2α-deficient tumours are characterised by increased antigen presentation, interferon signalling and CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Single copy loss of HIF1A or high levels of HIF2A mRNA expression correlate with altered immune microenvironments in human ccRCC. These studies reveal an oncogenic role of HIF-1α in ccRCC initiation and suggest that alterations in the balance of HIF-1α and HIF-2α activities can affect different aspects of ccRCC biology and disease aggressiveness.","Hoefflin, Rouven; Harlander, Sabine; Schäfer, Silvia; Metzger, Patrick; Kuo, Fengshen; Schönenberger, Désirée; Adlesic, Mojca; Peighambari, Asin; Seidel, Philipp; Chen, Chia-Yi; Consenza-Contreras, Miguel; Jud, Andreas; Lahrmann, Bernd; Grabe, Niels; Heide, Danijela; Uhl, Franziska M; Chan, Timothy A; Duyster, Justus; Zeiser, Robert; Schell, Christoph; Heikenwalder, Mathias; Schilling, Oliver; Hakimi, A Ari; Boerries, Melanie; Frew, Ian J",Nature communications,616,24

During the state of emergency, the frequency of intake of vegetables, beans, seaweeds, fish, meats, dairy products, and snacks increased, whereas alcohol intake decreased. Working from home was associated with increased intake of vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and snacks but decreased intake of seaweeds, meats, and alcohol. Time spent on childcare was associated with decreased intake of vegetables and fruits but increased intake of meats. Probable depressive symptoms were negatively associated with the frequency of food intake other than snacks and alcohol.

Set up in 2008, MUII aims to produce internationally competitive Ugandan and East African I&I research leaders, and develop human and infrastructural resources to support research and training excellence. We undertook an internal evaluation of MUII's achievements, challenges and lessons learned between August 2008 and December 2019, to inform programmes seeking to build Africa's health research expertise. Methods: Quantitative data were abstracted from programme annual reports. Qualitative data were obtained in March and April 2019: a cross-sectional evaluation was undertaken among a purposefully selected representative sample of 27 trainees and two programme staff. Qualitative data was analysed according to pre-determined themes of achievements, challenges, lessons learned and recommendations for improvement. Results: By December 2019, MUII had supported 68 fellowships at master's-level and above (50% female: 23 Masters, 27 PhD, 15 post-doctoral, three group-leader fellows) and over 1,000 internships. Fellows reported career advancement, mentorship by experts, and improved research skills and outputs. Fellows have published over 300 papers, secured grants worth over £20m, established over 40 international collaborations, and taken on research and academic leadership positions in the country. Key lessons for success include the following: efficient administration provides an enabling environment; institutions need supportive policies for procurement, including provisions for purchases of specific biological research reagents from international manufacturers; strong international, multi-disciplinary collaboration provides a critical mass of expertise to mentor researchers in development; and mentorship catalyses young scientists to progress from graduate trainees to productive academic researchers, relevant to society's most pressing health challenges.

This study aimed to identify perceived barriers to utilization of ANC services in a rural post-conflict area in northern Uganda. METHODS A qualitative study using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions of seventeen participants (pregnant women, health workers and a traditional birth attendant). The study was informed through a phenomenological approach to capture perceived barriers to utilization of ANC. The study was carried out in post-conflict Awach sub-county, Gulu District, northern Uganda. Data was analyzed using inductive conventional content analysis. RESULTS The main perceived barriers to ANC utilization were identified as: poor quality of care, including poor attitude of health workers; socio-cultural practices not being successfully aligned to ANC; and lack of support from the husband, including difficulties in encouraging him to attend ANC. Additionally, institutional structures and procedures at the health centers in terms of compulsory HIV testing and material requirements and transportation were perceived to prevent some pregnant women from attending ANC. CONCLUSIONS Identifying local barriers to ANC utilization are important and should be considered when planning ANC programs. We propose that future efforts should focus on how to ensure a good patient-provider relationship and perceived quality of care, and further how to improve inter-spousal communication and sensitization of husbands for increased involvement in ANC. We recommend more research on how socio-cultural context can meaningfully be aligned to ANC to improve maternal health and reduce maternal mortality.","Uldbjerg, Cecilie Skaarup; Schramm, Stine; Kaducu, Felix Ocaka; Ovuga, Emilio; Sodemann, Morten",Sexual & reproductive healthcare : official journal of the Swedish Association of Midwives,616,31

We herein report a novel hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic technique for patients with FAP and UC. METHODS Between February 2010 and March 2014, six patients underwent hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic total proctocolectomy with IPAA. The abdominal colectomy was performed laparoscopically with hand assistance through a transverse suprapubic incision, also used to fashion the ileal pouch. The proctectomy was carried out with the da Vinci Surgical System. The IPAA was hand-sewn through a trans-anal approach. The procedure was complemented by a temporary diverting loop ileostomy. RESULTS The mean hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) time was 154.6 (±12.8) min whereas the mean robotic time was 93.6 (±8.1) min. In all cases, a nerve-sparing proctectomy was performed, and no conversion to traditional laparotomy was required. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 13.2 (±7.4) days. No anastomotic leakage was observed. To date, no autonomic neurological disorders have been observed with a mean of 5.8 (±1.3) bowel movements per day. CONCLUSIONS The hand-assisted hybrid laparoscopic-robotic approach to total proctocolectomy with IPAA has not been previously described. Our report shows the feasibility of this hybrid approach, which surpasses most of the limitations of pure laparoscopic and robotic techniques.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of saliva swab specimens for the diagnosis of influenza compared with NP specimens. Influenza virus detection rate in saliva and NP swabs was compared in adult patients admitted to an emergency department from January to March 2020, using the Xpert Xpress Flu/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test. Cycle threshold (CT) values were evaluated in all the cases. Among the 82 patients recruited, 19 had an influenza-positive diagnostic test result (11 influenza A and 8 influenza B). Overall, the agreement between saliva and NP swabs results was 97.6% (80/82; κ = 0.929; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.832 to 1.0). There was no significant difference in the influenza detection rate between saliva swab and NP specimens (20.7% [17/82] versus 23.2% [19/82]; P = 0.5). There were only two discordant results (influenza B in an NP and false negative in a saliva sample). Manual inspection of the amplification curves showed that influenza RNA had been amplified in saliva with high CTs (CT of 40) that the test reported as a negative result. The overall sensitivity and specificity for saliva was 89.5% (73.0% to 100%) and 100% (99.2% to 100%), respectively. In all the cases, the same influenza virus (A/B) was detected. Median CT values were significantly lower in NP (31; interquartile range [IQR], 21.0 to 32.0) than in saliva (33; IQR, 23.0 to 38.0) (P = 0.001) specimens. Saliva swabs have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza virus by the Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test and a high overall agreement and CT correlation with NP specimens. Saliva swab is a feasible specimen type for influenza testing that might be easily self-collected with minimal equipment and discomfort. IMPORTANCE Early detection of influenza virus is important for guiding antiviral and antibacterial treatment for infection control and public health measures. We have observed that saliva swab specimens have high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of influenza by the Xpert Xpress Flu/respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) test and high overall agreement and CT correlation with nasopharyngeal specimens. Saliva swab may therefore be a feasible specimen type for influenza testing that can be easily self-collected with minimal equipment and discomfort.","Galar, Alicia; Catalán, Pilar; Vesperinas, Lara; Miguens, Iria; Muñoz, Ioana; García-Espona, Alejandro; Sevillano, José Antonio; Andueza, Juan Antonio; Bouza, Emilio; Muñoz, Patricia",Microbiology spectrum,616,5

RESULTS Twenty-nine patients (18.8%) had experienced COVID-19-related treatment changes, and changes of the treatment plan had a significant correlation with depression (t = 2.000, P = .047). Fear of cancer recurrence was high (mean score, 84.31 ± 24.23). Fifteen percent had moderate to severe levels of anxiety, and 24.7% had moderate to severe levels of depression.

CONCLUSION In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, breast cancer patients experienced treatment changes, and changes in treatment plans were significantly associated with depression. Fear of recurrence, anxiety, and depression were found at high levels. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Oncology nurses should assess the psychological status of cancer patients in the early survivorship phase who appear to be especially vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oncology nurses can also monitor whether patients are receiving timely supportive care to alleviate fears and anxiety and assess financial needs for COVID-19-related costs.","Kim, Soo Yeon; Kim, Sue",Cancer nursing,616,27

As public health officials seek to contain the virus and mitigate the deleterious effects on worldwide population health, a related threat has emerged: global media exposure to the crisis. We review research suggesting that repeated media exposure to community crisis can lead to increased anxiety, heightened stress responses that can lead to downstream effects on health, and misplaced health-protective and help-seeking behaviors that can overburden health care facilities and tax available resources. We draw from work on previous public health crises (i.e., Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks) and other collective trauma (e.g., terrorist attacks) where media coverage of events had unintended consequences for those at relatively low risk for direct exposure, leading to potentially severe public health repercussions. We conclude with recommendations for individuals, researchers, and public health officials with respect to receiving and providing effective communications during a public health crisis.

However, age-dependent differences in immune function require careful evaluation of novel vaccines in the pediatric population. Toward this goal, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Two groups of 8 infant rhesus macaques (RMs) were immunized intramuscularly at weeks 0 and 4 with stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S-2P spike (S) protein encoded by mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) or the purified S protein mixed with 3M-052, a synthetic TLR7/8 agonist in a squalene emulsion (Protein+3M-052-SE). Neither vaccine induced adverse effects. Both vaccines elicited high magnitude IgG binding to RBD, N terminus domain, S1, and S2, ACE2 blocking activity, and high neutralizing antibody titers, all peaking at week 6. S-specific memory B cells were detected by week 4 and S-specific T cell responses were dominated by the production of IL-17, IFN-γ, or TNF-α. Antibody and cellular responses were stable through week 22. The immune responses for the mRNA-LNP vaccine were of a similar magnitude to those elicited by the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine in adults. The S-2P mRNA-LNP and Protein-3M-052-SE vaccines were well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in infant RMs, providing proof-of concept for a pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with the potential for durable immunity that might decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and mitigate the ongoing health and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19.","Garrido, Carolina; Curtis, Alan D; Dennis, Maria; Pathak, Sachi H; Gao, Hongmei; Montefiori, David; Tomai, Mark; Fox, Christopher B; Kozlowski, Pamela A; Scobey, Trevor; Munt, Jennifer E; Mallory, Michael L; Saha, Pooja T; Hudgens, Michael G; Lindesmith, Lisa C; Baric, Ralph S; Abiona, Olubukola M; Graham, Barney; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Edwards, Darin; Carfi, Andrea; Fouda, Genevieve; Van Rompay, Koen K A; De Paris, Kristina; Permar, Sallie R",Science immunology,616,1

Dialysis unit attributes and isolation strategies that might reduce dialysis center COVID-19 infection rates have not been previously examined. Methods We explored the role of variables including community disease burden, dialysis unit attributes (size, layout) and infection control strategies, on rates of COVID-19 among patients receiving in center hemodialysis in London, UK, between March 2nd 2020 and May 31st 2020. The two outcomes were defined as (i) a positive test for infection or admission with suspected COVID19 and (ii) admission to the hospital with suspected infection. Associations were examined using a discrete-time multi-level time-to-event analysis. Results Data on 5,755 patients, dialysing in 51 units were analysed. 990 (17%) tested positive and 465 (8%) were admitted with suspected COVID-19 between 2nd March and 31st May 2020. Outcomes were associated with age, diabetes, local community COVID-19 rates and dialysis unit size.

Palestinian health-care providers were exposed to several challenges related to their work environment as they worked in war-like conditions;therefore, this study aims to explore health-care providers’ perceptions, perspectives, challenges and human rights-related concerns during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Palestine. Design/methodology/approach: The sample comprised 30 health-care providers 26–35 years, who were purposively selected from among health-care providers in two Palestinian cities, Nablus and Tulkarm, located in the north of the West Bank. Thematic content analysis was applied to transcripts of interviews with the practitioners to identify key themes. Findings: The thematic content analysis showed that the pandemic and quarantine negatively affect the mental health outcomes, daily routine and social relations of health-care providers. The main challenges related to human rights violations and faced by the health-care providers include a lack of sufficient infrastructure, lack of medical equipment’s and protective gear, military occupation and a shortage of health-care providers in general, especially those who practice in speciality fields such as neurology, oncology, pediatric surgery and clinical psychology. Practical implications: Further investigations are recommended to test different variables related to health-care providers’ work during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper also recommends conducting studies targeting Palestinian health-care providers’ training and supervision services to improve their skills and resiliency in dealing with future crises. Originality/value: The present work is the first to examine health-care providers’ perceptions, perspectives, challenges and human rights concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Palestine.

We aimed to characterize the presentation of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 on lower airway sampling following negative nasopharyngeal swab. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study to identify COVID-19 patients in whom nasopharyngeal swab testing was negative. Characteristics of patients were collected including demographics, presenting symptoms, and number of false negatives prior to diagnosis. Results: We identified 8 patients in whom COVID-19 diagnosis was assisted by lower airway sampling following between 1 and 4 negative nasopharyngeal swabs. While presenting characteristics of such patients were non-specific, we identify those with negative nasopharyngeal testing on initial presentation versus later in illness, who subsequently tested positive on lower airway sampling. Conclusions: Presentations of patients with COVID-19 in whom nasopharyngeal swab is negative are non-specific. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required in approaching patients with persistent, unexplained respiratory symptoms given the high prevalence of COVID-19. It is imperative to correctly identify patients positive for COVID-19, and lower airway sampling with tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be of value in cases of high suspicion by expediting the diagnosis, though further study is required. © Journal of Public Health and Emergency.

Understanding the cause and effects of fatigue in the profession are warranted to design evidence-based and effective interventions for fatigue mitigation. By identifying the individual stressors to individuals fatigue levels, tailored approaches to better optimise performance can be established. Methods This was a single-site qualitative study design using an interpretive, iterative and then deductive thematic analysis approach. Participants were recruited between February 2020 – May 2020. A convenience, followed by purposive sampling strategy was employed to inform theoretical gaps on surgical trainees and consultants. Findings There are commonalities in the influencing factors between both fatigue and sleep deprivation. It was identified that often the combination of fatigue and sleep stressors blurs the line between identifying what is primarily influencing subjective fatigue. There was an appreciation that the perfect storm of personal and environmental stressors could impact patient safety. Participants identified several personal mitigators for technical and cognitive performance, but relied more heavily on team factors for decision-making and to mitigate affective issues. Conclusion This study provides understanding of fatigue in surgery as a multifaceted phenomenon. Variation in causes and effects of fatigue are the norm. Maladaptive strategies to mitigate fatigue in surgery are commonly used. Fatigue as a problem is best tackled at an individual level, and supported by environmental and systemic changes to sustain behaviour changes.","Whelehan, Dale F.; Brown, Daniel Connelly Tara Ridgway Paul F.",International Journal of Surgery Open,616,1

This was to help curtail the spread of the deadly disease. This study examined the travel behaviour of flouting commuters in Makurdi metropolis amidst the travel restriction policy during the lockdown period. About 496 questionnaires were administered to commuters travelling within the 16 km radius metropolis. Essential factors captured in the questionnaire included modal split and trip purposes as affected by socio-demographic characteristics of commuters such as;age, gender, marital status, level of education, etc. The findings of the study revealed that there was no statistically significant level of dependence of commuters' socio-demographic characteristics on modal split and trip destinations at 5% level of significance using contingency tables. The trend revealed that there were no obvious influential changes in the travel behaviour of commuters in Makurdi metropolis amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It was recommended that concerned authorities should create more awareness about the outbreak of pandemics to help instil fear in commuters and discourage travelling to prevent wide spread. Also, distribution of palliatives to households during lockdown periods to enable them cope with the situation as they remain indoors, and deployment of law enforcement agents to streets and highways to stop commuters from travelling during lockdown periods to minimise the spread of communicable diseases were recommended.","Adeke, P.

This paper presents the conception, workflow and deployment of two MR applications for verification of typical yet geometrically complex structural members: a reinforced concrete corbel and a steel frame. The aim of this research is threefold: (i) to develop and implement the technological feasibility of such applications, (ii) to demonstrate possible use cases in the context of structural engineering lectures and (iii) to evaluate the presented MR examples and the future potential of such MR applications in structural engineering lectures through a survey. The workflow and MR teaching applications were developed with Apple's ARKit. The verification process was reproduced in the MR applications based on conventional exercises taught on paper. Users can navigate independently through the applications and review every single step, including a true-to-scale, spatial representation of the specific component as well as associated verification formulas in the respective step. The applications were used to assess the demand and expectations for immersive teaching techniques among students and instructors through a survey. The participants were asked to test the MR applications on their devices or watch pre-recorded video demonstrations, afterwards perception was elicited through a questionnaire. The results of subsequent data analysis show generally positive judgement of the MR application over the six questioned categories (style, usefulness, ease of use, enjoyment, attitude as well as intention towards using). The statistical analysis revealed (positivity) biases for users with prior XR experience w.r.t. to usage and navigation, while inexperienced users underlined increased enjoyment or excitement with this learning format.

Aims: Evaluate the resources available and used to gather COVID-19 epidemiological data by Portuguese health authorities from the onset of the pandemic until December 2020. The analysis laid on two main topics: (a) work processes at the Public Health Unit (PHU) level and (b) registry forms for epidemiological reporting and control procedures. Recommendations on requirements to overcome problems related to data integration and interoperability in order to build robust decision-making support mechanisms will also be produced. Methods: For topic (a), we revised the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health (DGS) guidelines for data treatment. For topic (b), we analysed the forms used during first and second waves, while comparing them with DGS metadata provided to researchers. Results: On topic (a), we detected the use of two complementary and non-interoperable systems. Further, the workflow does not seem to promote data quality and facilitates the occurrence of communication problems between health professionals. On topic (b), we found 27 deleted questions, 6 new questions, 1 displaced question, and 1 text modification between the 2 form versions. Discussion: Both the workflow and data gathering methods are not the best suited for the generation of good quality data. They do not effectively support Public Health Professionals (PHP) nor provide the elements for posterior data analysis.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 crisis and lockdown on families of children with CHD and to study knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among them. Methodology: The purposive sampling was used, all patients (173) who consulted in the cardiology outpatient department during the study period and 190 CHD patients whose the date of surgery was previously scheduled during April and May 2020, but delayed due to the national lockdown were included in this study. Hence, the sample size of the study was 363. Phone calls were made to all patients' families. This study design was used due to current COVID-19 crisis to minimize contact with patients, in line with safety precautions mandated by the government. Results: 54.2% were male patients, 43.3% in the age group of 1-5 years, predominant diagnosis (37.3%) was ventricular septal defect. Majority of parents of CHD patients (78.2%) answered that primary source of information about COVID-19 was social media. Twelve percent patients had worsening of symptoms related to existing heart condition during this period. Parents of 26 patients (8.3%) faced difficulty in getting medicines due to lockdown. The KAP assessment found that a high proportion of parents possessed basic knowledge about the disease at the early stage of the pandemic. The average KAP score was 10.2 (Range 2-16). Conclusion: This is the first study to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on children with CHD during the pandemic. This group had faced considerable difficulty like the general population. KAP assessment showed that they had good knowledge about the pandemic;they were following precautionary measures, especially because of the child's condition, to ensure the child's safety.","Prabhu, S.

This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former’s interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim “holding” legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant “permission” for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura",Health Hum Rights,616,7

Elevated serum levels of NO and IFN-gamma have been observed in HFRS patients, but little is known regarding the systemic levels of other IFNs and the possible effects of hantaviruses on innate antiviral immune responses. In Puumala virus-infected HFRS patients (n = 18), we report that the levels of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta are similar, whereas the level of IFN-lambda (type III IFN) is significantly decreased, during acute (day of hospitalization) compared to the convalescent phase. The possible antiviral effects of IFN-lambda on the prototypic hantavirus Hantaan virus (HTNV) replication was then investigated. Pretreatment of A549 cells with IFN-lambda alone inhibited HTNV replication, and IFN-lambda combined with IFN-gamma induced additive antiviral effects. We then studied the effect of postinfection treatment with IFNs. Interestingly, an already-established HTNV infection was insensitive to subsequent IFN-alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -lambda stimulation, and HTNV-infected cells produced less NO compared to noninfected cells when stimulated with IFN-gamma and IL-1beta. Furthermore, less phosphorylated STAT1 after IFN treatment was observed in the nuclei of infected cells than in those of noninfected cells. The results suggest that hantavirus can interfere with the activation of antiviral innate immune responses in patients and inhibit the antiviral effects of all IFNs. We believe that future studies addressing the mechanisms by which hantaviruses interfere with the activation and shaping of immune responses may bring more knowledge regarding HFRS and HCPS pathogenesis.","Stoltz, Malin; Ahlm, Clas; Lundkvist, Ake; Klingström, Jonas",Journal of virology,616,33

Dithiothreitol used in the cDNA synthesis step was found to significantly decrease the detection sensitivity for SINV RdRp and was therefore omitted. SINV RdRp cDNA was then quantified by QPCR using SYBR Green dye and a standard curve generated from SINV RdRp plasmid clones.

Our data suggest an association between abnormal genomic imprinting and hypospermatogenesis, and that spermatozoa from oligozoospermic patients carry a raised risk of transmitting imprinting errors.","Marques, Cristina Joana; Carvalho, Filipa; Sousa, Mário; Barros, Alberto",Lancet,616,1

Brain suspension from infected suckling mice was used as immunogen. The antigenic relationship between OC43 and NCDCV was studied by the indirect immunoperoxidase antibody technique, by the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and a new infectious centre-reduction neutralization test. In mouse immune sera, a two-way cross-reaction between OC43 and NCDCV was detected. However, the antigenic relationship appeared to be closer for internal (as shown by immunoperoxidase staining) as compared to surface antigens (as shown by HI and neutralization). In primary infections of natural hosts there was a high degree of cross-reactivity between the two coronavirus strains for both surface and internal antigens, and homologous and heterologous titres were consistently within an eightfold dilution difference by all tests. Most human adults and calves had antibody to both OC43 and NCDCV and geometric mean titres of homologous antibody were higher than titres of heterologous antibody. Although OC43 and NCDCV share antigenic determinants, they possessed several different biological properties, including plaque morphology by the infectious centre assay, agglutination of 1-day-old chick erythrocytes and resistance of haemagglutinin to physical and chemical treatments.","Gerna, G; Cereda, P M; Revello, M G; Cattaneo, E; Battaglia, M; Gerna, M T",The Journal of general virology,616,20

A prospective observational single surgeon study.,9.426338,4.0601954,2013,"INTRODUCTION The goal of modern laparoscopic hernia repair is to achieve a high standard of patient safety with a low threshold of hernia recurrence and chronic inguinal pain. In the absence of fixating devices and the use of the self-gripping Parietene and Parietex ProGrip mesh (Covidien AG, Zurich, Switzerland) was evaluated in this prospective clinical study. The incidence of chronic pain, postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, and hernia recurrence at follow-up after 12 and 24 months was recorded. METHODS Data were collected retrospectively from patient files and were analyzed for 405 male and female patients with 483 primary inguinal hernias. All patients included had undergone surgical repair for inguinal hernia by the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach using Parietex ProGrip meshes performed in the same clinical center in Germany. Pre-, peri-, and postoperative data were collected and a follow-up after 12 and 24 months was performed prospectively. Complications, pain scored on a 0 to 10 NRS scale, patient satisfaction, and hernia recurrence were assessed. RESULTS The only complications were minor and were postoperative: hematoma/seroma (nine cases), secondary hemorrhage through the trocar's site (eight cases), hematuria, emphysema in the inguinal regions (both sides), and swelling above the genital organs (one case for each). Two patients had to be reoperated due to a hematoma in inguinal canal. At mean follow-up at 22.8 months, there were only eight reports of hernia recurrence: 1.9% of the hernias. Most patients (94.9%) were satisfied or very satisfied with their hernia repair with only 1.2% reporting severe pain (NRS score 7 to 10) and 3.6% reported mild pain. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that, in experienced hands, inguinal hernia repair surgery performed by laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernioplasty using Parietene and Parietex ProGrip self-gripping meshes is rapid, efficient, and safe with low pain and low hernia recurrence rate. Since no fixating device or glue is necessary for the procedure, additional cost-effectiveness is achieved.","Birk, Dieter; Pardo, Carlos Garcia",Surgical technology international,616,1

METHODS Combined nose/throat swabs from patients with ILI selected from sentinel general practices were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses at the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory. The proportion of ILI attributed to laboratory-confirmed influenza was evaluated for five consecutive surveillance seasons, from 1998 to 2002. The seasonal patterns of ILI and laboratory-confirmed influenza were compared for 2000-02. ILI surveillance from sentinel general practices between 1997 and 2000 was compared with hospital admissions for influenza extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset between 1994 and 2000. RESULTS Approximately 41% of all ILI cases from sentinel general practices were confirmed to have an influenza infection between 1998 and 2002. The seasonal pattern of ILI and confirmed influenza among patients selected from sentinel general practices was very similar over three influenza seasons. The trends for ILI rates in sentinel general practices appeared to correlate remarkably well with those of hospital admissions for influenza. Thresholds for ILI were defined as: baseline < 0.25 ILI cases/100 patients/week; normal seasonal activity 0.25-1.5; above normal seasonal activity > 1.5-3.5; and epidemic activity above 3.5. CONCLUSIONS ILI rates from sentinel general practices correspond with hospital admissions coded as influenza and allow the use of threshold levels to describe seasonal influenza activity.","Watts, Caroline G; Andrews, Ross M; Druce, Julian D; Kelly, Heath A",Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,616,1

Some infectious diseases are already increasing but future changes are difficult to predict because of the complexity of host-agent-environment relationships. However mechanisms related to climate change that will influence disease patterns are understood. Warmer temperatures will benefit free living bacteria and parasites whose survival and development is limited by temperature. Warmer temperatures could promote survivability, shorter development rates and transmission. Insects such as mosquitoes and ticks that transmit disease agents may also benefit from climate change as well as the diseases they spread. Climate change will have significant impacts on biodiversity. Disease agents of species that benefit from warming will likely become more prevalent. Host species stressed by changing environmental conditions may be more vulnerable to disease agents. Warming could lead to increased agriculture and other economic opportunities in the Arctic bringing people, domestic food animals, pets and invasive species and their disease agents into Northern regions. Climate warming may also favor the release of persistent environmental pollutants some of which can affect the immune system and may favor increased rates of some diseases.","Bradley, Michael; Kutz, Susan J; Jenkins, Emily; O'Hara, Todd M",International journal of circumpolar health,616,19

Transmission to a family member who was later admitted to a community hospital in Toronto led to a large nosocomial outbreak. In this report we summarize the preliminary results of the epidemiological investigation into the transmission of SARS between 128 cases associated with this hospital outbreak. METHODS We collected epidemiologic data on 128 probable and suspect cases of SARS associated with the hospital outbreak, including those who became infected in hospital and the next generation of illness arising among their contacts. Incubation periods were calculated based on cases with a single known exposure. Transmission chains from the index family to hospital contacts and within the hospital were mapped. Attack rates were calculated for nurses in 3 hospital wards where transmission occurred. RESULTS The cases ranged in age from 21 months to 86 years; 60.2% were female. Seventeen deaths were reported (case-fatality rate 13.3%). Of the identified cases, 36.7% were hospital staff. Other cases were household or social contacts of SARS cases (29.6%), hospital patients (14.1%), visitors (14.1%) or other health care workers (5.5%). Of the 128 cases, 120 (93.8%) had documented contact with a SARS case or with a ward where there was a known SARS case. The remaining 8 cases without documented exposure are believed to have had exposure to an unidentified case and remain under investigation. The attack rates among nurses who worked in the emergency department, intensive care unit and coronary care unit ranged from 10.3% to 60.0%. Based on 42 of the 128 cases with a single known contact with a SARS case, the mean incubation period was 5 days (range 2 to 10 days). INTERPRETATION Evidence to date suggests that SARS is a severe respiratory illness spread mainly by respiratory droplets. There has been no evidence of further transmission within the hospital after the elapse of 2 full incubation periods (20 days).","Varia, Monali; Wilson, Samantha; Sarwal, Shelly; McGeer, Allison; Gournis, Effie; Galanis, Eleni; Henry, Bonnie",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,616,12

During this period, health care resources and databases have been developed. This paper reviews the literature on e-mail communication and on-line health care information resources to determine the impact on psychiatry. METHOD The Medline electronic database and the search engines Altavista and Google were used to review the literature discussing on-line guidelines, clinical trials, and continuing medical education (CME) resources, as well as the literature on Internet usage, e-journals, and e-mail communication. CONCLUSIONS The Internet has accelerated psychiatrists' access to new research findings and other information pertinent to clinical practice. It has eliminated distance barriers and offered psychiatrists and the general public equal access to scientific articles, clinical trials, and guidelines. The literature shows that the general public is using the Internet to obtain information and, to a lesser extent, to communicate with health care professionals. In terms of health outcomes, the effectiveness of patient on-line access to information is still uncertain, and further research is necessary. Although physicians have embraced on-line journals, further work is required before they embrace on-line CME. The Internet has developed to a point where it is important for psychiatrists to understand the issues and pitfalls in its use, to be able to access the resources available, and to be in a position to mentor patients who want to research their condition further.","Styra, Rima",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of major disasters. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza, the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to promote PTSD. Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). With a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms, the evocation of SARS is generating a great anxiety contributing to promote PTSD. Quarantine of infected patients evolved to quarantine of 'infected' towns or popular districts, and then of entire countries. In the families of cases, the brutal death of family members involved a spread of fear and a loss of certainty, promoting PTSD. In the context of disaster medicine with a lack of human and technical resources, healthcare workers could also develop acute stress disorders, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD. Globally, WHO estimates 30-50% of the population affected by a disaster suffered from diverse psychological distress. PTSD individuals are more at-risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and deaths by suicide - considering that healthcare workers are already at-risk occupations. We draw attention towards PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, both for general population, patients, and healthcare workers. Healthcare policies need to take into account preventive strategy of PTSD, and the related risk of suicide, in forthcoming months.","Dutheil, Frédéric; Mondillon, Laurie; Navel, Valentin",Psychol Med,616,6

The approved COVID-19 vaccines have shown great promise in reducing disease transmission and severity of outcomes. However, the success of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is dependent on public acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated. In this study, we aim to examine how the attitude towards public sector officials and the government impact vaccine willingness with a secondary aim to understand the impact of ethnicity on this relationship. MethodsThis cross-sectional study used data from a UK population based longitudinal household survey (Understanding Society COVID-19 study, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study) between April 2020-January 2021. Data from 22421 participants in Waves 6 and 7 of the study were included after excluding missing data. Demographic details in addition to previous survey responses relating to public sector/governmental trust were included in as covariates in the main analyses. A logit model was produced to describe the association between public sector/governmental mistrust and the willingness for vaccination with interaction terms included to account for ethnicity/socio-economic status. FindingsIn support of existing literature, we identified those from BAME groups were more likely to be unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that positive opinions towards public sector officials (OR 2.680: 95% CI 1.888 - 3.805) and the UK government (OR 3.400; 95% CI 2.454 - 4.712) led to substantive increase in vaccine willingness. Most notably we identified this effect to be vary across ethnicity and socio-economic status with those from South Asian background (OR 4.513; 95% CI 1.012 - 20.123) the most unwilling to be vaccinated when their trust in public sector officials were affected. InterpretationThese findings suggests that trust in public sector officials may play a key factor in the low vaccination rates particularly seen in at risk groups. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID-19 to those from lower socio-economic or ethnic minority backgrounds, there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the Government. FundingNo funding RESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA systematic literature search on Pubmed and MedRxiv from database inception to 2nd July 2021 was conducted. The broad terms included were ""COVID"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2*"" AND ""hesitancy"" OR ""willingness."" There were no age or language restrictions. We identified numerous observational studies examining prevalence of willingness and hesitancy towards taking the vaccine in a variety of global settings. However, there were fewer studies which examined the reasons behind decisions relating to vaccine hesitancy and in particular in communities relevant to those most at risk in the United Kingdom. Added value of this studyTo our knowledge, this is the first attempt to exploring the role of trust in the public sector officials and in the Government with UK COVID-19 vaccination willingness. We found that negative pre-existing opinions around public sector/Government significantly reduced vaccine willingness with an increased effect size noted in those from lower socio-economic and BAME backgrounds. Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings support pre-existing prevalence data suggesting a reduced willingness for vaccination in lower socio-economic/BAME communities. However, our findings build on existing literature by suggesting that trust in public sector officials may play a key factor in the low vaccination rates. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID-19 to those from lower socio-economic or ethnic minority backgrounds there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the Government.","Chaudhuri, Kausik; Chakrabarti, Anindita; Chandan, Joht Singh; Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha",,616,30

Lack of skills and knowledge on the part of health care providers have a negative effect on their access to care and health outcomes. This study 1) explores the knowledge and attitudes of medical students regarding LGBT people, and 2) assesses the impact of a one-hour lecture targeting adolescent LGBT health needs. METHODS: Fourth-year medical students attended a compulsory one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and gender identity development in adolescence, highlighting health issues. We created a questionnaire with items to elicit students' knowledge and attitudes about LGBT health issues. Students were invited to complete this questionnaire online anonymously one week before the lecture and one month after the lecture. RESULTS: Out of a total of 157 students, 107 (68.2%) responded to the pre-intervention questionnaire and 96 (61.1%) to the post-intervention questionnaire. A significant proportion-13.7% of all respondents-identified as LGBT or questioning. Our results show that most medical students already show favorable attitudes towards LGBT people and a certain degree of knowledge of LGBT health needs. They demonstrated a large and significant increase in knowledge of LGBT health issues one month after the lecture. DISCUSSION: A single one-hour lecture on sexual orientation and LGBT health issues may increase knowledge among medical students. Medical students and professionals should receive such training to increase their knowledge about LGBT patients as it, together with favorable attitudes, has the potential to improve health outcomes among this vulnerable population.","Wahlen, Raphaël; Bize, Raphaël; Wang, Jen; Merglen, Arnaud; Ambresin, Anne-Emmanuelle",PLoS One,616,16

However, there is no specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of three antiviral treatment regimens in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-labeled, prospective clinical trial. Eligible patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomized into three groups: ribavirin (RBV) plus interferon-α (IFN-α), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus IFN-α, and RBV plus LPV/r plus IFN-α at a 1:1:1 ratio. Each patient was invited to participate in a 28-d follow-up after initiation of an antiviral regimen. The outcomes include the difference in median interval to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity, the proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity at day 14, the mortality at day 28, the proportion of patients re-classified as severe cases, and adverse events during the study period. RESULTS: In total, we enrolled 101 patients in this study. Baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were comparable among the three groups. In the analysis of intention-to-treat data, the median interval from baseline to SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity was 12 d in the LPV/r+IFN-α-treated group, as compared with 13 and 15 d in the RBV+IFN-α-treated group and in the RBV+LPV/r+ IFN-α-treated group, respectively (p=0.23). The proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid negativity in the LPV/r+IFN-α-treated group (61.1%) was higher than the RBV+ IFN-α-treated group (51.5%) and the RBV+LPV/r+IFN-α-treated group (46.9%) at day 14; however, the difference between these groups was calculated to be statistically insignificant. The RBV+LPV/r+IFN-α-treated group developed a significantly higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events than the LPV/r+ IFN-α-treated group and the RBV+ IFN-α-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that there are no significant differences among the three regimens in terms of antiviral effectiveness in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of RBV and LPV/r is associated with a significant increase in gastrointestinal adverse events, suggesting that RBV and LPV/r should not be co-administered to COVID-19 patients simultaneously.
