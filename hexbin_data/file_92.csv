149,149,149,Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy,15.455151,7.9947267,2001-07-11,"Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com","Takano, T; Miyauchi, A; Yoshida, H; Hasegawa, Y; Kuma, K; Amino, N",Br J Cancer,92,1
570,570,570,Standardization of Methods for Early Diagnosis and On-Site Treatment of High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema,15.442979,7.8727303,2011-06-01,"High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-threatening disease of high altitude that often affects nonacclimatized apparently healthy individuals who rapidly ascend to high altitude. Early detection, early diagnosis, and early treatment are essential to maintain the safety of people who ascend to high altitude, such as construction workers and tourists. In this paper, I discuss various methods and criteria that can be used for the early diagnosis and prediction of HAPE. I also discuss the preventive strategies and options for on-site treatment. My objective is to improve the understanding of HAPE and to highlight the need for prevention, early diagnosis, and early treatment of HAPE to improve the safety of individuals ascending to high altitude.","Zhou, Qiquan",Pulm Med,92,22
1612,1612,1612,Procalcitonin versus C-reactive protein: Usefulness as biomarker of sepsis in ICU patient,15.5982895,8.018989,2014,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy of sepsis is a daily challenge in intensive care units (ICUs) despite the advances in critical care medicine. Procalcitonin (PCT); an innovative laboratory marker, has been recently proven valuable worldwide in this regard. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of PCT in a resource constrained country like ours when compared to the traditional inflammatory markers like C - reactive protein (CRP) to introduce PCT as a routine biochemical tool in regional hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCT and CRP were simultaneously measured and compared in 73 medico-surgical ICU patients according to the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) criteria based study groups. RESULTS: The clinical presentation of 75% cases revealed a range of systemic inflammatory responses (SIRS). The diagnostic accuracy of PCT was higher (75%) with greater specificity (72%), sensitivity (76%), positive and negative predictive values (89% and 50%), positive likelihood ratio (2.75) as well as the smaller negative likelihood ratio (0.33). Both serum PCT and CRP values in cases with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock were significantly higher from that of the cases with SIRS and no SIRS (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: PCT is found to be superior to CRP in terms of accuracy in identification and to assess the severity of sepsis even though both markers cannot be used in differentiating infectious from noninfectious clinical syndrome.","Nargis, Waheeda; Ibrahim, Md; Ahamed, Borhan Uddin",Int J Crit Illn Inj Sci,92,1
1803,1803,1803,"Insect-Specific Flaviviruses: A Systematic Review of Their Discovery, Host Range, Mode of Transmission, Superinfection Exclusion Potential and Genomic Organization",15.468135,8.142146,2015-04-10,"There has been a dramatic increase in the number of insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) discovered in the last decade. Historically, these viruses have generated limited interest due to their inability to infect vertebrate cells. This viewpoint has changed in recent years because some ISFs have been shown to enhance or suppress the replication of medically important flaviviruses in co-infected mosquito cells. Additionally, comparative studies between ISFs and medically important flaviviruses can provide a unique perspective as to why some flaviviruses possess the ability to infect and cause devastating disease in humans while others do not. ISFs have been isolated exclusively from mosquitoes in nature but the detection of ISF-like sequences in sandflies and chironomids indicates that they may also infect other dipterans. ISFs can be divided into two distinct phylogenetic groups. The first group currently consists of approximately 12 viruses and includes cell fusing agent virus, Kamiti River virus and Culex flavivirus. These viruses are phylogenetically distinct from all other known flaviviruses. The second group, which is apparently not monophyletic, currently consists of nine viruses and includes Chaoyang virus, Nounané virus and Lammi virus. These viruses phylogenetically affiliate with mosquito/vertebrate flaviviruses despite their apparent insect-restricted phenotype. This article provides a review of the discovery, host range, mode of transmission, superinfection exclusion ability and genomic organization of ISFs. This article also attempts to clarify the ISF nomenclature because some of these viruses have been assigned more than one name due to their simultaneous discoveries by independent research groups.","Blitvich, Bradley J.; Firth, Andrew E.",Viruses,92,27

METHODS: Review of available publications and discussion within a multidisciplinary group consistent of radiologists and microbiologists, in consultation with European patient and industry representatives. RECOMMENDATIONS: Good basic hygiene standards are essential. All US equipment must be approved prior to first use, including hand held devices. Any equipment in direct patient contact must be cleaned and disinfected prior to first use and after every examination. Regular deep cleaning of the entire US machine and environment should be undertaken. Faulty transducers should not be used. As outlined in presented flowcharts, low level disinfection is sufficient for standard US on intact skin. For all other minor and major interventional procedures as well as all endo-cavity US, high level disinfection is mandatory. Dedicated transducer covers must be used when transducers are in contact with mucous membranes or body fluids and sterile gel should be used inside and outside covers. CONCLUSIONS: Good standards of basic hygiene and thorough decontamination of all US equipment as well as appropriate use of US gel and transducer covers are essential to keep patients safe. MAIN MESSAGES: • Transducers must be cleaned/disinfected before first use and after every examination. • Low level disinfection is sufficient for standard US on intact skin. • High level disinfection is mandatory for endo-cavity US and all interventions. • Dedicated transducer covers must be used for endo-cavity US and all interventions. • Sterile gel should be used for all endo-cavity US and all interventions.","Nyhsen, Christiane M.; Humphreys, Hilary; Koerner, Roland J.; Grenier, Nicolas; Brady, Adrian; Sidhu, Paul; Nicolau, Carlos; Mostbeck, Gerhard; D’Onofrio, Mirko; Gangi, Afshin; Claudon, Michel",Insights Imaging,92,1

Here, we have studied the ability of heparin to inhibit homophilic interactions of RAGE in living cells and studied how heparin related structures interfere with RAGE–ligand interactions. Methods: Homophilic interactions of RAGE were studied with bead aggregation and living cell protein-fragment complementation assays. Ligand binding was analyzed with microwell binding and chromatographic assays. Cell surface advanced glycation end product binding to RAGE was studied using PC3 cell adhesion assay. Results: Homophilic binding of RAGE was mediated by V(1)- and modulated by C(2)-domain in bead aggregation assay. Dimerisation of RAGE on the living cell surface was inhibited by heparin. Sulphated K5 carbohydrate fragments inhibited RAGE binding to amyloid β-peptide and HMGB1. The inhibition was dependent on the level of sulfation and the length of the carbohydrate backbone. α-d-Glucopyranosiduronic acid (glycyrrhizin) inhibited RAGE binding to advanced glycation end products in PC3 cell adhesion and protein binding assays. Further, glycyrrhizin inhibited HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box binding to heparin. Conclusions: Our results show that K5 polysaccharides and glycyrrhizin are promising candidates for RAGE targeting drug development.","Rouhiainen, Ari; Nykänen, Niko-Petteri; Kuja-Panula, Juha; Vanttola, Päivi; Huttunen, Henri J.; Rauvala, Heikki",Medicines (Basel),92,1

6591,6591,6591,Effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) on chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis,15.575312,8.144848,1995,"Pulmonary hypertension comprises a group of diseases with heterogeneous etiology characterized by an increase of hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular bed. While secondary pulmonary hypertension predominantly results from acute or chronic left ventricular failure, characteristic gene defects or predisposing risk factors lead to various forms of primary pulmonary hypertension. Despite its diverse pathogenesis, pulmonary hypertension exhibits a uniform cellular pathophysiology in the pulmonary microcirculation. The dysfunction of lung vascular endothelial cells, which are the front line in response to hemodynamic changes in the pulmonary circulation, is the pathophysiological driving force of pulmonary hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a reduced production of vasodilative, anti-proliferative mediators and an increased release of vasoconstrictive, proliferative factors. This apparent imbalance not only enhances pulmonary vasoconstriction, but supports pathologic remodeling processes in the vascular intima and media. In addition, the pulmonary endothelium recruits platelets and leukocytes, thus, contributing to further release of vasoconstrictive and proliferative mediators and characteristic thrombus formation. These endothelium-derived pathomechanisms amplify each other, further enhance pulmonary vascular resistance, and finally result in fixation of the hypertensive state. Hence, pulmonary hypertension not only describes an alteration of lung hemodynamics, but comprises a complex set of pathophysiological events in both lung parenchymal cells and circulating blood cells. For development of new therapeutical strategies, the multifactorial character of the disease should be considered.","Kuebler, W. M.; Kuppe, H.",Z Herz Thorax Gefasschir,92,1

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of advances in spinal surgery on patient outcomes in the treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis (SK). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: SK is one of the most common causes of back pain in adolescents. Trends in diagnoses and surgical treatment and approach to SK have not been well described. METHODS: SK patients aged 0–20 years in KID were identified by ICD-9 code 732.0. KID-supplied year- and hospital-trend weights were used to establish prevalence. Patient demographics, surgical details, and outcomes were analyzed with analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 SK patients were identified (33.2% female), with increasing incidence of SK diagnosed from 2003 to 2012 (3.6–7.5 per 100,000, p < .001). The average age of operative patients was 16.1±2.0 years and did not change (16.27–16.06 years, p = .905). The surgical rate has not changed over time (72.8%–72.8%, p = .909). Overall, 96.3% of operative patients underwent fusion, with 82.2% of cases spanning ⩾4 levels; in addition, 8.6% underwent an anterior-only surgery, 74.6% posterior-only, and 13.6% combined approach. From 2003 to 2012, rates of posterior-only surgeries increased (62.4%–84.4%, p < .001) whereas the rate of combined-approach surgeries decreased (37.6%–8.8%, p < .001). Overall complication rates for SK surgeries have decreased (2003: 20.9%; 2012: 11.9%, p = .029). Concurrently, the rate of ⩾4-level fusions has increased (43.5%–89.6%, p < .001), as well as the use of Smith-Peterson (7.8%–23.6%, p < .001) and three-column osteotomies (0.0%–2.7%, p = .011). In subanalysis comparing posterior to combined approaches, complication rates were significantly different (posterior: 9.88%, combined: 19.46%, p = .005). Patients undergoing a combined approach have a longer length of stay (LOS) than patients undergoing a posterior-only approach (7.8 vs. 5.6 days, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite unchanged demographics and operative rates in SK, there has been a shift from combined to isolated posterior approaches, with a concurrent increase in levels treated. A combined approach was associated with increased complication rates, LOS, and total charges compared to isolated approaches. Awareness of these inherent differences is important for surgical decision making and patient education.

It also discusses the structure and function of CD4 and p56(lck) and factors involved in hiv-1-associated cd4 downmodulation. There are, at present, at least three HIV-1 gene products known to be involved in cell surface CD4 downmodulation. These are Nef, Vpu, and gp160. Whereas Nef is expressed during the early phase of HIV-1 gene expression, both Vpu and gp160, which appear to act coordinately, are expressed during the late phase. This functional convergence of HIV-1 proteins on cell surface CD4 downmodulation, whether specific or nonspecific in activity, suggests that this event is of critical importance in the life cycle of HIV-1. Further elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie CD4 cell surface downmodulation may lead to the development of novel strategies aimed at preventing such events, and potentially to the development of new therapeutic approaches.","Geleziunas, Romas; Bour, Stephane; Wainberg, Mark A.",Adv Virus Res,92,1

SOURCE: Search strategies were developed for MEDLINE, EMBASE, Joanna Briggs Institute, Cochrane, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. Eligible studies described the application of early cognitive interventions for delirium prevention or treatment within any intensive care setting. Study designs included randomized-controlled trials, quasi-experimental trials, and pre/post interventional trials. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane methodology. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Four hundred and four citations were found. Seven full-text articles were included in the final review. Six of the included studies had an overall serious, high, or critical risk of bias. After application of cognitive intervention protocols, a significant reduction in delirium incidence, duration, occurrence, and development was found in four studies. Feasibility of cognitive interventions was measured in three studies. Cognitive stimulation techniques were described in the majority of studies. CONCLUSION: The study of early cognitive interventions in critically ill patients was identified in a small number of studies with limited sample sizes. An overall high risk of bias and variability within protocols limit the utility of the findings for widespread practice implications. This review may help to promote future large, multi-centre trials studying the addition of cognitive interventions to current delirium prevention practices. The need for robust data is essential to support the implementation of early cognitive interventions protocols.","Deemer, Kirsten; Zjadewicz, Karolina; Fiest, Kirsten; Oviatt, Stephanie; Parsons, Michelle; Myhre, Brittany; Posadas-Calleja, Juan",Can J Anaesth,92,1

The effects of stabilizers including CTAB, SDS, Tween 80 and PVP on controlling the particle size of Pd NPs were investigated. They were further immobilized on graphene oxide (i.e. Pd@VP2/GO) by a simple mixing method. Some characterizations including FT-IR and XPS were conducted to study adsorption mode of Pd@VP2 on GO sheets. Their catalytic performance was estimated in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). Results showed that Tween 80 stabilized Pd NPs with the molar ratio of Pd to Tween 80 at 1:0.1 possessed the smallest size and the best stability as well. They were encapsulated into viral protein cages (mean size 49 ± 0.26 nm) to assemble confined nanoreactors, most of which contained 1–2 Pd NPs (mean size 8.15 ± 0.26 nm). As-prepared Pd@VP2 indicated an enhanced activity (apparent reaction rate constant k(app) = (3.74 ± 0.10) × 10(−3) s(−1)) for the reduction of 4-NP in comparison to non-confined Pd-Tween80 colloid (k(app) = (2.20 ± 0.06) × 10(−3) s(−1)). It was logically due to confinement effects of Pd@VP2 including high dispersion of Pd NPs and high effective concentration of substrates in confined space. Pd@VP2 were further immobilized on GO surface through C-N bond. Pd@VP2/GO exhibited good reusability after recycling for four runs, confirming the strong anchoring effects of GO on Pd@VP2.

In the two neighbour and most southern Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC), rabies in dogs has been successfully controlled for more than 30 years. However, rabies associated to the rural cycle remains endemic, with a significant, though oscillating—annual incidence of rabies in cattle. Despite the plethora of studies on genetic analyses of Brazilian RABV, isolates from southern Brazil have only scarcely been investigated. This work was performed to identify the genetic lineages of RABVs circulating in states of RS and SC. Fifty-nine RABV cattle isolates from RS and SC were selected and submitted to reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene. In RS, the circulation of two sublineages (1A and 1B) of RABV was detected, both with characteristics of lineages usually detected in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). In SC, only one sublineage of RABV (1B) was detected. Nevertheless, the findings reported here are expected to contribute to the understanding of the biology of the virus in the region and its interactions with the natural host D. rotundus.","Fernandes, Marcélia Emanuele S.; Carnieli, Pedro; Gregório, Adriele N.

We sought to investigate factors associated with the development of VAP in critically ill trauma patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of trauma patients admitted to our trauma intensive care unit between 2016 and 2018. Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were identified from the trauma database. Data collected from the trauma database included demographics (age, gender and race), mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), injury severity (injury severity score “ISS”), the presence of VAP, transfused blood products and presenting vital signs. RESULTS: A total of 1403 patients were admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) during the study period; of these, 45 had ventilator-associated pneumonia. Patients with VAP were older (p = 0.030), and they had a higher incidence of massive transfusion (p = 0.015) and received more packed cells in the first 24 h of admission (p = 0.028). They had a higher incidence of face injury (p = 0.001), injury to sternum (p = 0.011) and injury to spine (p = 0.024). Patients with VAP also had a higher incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (p < 0.001) and had a longer ICU (p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression models controlling for age and injury severity (ISS) showed massive transfusion (p = 0.017), AKI (p < 0.001), injury to face (p < 0.001), injury to sternum (p = 0.007), injury to spine (p = 0.047) and ICU length of stay (p < 0.001) to be independent predictors of VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Among critically ill trauma patients, acute kidney injury, injury to the spine, face or sternum, massive transfusion and intensive care unit length of stay were associated with VAP.","Younan, Duraid; Delozier, Sarah J.; Adamski, John; Loudon, Andrew; Violette, Aisha; Ustin, Jeffrey; Tinkoff, Glen; Moorman, Matthew L.; McQuay, Nathaniel",World J Surg,92,1

The aim of this study was to assess the comparative effects of the mindfulness (MB) and positive behavior support (PBS) components against the MBPBS program for mindful parenting. METHODS: The study utilized a three-arm randomized controlled trial design, with a 10-week pre-treatment control condition, 30 weeks of intervention, and 3 years of post-intervention follow-up. Mothers of children with ASD were randomly assigned to the MB, PBS, and MBPBS conditions and provided 3 days of training specific to each condition. The effects of these programs were assessed on the mothers (i.e., training attendance, meditation time, perceived psychological stress) and spillover effects were assessed on their children with ASD (i.e., aggression, disruptive behavior, compliance with mothers’ requests). RESULTS: Mothers in the MBPBS condition reported greater reductions in perceived psychological stress, followed by those in the MB condition, and with no significant changes reported by those in the PBS condition. Reduction in the children’s aggression and disruptive behavior followed a similar pattern, with most to least significant reductions being in MBPBS, MB, and PBS condition, respectively. Significant increases in compliance (i.e., responsiveness to mothers’ requests) were largest in the MBPBS condition, followed by MB, and then PBS. Changes across all variables for both mothers and their children were maintained for 3 years post-intervention. After time and training type were controlled for, meditation time was a significant predictor in reducing aggressive and disruptive behaviors, and in enhancing compliance of the children with mothers’ requests. CONCLUSIONS: Positive outcomes for mothers and their children with ASD were significantly greater in the MBPBS condition, followed by the MB condition, and least in the PBS condition. MBPBS appears to be an effective mindful parenting program on the assessed variables.","Singh, Nirbhay N.; Lancioni, Giulio E.; Medvedev, Oleg N.; Hwang, Yoon-Suk; Myers, Rachel E.",Mindfulness (N Y),92,1

Secondary and tertiary structures of all sequences were analyzed. Several mutations were found and major mutations were in amino acid residues 102, 202, 207, 292, 379, and 502. The mentioned mutations showed the minor effect on B cell and physicochemical properties of the L1 protein. Six disulfide bonds were determined in L1 protein and also in several N-link glycosylation and phosphorylation sites. Five L1 loops were determined, which had great potential to be B cell epitopes with high antigenic properties. All in all, this research as the first report from Iran described the tremendous potential of two L1 loops (BC and FG) to induce immune system which can be used as the descent candidate to design a new vaccine against HPV in the Iranian population. In addition, some differences between the reference sequence and Iranian patients’ sequences were determined. It is essential to consider these differences to monitor the effectiveness and efficacy of the vaccine for the Iranian population. Our results provide a vast understanding of L1 protein that can be useful for further studies on HPV infections and new vaccine generations.","Dehghani, Behzad; Hasanshahi, Zahra; Hashempour, Tayebeh; Motamedifar, Mohamad",Biologia (Bratisl),92,1

The 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) prompted an urgent worldwide vaccination campaign, especially of high-risk subjects, such as maintenance haemodialysis (HD) patients. Still the immunogenicity of the pandemic A (H1N1) vaccine in HD patients is unknown. Methods. We prospectively studied the immunogenicity of a monovalent adjuvanted influenza A/California/2009 (H1N1) vaccine (Pandemrix®, GSK Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) in HD patients and controls. Antibody level was measured using a seroneutralization assay before (D(0)) and 30 days after (D(30)) a single 3.75 μg vaccine dose. Specimens were tested in quadruplicates. Geometric mean (GM) antibody titers were determined in each subject at D(0) and D(30). Seroconversion was defined as an increase in GM titers by a factor 4 or more. Results. Fifty-three adult HD patients [aged 71 ± 10, 58.5% males, on HD for a median of 38 (3 − 146) months] and 32 control subjects (aged 47.3 ± 14, 31.3% males) were analyzed. Baseline GM titers were similar in HD patients and controls [7.9 (6.6 − 9.6) vs 10 (6 − 17); p = 0.69]. Seroconversion was observed in 30 (93.8%) controls and 34 (64.2%) HD patients (p = 0.002). In addition, GM titers at D(30) were significantly higher in controls than in HD patients [373 (217 − 640) vs 75.5 (42.5 − 134); p = 0.001]. HD patients were significantly older than controls (p < 0.001) and more likely to be males (p = 0.02). However, by multivariate analysis, HD status [OR 0.13 (0.02-0.78), p = 0.03], but neither age [OR 0.99 (0.96 − 1.03); p = 0.7] nor male gender [OR 1.31 (0.45 − 3.85); p = 0.63] was independently associated with seroconversion. The vaccine was generally well tolerated by HD patients. Conclusions. Only 64% of chronic HD patients developed seroconversion after a single dose of adjuvanted influenza A (H1N1) vaccine, a much lower rate than in controls (94%). These results underscore the substantial immunodeficiency associated with End-Stage Renal Disease. The persistence of protective antibodies as well as the effect of a booster dose remain to be investigated in HD patients.","Labriola, Laura; Hombrouck, Anneleen; Maréchal, Céline; Van Gucht, Steven; Brochier, Bernard; Thomas, Isabelle; Jadoul, Michel; Goubau, Patrick",Nephrol Dial Transplant,92,22

Using 508 ESCC genomes, we identified five novel significantly mutated genes and uncovered mutational signature clusters associated with metastasis and patients’ outcomes. Several functional assays implicated that NFE2L2 may act as a tumor suppressor in ESCC and that mutations in NFE2L2 probably impaired its tumor-suppressive function, or even conferred oncogenic activities. Additionally, we found that the NFE2L2 mutations were significantly associated with worse prognosis of ESCC. We also identified potential noncoding driver mutations including hotspot mutations in the promoter region of SLC35E2 that were correlated with worse survival. Approximately 5.9% and 15.2% of patients had high tumor mutation burden or actionable mutations, respectively, and may benefit from immunotherapy or targeted therapies. We found clinically relevant coding and noncoding genomic alterations and revealed three major subtypes that robustly predicted patients’ outcomes.

Nevertheless, other genes influence the manifestations of the disease, characterized by high clinical variability even within families. We mapped modifier loci for cardiovascular and skeletal manifestations in the mg∆(loxPneo) mouse model for MFS and the synthenic loci in the human genome. Corroborating our findings, one of those loci was identified also as a modifier locus in MFS patients. Here, we investigate the HSPG2 gene, located in this region, as a candidate modifier gene for MFS. We show a correlation between Fbn1 and Hspg2 expression in spinal column and aorta in non-isogenic mg∆(loxPneo) mice. Moreover, we show that mice with severe phenotypes present lower expression of Hspg2 than those mildly affected. Thus, we propose that HSPG2 is a strong candidate modifier gene for MFS and its role in modulating disease severity should be investigated in patients.","Gerdes Gyuricza, Isabela; Barbosa de Souza, Rodrigo; Farinha-Arcieri, Luis Ernesto; Ribeiro Fernandes, Gustavo; Veiga Pereira, Lygia",Eur J Hum Genet,92,17

The mortality occurs mainly in children less than 5 years of age. No licensed vaccine is available, and conventional efforts for developing an effective and safe vaccine against shigellosis have not been succeeded yet. The reverse vaccinology is a novel promising method that screens genome or proteome of an organism for finding new vaccine candidates. In this study, through reverse vaccinology approach, new vaccine candidates against Shigella flexneri were identified and experimentally evaluated. Proteomes of S. flexneri were obtained from UniProt, and then outer membrane and extracellular proteins were predicted and selected for the evaluation of transmembrane domains, protein conservation, host homology, antigenicity, and solubility. From 103 proteins, 7 high-scored proteins were introduced as novel vaccine candidates, and after B- and T-cell epitope prediction, the best protein was selected for experimental studies. Recombinant protein was expressed, purified, and injected to BALB/c mice. The adhesion inhibitory effect of sera was also studied. The immunized mice demonstrated full protection against the lethal dose challenge. The sera remarkably inhibited S. flexneri adhesion to Caco-2 epithelial cells. The results indicate that identified antigen can serve for vaccine development against shigellosis and support reverse vaccinology for discovering novel effective antigens. KEY POINTS: • Seven Shigella new antigens were identified by reverse vaccinology (RV) approach. • The best antigen experimented demonstrated full protection against lethal dose. • In vivo results verified RV analyses and suggest FimG as a new potent vaccine candidate.

Immunoglobulin superantigens (e.g., protein A of Staphylococcus aureus and protein L of Peptostreptococcus magnus) bind to the variable regions of either the heavy (V(H)3) or light chain (κ) of IgE. IL-33 is a cytokine expressed by epithelial cells that exerts pleiotropic functions in the lung. The present study investigated whether immunoglobulin superantigens protein A and protein L and IL-33 caused the release of inflammatory (histamine), angiogenic (VEGF-A) and lymphangiogenic (VEGF-C) factors from HLMCs. The results show that protein A and protein L induced the rapid (30 min) release of preformed histamine from HLMCs. By contrast, IL-33 did not induce the release of histamine from lung mast cells. Prolonged incubation (12 h) of HLMCs with superantigens and IL-33 induced the release of VEGF-A and VEGF-C. Preincubation with IL-33 potentiated the superantigenic release of histamine, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors from HLMCs. Our results suggest that IL-33 might enhance the inflammatory, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic activities of lung mast cells in pulmonary disorders.","Cristinziano, Leonardo; Poto, Remo; Criscuolo, Gjada; Ferrara, Anne Lise; Galdiero, Maria Rosaria; Modestino, Luca; Loffredo, Stefania; de Paulis, Amato; Marone, Gianni; Spadaro, Giuseppe; Varricchi, Gilda",Cells,92,27

Guidelines provide class-I recommendations on the prescription, but there are little data on the actual prescription practices. Our study provides insight into the prescription of medication among patients with PAD in the Netherlands and reports a ‘real-world’ patient journey through primary and secondary care. DESIGN: We conducted a cohort study among patients newly diagnosed with PAD between 2010 and 2014. SETTING: Data were obtained from the PHARMO Database Network, a population-based network of electronic pharmacy, primary and secondary healthcare setting records in the Netherlands. The source population for this study comprised almost 1 million individuals. PARTICIPANTS: ‘Newly diagnosed’ was defined as a recorded International Classification of Primary Care code for PAD, a PAD-specific WCIA examination code or a diagnosis recorded as free text episode in the general practitioner records with no previous PAD diagnosis record and no prescription of P2Y12 inhibitors or aspirin the preceding year. The patient journey was defined by at least 1 year of database history and follow-up relative to the index date. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2014, we identified 3677 newly diagnosed patients with PAD. Most patients (91%) were diagnosed in primary care. Almost half of all patients (49%) had no APT dispensing record. Within this group, 33% received other anticoagulant therapy (vitamin K antagonist or direct oral anticoagulant). Mono-APT was dispensed as aspirin (40% of patients) or P2Y12 inhibitors (2.5% of patients). Dual APT combining aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor was dispensed to 8.5% of the study population. CONCLUSION: Half of all patients with newly diagnosed PAD are not treated conforming to (international) guideline recommendations on thromboembolism prevention through APT. At least 33% of all patients with newly diagnosed PAD do not receive any antithrombotic therapy. Evaluation and improvement of APT prescription and thereby improved prevention of (secondary) cardiovascular events is warranted.","Brand, Aarent RT; Houben, Eline; Bezemer, Irene D; Visseren, Frank L J; Bots, Michiel L; Herings, Ron MC; de Borst, Gert-Jan",BMJ Open,92,1

IVIg treatment usually leads to rapid improvement and is generally safe, but does not seem to lead to long-term remissions. Corticosteroids act more slowly and are associated with more side effects, but may induce long-term remissions. The hypothesis of this study is that combined IVIg and corticosteroid induction treatment will lead to more frequent long-term remissions than IVIg treatment alone. METHODS: An international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, in adults with ‘probable’ or ‘definite’ CIDP according to the EFNS/PNS 2010 criteria. Three groups of patients are included: (1) treatment naïve, (2) known CIDP patients with a relapse after > 1 year without treatment, and (3) patients with CIDP who improved within 3 months after a single course of IVIg, who subsequently deteriorate at any interval without having received additional treatment. Patients are randomised to receive 7 courses of IVIg and 1000 mg intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) (in sodium chloride 0.9%) or IVIg and placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%), every 3 weeks for 18 weeks. IVIg treatment consists of a loading dose of 2 g/kg (over 3–5 days) followed by 6 courses of IVIg 1/g/kg (over 1–2 days). The primary outcome is remission at 1 year, defined as improvement in disability from baseline, sustained between week 18 and week 52 without further treatment. Secondary outcomes include changes in disability, impairment, pain, fatigue, quality of life, care use and costs and (long-term) safety. DISCUSSION: In case of superiority of the combined treatment, patients will experience the advantages of two proven efficacious treatments, namely rapid improvement due to IVIg and long-term remission due to corticosteroids. Long-term remission would reduce the need for maintenance IVIg treatment and may decrease health care costs. Additionally, we expect that the combined treatment leads to a higher proportion of patients with improvement as some patients who do not respond to IVIg will respond to corticosteroids. Risks of short and long-term additional adverse events of the combined treatment need to be assessed. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN registry ISRCTN15893334.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a random sample of 1000,000 individuals from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 3725 patients newly diagnosed with SSHL between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2009, and propensity score matching according to age, sex, index year, comorbidities, and medications was used to select the comparison group of 11,175 patients without SSHL. Participants were stratified by age (<65 and ≧65 years) and sex for the subgroup analyses. The outcome of interest was all cause dementia (ICD-9-CM codes 290.0, 290.4, 294.1, 331.0). Both groups were followed up until December 31, 2010, for diagnoses of dementia. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of dementia. RESULTS: During the average 5-year follow-up period, the incidence rate of dementia in the SSHL cohort was 6.5 per 1000 person-years compared with 5.09 per 10,000 person-years in the comparison group. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with SSHL were 1.39 times more likely to develop dementia than those without SSHL (95% confidence interval = 1.13–1.71). When stratified by patients’ age and sex, the incidence of dementia was 1.34- and 1.64-fold higher in patients with SSHL aged ≥65 years (P = .013) and in women (P = .001), respectively, compared with the comparison group. Women with SSHL who were < 65 years old had the highest risk (2.14, 95% CI = 1.17–4.11, P = .022). In addition, a log-rank test revealed that patients with SSHL had significantly higher cumulative incidence of dementia than those without SSHL (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SSHL, especially women aged < 65 years, were associated with higher risk of dementia than those without SSHL. Thus, clinicians managing patients with SSHL should be aware of the increased risk of dementia.","Tai, Shu-Yu; Shen, Cheng-Ting; Wang, Ling-Feng; Chien, Chen-Yu",BMC Neurol,92,1

Selected microRNAs were then evaluated by the Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy feature selection method, resulting in a feature list, which were fed into the incremental feature selection method to identify candidate circulating extracellular microRNA for cancer recognition and classification. A series of quantitative classification rules was also established for such cancer classification, thereby providing a solid research foundation for further biomarker exploration and functional analyses of tumorigenesis at the level of circulating extracellular microRNA.","Yuan, Fei; Li, Zhandong; Chen, Lei; Zeng, Tao; Zhang, Yu-Hang; Ding, Shijian; Huang, Tao; Cai, Yu-Dong",Front Genet,92,17

However, there are limited studies in pediatrics, particularly neonates. The CRP/albumin (CRP/ALB) ratio is often associated with higher mortality, organ failure and prolonged hospital stay. We hypothesized that the serum CRP/ALB ratio has a prognostic value in predicting surgery and mortality in neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). METHODS: Retrospective review of all neonates with clinical and radiological evidence of non-perforated NEC that were treated in a tertiary-level referral hospital between 2009 and 2018. General patient demographics, laboratory parameters and outcomes were recorded. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to evaluated optimal cut-offs and area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: A total of 191 neonates were identified. Of these, 103 (53.9%) were born at ≤ 28 weeks of gestation and 101 (52.9%) had a birth weight of ≤ 1000 g. Eighty-four (44.0%) patients underwent surgical intervention for NEC. The overall survival rate was 161/191 (84.3%). A CRP/ALB ratio of ≥ 3 on day 2 of NEC diagnosis was associated with a statistically significant higher likelihood for surgery [AUC 0.71 (95% CI 0.63–0.79); p < 0.0001] and mortality [AUC 0.66 (95% CI 0.54–0.77); p = 0.0150], respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A CRP/ALB ratio of ≥ 3 on day 2 is indicative of a critical pathway in neonates with radiologically confirmed, non-perforated NEC. This could be used as an additional criterion to guide parental counselling in NEC for surgical intervention and mortality.","Mohd Amin, Amir T.; Zaki, Rafdzah A.; Friedmacher, Florian; Sharif, Shazia P.",Pediatr Surg Int,92,1

Understanding the genetic diversity of Map in Australia will assist epidemiological studies for tracking disease transmission and identify subtype characteristics for use in development of improved diagnostic typing methods. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 351 Map isolates and compared different subtyping methods to assess their suitability for use in diagnostics and accuracy. RESULTS: SNP-based phylogenetic analysis of 228 Australian isolates and 123 publicly available international isolates grouped Type S and Type C strains into two distinct lineages. Type C strains were highly monomorphic with only 20 SNP differences separating them. Type S strains, when aligned separately to the Telford strain, fell into two distinct clades: The first clade contained seven international isolates while the second clade contained one international isolate from Scotland and all 59 Australian isolates. The Australian Type B strain clustered with US bison strains. IS1311 PCR and Restriction Enzyme Analysis (REA) intermittently generated incorrect results when compared to Long Sequence Polymorphism (LSP) analysis, whole genome SNP-based phylogenetic analysis, IS1311 sequence alignment and average nucleotide identity (ANI). These alternative methods generated consistent Map typing results. A published SNP based assay for genotyping Map was found to be unsuitable for differentiating between Australian and international strain types of Map. CONCLUSION: This is the first phylogenetic analysis of Australian Map isolates. The Type C lineage was highly monomorphic, and the Type S lineage clustered all Australian isolates into one clade with a single Scottish sheep strain. The Australian isolate classified as Type B by IS1311 PCR and REA is likely to be descended from bison and most closely related to US bison strains.

In sepsis-induced encephalopathy or acute brain injury the use of protective ventilation has not been widely investigated (experimentally or clinically). We hypothesized that protective ventilation would attenuate cerebral inflammation in a porcine endotoxemic sepsis model. The aim of the study was to study the effect of tidal volume on cerebral inflammatory response, cerebral metabolism and brain injury. Nine animals received protective mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 mL × kg(−1) and nine animals were ventilated with a tidal volume of 10 mL × kg(−1). During a 6-h experiment, the pigs received an endotoxin intravenous infusion of 0.25 µg × kg(−1) × h(−1). Systemic, superior sagittal sinus and jugular vein blood samples were analysed for inflammatory cytokines and S100B. Intracranial pressure, brain tissue oxygenation and brain microdialysis were sampled every hour. RESULTS: No differences in systemic or sagittal sinus levels of TNF-α or IL-6 were seen between the groups. The low tidal volume group had increased cerebral blood flow (p < 0.001) and cerebral oxygen delivery (p < 0.001), lower cerebral vascular resistance (p < 0.05), higher cerebral metabolic rate (p < 0.05) along with higher cerebral glucose consumption (p < 0.05) and lactate production (p < 0.05). Moreover, low tidal volume ventilation increased the levels of glutamate (p < 0.01), glycerol (p < 0.05) and showed a trend towards higher lactate to pyruvate ratio (p = 0.08) in cerebral microdialysate as well as higher levels of S-100B (p < 0.05) in jugular venous plasma compared with medium–high tidal volume ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the hypothesis, protective ventilation did not affect inflammatory cytokines.

Genomic aberrations, together with changes in the epigenomic profile, elicit a shift in cellular signaling response and a transcriptional reprograming in pancreatic tumors. This endows them with malignant attributes that enable them to not only overcome chemotherapeutic challenges, but to also attain diverse oncogenic properties. In fact, certain genetic amplifications elicit a rewiring of calcium signaling, which can confer ER stress resistance to tumors while also aberrantly activating known drivers of oncogenic programs such as NFAT. While calcium is a well-known second messenger, the transcriptional programs driven by aberrant calcium signaling remain largely undescribed in pancreatic cancer. In this review, we focus on calcium-dependent signaling and its role in epigenetic programs and transcriptional regulation. We also briefly discuss genetic aberration events, exemplifying how genetic alterations can rewire cellular signaling cascades, including calcium-dependent ones.","Kutschat, Ana P.; Johnsen, Steven A.; Hamdan, Feda H.",Cells,92,17

The study aims to formalize the concept of individualized MV strategy with finite mixture modeling (FMM) and dynamic treatment regime (DTR). METHODS: ARF patients requiring MV for over 48 h from 2008 to 2019 were included. FMM was conducted to identify classes of ARF. Static and dynamic mechanical power (MP_static and MP_dynamic) and relevant clinical variables were calculated/collected from hours 0 to 48 at an interval of 8 h. [Formula: see text] was calculated as the difference between actual and optimal MP. FINDINGS: A total of 8768 patients were included for analysis with a mortality rate of 27%. FFM identified three classes of ARF, namely, the class 1 (baseline), class 2 (critical) and class 3 (refractory respiratory failure). The effect size of MP_static on mortality is the smallest in class 1 (HR for every 5 Joules/min increase: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.45; p < 0.001) and the largest in class 3 (HR for every 5 Joules/min increase: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.52 to 2.20; p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: MP has differing therapeutic effects for subtypes of ARF. Optimal MP estimated by DTR model may help to improve survival outcome.

Extensive research has described the provision and optimal timing of tracheostomy, but very little describes tracheostomy utilization in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This prospective cohort study describes patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary hospital in Malawi who received tracheostomy versus those who did not, with a primary outcome of hospital mortality. We performed subgroup analysis of patients with severe head injuries. RESULTS: The analysis included 451 patients admitted to the study ICU between September 2016 and July 2018. Overall hospital mortality was 40% for patients who received tracheostomy and 63% for patients who did not. Logistic regression modeling revealed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.34 (95% CI 0.18–0.64) for hospital mortality among patients who received tracheostomy versus those who did not (p < 0.001). Standardized mortality ratio weighting revealed an odds ratio of 0.81 (95% CI 0.65–0.99, p < 0.001) for hospital death among patients who received tracheostomy versus those who did not. In the subgroup excluding severe head injury, both ICU (50%) and hospital mortality (75%) were higher overall, but hospital mortality was not more common for patients with tracheostomy versus without (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.94–1.74, p = 0.104). CONCLUSIONS: Tracheostomy is not associated with hospital mortality in a Malawi ICU cohort, but these results are affected by the presence of head injury. Research may focus on home tracheostomy care given the lack of hospital discharge options for patients in austere settings.

Anaesthetising and immobilising entangled seals does not allow for selection of animals that are at a safe distance from the water’s edge. Medetomidine-midazolam-butorphanol (MMB) sedation was trialled on eight entangled Cape fur seals (CFS) (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) to determine if it was safe to use on animals that entered the water post-darting. The MMB was given at an estimated dose of 0.03 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, via remote darting. Sedation was reversed with intramuscular atipamezole (0.15 mg/kg) and naltrexone (0.4 mg/kg) to antagonise the effects of medetomidine and butorphanol, respectively. Moderate sedation was achieved in six animals. Six of the animals entered the water after being darted. There was a single mortality and a single animal that was too lightly sedated for capture. The preliminary results indicate that MMB produces suitable sedation for disentanglement of CFS. Additionally, MMB might be suitable for application to field-based biological research.","Gardner, Brett R.; Spolander, Brandon; Seakamela, S.

This local paracrine GLP-1 signalling seems to be specifically involved in the perception of sweets. However, the role of GLP-1 in taste perception remains largely unaddressed in clinical studies. Whether any weight-reducing effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists are mediated through the modulation of taste perception is currently unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an investigator-initiated, randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. We will enrol 30 women with obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either semaglutide 1.0 mg or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary endpoints are alteration of transcriptomic profile of tongue tissue as changes in expression level from baseline to follow-up after 16 weeks of treatment, measured by RNA sequencing, and change in taste sensitivity as detected by chemical gustometry. Secondary endpoints include change in neural response to visual food cues and to sweet-tasting substances as assessed by functional MRI, change in body weight, change in fat mass and change in eating behaviour and food intake. DISCUSSION: This is the first study to investigate the role of semaglutide on taste perception, along with a neural response to visual food cues in reward processing regions. The study may identify the tongue and the taste perception as a novel target for GLP-1 receptor agonists. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATIONS: The study has been approved by the Slovene National Medical Ethics Committee and will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

Although the consensus white paper suggests that a minimum of 5 min of data are needed for assessing dynamic cerebral autoregulation with transfer function analysis (TFA), it remains unknown if the length of these data is valid for patients in the neuro-ICU, of whom are notably different than the general populations. We aimed to investigate the effect of data length using transcranial Doppler ultrasound combined with invasive blood pressure measurement for the assessment of dynamic cerebral autoregulation in patients in the neuro-ICU. METHODS: Twenty patients with various clinical conditions (severe acute encephalitis, ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, brain injury, cerebrovascular intervention operation, cerebral hemorrhage, intracranial space-occupying lesion, and toxic encephalopathy) were recruited for this study. Continuous invasive blood pressure, with a pressure catheter placed at the radial artery, and bilateral continuous cerebral blood flow velocity with transcranial Doppler ultrasound were simultaneously recorded for a length of 10 min for each patient. TFA was applied to derive phase shift, gain, and coherence function at all frequency bands from the first 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 min of the 10-min recordings in each patient on both hemispheres. The variability in the autoregulatory parameters in each hemisphere was investigated by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Forty-one recordings (82 hemispheres) were included in the study. According to the critical values of coherence provided by the Cerebral Autoregulation Research Network white paper, acceptable rates for the data were 100% with a length ≥ 7 min. The final analysis included 68 hemispheres. The effects of data length on trends in phase shift in the very low frequency (VLF) band (F(1.801,120.669) = 6.321, P = 0.003), in the LF band (F(1.274,85.343) = 4.290, P = 0.032), and in the HF band (F(1.391,93.189) = 3.868, P = 0.039) were significant for 3–7 min, for 4–7 min, and for 5–8 min, respectively. Effects were also significant on the gain in the VLF band (F(1.927,129.134) = 3.215, P = 0.045) for 2–8 min and on the coherence function in all frequency bands (VLF F(2.846,190.671) = 90.247, P < 0.001, LF F(2.515,168.492) = 55.770, P < 0.001, HF F(2.411, 161.542) = 33.833, P < 0.001) for 2–10 min. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the acceptable rates for the data and the variation in the TFA variables (phase shift and gain), we recommend recording data for a minimum length of 7 min for TFA in patients in the neuro-ICU.","Zhang, Weijun; Lu, Hongji; Zhang, Pandeng; Mo, Xiuyun; Ou, Aihua; Liu, Jia; Zhong, Jingxin",Neurocrit Care,92,22

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate and iteratively refine the acceptability and usability of a web-based exercise intervention (ExerciseGuide) for men with metastatic prostate cancer and determine how well individuals can replicate the video-based exercise prescription. METHODS: A laboratory-based multi-methods design was used, incorporating questionnaires, think-aloud tests, interviews, and movement screening among 11 men aged 63 to 82 years with metastatic prostate cancer. Overall, 9 participants were undergoing androgen deprivation therapy, and 2 were completing chemotherapy. Data were collected in two waves, with changes made for quality improvement after participant 5. RESULTS: The intervention’s usability score was deemed moderate overall but improved after modifications (from 60, SD 2.9 to 69.6, SD 2.2 out of 100). Overall, the participants found the intervention acceptable, with scores improving from wave 1 (24.2, SD 1.1 out of 30) to wave 2 (26.3, SD 2.1 out of 30). The personalized multimodal exercise prescription and computer-tailored education were seen as valuable. After wave 1, website navigation videos were added, medical terminology was simplified, and a telehealth component was included after expert real-time telehealth support was requested. Wave 2 changes included the added variety for aerobic exercise modes, reduced computer-tailoring question loads, and improved consistency of style and grammar. Finally, the participants could replicate the resistance exercise videos to a satisfactory level as judged by the movement screen; however, additional technique cueing within the videos is recommended to address safety concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The acceptability and usability of ExerciseGuide were deemed satisfactory. Various problems were identified and resolved. Notably, the participants requested the inclusion of personalized expert support through telehealth. The resistance training algorithms were shown to provide appropriate content safely, and the users could replicate the exercise technique unaided to a satisfactory level. This study has optimized the ExerciseGuide intervention for further investigation in this population.

Training about it has not been standardized in fellowship programs. This study was aimed at evaluating the education and knowledge of gastroenterology fellows about EMR of colorectal adenomas. Methods Participation in this survey was offered to 1730 gastroenterology fellows in the United States during the academic year 2019 to 2020. The survey assessed endoscopic mucosal resection training and knowledge and was approved and administered by the American College of Gastroenterology. Results A total of 163 fellows (9.4 %) completed the survey. Only 85 fellows (52.1 %) reported receiving formal education in endoscopic mucosal resection. Fellow confidence was lowest regarding knowing electrosurgery unit settings. Fewer fellows correctly identified Paris 0-IIb (79, 48.5 %; P < 0.0001) or NICE I (114, 69.9 %; P < 0.01) lesions as compared to other Paris and NICE III lesions, respectively. Only 73 (44.8 %) and 93 fellows (57.1 %) arranged steps of EMR in the correct order and identified the correct type of current used for resection, respectively. Training year, male sex, and provision of advanced endoscopy rotations during fellowship were associated with a higher knowledge score for EMR. Conclusions Nearly half of all fellows reported no formal education in EMR and incorrectly ordered its steps. Adenoma assessment by Paris and NICE classifications and electrosurgery unit settings were the most prominent knowledge deficiencies. Incorporation of standardized training about EMR with inclusion of advanced endoscopy rotations appears to be an important educational opportunity during gastroenterology fellowship.","Garg, Shashank; Inamdar, Sumant; Tharian, Benjamin; Muniraj, Thiruvengadam; Aslanian, Harry R.",Endosc Int Open,92,1

Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial in the generation of autoimmunity. Here, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review on the relationship between DC and APS. We performed a literature search of PubMed as of 26 March 2021. A total of 33 articles were extracted. DCs are pivotal in inducing inflammatory responses and orchestrating adaptive immunity. DCs contribute to the local inflammation regarding vascular thrombosis or obstetrical complications. Both B2GPI and antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) can promote antigen presentation by DCs and the generation or maintenance of autoimmunity. In addition, plasmacytoid DC activation is enhanced by aPL, thereby augmenting the inflammatory response. In line with these findings, DC modulation appears promising as a future treatment for APS. In conclusion, our review indicated the crucial role of DCs in the pathogenesis of APS. Deeper understanding of the complex relationship would help in developing new treatment strategies.","Tang, Kuo-Tung; Chen, Hsin-Hua; Chen, Tzu-Ting; Bracci, Nicole R.; Lin, Chi-Chien",Life (Basel),92,1

Herein, we describe HIV-associated morbidity among hospitalised HIV/AIDS patients with advanced immunosuppression and assess the comorbidities, laboratory parameters, and immunological markers associated with mortality. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the Fundação de Medicina Tropical Doutor Heitor Vieira Dourado (FMT-HVD) in Manaus, Brazil. In all, 83 participants aged between 12 and 70 years were enrolled by convenience within 72 h of their hospitalisation. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained from electronic medical records. We prospectively measured the cytokines Th1/Th2/Th17 and inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-12 using cytometric bead array, and the soluble CD14 using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The HIV/AIDS inpatients presented a scenario of respiratory syndromes as the most prevalent comorbidity. Almost all patients had CD4 T counts below 350 cells/mL and the mortality rate was 20.5%. Pulmonary tuberculosis, neurotoxoplasmosis and oropharyngeal–esophageal candidiasis were the most prevalent opportunistic infections. TB and weight loss were more prevalent in HIV/AIDS inpatients who died. The Mann Whitney analysis showed that those who died had higher platelet distribution width (PDW) on admission, which is suggestive for platelet activation. The Poisson multivariate analysis showed the prevalence of TB, digestive syndrome and increases in IL-8 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated to death. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced immunosuppression characterized by the opportunistic infections presented in these HIV/AIDS inpatients was the major factor of mortality. The role of platelet activation in worse outcomes of hospitalisation and the IL-8 associated with the context of advanced immunosuppression may be promising markers in the prediction of mortality in HIV/AIDS patients.","Gama, Wellington Mota; Frank, Carlos Henrique Michiles; Almeida, Taynná Vernalha Rocha; dos Santos, Daniel Silva; Chaves, Yury Oliveira; da Silva, Danielle Furtado; Orlandi, Patrícia Puccinelli; Pereira, Flávio Ribeiro; Magalhães, Gleicienne Feliz; Baptista, Bárbara Jóse; de Oliveira Silva, Viviane Lago; da Silva Balieiro, Antônio Alcirley; Santana, Monique Freire; Gonçalves, Roberta Lins; da Costa, Allyson Guimarães; dos Santos, Marcelo Cordeiro; de Lima Ferreira, Luís Carlos; Lacerda, Marcus Vinicius Guimaraes; Nogueira, Paulo Afonso",BMC Infect Dis,92,19

OBJECTIVE: To describe rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital death by race and ethnicity over 10 influenza seasons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used data from the Influenza-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), which conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in selected counties, representing approximately 9% of the US population. Influenza hospitalizations from the 2009 to 2010 season to the 2018 to 2019 season were analyzed. Data were analyzed from October 2020 to July 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were age-adjusted and age-stratified rates of influenza-associated hospitalization, ICU admission, and in-hospital death by race and ethnicity overall and by influenza season. RESULTS: Among 113 352 persons with an influenza-associated hospitalization (34 436 persons [32.0%] aged ≥75 years; 61 009 [53.8%] women), 70 225 persons (62.3%) were non-Hispanic White (White), 24 850 persons (21.6%) were non-Hispanic Black (Black), 11 903 persons (10.3%) were Hispanic, 5517 persons (5.1%) were non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander, and 857 persons (0.7%) were non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native. Among persons aged younger than 75 years and compared with White persons of the same ages, Black persons were more likely to be hospitalized (eg, age 50-64 years: rate ratio [RR], 2.50 95% CI, 2.43-2.57) and to be admitted to an ICU (eg, age 50-64 years: RR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.96-2.23). Among persons aged younger than 50 years and compared with White persons of the same ages, American Indian or Alaska Native persons were more likely to be hospitalized (eg, age 18-49 years: RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.51-1.96) and to be admitted to an ICU (eg, age 18-49 years: RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.40-2.42). Among children aged 4 years or younger and compared with White children, hospitalization rates were higher in Black children (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 2.10-2.33), Hispanic children (RR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.77-1.97), American Indian or Alaska Native children (RR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.55-3.53), and Asian or Pacific Islander children (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.38), as were rates of ICU admission (Black children: RR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.43-3.09; Hispanic children: RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.73-2.23; American Indian and Alaska Native children: RR, 3.51; 95% CI, 2.45-5.05). In this age group and compared with White children, in-hospital death rates were higher among Hispanic children (RR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.23-7.19), Black children (RR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.40-8.18), and Asian or Pacific Islander children (RR, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.55-12.22). Few differences were observed in rates of severe influenza-associated outcomes by race and ethnicity among adults aged 75 years or older. For example, in this age group, compared with White adults, hospitalization rates were slightly higher only among Black adults (RR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.09). Overall, Black persons had the highest age-adjusted hospitalization rate (68.8 [95% CI, 68.0-69.7] hospitalizations per 100 000 population) and ICU admission rate (11.6 [95% CI, 11.2-11.9] admissions per 100 000 population). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found racial and ethnic disparities in rates of severe influenza-associated disease.

The versatile functions of DNMT1 rely on allosteric networks between its different interacting partners, emerging as novel therapeutic targets. In this work, based on the modeling structures of DNMT1-ubiquitylated H3 (H3Ub)/ubiquitin specific peptidase 7 (USP7) complexes, we have used a combination of elastic network models, molecular dynamics simulations, structural residue perturbation, network modeling, and pocket pathway analysis to examine their molecular mechanisms of allosteric regulation. The comparative intrinsic and conformational dynamics analysis of three DNMT1 systems has highlighted the pivotal role of the RFTS domain as the dynamics hub in both intra- and inter-molecular interactions. The site perturbation and network modeling approaches have revealed the different and more complex allosteric interaction landscape in both DNMT1 complexes, involving the events caused by mutational hotspots and post-translation modification sites through protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Furthermore, communication pathway analysis and pocket detection have provided new mechanistic insights into molecular mechanisms underlying quaternary structures of DNMT1 complexes, suggesting potential targeting pockets for PPI-based allosteric drug design.","Zhu, Yu; Ye, Fei; Zhou, Ziyun; Liu, Wanlin; Liang, Zhongjie; Hu, Guang",Molecules,92,22

In the central nervous system (CNS) Fas/FasL is involved in axonal outgrowth and adult neurogenesis. However, little is known about the role of the Fas/FasL pathway in herpes encephalitis. In this study, we used a neuropathogenic clinical strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to explore infection-induced inflammation and immune responses in the mouse brain and the role of Fas/FasL in antiviral CNS immunity. HSV-1 CNS infection induced the infiltration of Fas- FasL-bearing monocytes and T cells in the brain and also to an up-regulation of Fas and FasL expression on resident astrocytes and microglia within infected sites. Upon infection, Fas- and FasL-deficient mice (lpr and gld) were partially protected from encephalitis with a decreased morbidity and mortality compared to WT mice. Fas/FasL deficiency promoted cell-mediated immunity within the CNS. Fas receptor stimulation abrogated HSV-1 induced activation and inflammatory reactions in microglia from WT mice, while lack of Fas or FasL led to a more pronounced activation of monocytes and microglia and also to an enhanced differentiation of these cells into a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Furthermore, the specific immune system was more efficient in Fas- and FasL-deficient mice with significantly higher numbers of infiltrating HSV-1-specific cytotoxic T cells in the brain. Our data indicate that the Fas/FasL pathway leads to excessive neuroinflammation during HSV-1 infection, which is associated with a diminished anti-viral response and an excessive neuroinflammation.","Krzyzowska, Malgorzata; Kowalczyk, Andrzej; Skulska, Katarzyna; Thörn, Karolina; Eriksson, Kristina",Front Immunol,92,17

Recently, machine learning (ML) emerged as a new technology to process and identify big data relationships, enabling a new era in clinical trial design. In this study, we designed a ML model for predictively stratifying acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients, ultimately reducing the required number of patients by increasing statistical power through cohort homogeneity. From the Philips eICU Research Institute (eRI) database, no less than 51,555 ARDS patients were extracted. We defined three subpopulations by outcome: (1) rapid death, (2) spontaneous recovery, and (3) long-stay patients. A retrospective univariate analysis identified highly predictive variables for each outcome. All 220 variables were used to determine the most accurate and generalizable model to predict long-stay patients. Multiclass gradient boosting was identified as the best-performing ML model. Whereas alterations in pH, bicarbonate or lactate proved to be strong predictors for rapid death in the univariate analysis, only the multivariate ML model was able to reliably differentiate the disease course of the long-stay outcome population (AUC of 0.77). We demonstrate the feasibility of prospective patient stratification using ML algorithms in the by far largest ARDS cohort reported to date. Our algorithm can identify patients with sufficiently long ARDS episodes to allow time for patients to respond to therapy, increasing statistical power. Further, early enrollment alerts may increase recruitment rate.","Schwager, E.; Jansson, K.; Rahman, A.; Schiffer, S.; Chang, Y.; Boverman, G.; Gross, B.; Xu-Wilson, M.; Boehme, P.; Truebel, H.; Frassica, J.

In addition, the cytoplasmic AHR protein may act as an adaptor of E3 ubiquitin ligase. In this study, the physiological functions of AHR that regulate cell proliferation were explored using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The doubling-time of the AHR-KO clones of A549 and BEAS-2B was observed to be prolonged. The attenuation of proliferation potential was strongly associated with either the induction of p27(Kip1) or the impairment in mitogenic signal transduction driven by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and EGF receptor (EGFR). We found that the leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1), a repressor of EGFR, was induced in the absence of AHR in vitro and in vivo. The LRIG1 tends to degrade via a proteasome dependent manner by interacting with AHR in wild-type cells. Either LRIG1 or a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) were accumulated in AHR-defective cells, consequently accelerating the degradation of EGFR, and attenuating the response to mitogenic stimulation. We also affirmed low AHR but high LRIG1 levels in lung tissues of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. This might partially elucidate the sluggish tissue repairment and developing inflammation in COPD patients.","Hsu, Han-Lin; Chen, Hong-Kai; Tsai, Chi-Hao; Liao, Po-Lin; Chan, Yen-Ju; Lee, Yu-Cheng; Lee, Chen-Chen; Li, Ching-Hao",Int J Mol Sci,92,1

Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.","Phillips, Angela M; Lawrence, Katherine R; Moulana, Alief; Dupic, Thomas; Chang, Jeffrey; Johnson, Milo S; Cvijovic, Ivana; Mora, Thierry; Walczak, Aleksandra M; Desai, Michael M",,92,1

This study aimed to assess the level of protection against Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD), and avian infectious bronchitis (IB) afforded by current vaccination schedules and characterize the circulating virus strains in commercial poultry flocks in Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 44 commercial poultry farms in Oyo and Kano states of Nigeria. Serum and tissue samples and data on flock, clinical and vaccination records were collected on each farm. Farms were classified as being protected or not protected against ND, IBD and IB based on a defined criterion. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing was performed for each target virus on tissue samples and positive samples were sequenced. A total of 15/44 (34.1%), 35/44 (79.5%), and 1/44 (2.3%) farms were considered to be protected against ND, IBD, and IB, respectively, at the time of sampling. NDV RNA was detected on 7/44 (15.9%) farms and sequences obtained from 3/7 farms were characterized as the lentogenic strain. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) RNA was detected on 16/44 (36.4%) farms tested; very virulent (vv) IBDV and non-virulent (nv) IBDV strains were both detected in 3/16 (18.8%) positive samples. Sequences of IBDV isolates were either clustered with a group of genotype 3 virulent IBDV strains or were related to vaccine strains MB and D78 strains. IBV RNA was detected on 36/44 (81.8%) farms, with variant02, Massachusetts, 4/91, and Q1 variants detected. Sequences of IBV isolates were either clustered with the vaccines strains Massachusetts M41 and H120 or were most closely related to the D274-like strains or a clade of sequences reported in Nigeria and Niger in 2006 and 2007. This study revealed that most study farms in Oyo and Kano states did not have adequate protective antibody titers against IBV and NDV and were therefore at risk of field challenge. Infectious bursal disease virus and IBV RNA were detected on farms with a history of vaccination suggesting potential vaccination failure, or that the vaccine strains used mismatch with the circulating strains and are therefore not protective.","Ekiri, Abel B.; Armson, Bryony; Adebowale, Kehinde; Endacott, Isabella; Galipo, Erika; Alafiatayo, Ruth; Horton, Daniel L.; Ogwuche, Adah; Bankole, Olorunsola N.; Galal, Hussein M.; Maikai, Beatty-Viv; Dineva, Mariana; Wakawa, Aliyu; Mijten, Erik; Varga, Gabriel; Cook, Alasdair J.

These methods have the potential to empower youth and provide them with an accessible and welcoming environment to express and manage difficult feelings and experiences. These effects are, however, dependent on the way these methods are implemented and how potential ethical concerns are handled. OBJECTIVE: Using the current literature on arts‐based health research as a foundation, this paper examines ethical issues emerging from participatory arts methods with young people with traumatic experiences. RESULTS: We present a typology covering relevant issues such as power, accessibility, communication, trust and ownership, across the domains of partnership working, project entry, participation and dissemination. Drawing on our extensive clinical and research experiences, existing research and novel in‐practice examples, we offer guidance for ethical dilemmas that might arise at different phases of research. CONCLUSION: Adequate anticipation and consideration of ethical issues, together with the involvement of young people, will help ensure that arts methods are implemented in research and practice with young people in a fair, meaningful and empowering way.

PAH can be idiopathic, familial, or associated with a number of conditions or diseases, such as connective tissue disease. Its prognosis is poor, less than 3 yr from diagnosis. The aetiology of severe unexplained pulmonary hypertension remained largely unknown until a few years ago. The gene underlying familial PAH was identified in 2000, the BMPR-2 gene. However its mutations are not always present, and it probably does not explained the full scope of the disease. PAH is associated with structural alterations in pulmonary arteries including intimal fibrosis, medial hypertrophy and adventitial changes, pointing towards extracellular matrix remodelling which have raised the question of involvement of the matrix degrading enzymes. Among them, serine proteases, such as plasmina and endogenous vascular elastase (EVE), and matrix metalloproteases have been studied. In experimental models, the three of them are increased. Accordingly, their inhibition has preventing and in some cases therapeutic effects. However it should be stressed that opposite consequence of protease inhibition on PAH can be observed depending on the experimental model, either chronic hypoxia-induced PAH (deleterious) or toxic moncrotalin-induced PAH (positive). In humans, only sparse reports exist, that found increase in the MMP inhibitor, TIMP-1, and MMP-2 expression and decreased collagenase (MMP-1). Inflammation is part of the PAH, and accordingly, protease production is a well known part of the inflammatory response. Answering the question whether protease inhibition might represent a therapeutic option in human PAH is however certainly too early.","d’Ortho, Marie-Pia",Matrix Metalloproteinases in Tissue Remodelling and Inflammation,92,1

In this graph, vertices identify individuals and edges establish the existence of some type of relations between them. In real communities, the possible edges may be active or not for variable periods of time. These so-called temporal networks typically result from an endogenous social dynamics, usually coupled to the process under study taking place in the community. For instance, disease spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to reconsider maintaining or not their social contacts. Here we investigate the impact of such a dynamical network structure on disease dynamics, where infection occurs along the edges of the network. To this end, we define an endogenous network dynamics coupled with disease spreading. We show that the effective infectiousness of a disease taking place along the edges of this temporal network depends on the population size, the number of infected individuals in the population and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected, ultimately dictated by availability of information regarding each individual’s health status. Importantly, we also show how dynamical networks strongly decrease the average time required to eradicate a disease.","Pacheco, Jorge M.; Van Segbroeck, Sven; Santos, Francisco C.",Temporal Network Epidemiology,92,19

Cell cultures are also of dominating importance for the isolation of infectious agents in the diagnosis of virus infections. Cell cultures are established by the propagation of dispersed cells. In some cases, such cells may grow in suspension, but most often, they grow as a monolayer on the supporting material. Cultures established by cultivation of the cells that have been released from organ fragments are called primary cell cultures.

It represents each polytope by its slack matrix, the matrix obtained by evaluating each facet inequality at each vertex. Unlike the classical model, the slack model naturally mods out projective transformations. It is inherently algebraic, arising as the positive part of a variety of a saturated determinantal ideal, and provides a new computational tool to study classical realizability problems for polytopes. We introduce the package SlackIdeals for Macaulay2, that provides methods for creating and manipulating slack matrices and slack ideals of convex polytopes and matroids. Slack ideals are often difficult to compute. To improve the power of the slack model, we develop two strategies to simplify computations: we scale as many entries of the slack matrix as possible to one; we then obtain a reduced slack model combining the slack variety with the more compact Grassmannian realization space model. This allows us to study slack ideals that were previously out of computational reach. As applications, we show that the well-known Perles polytope does not admit rational realizations and prove the non-realizability of a large simplicial sphere.","Macchia, Antonio; Wiebe, Amy",Mathematical Software - ICMS 2020,92,1

We aimed to evaluate in such patients the effects of a low-to-middle extracorporeal blood flow device on both gas exchanges and dynamic hyperinflation, as well as on work of breathing (WOB) during the IMV weaning process. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Open prospective interventional study in 12 deeply sedated IMV AE-COPD patients studied before and after ECCO(2)R initiation. Gas exchange and dynamic hyperinflation were compared after stabilization without and with ECCO(2)R (Hemolung, Alung, Pittsburgh, USA) combined with a specific adjustment algorithm of the respiratory rate (RR) designed to improve arterial pH. When possible, WOB with and without ECCO(2)R was measured at the end of the weaning process. Due to study size, results are expressed as median (IQR) and a non-parametric approach was adopted. RESULTS: An improvement in PaCO(2), from 68 (63; 76) to 49 (46; 55) mmHg, p = 0.0005, and in pH, from 7.25 (7.23; 7.29) to 7.35 (7.32; 7.40), p = 0.0005, was observed after ECCO(2)R initiation and adjustment of respiratory rate, while intrinsic PEEP and Functional Residual Capacity remained unchanged, from 9.0 (7.0; 10.0) to 8.0 (5.0; 9.0) cmH(2)O and from 3604 (2631; 4850) to 3338 (2633; 4848) mL, p = 0.1191 and p = 0.3013, respectively. WOB measurements were possible in 5 patients, indicating near-significant higher values after stopping ECCO(2)R: 11.7 (7.5; 15.0) versus 22.6 (13.9; 34.7) Joules/min., p = 0.0625 and 1.1 (0.8; 1.4) versus 1.5 (0.9; 2.8) Joules/L, p = 0.0625. Three patients died in-ICU. Other patients were successfully hospital-discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Using a formalized protocol of RR adjustment, ECCO(2)R permitted to effectively improve pH and diminish PaCO(2) at the early phase of IMV in 12 AE-COPD patients, but not to diminish dynamic hyperinflation in the whole group. A trend toward a decrease in WOB was also observed during the weaning process.

The research, carried out through informal, online consultations still in progress, revealed indicative trends in the discourses of 83 Christian leaders of local communities in various Brazilian states that influence, guide, and reflect the practice of the faithful in their communities. The main motivations which the leaders emphasized when mobilizing people to care for the poor were sought and what kinds of concrete actions the churches or Christian communities have carried out under the influence of these leaders in the face of the emergency situation. Initial results showed that the impact of the pandemic generated emergency assistance mobilizations for the poor, conducted institutionally, primarily in local communities; analyzed in the light of the Weberian categories of social action, the motivations endorsed by the leaders for these mobilizations revealed that rationality has given way to tradition and emotion when dealing with a social emergency. Finally, we found that while the social criticism present in the discourses of these leaders identifies economic inequality in the structures of society and emphasizes the need for action by religious institutions, they are nonetheless still minimal in terms of alternatives for a broader mobilization that would bring about transformations in the social structures of inequality in the country.","Arruda, Glair Alonso",Int J Lat Am Relig,92,17

The data of the WeanNet register show that more than half (64%) of patients transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to a specialized weaning center could definitely be weaned from the respirator. Weaning failure was associated with prolonged ventilation prior to transfer to a weaning center, low body mass index, pre-existing neuromuscular diseases and advanced age. The number of patients with out of hospital ventilation who had to be re-hospitalized because of ventilation control or as part of emergency management quadrupled in Germany between 2006 and 2016. Invasive out-of-hospital ventilation and long-term noninvasive ventilation are associated with a significant loss of autonomy and with low quality of life. Therefore, the initiation must be carefully reviewed and regularly re-evaluated in the context of patient comorbidities and, if necessary, decisions should be made with respect to changing treatment targets. Specialized weaning centers have been established for patients in whom weaning on the ICU was unsuccessful. In cases of persisting weaning failure the adequate transition to out-of-hospital ventilation should be managed by a weaning unit. Weaning centers are responsible for outpatient invasive or noninvasive ventilation strategies and control of treatment quality. Depending on the infrastructure and networking of the respective weaning center, it is basically also possible to provide outpatient care for clinically stable patients in a cooperation model together with pulmonologists in private practice experienced in respiratory medicine.","Fricke, K.; Schönhofer, B.",Pneumologe (Berl),92,1

For example, contains (value) methods of key-value maps may iterate through key-value entries without blocking concurrent updates, to avoid unwanted performance bottlenecks, and consequently overlook the effects of some linearization-order predecessors. While such weakly-consistent operations may not be atomic, they still offer guarantees, e.g., only observing values that have been present. In this work we develop a methodology for proving that concurrent object implementations adhere to weak-consistency specifications. In particular, we consider (forward) simulation-based proofs of implementations against relaxed-visibility specifications, which allow designated operations to overlook some of their linearization-order predecessors, i.e., behaving as if they never occurred. Besides annotating implementation code to identify linearization points, i.e., points at which operations’ logical effects occur, we also annotate code to identify visible operations, i.e., operations whose effects are observed; in practice this annotation can be done automatically by tracking the writers to each accessed memory location. We formalize our methodology over a general notion of transition systems, agnostic to any particular programming language or memory model, and demonstrate its application, using automated theorem provers, by verifying models of Java concurrent object implementations.","Krishna, Siddharth; Emmi, Michael; Enea, Constantin; Jovanović, Dejan",Programming Languages and Systems,92,8

Conversely, social participation has mental and physical health benefits (Novek et al., 2013). In light of the current Covid-19 pandemic requiring social distancing, the present study examined whether living situation and ability to access information about social activities are associated with older adults’ loneliness during the pandemic. Specifically, we surveyed ninety-one adults aged 60 years or older in May and June of 2020, at a time when social distancing measures were still in place. We tested whether their living situation and having access to information about social activities was associated with loneliness. OLS regression analyses revealed living alone was associated with higher loneliness (b = .43, p = .050); and having access to information about social activities was associated with lower loneliness (b = -.18, p = .027) amidst the pandemic. The analyses controlled for participants’ age, gender, and education. Our findings highlight that during Covid-19, older adults’ living situation and access to information about social activities matter and may impact their social behavior. Thus, at this difficult time, it is recommended organizations that offer social activities find creative ways to reach those living alone who will benefit most from having access to such activities.","Parker, Patti; Menec, Verena; Newall, Nancy",Innov Aging,92,1

Identifying hospitalized patients at high mortality risk is critical for triage and health-care resource management regionally, nationally, and globally. We present a retrospective analysis of predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Electronic health records (EHR) of patients admitted between March 1 and April 18, 2020 to St. Luke’s University Hospital with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 were reviewed for medical co-morbidities and initial biochemical/inflammatory markers. Survivors vs non-survivors were compared using χ (2) test, Student’s t-test, and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify candidate variables for multivariate analysis, which were then included in stepwise backward logistic regression. Statistical analyses were done on SPSS v26 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: Clinical characteristics, biochemical abnormalities and results of univariate regression in our cohort of 560 patients are noted in table 1. Multivariate regression revealed age, congestive heart failure (CHF), and creatinine≥ 1.5 mg/dl as significant predictors of mortality while race (Caucasian), vascular disease, lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin approached significance (Table 2).

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We present one of the largest cohorts to date of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Age, CHF, and renal disease were significant independent predictors of mortality. Though several inflammatory markers (d-dimer, CRP, procalcitonin) initially predicted mortality, they failed in multivariate analysis, questioning their role in risk-stratifying COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Interestingly, IL-6 used in those severely ill patients to assess candidacy for IL-6 inhibitor therapy (Tocilizumab) failed to predict mortality in our study. Our analysis was limited due to its retrospective nature and unfortunately large amounts of data were missing for some variables (ESR, BNP, IL-6 levels). The missing data was due to rapidly evolving institutional protocols early during the pandemic, leading to non-uniform assessment of these markers.

BSS have known a rampant growth during recent years, through technological advances, re-evaluated business models and reinvention of the mean’s utility. Yet, for a realized use of dockless BSS and a successful integration in the urban mobility ecosystem to be achieved, the factors that promote willingness to use them need to be explored. By using a sample of 500 stated preference data, classification trees and random forest models are built for three groups of potential BSS users; car users, bus users and pedestrians. Among the considered factors are BSS cost gains, BSS In Vehicle Time (IVT) and Out of Vehicle Time (OVT) gains, trip frequency, purpose and duration. More specific, it was found that BSS potential, increases for short duration trips of up to 21 min for car users. Bus users and pedestrians were found to be more likely to choose a BSS option for a higher cost up to 0,60 and 0,75 euros respectively. On the other side sociodemographic characteristics such as household income, gender, education level and occupation did not found to be the dominant factors for the mode choice decision. OVT is found only to be relatively important for bus users, while the cost gains are comparatively more significant for bus users and pedestrians.","Politis, Ioannis; Fyrogenis, Ioannis; Papadopoulos, Efthymis; Nikolaidou, Anastasia; Verani, Eleni",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,92,7

School social workers also engage in social justice work and advocate for the needs of their clients. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on a plethora of systemic inequities and challenges that impact the lives of young people and their families, particularly as they relate to schools and education. During the COVID-19 pandemic, schools have relied on the expertise, leadership, and skills of social workers to address multiple issues such as access to technology, food insecurity, services for students with disabilities, mental health support, and crisis intervention. This chapter describes the experiences of three school social workers in different high school settings: a public school, a charter school, and a school-based non-profit program. Macro-, mezzo-, and micro-level factors will be examined as they relate to school-based interventions in response to a national health crisis. Recommendations for clinical interventions in different school organizational systems in a time of crisis will also be discussed.","Sedillo-Hamann, Dayna; Chock-Goldman, Jessica; Badillo, Marina A.","Shared Trauma, Shared Resilience During a Pandemic",92,1

These properties of MSCs have seen them used in various clinical trials to treat various human diseases. Recently, MSCs have been utilized as a factory of cells to produce and secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), as it has been shown that MSC-derived EVs may carry part of the therapeutic effects of their parent cells. Obviously, this is advantageous as it would be mean that cell-free therapies laced with the therapeutic effects of MSCs could be possible. EVs can be termed as apoptotic bodies, microvesicle bodies, or exosomes, depending on their size. Interestingly and unsurprisingly, as it is common knowledge in the field that MSCs respond differently depending on their microenvironment, it has been found that MSCs can be pre-conditioned to produce and secrete EVs with different therapeutic properties. Herein, recent findings highlighting the therapeutic potential of MSC-derived EVs will be discussed, specifically MSC-derived exosomes.","Abomaray, Fawaz",Role of Exosomes in Biological Communication Systems,92,1

The main measures to combat it had (and still have) a huge impact on the daily lives of citizens. This investigation aimed to identify and monitor the population's perceptions about how it faced this period and the impact on health, well-being, and daily life. In this study, we describe the main trends observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of mental health status, confidence in the capacity of the health services to respond to the pandemic, and the use of health services by participants. The online survey collected responses from 171,947 individuals ≥16 years of age in Portugal, over a period of 15 weeks that started on 21 March 2020. Participants could fill the questionnaire once or weekly, which enabled us to analyse trends and variations in responses. Overall, 81% of the respondents reported having felt agitated, anxious, or sad during the COVID-19 pandemic; 19% did not experience these feelings. During the confinement period, the proportion of participants feeling agitated, anxious, or sad every day/almost every day ranged between 20 and 30%, but since the deconfinement this proportion decreased. Around 30% reported having more difficulty getting to sleep or to sleep all night; 28.4% felt more agitated; 25.5% felt sadder, discouraged, or cried more easily; and 24.7% felt unable to do everything they had to do, women more frequently than men. Overall, 65.8% of the participants reported feeling confident or very confident in the health services' capacity to respond to the challenges associated with the pandemic, and this confidence increased over time. Concerning the people who needed a consultation, 35.6% had one in person and 20.8% had one remotely, but almost 44% did not have one due to cancellation by the service (27.2%) or their own decision not to go (16.3%). At this unusual time in which we find ourselves and based on our findings, it is essential to continue monitoring how the population is facing the different phases of the pandemic until it officially ends. Analysing the effects of the pandemic from the point of view of citizens allows for anticipating critical trends and can contribute to preventative action.","Pedro, Ana Rita; Gama, Ana; Soares, Patrícia; Moniz, Marta; Laires, Pedro A.; Dias, Sónia",,92,1

The first and maybe the crucial step of resilience management is known as resilience analysis. However, there are many obstacles in front of the analyzers to analyze the resilience of systems. One of these obstacles is precise resilience data accessibility. Conventional resilience analysis methods frequently only consider historical data (e.g., time to repair and time to failure). However, to analyze the system resilience more precisely, the effect of the risk factors, which are known as observed and unobserved covariates, should be considered in the collected resilience database. These covariates will lead to the observed and unobserved heterogeneities among the collected database. Ignoring the effect of covariate may lead to erroneous conclusion about the resilience level of the system. Since it is hard to find a homogeneous operating condition, in this study, a formulation is proposed to model the effect of these covariates on complex system resilience. Finally, it is applied to a transportation system of a surface mine.","Mottahedi, Adel; Sereshki, Farhang; Ataei, Mohammad; Nouri Qarahasanlou, Ali; Barabadi, Abbas",Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag,92,1

Therefore, based on the information-sharing platform, this paper constructs the synergistic incentive framework; designs the computational experimental models from the aspects of system information structure, system organization structure, synergistic communication strategy and subject knowledge structure; and analyzes the influence mechanism and evolution law of information on synergistic incentive performance from the two dimensions of the influence of the synergy cycle on the incentive performance and the influence of the incentive cycle on the synergy degree. The results show that increasing the information redundancy length and the information redundancy width can improve the synergy degree and incentive validity. The concentration of subject number or information dimension in a certain information area can quickly improve the synergy degree and incentive utility in the early stage of the synergistic incentive cycle, but the above situation is opposite in the later stage. Increasing the information communication path is beneficial to the effective information dissemination among subjects and can improve the efficiency of the decision-making of the subjects. Lastly, considering the background of COVID-19 epidemic situation, this paper puts forward the remedial methods and coping strategies make up for the lack of synergistic incentive information between EPC subjects.

An interim analysis of a prospective randomized control trial,15.367822,8.174303,2021-05-27,"ABSTRACT: Bioflavonoids such as hesperidin and hesperetin as anticancer and antioxidant agents are widely used in the formulation of many herbal drugs. Recently, promising evidence for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19 using these compounds has been reported. Unfortunately, these compounds are often insoluble in aqueous media and have low stability in gastric acid environment. These factors reduced the bioavailability of related oral dosage forms in digestive system. Reduction of particle size and controlled release delivery system can decline the mentioned problems. In the presented research, extraction of bioflavonoids from Citrus sinensis L. (sweet orange) peels was performed using supercritical carbon dioxide. Experimental central composite design was employed for determination of optimal conditions. Qualification analysis was performed using LC–MS, and hesperidin and hesperetin were identified in herbal extract. Micronization and coating of the flavonoids nanoparticles on sugar spheres have been performed using an inhouse developed supercritical technique. Characterization of coated nanoparticles was done using FESEM and ImageJ software. The in vitro antioxidant activity of coated samples was investigated by ferrous ion chelating activity. According to the extraction results, concentration of ethanol as organic co-solvent has the greatest effect on the extraction yield. Analysis of FESEM images illustrated that nanoparticles of extract components with particle size distribution of 5–100 nm were coated successfully. The solubility and antioxidant activity of nanoparticles in aqueous media have increased significantly compared to original form. This process led to increasing dissolution rate and improving the oral bioavailability of flavonoids.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic allows China to play a key humanitarian role in heavily afflicted countries and, through this, perhaps an opportunity to forge more meaningful friendships.

To that end, we asked African American youths in Chicago what made social services provided to them by the Empowering Counseling Program meaningful to them. Their responses focused on the giving and receiving of compassion. To illuminate these youths’ experiences, this study examines their understandings of compassion in light of scriptural references to compassion. In the Old Testament, compassion is a passionate, personal force and an essential virtue. Yahweh self-defines as the compassionate and merciful one. In the New Testament, compassion is the English translation of three different Greek words: splagchnizomai, eleos, and agape. Splagchnizomai signifies an inner experience of Jesus that compels him to heal, teach, and nourish people. Eleos refers to acts of mercy, a response to human sinfulness exemplified by Jesus’ forgiveness, and is a capacity his followers must fulfill. Agape refers to God’s nature, represented in Jesus, and is a potential in all persons. Themes that the scriptural references and the youths’ data have in common are highlighted. In the narratives of both the youths and Scripture, compassionate responses address suffering and alienation with consolation, forgiveness, care, healing, and reconnection. Acts of compassion are to be extended to strangers as well as to friends and family and should always include respect for the autonomy and choices of others. Both the youths and Scripture regard compassion as a transforming liberation from stigma, social oppression, and terror, a life-giving process that brings hope and joy, and a commitment that endures across relationships and time.","McCrea, Katherine Tyson; Gillespie, C.

Our primary objective was to determine the percentage of Children’s Hospital Winnipeg Ambulatory Clinic’s patients who had ever used a public library. The clinic has a longstanding early-childhood literacy program and serves remote communities and low-income Winnipeg families. METHODS: A structured survey was administered to parents or legal guardians by the first author. It explored library barriers and covariates that might affect library use. Analysis included descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model for predictors of library use. RESULTS: Ninety-seven nearly consecutive surveys were administered, half prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most respondents were female, from Winnipeg, and in the two lowest neighbourhood income quintiles. Roughly half (46.4%) of children had used a library. Most respondents wanted health care providers to promote literacy and provide information about public libraries, and more supported in-clinic distribution of books. The number of children per household positively predicted library use, possibly a proxy for experience with community resources. About 2/3 of respondents believed that library fines should be abolished. Most identified other barriers, for example, inconvenient hours, distance, or concerns about COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Less than half of surveyed families used public libraries, citing multiple barriers, including fines. Moreover, not all health care providers can offer new books and anticipatory guidance. Clinics that promote use of public libraries may therefore represent a low-cost, stand-alone alternative.","Burns, Jessy; Sharma, Atul Kumar; Borland, Karin; Rodd, Celia J",Paediatr Child Health,92,1

In the present study, a simple and low-cost strategy has been employed to fabricate nanoporous Mn(2)O(3) with an increased surface area for an electrode/electrolyte interface that improved the conduction of Mn(2)O(3) material. The crystal phase and morphology of the prepared material was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The prepared electrode materials were deposited on a nickel foam substrate to investigate the electrochemical properties. The galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and complex impedance studies confirmed excellent specific capacitance and capacitive behavior of the prepared material. The synthesized Mn(2)O(3)/graphene composites exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 391 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/S. Moreover, a specific capacitance of 369 F/g was recorded at a current density of 0.5 A/g using the galvanostatic charge/discharge test.

However, waiting lists for surgery are long because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some patients are not eligible for surgery due to comorbidity. During the nineties of last century, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) was a popular and safe treatment for bladder stones. When TUCL was found to be more effective, ESWL was more or less forgotten. Because ESWL can be performed on the outpatient clinic, waiting lists for ESWL are shorter than for surgical options. During the COVID-19 pandemic we have treated several patients with bladder stones with ESWL. We conclude that ESWL is a suitable alternative to TUCL for selected patients, however multiple ESWL sessions may be necessary for an effective treatment.","Zeelenberg, Anna M.; Hendriks, Nora; Schout, Barbara M.

Factors like pandemic-related movement restrictions, school closures, and parents' stay-at-home have exposed children to the phenomenon of grief and death. In that case, children anticipate adverse outcomes and fear while they struggle with unanswered questions. Children may not have coping skills needed to manage their grief in constructive ways to identify, normalize, and express their responses to the loss in their lives. Naming and validating these responses as distinctive aspects of grief process and providing safe space to express their feelings are essential components of a child's coping with loss and grief. This is crucial to consider, as different children react to and are influenced by their environments differently. This article aims to explore the developmental understanding of the process of death and grief by applying the conceptual framework of Bronfenbrenner's theory. Understanding mutual interaction between a child and various ecological systems determines how children perceive death and process grief can facilitate effective communication that has significant implications.","Chachar, Aisha Sanober; Younus, Sana; Ali, Wamiq",Front Psychiatry,92,5

NLR is also known to increase with age and is considered to be an aging marker. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in elderly volunteers to examine the effect of a newly developed, highly bioavailable curcumin formulation (curcuRougeTM) on NLR. Both the white blood cell count and the neutrophil rate decreased significantly, and the lymphocyte rate increased significantly from baseline to after curcuRougeTM administration for 4 wk. curcuRougeTM significantly reduced the NLR (p=0.020). On the other hand, in the placebo group, there were no changes in white blood cell count, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte ratio, or NLR. The present study demonstrates for the first time, in elderly volunteers, that administration of curcuRougeTM significantly reduces NLR, an indicator of prognosis in cardiovascular diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and aging. Thus, curcuRougeTM might be expected to improve the prognosis of these diseases as well as exhibit anti-aging effects.","Kishimoto, Atsuhiro; Imaizumi, Atsushi; Wada, Hiromichi; Yamakage, Hajime; Satoh-Asahara, Noriko; Hashimoto, Tadashi; Hasegawa, Koji",Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,92,31

Overall there is no consistent conclusion about whether intramedullary nailing alone, or intramedullary nails augmented with poller screws is more advantageous.We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases. Seventy-five records were identified, of which 13 met our inclusion criteria. In a systematic review we asked: (1) What is the proportion of nonunions with poller screw usage? (2) What is the proportion of malalignment, infection and secondary surgical procedures with poller screw usage? The overall outcome proportion across the studies was computed using the inverse variance method for pooling.Thirteen studies with a total of 371 participants and 376 fractures were included. Mean follow-up time was 21.1 months. Mean age of included patients was 40.0 years. Seven studies had heterogenous populations of nonunions and acute fractures. Four studies included only acute fractures and two studies examined nonunions only.The results of the present systematic review show a low complication rate of IM nailing augmented with poller screws in terms of nonunion (4%, CI: 0.03-0.07), coronal plane malunion (5%, CI: 0.03-0.08), deep (5%, CI: 0.03-0.11) and superficial (6%, CI: 0.03-0.11) infections, and secondary procedures (8%, CI: 0.04-0.18).When compared with the existing literature our review suggests intramedullary nailing with poller screws has lower rates of nonunion and coronal malalignment when compared with nailing alone.

Despite this, older patients remain vastly underrepresented in research that sets the standards for cancer treatments. Consequently, most of what we know about cancer therapeutics is based on clinical trials conducted in younger, healthier patients, and effective strategies to improve clinical trial participation of older adults with cancer remain sparse. For this systematic review, the authors evaluated published studies regarding barriers to participation and interventions to improve participation of older adults in cancer trials. The quality of the available evidence was low and, despite a literature describing multifaceted barriers, only one intervention study aimed to increase enrollment of older adults in trials. The findings starkly amplify the paucity of evidence-based, effective strategies to improve participation of this underrepresented population in cancer trials. Within these limitations, the authors provide their opinion on how the current cancer research infrastructure must be modified to accommodate the needs of older patients. Several underused solutions are offered to expand clinical trials to include older adults with cancer. However, as currently constructed, these recommendations alone will not solve the evidence gap in geriatric oncology, and efforts are needed to meet older and frail adults where they are by expanding clinical trials designed specifically for this population and leveraging real-world data.","Sedrak, Mina S; Freedman, Rachel A; Cohen, Harvey J; Muss, Hyman B; Jatoi, Aminah; Klepin, Heidi D; Wildes, Tanya M; Le-Rademacher, Jennifer G; Kimmick, Gretchen G; Tew, William P; George, Kevin; Padam, Simran; Liu, Jennifer; Wong, Andrew R; Lynch, Andrea; Djulbegovic, Benjamin; Mohile, Supriya G; Dale, William",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,92,1

Accurate assessment of disease response is fundamental to increase the chances of successful breast-conserving surgery and to avoid local recurrence. The purpose of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) and contrast-enhanced-MRI (MRI) in the evaluation of tumor response to NAC. METHODS This prospective study was approved by the institutional review board and written informed consent was obtained. Fifty-four consenting women with breast cancer and indication of NAC were consecutively enrolled between October 2012 and December 2014. Patients underwent both CESM and MRI before, during and after NAC. MRI was performed first, followed by CESM within 3 days. Response to therapy was evaluated for each patient, comparing the size of the residual lesion measured on CESM and MRI performed after NAC to the pathological response on surgical specimens (gold standard), independently of and blinded to the results of the other test. The agreement between measurements was evaluated using Lin's coefficient. The agreement between measurements using CESM and MRI was tested at each step of the study, before, during and after NAC. And last of all, the variation in the largest dimension of the tumor on CESM and MRI was assessed according to the parameters set in RECIST 1.1 criteria, focusing on pathological complete response (pCR). RESULTS A total of 46 patients (85%) completed the study. CESM predicted pCR better than MRI (Lin's coefficient 0.81 and 0.59, respectively). Both methods tend to underestimate the real extent of residual tumor (mean 4.1mm in CESM, 7.5mm in MRI). The agreement between measurements using CESM and MRI was 0.96, 0.94 and 0.76 before, during and after NAC respectively. The distinction between responders and non-responders with CESM and MRI was identical for 45/46 patients. In the assessment of CR, sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 84%, respectively, for CESM, and 87% and 60% for MRI. CONCLUSION CESM and MRI lesion size measurements were highly correlated. CESM seems at least as reliable as MRI in assessing the response to NAC, and may be an alternative if MRI is contraindicated or its availability is limited.","Iotti, Valentina; Ravaioli, Sara; Vacondio, Rita; Coriani, Chiara; Caffarri, Sabrina; Sghedoni, Roberto; Nitrosi, Andrea; Ragazzi, Moira; Gasparini, Elisa; Masini, Cristina; Bisagni, Giancarlo; Falco, Giuseppe; Ferrari, Guglielmo; Braglia, Luca; Del Prato, Alberto; Malavolti, Ivana; Ginocchi, Vladimiro; Pattacini, Pierpaolo",Breast cancer research : BCR,92,26

METHOD A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, Web of Science and PsycNet databases with the following terms: ""stress,"" ""long-term memory,"" and ""retrieval."" Studies were included in the review if they tested samples of healthy human participants, with at least one control group, and with the onset of the stress intervention occurring after the encoding phase and shortly (up to one hour) before the final memory test. RESULTS Thirteen studies were included in the qualitative synthesis (N = 962) and were classified according to the time elapsed between stress induction and memory retrieval (stress-retrieval delay), the stress-inducing protocol (stressor), the time of day in which stress induction took place, sex, and age of participants. Most studies induced stress with the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) between 15 and 25 minutes before the final memory (mostly recall) test and showed significant increases in cortisol levels and memory impairment. DISCUSSION The reviewed studies indicate that stress does impair retrieval, particularly when induced with the TSST, in the afternoon, up to 45 minutes before the onset of the final memory test, in healthy young men. These results may inform future research on the impact of stress-induced cortisol surges on memory retrieval.","Klier, Cadu; Buratto, Luciano Grüdtner",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,92,1

HP infection could lead to decreased sperm parameters, and treating the HP infection could improve the quality of sperm. However, studies investigating the relationship between infertility and HP infection are still limited, and more evidence is required. Therefore, we performed the present study to investigate the impact of HP infection on sperm quality in males and on ovarian reserve in females. METHODS A total of 16,522 patients who visited the Second Hospital of Zhejiang University from January 2016 to June 2019 due to abdominal discomfort and underwent a 13/14C-urea breath HP test were included in this retrospective cross-sectional study. Among them, 565 had performed sperm analysis or ovarian reserve tests in the past three months and were involved for further analyses. Sperm parameters were examined with a computer-assisted sperm analysis system, and serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and sex hormones were tested with an electrochemiluminescence method. RESULTS Among 363 patients who underwent the sperm test, 136 (37.47%) had HP infection. Among 202 patients who underwent the AMH test, 55 (27.23%) had HP infection. There was no difference in sperm concentration and motility between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses stratified into 5-year age groups confirmed that there was no significant difference in sperm parameters (P > 0.05). When pooled with previously published data, no significant difference in sperm concentration or motility was found (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, this study found that the serum AMH level was similar between the HP+ and HP- groups (P > 0.05). Further subgroup analyses confirmed that there was no significant difference in serum AMH level (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS There were no differences in sperm parameters and AMH levels based on history of HP infection among Chinese patients.","Feng, Chun; Lv, Ping-Ping; Huang, Chang-Chang; Yang, Song-Qing; Yao, Qiu-Ping; Shen, Jin-Ming; Jin, Min",BMC urology,92,29

Central venous catheters have also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications. Paradoxical embolism as an aetiological mechanism of ischaemic stroke should be considered in a highly prothrombotic context, where it may be more frequent. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old woman with a central venous catheter, with a large vessel ischaemic stroke, treated with mechanical thrombectomy for an atypical paradoxical embolism while in intensive care for bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia. In the aetiological study, analysis highlighted an elevation of the D-dimer and right-left shunt with massive passage of contrast directly from the central peripheral access pathway in the left upper extremity to the left atrium in the transoesophageal echocardiogram. Thoracic tomographic angiography showed an anomalous venous structure with its origin in the subclavian vein and drainage to the segmental vein of the left upper lobe with direct emptying into the left atrium. Treatment consisted in anticoagulation until removal of the central venous catheter and simple anti-aggregating medication on discharge. CONCLUSIONS Paradoxical embolism due to intra- or extra-cardiac shunt should be considered in patients with COVID-19, given the high associated risk of venous thromboembolism. Further studies are needed to be able to define optimal prophylactic and therapeutic management.","Ballvé-Martín, A; Boned, S; Rubiera, M",Revista de neurologia,92,1

The aim of this study was to compare the postoperative pain of laparoscopic versus open gastrostomy in patients with complete obstruction caused by advanced esophageal cancer. METHODS Fifteen patients who had undergone either a reduced port access laparoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (LGJ, n=7) or open gastrostomy/jejunostomy (OGJ, n=8) between July 2011 and December 2015 were retrospectively studied. Variables examined comprised age, sex, body mass index (BMI), operative time, blood loss volume, and American Society of Anesthesiologist physical status (ASA-PS) scores. The degree of postoperative pain was also assessed in both groups during the first seven postoperative days. RESULTS The patients in the two groups were comparable in age, sex, BMI, ASA-PS scores, intraoperative blood loss or postoperative complication rates. Operative time was shorter in the LGJ group than the OGJ group. No patients in the LGJ group required conversion to open laparotomy. Tube feedings were started on postoperative Day 1 in both groups; there were no postoperative complications. The duration of rescue nonopioid analgesic use was significantly shorter in the LGJ than the OGJ group (1.3 versus 3.5 days; P=0.0005). There was a significant difference in frequency of postoperative nonopioid analgesic use: 7.9 times in the LGJ group versus 17.9 times in the OGJ group (P=0.0219). CONCLUSIONS LGJ is associated with less postoperative pain than OGJ in patients with complete obstruction caused by advanced esophageal cancer.","Matsutani, Takeshi; Nomura, Tsutomu; Hagiwara, Nobutoshi; Fujita, Itsuo; Kanazawa, Yoshikazu; Kakinuma, Daisuke; Kanno, Hitoshi; Matsuda, Akihisa; Ohta, Keiichiro; Uchida, Eiji",Journal of Nippon Medical School = Nippon Ika Daigaku zasshi,92,2

METHODS A review of a prospectively collected database at the Kyungpook National University Hospital from January 2006 to September 2010 revealed that a series of 16 consecutive patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for an appendiceal mucocele. Data regarding patient demographics, operating time, conversion, surgical morbidity, lateral lymph node status, and mid-term oncologic result were analyzed. RESULTS The reported series consisted of 7 women (50%) and 9 men with a mean age of 61.6 years (range, 41 to 88 years). The mean operative time was 66.8 minutes (range, 33 to 150 minutes). Perioperative mortality and morbidity were 0% and 6.2%, respectively. Recovery after the procedure was rapid, and the mean hospital stay was 6.8 days (range, 3 to 22 days). Pathology revealed 12 lesions compatible with a mucinous cystadenoma and four others compatible with benign cystic tumors. All surgical margins were clear. In one case, an extra port had to be placed, and another case required conversion from SILS to a standard open laparotomy immediately after identification of the tumor because of a micro-perforation with focal mucin collection. With a median follow-up of 28.7 months, no re-admission or tumor recurrence, such as pseudomyxoma peritonei, was noted in 14 patients. CONCLUSION A single-port laparoscopic mucocelectomy should be safe and feasible and has the advantage of being a minimally invasive approach. Prospective controlled studies comparing SILS and conventional open surgery, with long-term follow-up evaluation, are needed to confirm the author's initial experience.","Park, Ki Bum; Park, Jun Seok; Choi, Gyu-Seog; Kim, Hye Jin; Park, Soo Yeun; Ryuk, Jong Pil; Choi, Won Ho; Jang, You Seok",Journal of the Korean Society of Coloproctology,92,20

Infection may be mild, moderate or severe; many remain asymptomatic. High burden of non-communicable and communicable diseases theoretically puts Pakistani population at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection. Considering the universal risk of infection, the outpatient services in Pakistan need to be redesigned. Starting with risk assessment of the facility and provision of a dedicated telephone connection, structure and workflow need to be redesigned in order to minimise risk of exposure to healthcare professionals, staff and patients. Patients with COVID-19 patients should be identified before they arrive in the facility and should be served expeditiously, in an environment which prevents cross-transmission of infection. Tele-consultation is assuming an important role. Changes which are taking place in response to Covid-19 pandemic will have far reaching effects on clinical services in Pakistan.","Jamil, Bushra",JPMA.

Multiple grading scales have been developed for this purpose but none has been widely adopted. OBJECTIVE To analyze these scales to determine interobserver reliability. METHODS Four independent assessors scored the intraprocedural angiograms of patients who underwent flow-diverting stent deployment for an intracranial saccular or fusiform aneurysm at our institution between October 2012 and June 2015. Angiographic outcome immediately after flow-diverting stent deployment was scored using three grading scales (Kamran-Byrne (KB), Simple Measurement of Aneurysm Residual after Treatment (SMART), and O'Kelley, Krings, Marotta (OKM)). Statistical analysis was performed using Light's κ for multiple raters (κ), Kendall's coefficient of concordance (W), and intraclass correlation (ICC). RESULTS We included the angiograms of 50 consecutive patients (mean age 58 years, range 30-79) who underwent flow-diverting stent deployment for an intracranial aneurysm (40 saccular, 10 fusiform). Six aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation. The inter-rater reliability was typically poor or fair: SMART aneurysm filling (κ=0.30, W=0.36, ICC=0.12), SMART parent vessel stenosis (κ=0.07, W=0.33, ICC=0.12), KB axis I (κ=0.24, W=0.50, ICC=0.25), KB axis II (κ=0.07, W=0.30, ICC=0.06), OKM aneurysm filling (κ=0.23, W=0.45, ICC=0.13), OKM contrast stasis (κ=0.36,W=0.71, ICC=0.54).

SLHs in Los Angeles County (N = 297) were geocoded and linked with U.S. Census, alcohol outlet, recovery resources, and accessibility data. Regression analyses tested differences by house characteristics. Co-ed houses were in neighborhoods that were less ethnically diverse and farther away from recovery resources. Larger house capacity was associated with increased density of off-premise alcohol outlets but also increased proximity to treatment. Higher fees were associated with lower neighborhood disadvantage and off-premise alcohol outlet density but the greater distance from treatment programs and other recovery resources. House characteristics are associated with neighborhood factors that both support recovery and place residents at risk.","Mericle, Amy A; Karriker-Jaffe, Katherine; Patterson, Deidre; Mahoney, Elizabeth; Cooperman, Laya; Polcin, Douglas L",Journal of community psychology,92,16

Recently, reduced cancer mortality following bariatric surgery has been reported. This study tested whether reduced cancer mortality following gastric bypass was due to decreased incidence. Cancer incidence and mortality data through 2007 from the Utah Cancer Registry (UCR) were compared between 6,596 Utah patients who had gastric bypass (1984-2002) and 9,442 severely obese persons who had applied for Utah Driver's Licenses (1984-2002). Study outcomes included incidence, case-fatality, and mortality for cancer by site and stage at diagnosis of all gastric bypass patients, compared to nonoperated severely obese controls. Follow-up was over a 24-year period (mean 12.5 years). Total cancer incidence was significantly lower in the surgical group compared to controls (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76; confidence interval (CI) 95%, 0.65-0.89; P = 0.0006). Lower incidence in surgery patients vs. controls was primarily due to decreased incidence of cancer diagnosed at regional or distant stages. Cancer mortality was 46% lower in the surgery group compared to controls (HR = 0.54; CI 95%, 0.37-0.78; P = 0.001). Although the apparent protective effect of surgery on risk of developing cancer was limited to cancers likely known to be obesity related, the inverse association for mortality was seen for all cancers. Significant reduction in total cancer mortality in gastric bypass patients compared with severely obese controls was associated with decreased incidence, primarily among subjects with advanced cancers. These findings suggest gastric bypass results in lower cancer risk, presumably related to weight loss, supporting recommendations for reducing weight to lower cancer risk.","Adams, Ted D; Stroup, Antoinette M; Gress, Richard E; Adams, Kenneth F; Calle, Eugenia E; Smith, Sherman C; Halverson, R Chad; Simper, Steven C; Hopkins, Paul N; Hunt, Steven C",Obesity,92,30

In this study, we examine the feasibility and function of a novel minimally invasive, non-blood-contacting epicardial assist device in a porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy model. METHODS Feasibility was first tested in an ex vivo thoracoscopic trainer box with slaughterhouse hearts. Five male Yorkshire swine underwent selective ligation of the circumflex artery to create a posterolateral infarct Twelve weeks after infarct, all animals underwent left minithoracotomy. A custom inflatable bladder was positioned over the epicardial surface of the infarct and firmly secured to the surrounding border zone myocardium with polypropylene mesh and minimally invasive mesh tacks. An external gas pulsation system actively inflated and deflated the bladder in synchrony with the cardiac cycle. All animals then underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess ventricular function. RESULTS All subjects successfully underwent off-pump placement of the epicardial assist device via minithoracotomy. Ejection fraction significantly improved from 29.1% ± 4.8% to 39.6% ± 4.23% (P < 0.001) when compared with pretreatment. End-systolic volume decreased (76.6 ± 13.3 mL vs 62.4 ± 12.0 mL, P < 0.001) and stroke volume increased (28.6 ± 3.4 mL vs 37.9 ± 3.1 mL, P < 0.05) when assisted. No change was noted in end-diastolic volume (105.1 ± 11.4 vs 100.3 ± 12.7). On postmortem examination, mesh fixation and device position were excellent in all cases. No adverse events were encountered. CONCLUSIONS Directed epicardial assistance improves ventricular function in a porcine ischemic cardiomyopathy model and may provide a safe alternative to currently available ventricular assist device therapies. Further, the technique used for device positioning and fixation suggests that an entirely thoracoscopic approach is possible.","McGarvey, Jeremy R; Shimaoka, Toru; Takebayashi, Satoshi; Aoki, Chikashi; Kondo, Norihiro; Takebe, Manabu; Zsido, Gerald A; Jassar, Arminder; Gorman, Joseph H; Pilla, James J; Gorman, Robert C",Innovations,92,1

Methods Of 101 laparoscopic appendectomy with ERAS protocol cases for appendicitis from March 2019 to April 2020, 54 patients underwent SILA with multimodal analgesic approach (group 1) while 47 patients received CLA with multimodal analgesic approach (group 2). SILA and CLA were compared with the single institution's ERAS protocol. To adjust for baseline differences and selection bias, operative outcomes and complications were compared after propensity score matching (PSM). Results After 1:1 PSM, well-matched 35 patients in each group were evaluated. Postoperative hospital stays for patients in group 1 (1.2±0.8 vs. 1.6±0.8 days, p =0.037) were significantly lesser than those for patients in group 2.

A retrospective study of emergency hospitalizations with a diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen between April and July 2020 vs. a similar period in 2019 was performed. The observation sheets and the operating protocols were analyzed. Between April and July 2020, 50 cases of acute surgical abdomen were hospitalized and treated, compared to 43 cases in the same period last year. The main types of pathology in both groups included: Occlusions (60%, respectively 44.2% in 2019) and peritonitis (32%, respectively 41.8% in 2019). There was an increased rate of patients with colorectal cancers neglected therapeutically or uninvestigated, who presented during the pandemic period with emergencies for complications such as occlusion or tumor perforation (32 vs. 6.97%, P=0.0039). One case, with gastric perforation, was COVID-positive, with no pulmonary symptoms at admission. The number of postoperative infectious complications was lower during the pandemic (2 vs. 13.95%, P=0.0461).

Many mechanisms have been found to be related to this clinical phenomenon. Predicting this event by using hematological biomarkers may provide opportunities for adopting preventive measures against unfavorable neurovascular complications. The aim of this study is to determine the hematological predictors of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting. Material and methods A total of 120 patients who underwent carotid stenting were divided into two groups: those with and without carotid artery vasospasm. Carotid artery vasospasm was angiographically defined as transient or persistent emergent stenosis or irregularity of the vessel wall without evidence of thrombosis during carotid stenting. The hematological parameters were compared between 21 patients who developed carotid artery vasospasm (17.5%) and 99 patients who did not (82.5%). Results The mean age of the patients with carotid artery vasospasm and without carotid artery vasospasm was 66 ±8 and 70 ±8 years, respectively. Creatinine levels within 0.5-0.9 (OR = 3.704, 95% CI: 1.245-11.019, p = 0.019), each 1000 unit increase in neutrophil count (OR = 1.567, 95% CI: 1.027-2.392, p = 0.037) and presence of diabetes (OR = 3.081, 95% CI: 1.116-8.505, p = 0.030) were the independent predictors of carotid artery vasospasm in carotid arteries during carotid stenting. Conclusions The prediction of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting should help clinicians adopt preventive measures against the development of neurological sequelae. This study found that creatinine levels, increased neutrophil count and presence of diabetes are independent predictors of carotid artery vasospasm.","Can, Yusuf; Kocayigit, Ibrahim",Archives of medical sciences.

Among people with CF, these viruses are associated with prolonged respiratory illness and show a clear association with pulmonary exacerbations which in turn are associated with lung function decline and risk of death. Human rhinovirus is the most commonly encountered respiratory viral pathogen in CF although adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus are all also responsible for infections in this population. Areas covered: This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical impact and therapeutic options for respiratory virus infection in both children and adults with CF. Expert commentary: The management of CF to date has largely focused on airway clearance strategies, nutritional support and aggressive antibacterial therapy.

Its prevalence and impact on short- and long-term outcomes are not well described. This systematic review was undertaken to review the available evidence on dysglycemia (either hypo- or hyperglycemia) in hospitalized children with SAM. The 2 primary objectives of this systematic review were to understand the prevalence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in children with SAM. A secondary objective was to understand the relation between dysglycemia and clinical outcomes like mortality in children with SAM. MEDLINE was searched with terms related to children, SAM, and dysglycemia. A meta-analysis of proportions was completed to determine the hypoglycemia prevalence and a standard meta-analysis was done to determine the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A total of 2148 articles were identified in the database search of which 16 met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review based on screening done by multiple reviewers. The overall prevalence of hypoglycemia in SAM across studies based on the meta-analysis of proportions was 9% (95% CI: 7%, 12%; I2 = 92%). Meta-analysis results showed that hypoglycemia was associated with a higher chance of mortality during hospitalization in children with SAM (OR: 4.29; 95% CI: 3.04, 6.05; I2 = 0%). According to the GRADE evaluation, the certainty of the evidence for the prevalence of hypoglycemia was low and for hyperglycemia was very low. For the relation between hypoglycemia and mortality, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. A meta-analysis was not carried out for the prevalence of hyperglycemia due to the wide range of definitions used for across studies, but the prevalence ranged from 2% to 38% in the literature. This systematic review highlights the need for further work in this area to include serial glucose measurements to understand the clinical importance of dysglycemia during hospitalization in children with SAM.","Ledger, Elizabeth; Harawa, Philliness Prisca; Daniel, Allison I; Candler, Toby; Prentice, Andrew M; Bandsma, Robert H J",Advances in nutrition,92,4

After we diagnosed a right inguinal hernia, endoscopic inguinal hernia repair was performed. We selected the totally extraperitoneal approach with EMARO. The endoscopic procedure time was 100 minutes, and no intraoperative complications occurred. EMARO brings together features of smooth motion and good manipulation performance. This operation was performed safely and was comparable to a conventional operation completed with human assistants.

However, in the medial gastrocnemius (MG), mixed evidence exists on whether fascicle stretch amplitude influences the level of EIMD, thus questioning whether changes in fascicle mechanics underpin the RBE. An alternative hypothesis is that neural adaptations contribute to the RBE in this muscle. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuromechanical adaptations during and after repeated bouts of a highly controlled muscle lengthening exercise that aimed to maximize EIMD in MG. In all, 20 subjects performed two bouts of 500 active lengthening contractions (70% of maximal activation) of the triceps surae, separated by 7 days. Ultrasound constructed fascicle length-torque (L-T) curves of MG, surface electromyography (EMG), maximum torque production, and muscle soreness were assessed before, 2 hours and 2 days after each exercise bout. The drop in maximum torque (4%) and the increase in muscle soreness (24%) following the repeated bout were significantly less than following the initial bout (8% and 59%, respectively), indicating a RBE. However, neither shift in the L-T curve nor changes in EMG parameters were present. Furthermore, muscle properties during the exercise were not related to the EIMD or RBE. Our results show that there are no global changes in gastrocnemius mechanical behavior or neural activation that could explain the observed RBE in this muscle. We suggest that adaptations in the non-contractile elements of the muscle are likely to explain the RBE in the triceps surae.","Pincheira, P A; Hoffman, B W; Cresswell, A G; Carroll, T J; Brown, N A T; Lichtwark, G A",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,92,11

The prevalence of COVID-19 in orthopaedic populations will vary depending on the time and place where the sampling is performed. The idea that asymptomatic carriers play a role is generalizable but has not been studied in large populations of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. We therefore evaluated this topic in one large, metropolitan city in a state that had the ninth-most infections in the United States at the time this study was completed (June 2020). This work was based on a screening and testing protocol that required all patients to be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) What is the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery in one major city, in order to provide other surgeons with a framework for assessing COVID-19 rates in their healthcare system? (2) How did patients with positive test results for COVID-19 differ in terms of age, sex, and orthopaedic conditions? (3) What proportion of patients had complications treated, and how many patients had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days of surgery (recognizing that some may have been missed and so our estimates of event rates will necessarily underestimate the frequency of this event)? METHODS All adult patients scheduled for surgery at four facilities (two tertiary care hospitals, one orthopaedic specialty hospital, and one ambulatory surgery center) at a single institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area from April 27, 2020 to June 12, 2020 were included in this study. A total of 1295 patients were screened for symptoms, exposure, temperature, and oxygen saturation via a standardized protocol before surgical scheduling; 1.5% (19 of 1295) were excluded because they had COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or recent travel based on the initial screening questionnaire, leaving 98.5% (1276 of 1295) who underwent testing for COVID-19 preoperatively. All 1276 patients who passed the initial screening test underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before surgery. The mean age at the time of testing was 56 ± 16 years, and 53% (672 of 1276) were men. Eighty-seven percent (1106), 8% (103), and 5% (67) were tested via the Roche, Abbott, and Cepheid assays, respectively. All patients undergoing elective surgery were tested via the Roche assay, while those undergoing nonelective surgery received either the Abbott or Cepheid assay, based on availability. Patients with positive test results undergoing elective surgery had their procedures rescheduled, while patients scheduled for nonelective surgery underwent surgery regardless of their test results. Additionally, we reviewed the records of all patients at 30 days postoperatively for emergency room visits, readmissions, and COVID-19-related complications via electronic medical records and surgeon-reported complications. However, we had no method for definitively determining how many patients had complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions outside our system, so our event rate estimates for these endpoints are necessarily best-case estimates. RESULTS A total of 0.5% (7 of 1276) of the patients tested positive for COVID-19: five via the Roche assay and two via the Abbott assay. Patients with positive test results were younger than those with negative results (39 ± 12 years versus 56 ± 16 years; p = 0.01). With the numbers available, we found no difference in the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 based on subspecialty area (examining the lowest and highest point estimates, respectively, we observed: trauma surgery [3%; 2 of 68 patients] versus hip and knee [0.3%; 1 of 401 patients], OR 12 [95% CI 1-135]; p = 0.06). No patients with negative preoperative test results for COVID-19 developed a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days postoperatively. Within 30 days of surgery, 0.9% (11 of 1276) of the patients presented to the emergency room, and 1.3% (16 of 1276) were readmitted for non-COVID-19-related complications. None of the patients with positive test results for COVID-19 preoperatively experienced complications. However, because some were likely treated outside our healthcare system, the actual percentages may be higher. CONCLUSION Because younger patients are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of disease, surgeons should emphasize the importance of taking proper precautions to prevent virus exposure preoperatively. Because the rates of COVID-19 infection differ based on city and time, surgeons should monitor the local prevalence of disease to properly advise patients on the risk of COVID-19 exposure. Further investigation is required to assess the prevalence in the orthopaedic population in cities with larger COVID-19 burdens.

67683,67683,67683,Why is it important to report early possible COVID-19 PET/CT findings in cancer patients? Explaining with a case series.,15.611132,7.842026,2021,"COVID-19, in most patients, presents with mild flu-like illness. Elderly patients with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, are more likely to have severe disease and deaths. Neurological complications are frequently reported in severely or critically ill patients with comorbidities. In COVID-19, both central and peripheral nervous systems can be affected. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes the disease COVID-19 and has the potential to invade the brain. The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the brain either via a hematogenous route or olfactory system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme two receptors, present on endothelial cells of cerebral vessels, are a possible viral entry point. The most severe neurological manifestations, altered sensorium (agitation, delirium, and coma), are because of hypoxic and metabolic abnormalities. Characteristic cytokine storm incites severe metabolic changes and multiple organ failure. Profound coagulopathies may manifest with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Rarely, SARS-CoV-2 virus encephalitis or pictures like acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported. Nonspecific headache is a commonly experienced neurological symptom. A new type of headache ""personal protection equipment-related headache"" has been described. Complete or partial anosmia and ageusia are common peripheral nervous system manifestations. Recently, many cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in COVID-19 patients have been observed, and a postinfectious immune-mediated inflammatory process was held responsible for this. Guillain-Barré syndrome does respond to intravenous immunoglobulin. Myalgia/fatigue is also common, and elevated creatine kinase levels indicate muscle injury. Most of the reports about neurological complications are currently from China. COVID-19 pandemic is spreading to other parts of the world; the spectrum of neurological complications is likely to widen further.","Garg, Ravindra K",Neurology India,92,27

Molecular profiling (MP) was used to evaluate the expression of chemotherapy targeted biomarkers associated with ECF therapy and other first-line cytotoxic regimens for GC. METHODS GC specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for TOP2A, TS, ERCC1, PGP, and TOPO1 expression (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ) from 2009 to 2012. RESULTS A total of 230 GC specimens were analyzed. The median age of patients was 61 (IQR: 50-72) years with the majority being male (n = 139, 60%). IHC actionable targets included: 60% (n = 138) high TOP2A, 55% (n = 127) negative ERCC1, and 63% (n = 145) negative TS, indicating potential benefit from E, C, and F, respectively. Simultaneous expression analysis demonstrated only 24% (n = 55) of patients had gene expression levels that suggested uniform sensitivity to ECF. Biomarker results of 6.5% (n = 15) of patients revealed a potential complete lack of sensitivity to first-line ECF. CONCLUSIONS MP of GC has the potential to define patients who would derive the greatest benefit from current therapies. Prospective controlled studies are required to validate the role of biomarkers in the management of GC patients.","Miura, John T; Johnston, Fabian M; Thomas, James; George, Ben; Eastwood, Dan; Tsai, Susan; Christians, Kathleen K; Turaga, Kiran K; Gamblin, T Clark",Journal of surgical oncology,92,1

Patient who has CBC with RLD leads to respiratory symptoms such as breathing difficulty, airway obstruction, reduced exercise capacity and altered pulmonary functions. However, studies examining the role of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burn of chest are lacking. OBJECTIVE To find the short term effects of pranayama breathing exercise on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity and exercise tolerance in full thickness circumferential burns of chest. METHODS Through simple random sampling method thirty subjects (N = 30) with RLD following CBC were allocated to pranayama breathing exercise group (PBE-G; n = 15) and conventional breathing exercise group (CBE-G; n = 15). They received pranayama breathing exercise and conventional breathing exercise for 4 weeks respectively. All the subjects received chest mobility exercise as common treatment. Primary (Numeric Pain Rating Scale - NPRS, forced expiratory volume (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and secondary (Electromyogram of sternocleidomastoid, scalene, external intercostal and diaphragm muscle, 6 min walk test & Global Rating of Change - GRC) outcome measures were measured at baseline, after four weeks and after three months follow up. RESULTS Baseline demographic and clinical variables show homogenous distribution between the groups (p > 0.05). Four weeks following different breathing exercises, PBE-G group shows more significant changes in pain intensity, pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity, exercise tolerance and global rating of change than CBE-G group (p ≤ 0.05) at four weeks and three months follow up. CONCLUSION Both groups showed improvement over time. However, differences between the groups were noticed small. Still physiotherapy management, which included pranayama breathing exercises with chest mobilization program, had an effective strategy in the treatment of restrictive lung disease following circumferential burn of chest.","Nambi, Gopal; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Elshehawy, Ahmed A; Altrawy, Heba H; Abodonya, Ahmed M; Saleh, Ayman K; Hussein, Ramadan S",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,92,19

Conceptualisation of advance care planning as a health behaviour highlights the need to design innovative, evidence-based strategies that will facilitate meaningful end-of-life care decision-making. Aim: To review systematically and synthesise quantitative and qualitative evidence on barriers and facilitators to stakeholders` engagement in ACP for older adults (≥ 50 years old) in a community setting. Methods: A hybrid systematic review will be conducted, identifying studies for consideration in two phases. First, databases will be searched from inception to identify relevant prior systematic reviews, and assess all studies included in those reviews against eligibility criteria (Phase 1). Second, databases will be searched systematically for individual studies falling outside the timeframe of those reviews (Phase 2). A modified SPIDER framework informed eligibility criteria. A study will be considered if it (a) included relevant adult stakeholders; (b) explored engagement in ACP among older adults (≥50 years old); (c) employed any type of design; (d) identified enablers and/or barriers to events specified in the Organising Framework of ACP Outcomes; (e) used either quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods methodology; and (f) evaluated phenomena of interest in a community setting (e.g., primary care or community healthcare centres). Screening, selection, bias assessment, and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. Integrated methodologies will be employed and quantitative and qualitative data will be combined into a single mixed method synthesis.

Many subcortical structures are known to play a crucial role in higher-order cognitive processing. However, comprehensive anatomic characterization of these structures is currently lacking in the congenital heart disease population. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the morphometry and volume of the globus pallidus, striatum, and thalamus between youth born with congenital heart disease and healthy peers. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recruited youth between 16 and 24 years of age born with congenital heart disease who underwent cardiopulmonary bypass surgery before 2 years of age (n = 48) and healthy controls of the same age (n = 48). All participants underwent a brain MR imaging to acquire high-resolution 3D T1-weighted images. RESULTS Smaller surface area and inward bilateral displacement across the lateral surfaces of the globus pallidus were concentrated anteriorly in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). On the lateral surfaces of bilateral thalami, we found regions of both larger and smaller surface areas, as well as inward and outward displacement in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls (q < 0.15). We did not find any morphometric differences between groups for the striatum. For the volumetric analyses, only the right globus pallidus showed a significant volume reduction (q < 0.05) in the congenital heart disease group compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS This study reports morphometric alterations in youth with congenital heart disease in the absence of volume reductions, suggesting that volume alone is not sufficient to detect and explain subtle neuroanatomic differences in this clinical population.","Fontes, K; Courtin, F; Rohlicek, C V; Saint-Martin, C; Gilbert, G; Easson, K; Majnemer, A; Marelli, A; Chakravarty, M M; Brossard-Racine, M",AJNR.

Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy (FDA Pregnancy Category X) and in men whose partners may become pregnant. In 2003, the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry was established to monitor pregnancy exposures to ribavirin and to evaluate the potential human teratogenicity of prenatal exposure. METHODS This voluntary registry enrolls pregnant women who have been exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or during the six months prior to conception either directly, by taking ribavirin, or indirectly through sexual contact with a man taking ribavirin. Women are followed until delivery; live born infants are followed for one year. The Registry aims to enroll 131 live births following direct (maternal) exposure to ribavirin and 131 live births following indirect (male) exposures. RESULTS After more than five years of operation, the Registry has enrolled 49 live births with direct exposure and 69 live births following indirect exposure. Six outcomes with birth defects have been reported. All were among live born infants: torticollis (2), hypospadias (1), polydactyly and a neonatal tooth (1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (1), ventricular septal defect and cyst of 4th ventricle of the brain (1). Three received direct exposures ([6.1% (95% CI: 1.2, 16.9)], three were exposed indirectly [4.3% (95% CI: 0.9, 12.2)]. CONCLUSIONS Although current enrollment is far short of the required sample size, preliminary findings have not detected a signal indicating human teratogenicity for ribavirin. However, findings must be interpreted with caution concerning direct or indirect prenatal ribavirin exposures.","Roberts, Susan S; Miller, Richard K; Jones, Judith K; Lindsay, Karen L; Greene, Michael F; Maddrey, Willis C; Williams, Ian T; Liu, John; Spiegel, Robert J","Birth defects research.

RECENT FINDINGS Anaphylaxis mortality and morbidity statistics (MMS) may gain new perspectives with the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 in the forthcoming years. Improving the quality of epidemiological data related to anaphylaxis should clarify some areas of uncertainty about risk factors, leading to better targeting of strategies to protect those patients at risk, and support decision-making to facilitate healthcare planning and implementation of public health measures to prevent anaphylaxis. SUMMARY Anaphylaxis is a complex noncommunicable diseases with adverse impact on health-related quality of life of patients and their carriers and a significant proportion of deaths may be preventable. It requires an integrated holistic plan to improve quality of healthcare and gathering accurate and comparable epidemiological data is key. Morbidity related to anaphylaxis seems to be increasing worldwide whereas mortality of anaphylaxis appears to be low and stable, but this still has great challenges in capturing quality anaphylaxis MMS. Improving the quality of epidemiological data related to anaphylaxis should clarify some areas of uncertainty about risk factors, leading to better targeting of strategies to protect those patients at risk. As knowledge derived from populations is key information for more realistic decision-making, the construction of the new section addressed to anaphylaxis in the ICD-11 will allow the collection of more accurate epidemiological data to support quality management of patients, and better facilitate healthcare planning to implement public health measures to prevent and reduce the morbidity and mortality attributable to these conditions.","Tanno, Luciana Kase; Demoly, Pascal",Current opinion in allergy and clinical immunology,92,33

Persistent activation of pDCs has been demonstrated in a number of autoimmune diseases. To evaluate the potential benefit of depleting pDCs in autoimmunity, a monoclonal antibody targeting the pDC-specific marker immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 was generated. This antibody, known as VIB7734, which was engineered for enhanced effector function, mediated rapid and potent depletion of pDCs through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. In cynomolgus monkeys, treatment with VIB7734 reduced pDCs in blood below the lower limit of normal by day 1 after the first dose. In two phase 1 studies in patients with autoimmune diseases, VIB7734 demonstrated an acceptable safety profile, comparable to that of placebo. In individuals with cutaneous lupus, VIB7734 profoundly reduced both circulating and tissue-resident pDCs, with a 97.6% median reduction in skin pDCs at study day 85 in VIB7734-treated participants. Reductions in pDCs in the skin correlated with a decrease in local type I IFN activity as well as improvements in clinical disease activity. Biomarker analysis suggests that responsiveness to pDC depletion therapy may be greater among individuals with high baseline type I IFN activity, supporting a central role for pDCs in type I IFN production in autoimmunity and further development of VIB7734 in IFN-associated diseases.","Karnell, Jodi L; Wu, Yanping; Mittereder, Nanette; Smith, Michael A; Gunsior, Michele; Yan, Li; Casey, Kerry A; Henault, Jill; Riggs, Jeffrey M; Nicholson, Simone M; Sanjuan, Miguel A; Vousden, Katherine A; Werth, Victoria P; Drappa, Jörn; Illei, Gabor G; Rees, William A; Ratchford, John N",Science translational medicine,92,6

METHODS A multidisciplinary committee developed and implemented a series of PSH protocols that included the entire continuum of care from the decision for surgery until 30 days after surgery. Five hundred forty-six subjects were included in the preimplementation phase (Fast Track [T-fast]), and 518 patients were included in the postimplementation phase (PSH). The primary end points of this report are hospital length of stay (LOS), postoperative skilled nursing facility (SNF) bypass rate, and 30-day readmission rate. We used a generalized linear model to assess the effect on LOS while adjusting for potential confounding variables. RESULTS We found that patients assigned to the PSH pathway had a significantly shorter mean LOS compared with patients in the T-fast group (2.4 ± 2.1 days [confidence interval {CI}, 2.2-2.8] vs 3.4 ± 2.9 days [CI, 2.9-3.9]). The SNF bypass rate was significantly higher in the PSH group compared with the T-fast group (94% vs 80%, P = 0.00002, CI, -0.102 to -0.036). There was no difference in the 30 readmission rates between patients managed in the PSH track and the T-fast track (1.2% vs 0.98%). CONCLUSIONS Introduction of the PSH into an integrated delivery system resulted in a simultaneous reduction of LOS and SNF admission for total knee arthroplasty patients.","Qiu, Chunyuan; Cannesson, Maxime; Morkos, Atef; Nguyen, Vu T; LaPlace, Diana; Trivedi, Narendra S; Khachatourians, Armond; Rinehart, Joseph; Kain, Zeev N",Anesthesia and analgesia,92,0

Here, we investigated the risk factors for pre-surgical DOR in patients with ovarian endometriomas and for DOR after laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy for endometriomas and evaluated the feasibility of the pre-surgical prediction of post-surgical DOR based on the Bologna criteria. METHODS A total of 143 patients with ovarian endometriomas who underwent laparoscopic cystectomy from January 2009 to May 2015 at our hospital were prospectively enrolled and evaluated. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations were measured pre-surgically and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. In accordance with the Bologna criteria, the patients whose AMH concentrations were <1.1 ng/mL before surgery and 3 or 6 months after surgery were classified into pre- and post-surgical adverse DOR (aDOR) groups, respectively. RESULTS Thirty-one (21.7 %) of 143 patients were classified as pre-surgical aDOR. Patient age and serum follicle-stimulating hormone level were significantly positively correlated with pre-surgical aDOR [odds ratios (ORs), 1.26 and 1.16; p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively]. Among the remaining 112 patients, 38 patients (33.9 %) had post-surgical aDOR 3 and 6 months after surgery. Bilateral cystectomy was positively correlated with post-surgical aDOR (at 3 months: OR, 4.7; p = 0.001; at 6 months: OR, 3.71; p = 0.006); conversely, pre-surgical serum AMH concentrations were negatively correlated with post-surgical aDOR (at 3 months: OR, 0.65; p = 0.005; at 6 months: OR, 0.43; p < 0.001). The optimal cut-off point of pre-surgical AMH concentrations for predicting aDOR at 3 and 6 months in the patients undergoing unilateral cystectomy was 2.1 ng/mL. In contrast, the optimal cut-off points at 3 and 6 months in the patients undergoing bilateral cystectomy were 3.0 and 3.5 ng/mL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that the pre-surgical serum AMH concentrations and bilateral cystectomy are significant factors for the risk of aDOR following surgery and that predicting post-surgical aDOR according to the Bologna criteria could be feasible using pre-operative measurements of serum AMH concentrations.","Ozaki, Rie; Kumakiri, Jun; Tinelli, Andrea; Grimbizis, Grigoris F; Kitade, Mari; Takeda, Satoru",Journal of ovarian research,92,24

We aimed to investigate the presence of conventional APAs used in the classification of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome in patients with severe lung infection with SARS-CoV-2 and to compare these results with non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS Thirty-one COVID-19 patients (COVID group) and 28 non-COVID-19 critically ill patients (non-COVID group), were included in the study. Anti-cardiolipin (ACA) (IgG, IgM), anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 (Anti-β2GPI) (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and if the patient had not received any anti thrombotic agent before blood collection, lupus anticoagulant (LAC) tests were studied from the plasma of the patients. For testing ACA and Anti-β2GPI, ELISA method was used, while fully automated coagulometer device was used for LAC test. RESULTS APAs were positive in 25.81% in the COVID group (8/31) and 25% in the non-COVID group (7/28). LAC was the most common APA present in 23.08% of the COVID-19 group, who underwent measurement (6/26), while 3.57% of the non-COVID group was LAC positive (1/28) (p = 0.047). In the COVID group, ACA IgM, and IgG were positive in 6.45% and 0%, respectively (2/31 vs 0/31). In the non-COVID group, ACA IgM was not positive in any patient, while ACA IgG was positive in 7.14% (2/28). Anti-β2GPI IgG and IgM tests were not positive in any patient in either the COVID or the non-COVID group. Anti-β2GPI IgA were positive in 6.45% and 14.29%, respectively (2/31 vs 4/28). CONCLUSION In this study, APAs were equally positive in critically ill patients among COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 patients. Only LAC was more observed in COVID-19 patients.KEY MESSAGESIn this study, APAs were equally positive in critically ill patients among COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 related conditions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS During the inaugural American Urological Association 2010 Tissue Ablative course content, validity testing of a renal tumor model was undertaken. Five expert faculty in cryotherapy and RFA techniques for renal tumors performed laparoscopic ultrasonography (US) examination of the tumor model. They performed US guided placement and activation of the treatment probe into the tumor of the model. They completed a questionnaire and rated the quality of the renal tumor model on a 5 point Likert scale. RESULTS All of the subjects assigned a score of 5 of 5 on the Likert scale regarding the ability to identify the tumor with US, were able to deploy the ablative probe into the model under US guidance, and would recommend the use of this teaching model to residents or fellows. They thought that this tumor model was appropriate for teaching laparoscopic US imaging of a renal tumor during ablative treatment procedures, teaching and practicing laparoscopic US-guided cryotherapy, and teaching and practicing laparoscopic US-guided RFA. CONCLUSION We have developed a unique model that simulates small kidney tumors that can be used for training surgeons in ablative techniques.","Fernandez, Alfonso; Chen, Elvis; Moore, John; Peters, Terry M; Cheung, Carling; Erdeljan, Petar; Fuller, Andrew; Pautler, Stephen E; McDougall, Elspeth M",Journal of endourology,92,1

Herein, a new poly(allyltrimethylammonium) grafted chitosan and biochar composite (PATMAC-CTS-BC) was introduced for the removal of selenate (SeO42-) in water. Results suggest that the PATMAC-CTS-BC showed a rapid removal of SeO42- with efficiency of >97% within 10 min and it followed a pseudo-second-order model. High capacity of SeO42- adsorption by the composite was achieved, with maximum value of 98.99 mg·g-1 based on Langmuir model, considerably higher than most of reported adsorbents. The thermodynamic results reflected the spontaneous and exothermic nature of SeO42- adsorption onto the composite. The composite could be applied at a wide initial pH range (2-10) with high removal efficiency of SeO42- because of permanent positive charges of quaternary ammonium groups (=N+-). The removal mechanisms of SeO42- were mainly attributed to electrostatic interactions with =N+- and protonated -NH3+ groups, and redox-complexation interactions with -NH2, -NH-, and -OH groups. Besides SeO42-, the hexavalent chromium (Cr2O72-) was considered as example to further demonstrate the anion removal capability of cationic hydrogel-BC composite. The study outcomes open up new opportunities to efficiently remove anionic heavy metal ions (e.g., SeO42- and Cr2O72-) in water using these materials.","Zhang, Lixun; Jiang, Sunny C; Guan, Yuntao",Environmental research,92,24

METHODS A retrospective review was carried out of 18 SIRS infants born at gestational week 24-28. Eight with blood interleukin (IL)-6 ≥ 1000 pg/mL were treated actively with 2 h PMX-DHP followed by 2 h PMX-DHP and CHDF. Ten with IL-6 < 500 pg/mL were treated conventionally (with neither PMX-DHP nor CHDF) and served as controls. RESULTS Demographic characteristics were similar except for IL-6, arterial-to-alveolar oxygen tension ratio (a/APO2 ), and number of immature neutrophils between the two groups. Baseline a/APO2 was significantly lower in infants with than without active treatment (0.44 vs 0.67, respectively, P = 0.002). After 4 h treatment, the IL-6 decreased to < 500 pg/mL in all eight infants, and a/APO2 improved significantly to 0.62 (P = 0.006). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia occurred in a similar proportion (63%, 5/8 vs 80%, 8/10, respectively), but the number of days on inhaled oxygen (30 vs 47 days, respectively, P = 0.033) and tracheal intubation (36 vs 51 days, respectively, P = 0.040) was significantly lower in infants with than without active treatment. Prevalence of adverse events was similar (13%, 1/8 vs 50%, 5/10 for active vs conventional treatment, respectively).

A remotely delivered LVA that replicates a standard in-clinic assessment may bridge the gap for patients not accessing care due to the limited quantity and distribution of low-vision providers. Within an LVA, an accurate and consistent assessment of refraction error is an essential component. No system has currently been validated for the purposes of a remote LVA. The purpose of this study was to validate a commercially available portable refraction approach in a low-vision population. METHODS Low-vision patients (n = 26) or normally sighted patients (n = 25) underwent a refraction assessment using the Adaptica® 2WIN autorefractor, adaptor scope (Kaleidos) and VisionFit phoropter portable refraction devices, as well as a standard autorefractor (Huvitz) and phoropter (Haag-Streit). Refraction data between systems and populations were compared using intraclass correlations. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the differences between devices. RESULTS Spherical equivalent values were found to be reproducible between standard and experimental autorefraction devices (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.8) in both low-vision and normally sighted groups. Similarly, manifest refraction was highly consistent (ICC > 0.8) between devices in all groups. The Bland-Altman plots showed clinically acceptable mean differences of 0.701 between autorefraction methods and -0.116 between manifest refraction methods. DISCUSSION The 2WIN/VisionFit system can reliably generate refraction values across a spectrum of errors in normally sighted and visually impaired people, and would be feasible to deliver remotely.","Curtis, Rachel; Hazari, Hassan; Eden, Karen; Hopman, Wilma M; Irrcher, Isabella; Bona, Mark D",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,92,17

AIM The aim was to investigate the impact of discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment on patients living with spasticity during the COVID-19 quarantine. DESIGN A multicentric cross-sectional study. SETTING Outpatients setting. POPULATION Patients with spasticity after stroke and traumatic brain injury treated with BoNT-A. METHODS A phone-based survey was conducted from March to May, 2020. Based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), an ad hoc questionnaire CORTOX (CORonavirus TOXin survey) was developed to investigate patients' experiences following the discontinuation of their usual treatment for spasticity due to the lockdown and its implication on their health perception. It assessed patients' condition and explored different ICF domains related to spasticity: unpleasant sensations, mobility, self care, facilitators and psychosocial factors. The sum of those represented the CORTOX score (Max 142). The questionnaire also collected data about the impact of COVID-19 on patients' wellbeing (mood, sleep, relationships, community life, motivation). RESULTS A total of 151 participants completed the survey. The majority of participants (72.2 %) experienced a worsening in perceived spasticity, 53% got worse in independence and 70.9% had a negative impact on quality of life. The mean CORTOX score was 52.85 ± 27.25, reflecting a perceived worsening in all ICF domains investigated. Moderate to strong correlations were found between different subscores of the questionnaire and severity of spasticity (p<0.001). COVID-19 psychosocial related factors were associated with loss of independence (p < 0.05) but only mood was associated with worsening of spasticity (p < 0.001). The lack of rehabilitation therapy was significantly associated with the worsening of independence but not with the worsening of spasticity. Finally, respondents reported that BoNT-A was useful to their condition and should not be discontinued. CONCLUSIONS The discontinuation of BoNT-A treatment was associated with worsening of activities and participation and perceived spasticity. COVID-19 related problems and rehabilitation showed an association with loss of independence.

For intravenous anesthetics however, no decisive evidence in favor of breath concentration monitoring has been presented up until now. At the same time, questions remain with respect to the performance of currently used plasma pharmacokinetic models implemented in target-controlled infusion systems. In this study, we investigate whether breath monitoring of propofol could improve the predictive performance of currently applied, target-controlled infusion models. METHODS Based on data from a healthy volunteer study, we developed an addition to the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model for propofol, to accommodate breath concentration measurements. The potential of using this pharmacokinetic (PK) model in a Bayesian forecasting setting was studied using a simulation study. Finally, by introducing bispectral index monitor (BIS) measurements and the accompanying BIS models into our PK model, we investigated the relationship between BIS and predicted breath concentrations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We show that the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model is easily extended to reliably describe propofol kinetics in exhaled breath. Furthermore, we show that the predictive performance of the a priori model is improved by Bayesian adaptation based on the measured breath concentrations, thereby allowing further treatment individualization and a more stringent control on the targeted plasma concentrations during general anesthesia. Finally, we demonstrated concordance between currently advocated BIS models, relying on predicted effect-site concentrations, and our new approach in which BIS measurements are derived from predicted breath concentrations.","Colin, Pieter; Eleveld, Douglas J; van den Berg, Johannes P; Vereecke, Hugo E M; Struys, Michel M R F; Schelling, Gustav; Apfel, Christian C; Hornuss, Cyrill",Clinical pharmacokinetics,92,24

Methods All first-year medical students at Florida Atlantic University went through three sessions on telemedicine that began with a lecture, followed by a standardized patient interaction, then a small group meeting with clinical faculty. We assessed the sessions using survey questions on a 5-point Likert scale and additional narrative feedback. We also assessed students on a telemedicine objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) at the end of the semester and compared results to the previous year's same case done in person. Results Students overall found the sessions helpful for refining their history-taking skills and that the knowledge gained would be helpful in their future practices. They felt the online platform was a useful way to interact with patients, but had frustrations with technical difficulties. They also expressed a greater appreciation for the ability to perform an in-person physical examination. Students performed similarly on the OSCE station in person compared to virtual visits (mean score 93% vs 93.75%). Conclusion Introducing telemedicine during a first-year medical school clinical skills course provides students with opportunities to refine their clinical skills while introducing a skill that will be commonplace in the postpandemic environment.

METHODS The clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted in the Infectious Diseases Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China from January 22nd, 2020 to March 8th, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. According to whether there were gastrointestinal symptoms (poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea), all patients were divided into gastrointestinal symptom group and asymptomatic group. The characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as poor appetite, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were counted and analyzed, and the correlation between gastrointestinal symptoms and gender, age, basic diseases, disease severity, laboratory examination and drug treatment were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 80 COVID-19 patients were involved, 43 cases (53.8%) presented with poor appetite, 17 cases (21.3%) had nausea and vomiting, and 33 cases (41.3%) had diarrhea. Among them, 5 cases, 1 case and 4 cases respectively preformed poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea before admission, while the others experienced gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours after admission. Duration of poor appetite, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea (days) of all patients were 5.3±2.1, 2.2±1.0 and 1.4±0.9, respectively. The patients with poor appetite were older than those without symptoms (years old: 48.2±17.6 vs. 39.3±15.1), albumin (Alb) level and the lymphocytes ratio were lower than those in asymptomatic group [Alb (g/L): 39.8 (35.7, 45.1) vs. 46.1 (42.6, 49.4), lymphocytes ratio: 0.19 (0.09, 0.28) vs. 0.28 (0.17, 0.35)], while the neutrophil ratio, the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were higher than those in asymptomatic group [the neutrophil ratio: 0.74 (0.61, 0.85) vs. 0.64 (0.52, 0.76), CRP (mg/L): 21.4 (3.9, 52.9) vs. 5.6 (2.4, 14.0), D-dimer (mg/L): 0.2 (0.2, 0.5) vs. 0.2 (0.1, 0.3), LDH (μmol×s-1×L-1): 4.49 (3.59, 5.19) vs. 3.12 (2.77, 4.90)]; at the same time, more traditional Chinese medicine was used in the patients with gastrointestinal symptoms [65.1% (28/43) vs. 40.5% (15/37), all P < 0.05]. In addition, 14 cases of 18 patients with cardiovascular diseases presented with poor appetite, 7 patients had nausea and vomiting symptoms.

OBJECTIVE To describe our experience with endovascular treatment of CSdAVF complicated by ipsilateral IPS occlusion. METHODS From January 2003 through September 2014, a total of 49 CSdAVFs with ipsilateral IPS occlusion were identified in 49 patients, who then underwent endovascular treatment. Clinical and radiologic data were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Either transvenous (n = 38) or transarterial (n = 11) access was initially elected, the latter reserved for single-hole or dominant arterial feeder fistulas. Access via occluded ipsilateral IPS was usually attempted (n = 34) by transvenous approach, with a 54.3% success rate. Anterior (n = 3) or posterior (n = 1) facial vein was alternatively used. Direct surgical exposure of ophthalmic vein (n = 3) or radiosurgery (n = 4) was performed for access failure or unsuccessful occlusion by other means. In 46 fistulas (93.9%), complete occlusion was achieved, with no procedure-related morbidity or mortality. Postprocedural symptom improvement was noted in all but 2 patients, who separately experienced paradoxical worsening of cranial nerve palsy and access failure. CONCLUSION In patients with CSdAVF and ipsilateral IPS occlusion, various treatment strategies may be applied (given angioanatomic suitability), resulting in excellent procedural and short-term follow-up results. Reopening of an occluded IPS is reasonable as an initial access attempt.","Rhim, Jong Kook; Cho, Young Dae; Park, Jeong Jin; Jeon, Jin Pyeong; Kang, Hyun-Seung; Kim, Jeong Eun; Cho, Won-Sang; Han, Moon Hee",Neurosurgery,92,27

The NS is protected by rather complicated multi-layer barriers that allow access to nutrients and facilitate contact with the peripheral tissues, but block entry of pathogens and toxins. Virus infections usually begin in peripheral tissues and if these barriers are weakened, they can spread into the PNS and more rarely into the CNS. Most viral infections of the NS are opportunistic or accidental pathogens that gain access via the bloodstream (e.g., HIV and various arboviruses). But a few have evolved to enter the NS efficiently by invading neurons directly and by exploiting neuronal cell biology (e.g., rhabdoviruses and alphaherpesviruses). Most NS infections are devastating and difficult to manage. Remarkably, the alphaherpesviruses establish life-long quiescent infections in the PNS, with rare but often serious CNS pathology. In this review, we will focus on how alphaherpesviruses gain access to and spread in the NS, with particular emphasis on bidirectional transport and spread within and between neurons and neural circuits, which is regulated by complex viral-host protein interactions. Finally, we will describe the wide use of alphaherpesviruses as tools to study nerve connectivity and function in animal models.","Koyuncu, Orkide O; Enquist, Lynn W; Engel, Esteban A",Current issues in molecular biology,92,1

However, methods for delivering siRNA in vivo to induce this high anticancer activity with low potential side effects are urgently needed. Herein, a folic acid (FA)-modified polydopamine (PDA) nanomedicine used in photothermal therapy was designed for siRNA delivery. The designed nanovector can undergo photothermal conversion with good biocompatibility. Importantly, this genetic nanomedicine was selectively delivered to liver cancer cells by FA through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the siRNA cargo was released from the PDA nanomedicine into the tumor microenvironment by controlled release triggered by pH. More importantly, the genetic nanomedicine not only inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation but also promoted liver cell apoptosis by slowing ROC1 activity, suppressing the Neddylation pathway, enabling the accumulation of apototic factor ATF4 and DNA damage factor P-H2AX. Combined with photothermal therapy, this genetic nanomedicine showed superior inhibition of the growth of liver cancer in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the results indicate that this biodegradable nanomedicine exhibits good target recognition, an effective pH response, application potential for genetic therapy, photothermal imaging and treatment of liver cancer. Therefore, this work contributes to the design of a multifunctional nanoplatform that combines genetic therapy and photothermal therapy for the treatment of liver cancer.","Zhang, Zhanxia; Zhang, Junqian; Tian, Jianhui; Li, Hegen",Journal of nanobiotechnology,92,20

Pre-departure preparation is an essential component to equip trainees with the adequate safety, wellness, and cultural competence needed to engage in a meaningful and mutually beneficial elective. This review seeks to quantify the plethora of pre-departure preparation training available to public health, clinical, and undergraduate trainees across the continuum of education for short-term experiences in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS We performed a systematic review of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid Global Health in February, 2018. A three-concept search was employed and included ""global or international health""; ""education or preparation of personnel/students""; and ""field programs or travel."" The study teamed used PRISMA reporting guidelines to conduct title and full-text reviews and conduct data extraction and analysis. RESULTS The search returned 2506 unique articles. Of these, 55 met inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Ninety one percent (91%) of articles focused on pre-departure trainings for medical students and residents. Nine thematic domains for short-term international field experiences emerged; culture, safety, and project-specific knowledge were the most frequently covered domains while mentorship, professionalism, and emotional wellness and culture shock were least common. Approximately half (53.3%) of studies specifically evaluated the pre-departure component of the international experience using a survey or evaluation form. Recommendations emerged from these evaluations including early engagement with international partners, inclusion of self-reflection exercises and site-specific content, and utilization of interactive approaches in learning. Some institutions face barriers to conducting pre-departure preparation such as lack of dedicated faculty, finances, and institutional support. CONCLUSIONS Interest in pre-departure training for international experiences is growing but few programs conduct and publish evaluations of these trainings. Pre-departure trainings should be developed in partnership with receiving institutions and faculty and incorporate critical self- reflection throughout the experience. In addition to the experience itself, institutions need to evaluate these curricula to better understand how they influence trainees' capacity to effectively engage in LMIC settings.","Kalbarczyk, Anna; Nagourney, Emily; Martin, Nina A; Chen, Victoria; Hansoti, Bhakti",BMC medical education,92,1

CVD is more prevalent among military veterans than nonveterans, and veteran status is associated with higher risk of incident heart disease after controlling for socioeconomic status, other medical diseases, depression, and lifestyle. Many patients seeking care in the Veterans Health Administration, including those who undergo cardiac catheterization, meet the criteria for multimorbidity (defined as ≥ 2 chronic diseases). Observations The Heart Disease Reversal Program (HDRP) is a novel interdisciplinary, multicomponent lifestyle program at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Sacramento VA Medical Center. This program is a streamlined adaptation of behavioral/lifestyle interventions aimed at promoting partial reversal (regression) of atherosclerotic heart disease and achievement of comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction. HDRP was developed and implemented within a VA behavioral medicine clinic and successfully adapted for delivery through videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient satisfaction survey data indicate a very high level of patient acceptability. We found direct-to-patient clinical outreach an effective method for launching a disease reversal program. Conclusions Beyond the clinical benefits to patients, there is significant value and benefit added to the health care system by offering an intervention within the disease reversal paradigm. Efforts of the health care team to reverse a disease can be considered the highest aim of medicine and health care.","Yiaslas, Themis A; Sood, Ajay; Ono, Gregory; Rogers-Soeder, Tara S; Kitazono, Rachel E; Embree, Janelle; Spann, Cynthia; Caputo, Carrie A; Taylor, June; Schaefer, Saul","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",92,32

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective cohort study was performed of biopsy confirmed primary stage I lung cancers treated with RFA. FDG PET and near contemporaneous diagnostic CT imaging pre-ablation, within 30 days post-ablation, and beyond 6 months were independently and retrospectively evaluated for features supportive of recurrence. Time to imaging recurrence by PET (TTR_PET) and by CT (TTR_CT) were determined and compared. FDG avidity of untreated tumors was compared between recurrent and non-recurrent groups. RESULTS Thirteen recurrences after 72 RFA treatments were confirmed by diagnostic CT. All recurrences were associated with focally intense and increasing FDG uptake beyond 6 months (sensitivity 100%; specificity 98.5%). Mean TTR_PET was 14 months compared to mean TTR_CT of 17 months (not statistically significant). Normalized SUVmax and total lesions glycolysis of lung cancers that recurred after RFA was 4.0 and 6.0, respectively compared to 2.8 and 5.0, respectively for cancers that did not recur (p = .068). CONCLUSION A pattern of focally intense and increasing FDG PET uptake has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting recurrent lung cancer following RFA. Surveillance after RFA should include a contrast enhanced diagnostic CT at 1 month to diagnose procedural complications, PET at 6 months as a post-treatment metabolic baseline (with diagnostic CT if PET is abnormal) and alternating diagnostic CTs or PET every 6 months for 2 years.","Wang, Yingbing; Lanuti, Michael; Bernheim, Adam; Shepard, Jo-Anne O; Sharma, Amita","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",92,1

We aimed to describe the glycaemic status pre- and post-pancreatectomy, compare patients' clinical characteristics, group according to pre- and post-pancreatectomy diabetes mellitus (DM) status and identify predictors of post-operative PDM. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients admitted for pancreatic resection at a single institution from 2011 to 2017. Post-operative DM status was determined at the time of discharge or at 30 days post-operation. Longer term DM onset was as documented in medical record subsequent to admission for pancreatic surgery. RESULTS A total of 137 cases were analysed; 13.3% and 24.8% of patients developed post-operative PDM within 30 days and at median of 1 year (range 1-4 years) follow-up, respectively. All patients with pre-existing DM continued to have DM post-operatively. Patients with pre-existing DM were older (P = 0.004) and had a family history of DM (P = 0.020); 8.3% of patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy versus 17.1% of patients who had undergone distal pancreatectomy developed PDM (P = 0.318). A lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.033) was significantly associated with post-operative PDM development. No independent predictors for post-operative PDM were identified. CONCLUSIONS The new development of DM within 30 days post-pancreatectomy occurs in approximately one in seven persons. No patients with pre-existing DM demonstrated a remission of DM post-pancreatectomy. These findings suggest that all patients should be screened for DM pre-operatively and followed up post-operatively, particularly those with pre-existing impaired renal function.","Lee, Cynthia Ying Chian; Depczynski, Barbara; Poynten, Ann; Haghighi, Koroush S",ANZ journal of surgery,92,27

Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging has been proposed as a useful tool to assess microcirculation mostly outside the heart transplantation setting. Instantaneous hyperemic diastolic flow velocity-pressure slope, an intracoronary physiology index, has demonstrated a better correlation with microcirculatory remodelling in cardiac allograft vasculopathy than other indices such as coronary flow velocity reserve. To investigate the potential of magnetic resonance perfusion imaging to detect the presence of microcirculatory remodeling in cardiac allograft vasculopathy, we compared magnetic resonance perfusion data with invasive intracoronary physiological indices to study microcirculation in a population of heart transplantation recipients with macrovascular nonobstructive disease demonstrated with intravascular ultrasound. METHODS We studied 8 heart transplantation recipients (mean age, 61 [12] years, 100% male) with epicardial allograft vasculopathy defined by intravascular ultrasound, nonsignificant coronary stenoses and negative visually-assessed wall-motion/perfusion dobutamine stress magnetic resonance. Quantitative stress and rest magnetic resonance perfusion data to build myocardial perfusion reserve index, noninvasively, and 4 invasive intracoronary physiological indices were determined. RESULTS Postprocessed data showed a mean (standard deviation) myocardial perfusion reserve index of 1.22 (0.27), while fractional flow reserve, coronary flow velocity reserve, hyperemic microvascular resistance and instantaneous hyperemic diastolic flow velocity-pressure slope were 0.98 (0.02), cm/s/mmHg, 2.34 (0.55) cm/s/mmHg, 2.00 (0.69) cm/s/mmHg and 0.91 (0.65) cm/s/mmHg, respectively. The myocardial perfusion reserve index correlated strongly only with the instantaneous hyperemic diastolic flow velocity-pressure slope (r=0.75; P=.033). CONCLUSIONS Myocardial perfusion reserve index derived from a comprehensive dobutamine stress magnetic resonance appears to be a reliable technique for noninvasive detection of microcirculatory coronary disease associated with cardiac allograft vasculopathy.","Mirelis, Jesús G; García-Pavía, Pablo; Cavero, Miguel A; González-López, Esther; Echavarria-Pinto, Mauro; Pastrana, Miguel; Segovia, Javier; Oteo, Juan F; Alonso-Pulpón, Luis; Escaned, Javier",Revista espanola de cardiologia,92,1

CHIKV targets the joints, resulting in symmetric polyarthritis that clinically mimics rheumatoid arthritis and can endure for months to years. At present, no approved treatment is effective in preventing or controlling CHIKV infection or disease. We treated mice with eight different disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and identified CLTA4-Ig (abatacept) and tofacitinib as candidate therapies based on their ability to decrease acute joint swelling. CTLA4-Ig reduced T cell accumulation in the joints of infected animals without affecting viral infection. Whereas monotherapy with CTLA4-Ig or a neutralizing anti-CHIKV human monoclonal antibody provided partial clinical improvement, therapy with both abolished swelling and markedly reduced levels of chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and infiltrating leukocytes. Thus, combination CTLA4-Ig and antiviral antibody therapy controls acute CHIKV infection and arthritis and may be a candidate for testing in humans.","Miner, Jonathan J; Cook, Lindsey E; Hong, Jun P; Smith, Amber M; Richner, Justin M; Shimak, Raeann M; Young, Alissa R; Monte, Kristen; Poddar, Subhajit; Crowe, James E; Lenschow, Deborah J; Diamond, Michael S",Science translational medicine,92,22

Occurrence of EV-content delivery within acceptor cells has not been unambiguously demonstrated, let alone quantified, and remains debated. Here, we developed a cell-based assay in which EVs containing luciferase- or fluorescent-protein tagged cytosolic cargoes are loaded on unlabeled acceptor cells. Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and temperature-block experiments suggest that EV uptake is a low yield process (~1% spontaneous rate at 1 h). Further characterization of this limited EV uptake, through fractionation of membranes and cytosol, revealed cytosolic release (~30% of the uptaken EVs) in acceptor cells. This release is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and overexpression of IFITM proteins, which prevent virus entry and fusion. Our results show that EV content release requires endosomal acidification and suggest the involvement of membrane fusion.","Bonsergent, Emeline; Grisard, Eleonora; Buchrieser, Julian; Schwartz, Olivier; Théry, Clotilde; Lavieu, Grégory",Nature communications,92,16

To understand this process, deletion analysis was used to identify the region of eIF3-f that is required for its proteolysis. Here, we report that the highly conserved C-terminal domain of eIF3-f is implicated for MAFbx-directed polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Site-directed mutagenesis of eIF3-f revealed that the six lysine residues within this domain are required for full polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. In addition, mutation of these six lysines (mutant K(5-10)R) displayed hypertrophic activity in cellulo and in vivo and was able to protect against starvation-induced muscle atrophy. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the C-terminal modifications, believed to be critical for proper eIF3-f regulation, are essential and contribute to a fine-tuning mechanism that plays an important role for eIF3-f function in skeletal muscle.","Csibi, Alfredo; Leibovitch, Marie Pierre; Cornille, Karen; Tintignac, Lionel A; Leibovitch, Serge A",The Journal of biological chemistry,92,14

The Assam Police, India started telephone helplines to address the psychological issues. Aims To evaluate the sociodemographic profile of the distress callers, their psychosocial concerns, the interventions provided by the service provider, and whether the service users were satisfied with the intervention(s) or not. Method It was a cross-sectional study done during the period of lockdown (7-24 April 2020). All the callers who called the helpline were screened for anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts (when required), and the psychosocial issues which they were facing were explored. They were provided the psychological intervention(s) at the appropriate time, and they were asked to rate their experience at the end. Results A total of 239 callers used the tele-counselling services. The majority of callers were male (79.1%). Most of the callers were between 19-35 years of age group (66.5%), married (52.5%), and graduates (31%). Two-thirds of the callers called to seek guidance for their own issues and one-third for their relatives or friends. Callers had anxiety (46%), depressive disorder (8.3%), and depressive symptoms not qualifying for depressive disorder (14%), and suicidal thoughts (5.44%). The commonest intervention provided to the callers was supportive (77.8%), followed by psychoeducation (30.5%), cognitive behaviour therapy (24.7%), relaxation (23.6%) and behaviour therapy (13.4%).

Methods To evaluate self-reported medication use in relation to urine drug metabolite levels in a large cohort of CKD patients, the Germany Chronic Kidney Disease study, we ascertained self-reported use of 158 substances and 41 medication groups and coded active ingredients according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. We used a nontargeted mass spectrometry-based approach to quantify metabolites in urine; calculated specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of medication use and corresponding metabolite measurements; and used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations and prescription patterns. Results Among 4885 participants, there were 108 medication-drug metabolite pairs based on reported medication use and 78 drug metabolites. Accuracy was excellent for measurements of 36 individual substances in which the unchanged drug was measured in urine (median, 98.5%; range 61.1%-100%). For 66 pairs of substances and their related drug metabolites, median measurement-based specificity and sensitivity were 99.2% (range 84.0%-100%) and 71.7% (range 1.2%-100%), respectively. Commonly prescribed medications for hypertension and cardiovascular risk reduction-including angiotensin-II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and metoprolol-showed high sensitivity and specificity. Although self-reported use of prescribed analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) was <3% each, drug metabolite levels indicated higher usage (acetaminophen, 10%-26%; ibuprofen, 10%-18%). Conclusions This comprehensive screen of associations between urine drug metabolite levels and self-reported medication use supports the use of pharmacometabolomics to assess medication adherence and prescription patterns in persons with CKD, and indicates underreported use of medications available over the counter, such as analgesics.","Kotsis, Fruzsina; Schultheiss, Ulla; Wuttke, Matthias; Schlosser, Pascal; Mielke, Johanna; Becker, Michael; Oefner, Peter; Karoly, Edward; Mohney, Robert; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Sekula, Peggy; Köttgen, Anna",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,92,19

However, the effects of tocovid on anti-inflammation in ischemic model remain elusive. In the present study, we assessed the effects of Tocovid pretreatment on anti-inflammatory effects after transient middle cerebral occlusion (tMCAO) in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated the therapeutic and anti-inflammatory effects of tocovid pretreatment (200 mg/kg per day, for 1 month) on mice brain under 60 minutes of tMCAO. The expressive changes of inflammatory markers were observed after tMCAO in mice. RESULTS Tocovid pretreatment greatly improved the mice neurobehaviors, reduced infarct volumes and decreased expressions of inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and ionized calcium binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba-1), and improved the damage of neurovascular units including matrix metallopeptidase 9, IgG and collagen IV after tMCAO.

Prescribed IVTM play an essential role in the treatment of illness, management of chronic conditions and in maintaining health and wellbeing. The intravenous (IV) route is the administration of concentrated medications (diluted or undiluted) directly into peripherally or centrally inserted vascular access devices. Medication safety is a key priority and best practice standards are required to guide the safe preparation and administration of IVTM. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines. Our search will include studies concerned with the preparation and/or administration of IVTM via peripheral or central vascular access devices. We will be guided by the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) in this review. Literature will include all trial designs, national/international guidelines, and expert consensus opinion made available in English from 2009 to present day. Conclusions: We will synthesise the evidence concerning safe and effective preparation and administration of intravenous therapy and medicines to inform the development of a national guideline for healthcare professionals in Ireland. The availability of up-to-date, contemporaneous evidence-based practice standards will ensure quality and safety for service-users.

85257,85257,85257,Totally Endoscopic Resection of Giant Left Atrial Myxoma Without Robotic Assistance.,15.542113,8.040127,2018,"Mammalian orthoreovirus attachment to target cells is mediated by the outer capsid protein σ1, which projects from the virion surface. The σ1 protein is a homotrimer consisting of a filamentous tail, which is partly inserted into the virion; a body domain constructed from β-spiral repeats; and a globular head with receptor-binding properties. The σ1 tail is predicted to form an α-helical coiled coil. Although σ1 undergoes a conformational change during cell entry, the nature of this change and its contributions to viral replication are unknown. Electron micrographs of σ1 molecules released from virions identified three regions of flexibility, including one at the midpoint of the molecule, that may be involved in its structural rearrangement. To enable a detailed understanding of essential σ1 tail organization and properties, we determined high-resolution structures of the reovirus type 1 Lang (T1L) and type 3 Dearing (T3D) σ1 tail domains. Both molecules feature extended α-helical coiled coils, with T1L σ1 harboring central chloride ions. Each molecule displays a discontinuity (stutter) within the coiled coil and an unexpectedly seamless transition to the body domain. The transition region features conserved interdomain interactions and appears rigid rather than highly flexible. Functional analyses of reoviruses containing engineered σ1 mutations suggest that conserved residues predicted to stabilize the coiled-coil-to-body junction are essential for σ1 folding and encapsidation, whereas central chloride ion coordination and the stutter are dispensable for efficient replication. Together, these findings enable modeling of full-length reovirus σ1 and provide insight into the stabilization of a multidomain virus attachment protein.IMPORTANCE While it is established that different conformational states of attachment proteins of enveloped viruses mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion, less is understood about how such proteins mediate attachment and entry of nonenveloped viruses. The filamentous reovirus attachment protein σ1 binds cellular receptors; contains regions of predicted flexibility, including one at the fiber midpoint; and undergoes a conformational change during cell entry. Neither the nature of the structural change nor its contribution to viral infection is understood. We determined crystal structures of large σ1 fragments for two different reovirus serotypes. We observed an unexpectedly tight transition between two domains spanning the fiber midpoint, which allows for little flexibility. Studies of reoviruses with engineered changes near the σ1 midpoint suggest that the stabilization of this region is critical for function. Together with a previously determined structure, we now have a complete model of the full-length, elongated reovirus σ1 attachment protein.","Dietrich, Melanie H; Ogden, Kristen M; Long, Jacob M; Ebenhoch, Rebecca; Thor, Alexandra; Dermody, Terence S; Stehle, Thilo",Journal of virology,92,1

POCT efficiency and effectiveness have the potential to facilitate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) detection, decrease risks of co-infections for critically ill COVID-19 patients, and improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare. OBJECTIVES To assess AMR identification using POCT, describe the United States AMR Diagnostic Challenge, and improve global standards of care for infectious diseases. Data Sources PubMed, WWW, and other sources were searched for papers focusing on AMR and POCT. EndNote X9.1 (Clarivate Analytics) consolidated abstracts, URLs, and PDFs representing ~500 articles assessed for relevance. Panelist insights at Tri•Con 2020 in San Francisco and finalist POC technologies competing for a US $20,000,000 AMR prize are summarized. CONCLUSIONS Co-infections represent high risks for COVID-19 patients. POCT potentially will help target specific pathogens, refine choices for antimicrobial drugs, and prevent excess morbidity and mortality. POC assays that identify patterns of pathogen resistance can help tell us how infected individuals spread AMR, where geospatial hotspots are located, when delays cause death, and how to deploy preventative resources. Shared AMR data ""clouds"" could help reduce critical care burden during pandemics and optimize therapeutic options, similar to use of antibiograms in individual hospitals. Multidisciplinary healthcare personnel should learn the principles and practice of POCT, so they can meet needs with rapid diagnostic testing. The stakes are high. AMR is projected to cause millions of deaths annually and cumulative financial loses in the trillions by 2050.","Kost, Gerald J",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,92,31

It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 new infections annually in Egypt, the country with the highest HCV prevalence. An effective vaccine would help control this expanding global health burden. HCV is highly variable, and an effective vaccine should target conserved T- and B-cell epitopes of the virus. Conserved B-cell epitopes overlapping the CD81 receptor-binding site (CD81bs) on the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein have been reported previously and provide promising vaccine targets. In this study, we isolated 73 human mAbs recognizing five distinct antigenic regions on the virus envelope glycoprotein complex E1E2 from an HCV-immune phage-display antibody library by using an exhaustive-panning strategy. Many of these mAbs were broadly neutralizing. In particular, the mAb AR4A, recognizing a discontinuous epitope outside the CD81bs on the E1E2 complex, has an exceptionally broad neutralizing activity toward diverse HCV genotypes and protects against heterologous HCV challenge in a small animal model. The mAb panel will be useful for the design and development of vaccine candidates to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies to HCV.","Giang, Erick; Dorner, Marcus; Prentoe, Jannick C; Dreux, Marlène; Evans, Matthew J; Bukh, Jens; Rice, Charles M; Ploss, Alexander; Burton, Dennis R; Law, Mansun",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,92,1

METHODS All the data for patients undergoing robotic distal pancreatectomy (RDP) were prospectively collected. RESULTS A total of 66 patients were included, with 33 in each group. The console time was significantly shorter in the RDP-SP group than in the RDP-S group (165 minutes vs. 220 minutes). The median blood loss was 50 cm3 in the RDP-SP group and 100 cm3 in the RDP-S group. The surgical morbidity was significantly lower in RDP-SP group (18% vs. 58%). Spleen infarction (15%), gastric varices (6%) and perigastric varices (45%) after RDP-SP were not associated with any subsequent complication. Postoperative platelet count and white blood cell (WBC) count were significantly higher in the RDP-S group. CONCLUSIONS Both RDP-SP and RDP-S are feasible in selected patients. RDP-SP is feasible and time-saving. Although gastric/perigastric varices and spleen infarction are not uncommon after RDP-SP, they appear to be clinically irrelevant.","Wang, Shin-E; Shyr, Bor-Uei; Chen, Shih-Chin; Shyr, Yi-Ming",The international journal of medical robotics + computer assisted surgery : MRCAS,92,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty healthy volunteers were investigated during 4 experimental steps: baseline, hyperoxia, ischemia, and reperfusion. For each volunteer, 2 sensors INVOS and 2 sensors EQUANOX were placed on both left and right calves. Blood pressure, heart rate, and peripheral pulse oximetry were monitored. RESULTS Peripheral rSO2 ranged from 40% to 95% (INVOS) and from 47% to 100% (EQUANOX): 81±12 vs 82±9 (P=.469). A significant relationship was found at baseline between absolute values of INVOS and EQUANOX (n=40; R2=0.159; P=.011). Bias was -0.4%, and limits of agreement were ±15.1%. The percent maximum differences vs baseline values during dynamic maneuvers were 33%±19% (95% confidence interval, 24-42) and 21%±14% (95% confidence interval, 15-28) for INVOS and EQUANOX, respectively. No significant relationship was observed between percent maximum differences in INVOS and EQUANOX (n=20; R2=0.128; P=.122). Rates of desaturation/resaturation during occlusive vascular tests were 3.65% per minute vs 2.36% per minute (P=.027) and 30.42% per minute vs 16.28% per minute (P=.004) for INVOS and EQUANOX, respectively.

Healthcare workers who face potential COVID-19 exposure are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Estimating the prevalence of infection among healthcare professionals, determining the related risk factors and applying effective infection control measures are essential for the continuity of the health system. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers in our hospital who have participated extensively in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In the study, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody test results of 774 healthcare workers between March 24, 2020, and September 10, 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Age, sex, profession, and the status of being diagnosed with COVID-19 before the antibody test were determined for the healthcare workers in the study. When the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody results were evaluated, it was determined that 57 healthcare workers were positive, 708 healthcare workers were negative, and 9 healthcare workers were borderline. The seroprevalence among the workers of our hospital was found to be 7.4%. The antibody positivity rate was 75.6% in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and/or thoracic computed tomography and it was found to be 3.5% in individuals without the diagnosis. The semi-quantitative antibody index values of the healthcare workers who were seropositive and diagnosed with COVID-19 before the test (n= 31) and those who did not (n= 26) were statistically compared and a significant difference was found between the two groups (p<0.01). In our study, the highest seropositivity was observed among residents (12.3%) and among nurses (11.1%), respectively. When the seropositivity rates of the residents and the nurses were compared with other occupational groups, the differences were found to be statistically significant (p= 0.04, p= 0.04, respectively). In conclusion, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was determined as 7.4% among healthcare workers in a tertiary hospital with high patient admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering that SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was announced as 0.81% in the press release made by the Ministry of Health of Turkey in July 2020, it is seen that the rate of seroprevalence among health care workers is significantly larger than the community. Determination of the seroprevalence in the general population and large-scale studies are needed for risk assessment in healthcare professionals.","Özdemir, Adem; Demir Çuha, Mervenur; Telli Dizman, Gülçin; Alp, Alpaslan; Metan, Gökhan; Şener, Burçin",Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,92,17

To avoid retention, a PillCam patency capsule (PC) is used in patients with suspected intestinal stenosis. However, a relatively low positive predictive value of the PC examination has been reported previously. The aims of this study were to clarify the accuracy of PC examination and to evaluate clinical factors related to cases of false-positive detection. METHODS We performed a retrospective single-center study of 282 consecutive patients referred for PC examination. Patients in which the PC could not pass through the small bowel within 33 h were classified into the 'no patency' group. The 'no patency' group was investigated for evidence of significant stenosis upon further examinations, including CE, double-balloon endoscopy, and small bowel follow-through after PC examination. Clinical factors related to small bowel patency and false-positive cases were evaluated. RESULTS We included 161 male (57.1%) and 121 female (42.9%) patients with a mean age of 47.5 ± 17.7 years. Of the 282 patients enrolled, 27 patients exhibited 'no patency' upon PC examination. Multivariate analysis showed that clinical factors related to 'no patency' included Crohn's disease, abdominal symptoms, stenosis upon imaging, and previous abdominal surgery. Upon further examination, nine cases in the 'no patency' group had significant stenosis. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of PC examination for detecting small bowel stenosis were 93.8%, 96.6%, 99.6%, and 62.5%, respectively, and the only clinical factor related to false-positive cases was constipation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION We found a relatively low positive predictive value of PC examination and that constipation was related to false-positive results.

To investigate the longitudinal transition of phylogenetic feature of HCoV-OC43 S gene in a community, phylogenetic analysis of the S1 region of S gene was conducted using 208 strains detected in Yamagata during 2010-2017 with reference strains of genotype. The S1 sequences were divisible into four groups: A-D. All Yamagata strains belonged to either group B or group D. In group B, 46 (90.2%) out of 51 Yamagata strains were clustered with those of genotype E reference strains (cluster E). In group D, 28 (17.8%) and 122 (77.7%) out of 157 Yamagata strains were clustered respectively with genotype F and genotype G reference strains. In cluster G, 28 strains formed a distinct cluster. Monthly distributions of HCoV-OC43 in Yamagata in 2010-2017 revealed that group B and group D appeared one after another. In group B, the cluster E strains were prevalent recurrently.

METHODS Five thousand, five hundred and fifty-five pregnant women from antenatal clinics in 16 hospitals in England were invited to complete a survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of women currently BP self-monitoring. Secondary outcomes included self-monitoring schedules and women's interactions with clinicians regarding self-monitoring. Population characteristics including risk factors for preeclampsia, ethnicity and deprivation level were considered. RESULTS Completed surveys were received and analysed from 5181 pregnant women (93% response rate). Comparison to hospital demographic data suggests that respondents were representative of the UK population. Nine hundred and eighty-three of 5181 (19%) women were currently self-monitoring their BP, constituting 189 of 389 (49%) hypertensive women and 794 of 4792 (17%) normotensive women. However, only 482 of 983 (49%) reported ever sharing this information with antenatal care teams. Of those who self-monitored, 68% (668/983) were able to provide a previous BP reading, compared with 1% (67/5181) of those who did not self-monitor. CONCLUSION Many women are now choosing to self-monitor their BP during pregnancy and clinicians should enquire about this proactively and consider providing better information on BP monitoring. Those who self-monitor appear to have better knowledge about their blood pressure. If these findings were replicated nationwide, around 125 000 pregnant women would be currently self-monitoring BP in the UK, yet only half of these women may communicate their readings to their antenatal care teams, suggesting a missed opportunity for enhanced care. Current trials will make the place of self-monitoring in pregnancy clearer.","Tucker, Katherine L; Hodgkinson, James; Wilson, Hannah M; Crawford, Carole; Stevens, Richard; Lay-Flurrie, Sarah; Dale, Madeleine; Astbury, Nerys; Chappell, Lucy C; McManus, Richard J",Journal of hypertension,92,31

Logistic regression analysis was performed on variables for mortality and major adverse events. Then, a propensity score analysis was adjusted for imbalances in baseline characteristics between patients with or without neoadjuvant treatment. RESULTS Operative mortality was 7.8%. Surgical, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and infectious complications rates were 14.9%, 14.1%, 11.5%, and 2.7%, respectively. None of these complications were predicted by the performance of a neoadjuvant therapy. Operative mortality analysis, adjusted for the propensity scores, identified age greater than 65 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.9; P < .001), underweight body mass index category (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0; P = .009), American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 3 or greater (OR, 2.310; 95% CI, 1.615-3.304; P < .001), right laterality of the procedure (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .011), performance of an extended pneumonectomy (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.1; P = .018), and absence of systematic lymphadenectomy (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8; P = .027) as risk predictors. Induction therapy (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9; P = .005) and overweight body mass index category (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P = .033) were protective factors. CONCLUSIONS Several risk factors for major adverse early outcomes after pneumonectomy for cancer were identified. Overweight patients and those who received induction therapy had paradoxically lower adjusted risks of mortality.","Thomas, Pascal A; Berbis, Julie; Baste, Jean-Marc; Le Pimpec-Barthes, Françoise; Tronc, François; Falcoz, Pierre-Emmanuel; Dahan, Marcel; Loundou, Anderson",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,92,1

Methods: United States adults (N = 1607) completed a health-related questionnaire during COVID-19 and associated shelter-in-place. We categorized respondents into 4 groups of SWF at the time of the pandemic: ""Never,"" ""< 1x a week,"" ""1x a week,"" or ""> 1x a week."" Results: The proportion of adults never weighing increased during the pandemic (15% to 25%), whereas the proportion of those weighing < 1x week went down (41% to 29%). Higher SWF was significantly associated with changes in energy expenditure including increased total physical activity (PA), lower likelihood of decreases in vigorous, moderate, and walking PA, and a lower likelihood of sitting more. More frequent self-weighing also was associated statistically with lower likelihood of keeping unhealthy eating behaviors the same. Conversely, there was no significant difference in changes in alcohol, caffeine, takeout, fruit or vegetable consumption, and television viewing among SWF groups. Conclusion: SWF decreased during the pandemic in the lower 2 SWF categories. Higher SWF was associated with fewer negative changes in health behaviors, especially related to PA.","Cooper, Jamie A; vanDellen, Michelle; Bhutani, Surabhi",American journal of health behavior,92,8

The aim of this paper is to discuss the practicalities of using emerging technologies to address elderly loneliness and its implications and adaptations to the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019. Design/methodology/approach The authors draw on examples from the literature and their own observations from working with older adults, to provide an overview of possible ways technology could help this population in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Findings Technological advancements have offered remarkable opportunities to deliver care and maintain connections despite the need to stay physically separated. These tools can be integrated into crisis communications, public health responses, and care programs to address loneliness among the elderly. However, it must be done strategically and informed by the type of loneliness at play, environmental factors, socioeconomics, and technological literacy. Originality Technological advancements can be a valuable tool in addressing known public health concerns, such as loneliness among the elderly populations. However, the use of this tool should be governed by the specific situation at hand, taking into consideration individual needs and environmental factors, especially the compounded effects caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Different technological programs and approaches are appropriate for different types of loneliness. For example, online therapy such as internet-based cognitive behavior therapy may mitigate loneliness caused by fear; online interaction such as videoconferencing may relieve loneliness caused by lack of social engagement. Practical implications Care-providing organizations and policy makers should consider the risk of loneliness while responding to COVID-19 outbreak, particularly within elderly populations. As part of a broader plan, technological solutions as well as low-tech approaches can make a difference in mitigating loneliness. Solutions should be accessible to and usable by older adults. Provision of equipment, training, and guidance may be necessary to execute a technology-centric plan; for some communities and individuals, approaches that do not rely on advanced technology may be more effective.","Conroy, Kristina M; Krishnan, Srikripa; Mittelstaedt, Stacy; Patel, Sonny S",Working with older people,92,1

The newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and reemerging influenza virus cause disproportionate disease in the aged, who are also notoriously difficult to successfully vaccinate, likely due to immunosenescence. To protect against future emerging strains, vaccine platforms should induce broad cross-reactive immunity that is sufficient to protect from homologous and heterologous challenge in all ages. From initial studies, we hypothesized that attenuated Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE) replicon particle (VRP) vaccine glycoproteins mediated vaccine failure in the aged. We then compared the efficacies of vaccines bearing attenuated (VRP(3014)) or wild-type VEE glycoproteins (VRP(3000)) in young and aged mice within novel models of severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. Aged animals receiving VRP(3000)-based vaccines were protected from SARS-CoV disease, while animals receiving the VRP(3014)-based vaccines were not. The superior protection for the aged observed with VRP(3000)-based vaccines was confirmed in a lethal influenza virus challenge model. While the VRP(3000) vaccine's immune responses in the aged were sufficient to protect against lethal homologous and heterologous challenge, our data suggest that innate defects within the VRP(3014) platform mediate vaccine failure. Exploration into the mechanism(s) of successful vaccination in the immunosenescent should aid in the development of successful vaccine strategies for other viral diseases disproportionately affecting the elderly, like West Nile virus, influenza virus, norovirus, or other emerging viruses of the future.","Sheahan, Timothy; Whitmore, Alan; Long, Kristin; Ferris, Martin; Rockx, Barry; Funkhouser, William; Donaldson, Eric; Gralinski, Lisa; Collier, Martha; Heise, Mark; Davis, Nancy; Johnston, Robert; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,92,1

The role of surgery is to achieve complete resection. AIM To present the outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for stage III or IVa thymoma. METHODS Retrospective review of patients undergoing open surgery for stage III or IVa thymoma between 2016 and 2020 at a single centre was performed. Preoperative imaging, treatment plan, surgical approach, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Forty-seven patients underwent surgery for thymoma. Patients with clinical stage I/II thymoma or minimally invasive thymectomy were excluded. Thirteen patients with clinical stage III or IVa were included. Median sternotomy approach was used in four patients, of which one was redo sternotomy; a hemi-clamshell in four; and a combination of approaches in the remaining five patients. There was no postoperative mortality. Four patients had postoperative complications. Complete resection was achieved in all but two patients. At a median follow-up of 17.9 months, all patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence except one who died 4 months after surgery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS Surgery for stage III and IVa thymoma is safe and can be achieved with complete macroscopic resection. To obtain adequate exposure of all structures involved in the tumour, combined surgical approaches can be used with no increased morbidity.

In the time of the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic, with a massive number of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, the open tracheal suction technique (OTST) represents a serious threat for medical workers, even if they are wearing full personal protective equipment. Closed tracheal suction systems (CTSS) allow the removal of tracheobronchial secretions without disconnecting ventilatory circuits, preventing alveolar derecruitment, gas exchange deterioration and hypoxia. CTSS reduce the risk of pathogens entering the respiratory circuit and appear to be a cost-effective solution.

Due to their clinical significance, we explored disease associations of the APOE genotypes using a hypothesis-free, data-driven, phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach. METHODS We used data from the UK Biobank to screen for associations between APOE genotypes and over 950 disease outcomes using genotype ε3ε3 as a reference. Data was restricted to 337,484 white British participants (aged 37-73 years). FINDINGS After correction for multiple testing, PheWAS analyses identified associations with 37 outcomes, representing 18 distinct diseases. As expected, ε3ε4 and ε4ε4 genotypes associated with increased odds of AD (p ≤ 7.6 × 10-46), hypercholesterolaemia (p ≤ 7.1 × 10-17) and ischaemic heart disease (p ≤ 2.3 × 10-4), while ε2ε3 provided protection for the latter two conditions (p ≤ 3.7 × 10-10) compared to ε3ε3. In contrast, ε4-associated disease protection was seen against obesity, chronic airway obstruction, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, and liver disease (all p ≤ 5.2 × 10-4) while ε2ε2 homozygosity increased risks of peripheral vascular disease, thromboembolism, arterial aneurysm, peptic ulcer, cervical disorders, and hallux valgus (all p ≤ 6.1 × 10-4). Sensitivity analyses using brain neuroimaging, blood biochemistry, anthropometric, and spirometric biomarkers supported the PheWAS findings on APOE associations with respective disease outcomes. INTERPRETATION PheWAS confirms strong associations between APOE and AD, hypercholesterolaemia, and ischaemic heart disease, and suggests potential ε4-associated disease protection and harmful effects of the ε2ε2 genotype, for several conditions.

The goal of this study was to explore the association between NPT use and infection after cesarean delivery among obese women. METHODS We initiated a hospital protocol wherein women with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or greater who delivered after January 1, 2011 were to receive NPT following cesarean section. A retrospective comparison of surgical site infection (SSI) in women receiving the intervention to a similar group with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, a historical control group of women who delivered before January 1, 2011. Incidence of SSI was compared between time periods using logistic regression models. RESULTS A total of 233 patients in the preintervention (control) group and 234 patients in the intervention group were included in the analysis. In the control group, 23 (9.9%) developed SSI, compared with 13 (5.6%) in the intervention group. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, women in the postintervention period experienced a statistically significant reduction in SSI rates (adjusted odds ratio =0.45, 95% CI = 0.22-0.95); P = .04). CONCLUSION Implementation of a hospital protocol of NPT following cesarean delivery in obese women resulted in reduced incidence of postoperative SSI. This study suggests that using NPT after cesarean delivery in women with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 is an efficacious method to reduce incidence of postoperative wound infections.","Looby, Maureen Ayers; Vogel, Rachel Isaksson; Bangdiwala, Ananta; Hyer, Barbara; Das, Kamalini",Surgical innovation,92,30

Here, we investigated the role of MTA1 in the regulation of expression and function of MyD88, a proximal component of NF-κB signaling. We discovered that MTA1 targets MyD88 and that MyD88 is a NF-κB-responsive gene in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We found that MTA1 is required for MyD88-dependent stimulation of NF-κB signaling and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, MIP2, and TNF-α as MTA1 depletion leads to a substantial reduction in the expression of NF-κB target genes. In addition, LPS-mediated stimulation of MyD88 transcription was accompanied by an enhanced recruitment of MTA1, RNA polymerase II, and p65RelA complex to the NF-κB consensus sites in the MyD88 promoter. Interestingly, the recruitment of both MTA1 and MyD88 expression is effectively blocked by NF-κB inhibitor parthenolide. Selective knockdown of MyD88 by a dominant negative mutant of MyD88 or selective siRNA also impairs the ability of LPS to stimulate the NF-κB target genes. These findings reveal an inherent coregulatory role of MTA1 upon the expression of MyD88 and suggest that MTA1 regulation of MyD88 may constitute at least one of the mechanisms by which MTA1 stimulates LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in stimulated macrophages.","Pakala, Suresh B; Reddy, Sirigiri Divijendra Natha; Bui-Nguyen, Tri M; Rangparia, Siddharth S; Bommana, Anitha; Kumar, Rakesh",The Journal of biological chemistry,92,29

The automated propofol-remifentanil titration by Bispectral Index (BIS) (AutoTIVA) avoids period of deep (BIS<40) anesthesia and could potentially decrease the ED. The aim of this study was to evaluate ED in surgical patients under AutoTIVA, manual titration of propofol-remifentanil (ManualTIVA) or volatile BIS-guided GA. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate age-related postoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) changes. METHODS One hundred and thirty-two adult patients scheduled for elective urologic surgery were randomized in: AutoTIVA, desflurane (DES), sevoflurane (SEVO), ManualTIVA anesthesia. The MMSE was performed before GA and 15 minutes after tracheal extubation. RESULTS The percentage of BIS 40-60 was significantly higher in the AutoTIVA compared to DES, SEVO and ManualTIVA (87% vs. 78 %, 58%, 39%, respectively; P≤0.001). The percentage of BIS<40 was significantly lower in AutoTIVA than in the other groups (P<0.001). No difference in hemodynamics was found among groups. Postoperative MMSE scores were similar to baseline in the AutoTIVA (26 [24-28] vs. 26 [23-28]) while they markedly decreased in all other groups (P<0.001). Postoperative MMSE decreased at any age. None experienced awareness was recorded. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that patients treated with AutoTIVA performed better in the cognitive test compared to the other groups receiving manual target-controlled GA due to a higher adequate level of anesthesia measured by BIS. Cognitive tests should be performed to test ED in all patients undergoing GA.","Cotoia, Antonella; Mirabella, Lucia; Beck, Renata; Matrella, Pompeo; Assenzo, Valentina; Chazot, Thierry; Cinnella, Gilda; Liu, Ngai; Dambrosio, Michele",Minerva anestesiologica,92,26

They contribute to anti-pathogen host defense responses by directly killing a diverse range of microbes. Of note, θ-defensins also modulate microbe-induced inflammation by affecting the production of soluble tumor necrosis factor (sTNF) and other proinflammatory cytokines. Here, we report that natural rhesus macaque θ-defensin (RTD) isoforms regulate sTNF cellular release by inhibiting TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE; also known as adisintegrin and metalloprotease 17; ADAM17), the primary pro-TNF sheddase. Dose-dependent inhibition of cellular TACE activity by RTDs occurred when leukocytes were stimulated with live Escherichia coli cells as well as numerous Toll-like receptor agonists. Moreover, the relative inhibitory potencies of the RTD isoforms strongly correlated with their suppression of TNF release by stimulated blood leukocytes and THP-1 monocytes. RTD isoforms also inhibited ADAM10, a sheddase closely related to TACE. TACE inhibition was abrogated by introducing a single opening in the RTD-1 backbone, demonstrating that the intact macrocycle is required for enzyme inhibition. Enzymologic analyses showed that RTD-1 is a fast binding, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of TACE. We conclude that θ-defensin-mediated inhibition of pro-TNF proteolysis by TACE represents a rapid mechanism for the regulation of sTNF and TNF-dependent inflammatory pathways. Molecules with structural and functional features mimicking those of θ-defensins may have clinical utility as TACE inhibitors for managing TNF-driven diseases.","Schaal, Justin B; Maretzky, Thorsten; Tran, Dat Q; Tran, Patti A; Tongaonkar, Prasad; Blobel, Carl P; Ouellette, André J; Selsted, Michael E",The Journal of biological chemistry,92,1

We explored attitudes of Israeli health-care-professionals (HCPs) towards the disclosure of challenging findings: variants of uncertain clinical significance (VUS), susceptibility loci (SL) for neurodevelopmental disorders and variants associated with adult-onset conditions. Particularly, we sought their views on providing parental choice regarding the disclosure of these findings. METHODS 29 in-depth interviews were conducted with genetic counselors (n=19), medical geneticists (n=4), medical geneticists that are trained in and practice fetal medicine (n=3) and fetal medicine experts (n=3). RESULTS Most participants (n=24) supported parental choice regarding uncertain genetic information. Engaging parents in disclosure decisions allows avoidance from potentially anxiety-provoking information, practicing parental autonomy and better preparation in cases where uncertain findings are identified. HCPs believed that given appropriate preparation, parents can make informed decisions. Four participants believed that disclosure should be based on professional judgement and one supported full-disclosure. Unlike VUS or SL, all interviewees agreed that in cases of medically actionable adult-onset conditions, the benefit of disclosure outweighs the damage. CONCLUSION HCPs attitudes are largely in-line with the Israeli practice of involving parents in disclosure decisions regarding uncertain information. This may mitigate disclosure dilemmas and allow personalized disclosure based on parents' views. This article is protected by copyright.

However, the biological role of ppGalNAc-T4 in breast cancer is still undetermined. In this study, we investigate the effects and mechanism of ppGalNAc-T4 to the breast cancer cell proliferation. From analysis of high throughput RNA sequencing datasets of GEO and ArrayExpress, a positive correlation between ppGalNAc-T4 and the recurrence-free survival was observed in multigroup of human breast cancer datasets. Moreover, transcriptomes analysis using RNA-sequencing in MCF7 cells revealed that cell cycle-related genes induced the effects of ppGalNAc-T4 on breast cancer cell proliferation. Additionally, investigations showed that ppGalNAc-T4 impaired cell proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cells. Furthermore, our results suggested that ppGalNAc-T4 knockout activated Notch signaling pathway and enhanced cell proliferation.

METHODS Children aged from 2 to 18 years and receiving vitamin K antagonist therapy were eligible for this prospective multicentre study. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Health-related quality of life was assessed using the PedsQL™ 4.0 questionnaire. Correlations between quality of life scores and time in therapeutic range were measured. RESULTS A total of 121 children were included in the study (mean age 9.6±4.9 years). Cardiac conditions were the predominant indication for vitamin K antagonists. The mean time in therapeutic range was 0.78±0.15 overall, and 0.76±0.24 over the 3-month period before quality of life assessment. The mean total quality of life score was 76.2±18 in self reports, 71.4±22 in mother reports and 73.5±19 in father reports. The time in therapeutic range correlated with the total quality of life scores in self reports (r=0.22; P=0.04), mother reports (r=0.23; P=0.02) and father reports (r=0.28; P=0.02). The time in therapeutic range predominantly correlated with school functioning in self reports (r=0.38; P=0.002) and mother reports (r=0.40; P<0.001), and with physical functioning in father reports (r=0.28; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Time in therapeutic range correlated with quality of life in children participating in a non-selective International Normalised Ratio self-monitoring and vitamin K antagonist education programme. Regular assessment of quality of life in patient education programmes contributes towards understanding the concerns and needs of patients.","Abassi, Hamouda; Bajolle, Fanny; Werner, Oscar; Auer, Annie; Marquina, Amandine; Mura, Thibault; Lavastre, Kathleen; Guillaumont, Sophie; Manna, Federico; Auquier, Pascal; Bonnet, Damien; Amedro, Pascal",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,92,1

Because cardiopulmonary bypass is a potentially reversible ischemia-reperfusion sequence, we aimed to assess whether statin loading could help to limit myocardial injury in patients undergoing isolated heart valve replacement under cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS One hundred patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease undergoing valve replacement received either a loading dose of rosuvastatin (40 mg initiated 7 days before surgery; loaded group) or no statins (non-loaded group). Cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase MB, and brain natriuretic peptide were measured at 8, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the extent of perioperative myocardial injury measured by the area under the curve for each biomarker. RESULTS Despite similar baseline levels, all biomarkers at 8, 24, and 48 h were significantly lower in the loaded group. The area under the curve of each biomarker was significantly lower in the loaded group than in the non-loaded group (troponin I: 31.43 vs. 77.21 ng·h·mL-1, creatine kinase MB 309.31 vs. 429.12 ng·h·mL-1, brain natriuretic peptide 5176.11 vs. 16119.31 pg·h·mL-1, all p < 0.001). The mean changes from baseline to peak levels were also significantly lower in the loaded group. The loaded group had a shorter hospital stay but no significant difference was seen in ventilator time, inotrope time, aortic crossclamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass time, or intensive care unit stay. CONCLUSION In patients undergoing valve replacement, high-dose statin loading before surgery had a favorable impact on the release kinetics of various cardiac biomarkers.","Kaushik, Atul; Kapoor, Aditya; Agarwal, Surendra Kumar; Pande, Shantanu; Kashyap, Shiridhar; Sinha, Archana; Khanna, Roopali; Kumar, Sudeep; Garg, Naveen; Tewari, Satyendra; Goel, Pravin K",Asian cardiovascular & thoracic annals,92,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS Medline/PubMed and SCOPUS databases were searched. Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of plain balloon angioplasty (PBA), cutting balloon angioplasty (CtBA) and drug coated balloon angioplasty (DCBA) in autogenous AVFs vein stenoses were performed; studies on central vein stenoses were excluded. The main outcome measures were failure rates at 6-months and 1-year. RESULTS Eleven RCTs were included reporting a total of 814 patients and 395 out of them underwent PBA. Network meta-analysis showed that DCBA at 6-months was significantly more effective than PBA [Odds ratio (OR): 0.39, Confidence Intervals (CI):0.18-0.81] and ranked as the best treatment option, but without having statistically significant difference when compared with CtBA (OR: 0.65, CI: 0.20-2.12). Statistical significance was not achieved at 1 year among treatments. Additional conventional pair-wise meta-analyses did not find significant differences at 1-year. CONCLUSION In failing AVFs with outflow stenosis, DCBA is significantly superior to PBA presenting an improved 6-month failure rate. However the effectiveness of DCBA in the long term deserves further investigation.","Gregory, Tripsianis; Eleni, Christaina; Christos, Argyriou; Efstratios, Georgakarakos; George, Georgiadis S; Miltos, Lazarides K",Journal of vascular surgery,92,16
96079,96079,96079,Role of Permacol Injection in the Treatment of Patients With Fecal Incontinence.,15.524437,8.274519,2016,"CONTEXT Pseudorabies herpesvirus (PrV) belongs to the Alphaherpesvirinae. Piglets infected with PrV die within a few days. Development of effective antiviral agents is one alternative or complementary method to prevent PrV infection. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae), H. cordata, a traditional Chinese medicine, is often used to relieve lung abnormal symptoms, infectious disease, refractory hemoptysis and malignant pleural effusion in China. OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to investigate the effect of H. cordata injection on cell infection by PrV using Vero cells (a monkey kidney cell line) and swine testis cells (ST) as models. MATERIALS AND METHODS The infectivity of PrV was determined by plaque assays when H. cordata was applied to the virus, to the virus infected cells, and to the cells prior to infection. The genomic DNA copies post-drug treatment were confirmed by PCR and reverse transcription PCR. The cell apoptosis caused by the virus was analyzed. RESULTS H. cordata efficiently inhibited cell infection after incubating the drug with PrV. Nevertheless, H. cordata was more efficient in Vero cells than in ST cells in terms of its inhibitory effect. Low-dosage drug inhibited cell apoptosis induced by PrV; nevertheless, high-dosage drug alone resulted in cell apoptosis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION H. cordata has a direct inhibitory activity against PrV in vitro. H. cordata may be used as an anti-PrV agent or combined with other anti-PrV agents. PrV infection induces cell apoptosis and H. cordata inhibits cell infection. The optimal administration dosage of H. cordata should be taken into account in the future, because high-dosage H. cordata alone causes cell apoptosis.","Ren, Xiaofeng; Sui, Xiuwen; Yin, Jiechao",Pharmaceutical biology,92,27

We evaluated the feasibility of a predefined multifaceted individualized pneumoperitoneum strategy aiming at the lowest possible intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS Multicenter prospective study in patients scheduled for laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The strategy consisted of ventilation with low tidal volume, a modified lithotomy position, deep neuromuscular blockade, pre-stretching of the abdominal wall, and individualized intra-abdominal pressure titration; the effect was blindly evaluated by the surgeon. The primary endpoint was the proportion of surgical procedures completed at each individualized intra-abdominal pressure level. Secondary endpoints were the respiratory system driving pressure, and the estimated volume of insufflated CO2 gas needed to perform the surgical procedure. RESULTS Ninety-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fourteen cases were converted to open surgery for reasons not related to the strategy. The intervention was feasible in all patients and well-accepted by all surgeons. In 61 out of 78 patients (78%), surgery was performed and completed at the lowest possible IAP, 8 mmHg. In 17 patients, IAP was raised up to 12 mmHg. The relationship between IAP and driving pressure was almost linear. The mean estimated intra-abdominal CO2 volume at which surgery was performed was 3.2 L. CONCLUSION A multifaceted individualized pneumoperitoneum strategy during laparoscopic colorectal surgery was feasible and resulted in an adequate working space in most patients at lower intra-abdominal pressure and lower respiratory driving pressure.

We report our preliminary experience with 18 SOT (kidney [44.4%], liver [33.3%] and heart [22.2%]) recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 by March 23, 2020 at a tertiary-care center at Madrid. Median age at diagnosis was 71.0 ± 12.8 years, and the median interval since transplantation was 9.3 years. Fever (83.3%) and radiographic abnormalities in form of unilateral or bilateral/multifocal consolidations (72.2%) were the most common presentations.

Scientific evidence has found that plant extracts seem to be a reliable choice due to their multitarget effects against HCC. Juniperus communis has been used for centuries in traditional medicine and has reported its anticancer properties. As a result, the purpose of the study was to investigate the anticancer effect and mechanism of JCo extract on HCC in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that J. communis extract (JCo extract) inhibited the growth of human HCC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, extensive apoptosis and suppressing metastatic protein expressions in HCC cells. Moreover, the combinational treatment of JCo and VP-16 was found to enhance the anti-cancer effect, revealing that JCo extract might have the potential to be utilized as an adjuvant to promote HCC treatment. Furthermore, in vivo study, JCo extract significantly suppressed HCC tumor growth and extended the lifespan with no or low systemic and pathological toxicity. JCo extract significantly upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and tumor suppressor p53, suppressed VEGF/VEGFR autocrine signaling, downregulated cell cycle regulatory proteins and MMP2/MMP9 proteins. Overall, our results provide a basis for exploiting JCo extract as a potential anticancer agent against hepatocellular carcinoma.","Huang, Nan-Chieh; Huang, Ru-Lai; Huang, Xiao-Fan; Chang, Kai-Fu; Lee, Chien-Ju; Hsiao, Chih-Yen; Lee, Shan-Chih; Tsai, Nu-Man",Bioscience reports,92,16

Because nurse shift work is so varied, including overnight duty, rotating shift schedules, early awakening, and interrupted nocturnal sleep, it offers an interesting model to study this paradigm. It has been investigated so far using only subjective markers. A combined approach based on the simultaneous analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) and force signals can objectively detect possible deficits in neuromuscular control and muscle fatigue. With this study we investigated neuromuscular activation and muscle contraction capacity at submaximum and maximum level in nurses working two night-shift schedules and compared them to levels in nurses working entirely in day shifts. Sleep quality and activity levels were also assessed. The study sample was 71 nurses grouped by their shift work schedule: night shift for 5 days (NS5, n = 46), night shift for 10 days (NS10, n = 9), and only day/swing shift (DS, n = 16). Before and after the shift-work cycle, maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force and muscle activation, neuromuscular control, and muscle fatigability were measured in the finger flexor muscles. Activity level and sleep quality during the shift-work cycle were recorded with a wrist actigraph. After the shift-work cycles, MVC force and muscle activation were decreased (-11 ± 3% and -33 ± 3%, p < 0.001) as was neuromuscular control (-36 ± 8%, p = 0.007), whereas muscle fatigability was increased (+ 19 ± 9%, p = 0.006) in the NS5 and the NS10 group. Sleep quality was lower in the NS5 and the NS10 group (-8 ± 1.8% and -15%3, respectively, p < 0.001), while the activity level for the three groups was similar. There was a clear reduction in neuromuscular control and an increase in muscle fatigue in the nurses working the night shift. These findings may inform of work schedule planning or recommendations for devising new recovery strategies to counteract neuromuscular alterations in night shift nurses.","Cè, Emiliano; Doria, Christian; Roveda, Eliana; Montaruli, Angela; Galasso, Letizia; Castelli, Lucia; Mulè, Antonino; Longo, Stefano; Coratella, Giuseppe; D'Aloia, Pasqualino; Banfi, Giuseppe; Esposito, Fabio",Frontiers in physiology,92,13

This study aims to investigate the early (≤30 days) and late (>30 days) infectious complications of CVLs placed in pediatric patients with and without neutropenia. METHODS A retrospective review was conducted of all CVLs placed by pediatric surgeons at two institutions from 2010 to 2017. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for line infection. Propensity score-matched cohorts of patients with and without neutropenia were compared in a 1:1 ratio. Wilcoxon rank-sum, Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and log-rank tests were also performed. RESULTS Review identified 1,102 CVLs placed in 937 patients. Fifty-four patients were neutropenic at the time of placement. Multivariable analysis demonstrated tunneled catheters and subclavian access as associated with line infection. The propensity score-matched cohort included 94 patients, 47 from each group. Demographic and preoperative data were similar between the groups (p > 0.05). Patients with neutropenia were no more likely to develop early (4.3% vs. 2.1%, p = 1.000) or late (19.1% vs. 17.0%, p = 1.000) infectious complications than patients without neutropenia, with similar median time to infection (141 vs. 222 days, p = 0.370). CONCLUSION A policy of selective CVL placement in neutropenic patients with standardized postoperative line maintenance is safe. Future directions include defining criteria by which neutropenic patients could be prospectively selected for safe CVL placement.

Accordingly, the Konyang Standard Method (KSM) for SILC has been developed over the past 6 years. We report the outcomes of our procedures. Methods Between April 2010 and December 2016, 1,005 patients underwent SILC at Konyang University Hospital. Initially 3-channel SILC with KSM was changed to 4-channel SILC using a modified technique with a snake retractor for exposure of Calot triangle; we called this a modified KSM (mKSM). Recently, we have used a commercial 4-channel (Glove) port for simplicity. Results SILC was performed in 323 patients with the KSM, in 645 with the mKSM, and in 37 with the commercial 4-channel port. Age was not significantly different between the 3 groups (P = 0.942). The postoperative hospital days (P = 0.051), operative time (P < 0.001) and intraoperative bleeding volume (P < 0.001) were significantly improved in the 3 groups. Drain insertion (P = 0.214), additional port insertion (P = 0.639), and postoperative complications (P = 0.608) were not significantly different in all groups. Postoperative complications were evaluated with the Clavien-Dindo classification. There were 3 cases (0.9%) over grade IIIb (bile duct injury, incisional hernia, duodenal perforation, or small bowel injury) with KSM and 3 (0.5%) with mKSM. Conclusion We evaluated the evolution of the KSM for SILC. The use of the mKSM with a commercial 4-channel port may be the safest and most effective method for SILC.","Kim, Min Kyu; Choi, In Seok; Moon, Ju Ik; Lee, Sang Eok; Yoon, Dae Sung; Kwon, Seong Uk; Choi, Won Jun; Sung, Nak Song; Park, Si Min",Annals of surgical treatment and research,92,31

Both RNA and DNA viral infection induces TBK1 activation, triggers phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and subsequent expression of type I interferons (IFNs; IFN-α/β). Type I IFNs can induce the expression of numerous antiviral genes called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to build a remarkable antiviral state and limit viral replication. Thus, optimal TBK1 activity is crucial for IRF3-induced type I IFNs expression and ISGs-mediated viral elimination. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the diverse roles of TBK1 in antiviral innate immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of TBK1 activity and the implication in antiviral development. Expert opinion: TBK1 is a key kinase against antiviral infection via inducing type I IFNs expression. Multiple types of post-translational modifications of TBK1 tightly regulate TBK1 activity and subsequent TBK1-dependent antiviral responses. The identified regulators of TBK1 unveil regulatory mechanisms of host antiviral innate immunity and immuno-escape mechanism of virus provide strategies to control viral diseases by modulating TBK1 activity.","Zhao, Chunyuan; Zhao, Wei",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,92,15

Patients and Methods Patients undergoing esophagectomy often have little understanding about postoperative symptom management. The Mayo Clinic esophageal CONDUIT tool is a validated questionnaire comprising 5 multi-item symptom-assessment domains and 2 health-assessment domains. A prospective nonrandomized cohort study was conducted on adult patients who have had esophagectomies using the CONDUIT tool from August 17, 2015, to July 30, 2018 (NCT02530983). The Statistical Analysis System v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to calculate and analyze the scores. Results Over the study period, 569 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 241 patients consented and were offered the tool. Of these, 188 patients (median age: 65 years; range: 24 to 87 years; 80% male patients) had calculable scores. Of the 188 patients, 50 (26.6%) patients were identified as potential beneficiaries for educational intervention to improve symptoms (received moderate scores for a domain), and 131 (69.7%) patients were identified as needing further testing or provider intervention (received poor scores for a domain) based on the tool. Conclusion The CONDUIT tool scores, when compared with standardized scales with established preliminary normative scores, could be used to identify and triage patients who need targeted education, further testing, or provider interventions. These score ranges will serve as the first set of normative standards to aid in the interpretation of conduit performance among providers and patients.","Mahajan, Nandita N; Lee, Minji K; Yost, Kathleen J; Pierson, Karlyn E; Viehman, Jason K; Allen, Mark S; Cassivi, Stephen D; Nichols, Francis C; Reisenauer, Janani S; Shen, K Robert; Wigle, Dennis A; Blackmon, Shanda H","Mayo Clinic proceedings.

To examine, in male lowlanders, whether, and to what extent, hypoxia would modulate thermoregulatory effector responses during repeated whole-body cold stress encountered in a single day. What is the main finding and its importance? A ∼10-h sustained exposure to hypoxia appears to mediate a gradual upregulation of endogenous heat production, preventing the progressive hypothermic response prompted by the serial cold stimuli. Also, hypoxia progressively degraded mood, and compounded the perceived thermal discomfort, and sensations of fatigue and coldness. ABSTRACT We examined whether hypoxia would modulate thermoeffector responses during repeated cold stress encountered in a single day. Eleven men completed two ∼10-h sessions, while breathing, in normobaria, either normoxia or hypoxia (PO2 : 12 kPa). During each session, subjects underwent sequentially three 120-min immersions to the chest in 20°C water (CWI), interspersed by 120-min rewarming. In normoxia, the final drop in rectal temperature (Trec ) was greater in the third (∼1.2°C) than in the first and second (∼0.9°C) CWIs (P < 0.05). The first hypoxic CWI augmented the Trec fall (∼1.2°C; P = 0.002); but the drop in Trec did not vary between the three hypoxic CWIs (P = 0.99). In normoxia, the metabolic heat production (M) was greater during the first half of the third CWI than during the corresponding part of the first CWI (P = 0.02); yet the difference was blunted during the second half of the CWIs (P = 0.89). In hypoxia, by contrast, the increase in M was augmented by ∼25% throughout the third CWI (P < 0.01). Regardless of the breathing condition, the cold-induced elevation in MAP was blunted in the second and third CWI (P < 0.05). Hypoxia aggravated the sensation of coldness (P = 0.05) and thermal discomfort (P = 0.04) during the second half of the third CWI. Present findings therefore demonstrate that prolonged hypoxia mediates, in a gradual manner, metabolic and thermoperceptual sensitization to repeated cold stress.

Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from Rhinolophus bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.","Gabutti, Giovanni; d'Anchera, Erica; Sandri, Federica; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando",Infectious diseases and therapy,92,16

At present, research concerning the biological components of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) is of increasing interest. However, previous research has mainly focused on serious pollution conditions, creating a knowledge gap regarding background atmospheric microbes. In this study, we observed the atmosphere of Huairou in Beijing for one year, analyzed the characteristics of the physiological metabolic activity of the microorganisms as an index to determine the air quality, and further explored the microbial communities. From January 2018 to January 2019, a total of 157 days of microbial activity data for PM2.5 and PM10 were obtained through the use of a modified fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis method. Our results showed that there was no significant difference between the microbial activity of PM2.5 and PM10, even though there was significant seasonal variation. At increasing pollution levels, the results showed that the microbial activity decreased at first, and then increased as the conditions worsened. The microbial community of PM2.5 was analyzed using the high-throughput sequencing method. There were significant seasonal differences in species richness and community diversity of bacteria in PM2.5, whereas there was variation only in its fungi species richness. Notably, the microbial community dominated by bacteria has a significant influence on microbial activity. From the perspective of microbial community composition, this study uncovered the possible causes of microbial activity variation and identified the key bacteria and fungi. These results will provide a theoretical basis for both improving air biological pollution predictions and ambient air quality evaluations.","Chen, Hanlin; Du, Rui; Zhang, Yongtao; Zhang, Sujian; Ren, Weishan; Du, Pengrui",The Science of the total environment,92,1

Design, Setting, and Participants In this case series, an electronic health record search was performed at our institution (University of Wisconsin) to identify all competitive athletes (a consecutive sample) recovering from COVID-19, who underwent gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI between January 1, 2020, and November 29, 2020. The MRI findings were reviewed by 2 radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging, using the updated Lake Louise criteria.

Results A total of 145 competitive student athletes (108 male and 37 female individuals; mean age, 20 years; range, 17-23 years) recovering from COVID-19 were included. Most patients had mild (71 [49.0%]) or moderate (40 [27.6%]) symptoms during the acute infection or were asymptomatic (24 [16.6%]). Symptoms were not specified or documented in 10 patients (6.9%). No patients required hospitalization. Cardiac MRIs were performed a median of 15 days (range, 11-194 days) after patients tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients had MRI findings consistent with myocarditis (1.4% [95% CI, 0.4%-4.9%]).

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of delivering supportive care via telehealth platforms to adults with primary brain tumor and family caregivers. METHODS A systematic search of PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane Library was conducted from 1980 to June 1st 2020 to identify eligible studies. Methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS 17 articles, reporting on 16 studies, evaluated telephone-based support (5 studies), videoconferencing (3 studies), web-based programs and resources (7 studies) or combined use of videoconferencing and web-based modules (1 study) to deliver supportive care remotely. Caregivers were involved in 31% of interventions. Mean rates of accrual (68%) and adherence (74%) were moderate, whereas acceptability or satisfaction for those completing the interventions was typically high (M satisfied or very satisfied = 81%). Adherence rates were generally higher and clinical gains were more evident for interventions involving real-time interaction as opposed to self-guided interventions. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth delivery of supportive care is feasible and acceptable to a high proportion of individuals with primary brain tumor and their caregivers. It is recommended that future research focuses on implementation outcomes, including factors influencing the uptake and sustainability of telehealth platforms in practice.

Comparison statistics and Cox hazard modeling were performed to determine differences between groups and attempt to identify risk factors for OS, DFS, and LRFS. RESULTS Superior segmentectomy patients, compared with lower lobectomy patients, had more current smokers, worse forced expiratory volume in 1 s percentage, radiologic emphysema scores, clinically and pathologically smaller tumors, and more occurrences of 0 lymph nodes examined. Outcomes for superior segmentectomy compared with lower lobectomy were equivalent for 5-year OS (67.0% vs. 75.1%, p = 0.70), DFS (56.9% vs. 60.4%, p = 0.59), and LRFS (87.9% vs. 91.3%, p = 0.46).

We phenotyped severe AECOPD based on molecular pathogen detection of sputum samples collected at hospitalization of COPD patients and determined their outcomes. Methods We phenotyped 72 sputum samples of COPD patients who were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of AECOPD using a molecular array that detected common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. Based on these results, the patients were classified into positive or negative pathogen groups. The pathogen-positive group was further divided into virus or bacteria subgroups. Admission day 1 blood samples were assayed for N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide, CRP, and complete blood counts. Results A total of 52 patients had a positive result on the array, while 20 patients had no pathogens detected. The most common bacterial pathogen detected was Haemophilus influenzae and the most common virus was rhinovirus. The pathogen-negative group had the worse outcomes with longer hospital stays (median 6.5 vs 5 days for bacteria-positive group, P=0.02) and a trend toward increased 1-year mortality (P=0.052). The bacteria-positive group had the best prognosis, whereas the virus-positive group had outcomes somewhere in between the bacteria-positive and pathogen-negative groups. Conclusion Molecular diagnostics on sputum can rapidly phenotype serious AECOPD into bacteria-, virus-, or pathogen-negative groups. The bacteria-positive group appears to have the best prognosis, while pathogen-negative group has the worst. These data suggest that AECOPD is a heterogeneous event and that accurate phenotyping of AECOPD may lead to novel management strategies that are personalized and more precise.","Alotaibi, Nawaf M; Chen, Virginia; Hollander, Zsuzsanna; Leipsic, Jonathon A; Hague, Cameron J; Murphy, Darra T; DeMarco, Mari L; FitzGerald, J M; McManus, Bruce M; Ng, Raymond T; Sin, Don D",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,92,11

However, rigorous efficacy testing requires extensive screening with live virus under onerous biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions, which limits high-throughput screening of patient and vaccine sera. Myriad BSL2-compatible surrogate virus neutralization assays (VNAs) have been developed to overcome this barrier. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how their results are presented, making intergroup comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using CoV2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) based on vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the Renilla luciferase gene in place of its G glycoprotein (VSVΔG); this assay can be robustly produced at scale and generate accurate neutralizing titers within 18 h postinfection. Our standardized CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results and live-virus neutralizations in confirmed convalescent-patient sera. Three independent groups subsequently validated our standardized CoV2pp VNA (n > 120). Our data (i) show that absolute 50% inhibitory concentration (absIC50), absIC80, and absIC90 values can be legitimately compared across diverse cohorts, (ii) highlight the substantial but consistent variability in neutralization potency across these cohorts, and (iii) support the use of the absIC80 as a more meaningful metric for assessing the neutralization potency of a vaccine or convalescent-phase sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2 plus TMPRSS2. When these are used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNAs/week.IMPORTANCE Vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics like convalescent-phase plasma therapy are premised upon inducing or transferring neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) for measuring neutralizing antibody titers (NATs) are an essential part of determining vaccine or therapeutic efficacy. However, such efficacy testing is limited by the inherent dangers of working with the live virus, which requires specialized high-level biocontainment facilities. We therefore developed a standardized replication-defective pseudotyped particle system that mimics the entry of live SARS-CoV-2. This tool allows for the safe and efficient measurement of NATs, determination of other forms of entry inhibition, and thorough investigation of virus entry mechanisms. Four independent labs across the globe validated our standardized VNA using diverse cohorts. We argue that a standardized and scalable assay is necessary for meaningful comparisons of the myriad of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics becoming available. Our data provide generalizable metrics for assessing their efficacy.","Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian S; Hung, Chuan Tien; Ikegame, Satoshi; Acklin, Joshua A; Kowdle, Shreyas S; Carmichael, Jillian C; Chiu, Hsin-Ping; Azarm, Kristopher D; Haas, Griffin D; Amanat, Fatima; Klingler, Jéromine; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C; Siddiquey, Mohammed N A; Schilke, Robert M; Woolard, Matthew D; Zhang, Hongbo; Duty, Andrew J; Kraus, Thomas A; Moran, Thomas M; Tortorella, Domenico; Lim, Jean K; Gamarnik, Andrea V; Hioe, Catarina E; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Ivanov, Stanimir S; Kamil, Jeremy P; Krammer, Florian; Lee, Benhur",mBio,92,19

METHODS Data collection was performed on a retrospective cohort of patients surgically treated for primary HNC between March and May 2020, using data from two tertiary hospitals: the European Institute of Oncology (Milan) and Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (London). RESULTS We included 77 patients with HNC. More patients with COVID-19 were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and had Clavien-Dindo Classification grade I compared to negative patients, respectively (60% vs 22% [p = 0.058] and 40% vs 8% [p = 0.025]). Multivariate logistic regression analyses confirmed our data (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively). Sex and age were statistically significantly different (p = 0.05 and <0.001 respectively), showing more male patients (75% vs 53.66%, respectively) and more elderly patients in Italy than in the United Kingdom (patients aged >63 years: 69.44% vs 29.27%). CONCLUSIONS This study presents a large cohort of patients with HNC with nasopharyngeal swab during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Patients with HNC with COVID-19 appeared more likely to develop postsurgical complications and to be taking ACE inhibitors. The preventive measures adopted guaranteed the continuation of therapeutic surgical intervention.","Tagliabue, Marta; Russell, Beth; Moss, Charlotte; De Berardinis, Rita; Chu, Francesco; Jeannon, Jean-Pierre; Pietrobon, Giacomo; Haire, Anna; Grosso, Enrica; Wylie, Harriet; Zorzi, Stefano; Proh, Michele; Brunet-Garcia, Aina; Cattaneo, Augusto; Oakley, Richard; De Benedetto, Luigi; Arora, Asit; Riccio, Stefano; Fry, Alistair; Bruschini, Roberto; Townley, William; Giugliano, Gioacchino; Orfaniotis, Georgios; Madini, Marzia; Dolly, Saoirse; Borghi, Ester; Aprile, Danila; Zurlo, Valeria; Bibiano, Debora; Mastrilli, Fabrizio; Chiocca, Susanna; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke; Gandini, Sara; Simo, Ricard; Ansarin, Mohssen",Tumori,92,1

Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HLA-editing strategy to generate a variety of HLA homozygous-like hESC lines from pre-established hESC lines. We edited four pre-established HLA-heterozygous hESC lines and created a mini library of 14 HLA-edited hESC lines in which single HLA-A and HLA-B alleles and both HLA-DR alleles are disrupted. The HLA-edited hESC derivatives elicited both low T cell- and low NK cell-mediated immune responses. Our library would cover about 40% of the Asian-Pacific population. We estimate that HLA-editing of only 19 pre-established hESC lines would give rise to 46 different hESC lines to cover 90% of the Asian-Pacific population. This study offers an opportunity to generate an off-the-shelf HLA-compatible hESC bank, available for immune-compatible cell transplantation, without embryo destruction.

This study evaluated the reliability of radiocolloid injection as determined by sentinel node identification rate and positive sentinel node biopsy rate, after the patient has been anesthetized in the operating room as compared with preoperative injection. METHODS After institutional review board approval, a retrospective cohort of patients with breast cancer who underwent sentinel node biopsy from January 2005 through December 2010 was evaluated for analysis. Patients who received intraoperative injection of radiocolloid were compared with those who received their injection preoperatively. Patients with incomplete pathologic staging or having received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. All patients received radiocolloid injections into the retroareolar tissue; some also received intradermal injection directly over the tumor. All injections contained 37 MBq (1 mCi) in 0.5 mL of filtered (0.22-μm) (99m)Tc-sulfur colloid. RESULTS Over the 6-y study period there were 904 sentinel node biopsy procedures, and 165 patients were excluded from analysis. Of the 739 sentinel node biopsies that were analyzed, 647 had preoperative injection of radiocolloid and 92 had intraoperative injection. The overall sentinel lymph node identification rates were similar for the 2 groups: 93.5% for the preoperative injection group and 94.6% for the intraoperative injection group (not statistically significant). The identification rates remained comparable for both groups when analyzed by T stage of the tumor. The average number of sentinel lymph nodes removed was similar between preoperative and intraoperative injection: 2.60 and 2.70 nodes, respectively. The overall rates of positive sentinel nodes were comparable for the 2 groups: 25.6% for the preoperative injection group and 26.4% for the intraoperative injection group (not statistically significant). When analyzed by T stage, the positive sentinel node rates remained similar between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION The sentinel lymph node identification rate of 94.6% for the intraoperative injection group was similar to other published sentinel lymph node identification rates (96%-100%). The positive sentinel lymph node rate was also comparable to that of published series. Intraoperative injection of radiocolloid for axillary sentinel node biopsy appears equivalent to preoperative injection and is a less painful experience for breast cancer patients.","Vu, Huan N; O'Connor, Patricia F; Shoemaker, Rebecca R; Wan, Wen; Fratkin, Melvin J; Bear, Harry D",Journal of nuclear medicine technology,92,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS We describe a series of 6 patients with a glomus tympanicum tumor who were treated in our hospital using the same technique: the day before surgery selective tumor embolization due to denaturation with 96% ethanol. Following parameters were considered: tumor classification, tumor control, clinical and audiological outcome, effectiveness of embolization, percentage of tumor necrosis and treatment complications. RESULTS There were no severe complications due to embolization or surgery. Tumor blush disappeared completely in 5 patients on DSA post embolization and histologic evaluation of the resected tissue showed a median of 69.2% of tumor necrosis. Pulsatile tinnitus disappeared in all patients and 3 patients had no symptoms at all. Hearing ameliorated in 4 patients, 1 patient without hearing loss pre- treatment still had normal hearing after treatment and 1 patient's hearing was worse after treatment. Average follow-up was 21.3months. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of glomus tympanicum tumors by pre-operative embolization with ethanol and surgical resection has not been described before. Our results show that it is a safe procedure with a good long term tumor control, good clinical and audiological outcome.","Devuyst, Lien; Defreyne, Luc; Praet, Marleen; Geukens, Sven; Dhooge, Ingeborg",American journal of otolaryngology,92,1

Despite the significant efforts made in developing vaccines and therapeutic drugs, there is currently no available effective treatment against this new coronavirus infection, hence the need to continue research which is aimed at limiting the progression of this virus. The present study which has as objective to carry out in silico studies on the metabolites of some Cameroonian medicinal plants of the Asteraceae family with a view to propose potential molecules to fight against COVID-19. The selected plants are commonly used to treat respiratory infectious diseases, and for this reason they may contain some constituents which could exhibit an antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a set of 74 naturally occurring compounds are computed with SARS-CoV-2 main protease protein (PDB ID: 6lu7) and spike protein (PDB ID: 6m0j) for their affinity and stability using binding energy analysis and molecular docking. Chrysoeriol-7-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside (compound 16) has showed promising results including excellent Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME) parameters as well as insignificant toxicity. Finally, the stability of this compound is complex with the two proteins validated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, they displayed stable trajectory and molecular properties with consistent interaction profile in molecular dynamics simulations.

We describe the development of two molecular assays for the detection of 11 common viral and bacterial agents of CAP and sepsis: influenza virus A, influenza virus B, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV A), RSV B, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Legionella micdadei, Bordetella pertussis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further, we report the prevalence of carriage of these pathogens in respiratory, skin, and serum specimens from 243 asymptomatic children and adults. The detection of pathogens was done using both a manual enzyme hybridization assay and an automated electronic microarray following reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The analytical sensitivities ranged between 0.01 and 100 50% tissue culture infective doses, cells, or CFU per ml for both detection methods. Analytical specificity testing demonstrated no significant cross-reactivity among 19 other common respiratory organisms. One hundred spiked ""surrogate"" clinical specimens were all correctly identified with 100% specificity (95% confidence interval, 100%). Overall, 28 (21.7%) of 129 nasopharyngeal specimens, 11 of 100 skin specimens, and 2 of 100 serum specimens from asymptomatic subjects tested positive for one or more pathogens, with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus giving 89% of the positive results. Our data suggest that asymptomatic carriage makes the use of molecular assays problematic for the detection of S. pneumoniae or S. aureus in upper respiratory tract secretions; however, the specimens tested showed virtually no carriage of the other nine viral and bacterial pathogens, and the detection of these pathogens should not be a significant diagnostic problem. In addition, slightly less sensitive molecular assays may have better correlation with clinical disease in the case of CAP.","Kumar, Swati; Wang, Lihua; Fan, Jiang; Kraft, Andrea; Bose, Michael E; Tiwari, Sagarika; Van Dyke, Meredith; Haigis, Robert; Luo, Tingquo; Ghosh, Madhushree; Tang, Huong; Haghnia, Marjan; Mather, Elizabeth L; Weisburg, William G; Henrickson, Kelly J",Journal of clinical microbiology,92,16

In our prospective study, a total of 60 women underwent TLH. Uterine artery ligation (UAL) was done at the beginning of the procedure. Women were divided into TLH + UAL (n = 30) and TLH (n = 30) groups. In TLH group, TLH was done without ligating the uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. In TLH + UAL group, TLH was done with ligation of both uterine arteries at the beginning of the procedure. The mean operating time was longer for the TLH group (99.16 ± 7.01) than TLH + UAL group (63.27 ± 7.16). The median total blood loss was higher in TLH group (109.38 ± 33.03 mL) than TLH + UAL group (47.50 ± 8.12 mL). UAL at the beginning of TLH is a technically feasible procedure.

This article reviews advances in the use of artificial intelligence for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of urinary stone disease over the last 2 years. Pertinent studies were identified via a nonsystematic review of the literature performed using MEDLINE and the Cochrane database. RECENT FINDINGS Twelve articles have been published, which met the inclusion criteria. This included three articles in the detection and diagnosis of stones, six in the prediction of postprocedural outcomes including percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shock wave lithotripsy, and three in the use of artificial intelligence in prevention of stone disease by predicting patients at risk of stones, detecting the stone type via digital photographs and detecting risk factors in patients most at risk of not attending outpatient appointments. SUMMARY Our knowledge of artificial intelligence in urology has greatly advanced in the last 2 years. Its role currently is to aid the endourologist as opposed to replacing them. However, the ability of artificial intelligence to efficiently process vast quantities of data, in combination with the shift towards electronic patient records provides increasingly more 'big data' sets. This will allow artificial intelligence to analyse and detect novel diagnostic and treatment patterns in the future.","Yang, Bob; Veneziano, Domenico; Somani, Bhaskar K",Current opinion in urology,92,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty patients with pathologically proven SAAH (SAAH group) who underwent CT or MRI examinations up to 30 days before or 15 days after liver biopsy between January 2008 and June 2018 were retrospectively included. There were 31 men and 29 women with a mean age of 52±9 (SD) years (range: 33-67 years). Imaging features of the SAAH group were compared to those obtained in two control groups including 62 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis without acute alcoholic hepatitis (control group 1) and 19 patients with NASH cirrhosis (control group 2) by two independent radiologists blinded to the final diagnosis. Univariate analyses were performed to compare imaging characteristics between the three groups, followed by diagnostic performance analysis for the diagnosis of SAAH of the main CT features. RESULTS Heterogeneous steatosis was significantly more frequent in SAAH group than in the control groups (41/50; 82% vs. 7/62; 10% and 1/19; 5% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 1 and 34/50; 68% vs. 8/62; 13% and 1/19; 5% in control groups 1 and 2, respectively for reader 2; both P=0.01).

In this study, the role of AFS in providing appropriate antifungal therapy was evaluated. Methods: This study included three periods as observation, feedback/education, and daily AFS activities. In observation period, the use of systemic antifungals was evaluated for a baseline measurement of appropriateness. In second period, monthly meetings were organized to provide feedback and education to physicians regarding antifungal therapy and the rate of adherence to the clinical guidelines. In final period, a clinical pharmacist participated in daily ward rounds to evaluate appropriateness of the antifungal therapy. A scoring system for appropriateness was used for comparison between the three periods. Results: Four hundred and eighteen episodes of antifungal therapy were evaluated. Baseline demographics of patients were similar in all three periods for age, gender, and the number of comorbidities. The indications for antifungal use were for prophylaxis in 22.7%, Candida infections in 58.6%, and invasive mould infections in 18.7%. During the third period, 157 (78.9%) recommendations were made and 151 (96.2%) were accepted. The overall appropriateness of antifungal use increased significantly for prophylaxis (30.8%, 17.9%, 46.3%, p=0.046) and treatment of fungal diseases (27.8%, 32.4%, 71.9%, p<0.001) between the first, second and third periods, respectively. A 30-day mortality was not significantly changed between the three periods (19%, 15.6% and 27.5%; p=0.050). Conclusions: Appropriateness in antifungal therapy can be augmented by the integration of an AFS program. A team-based evaluation of fungal infections and assessment of patients by a clinical pharmacist with a therapeutic perspective may help to increase the quality of antifungal therapy.","Kara, Emre; Metan, Gokhan; Bayraktar-Ekincioglu, Aygin; Gulmez, Dolunay; Arikan-Akdagli, Sevtap; Demirkazik, Figen; Akova, Murat; Unal, Serhat; Uzun, Omrum",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,92,16

Subjects had to have a history of recent onset of symptoms compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia or have been exposed to the contagion of patients carrying the disease. COVID-19 testing was performed with SARS-CoV-2 nasal-pharyngeal (NP) swabs. Positive subjects to LUS scanning were considered those with non-coascelent B-lines in >3 zones, coalescent B-lines in >3 zones and with iperdensed patchy non-consolidated lungs. Sixty-three percent had positive NP testing and 65% had LUS signs of pulmonary injury. LUS had a sensitivity of 79% in predicting positive NP testing. Sixteen percent of residents tested negative for SARSCoV-2 carried the signs of COVID-19 lung injury at LUS. There were 92 patients (61%) with current or recent symptoms.Positivity to LUS scanning was reported in 73% of residents with symptoms, while it was 53% in those without (P=0.016). A positive NP testing was observed in 66% of residents with symptoms and in 57% of those without (P=0.27). We conclude that assessment of LUS by portable wireless scanner echography can be profitability utilized to diagnose lung injury among senior nursing home residents with or without symptoms compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Dini, Frank Lloyd; Bergamini, Carlo; Allegrini, Aldo; Scopelliti, Massimo; Secco, Gianmarco; Miccoli, Mario; Boni, Stefano; Brigada, Raffaella; Perlini, Stefano",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,92,5

However, continuously high training loads with insufficient recovery may cause fatigue to accumulate and result in overtraining. A comprehensive systematic review is required to collate overtraining literature and improve the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying functional overreaching (FOR), non-functional overreaching (NFOR) and the overtraining syndrome (OTS) in resistance training. OBJECTIVE The objective of this systematic review was to establish markers of overtraining and elucidate the mechanisms underlying maladaptive resistance training conditions. Furthermore, this review aims to critically evaluate the methodological approaches of the overtraining literature. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus to identify studies up to June 2019. Electronic databases were searched using terms related to resistance training and overtraining. Records were included if they attempted to induce a state of overreaching or overtraining through resistance exercise in healthy participants. RESULTS A total of 22 studies were selected for review. Among these studies, eight resulted in decrements in performance and measured changes in performance during a follow-up period. There were four studies that reported decrease in performance yet failed to implement follow-up measures. A total of 10 studies reported no decline in performance. Overall, a lack of standardisation in methodology (follow-up performance testing) and diagnostic criteria prevents consistent determination of FOR, NFOR and OTS in resistance training. CONCLUSIONS Few studies have appropriately established FOR, NFOR or OTS in resistance training. Overtraining may be related to frequent high-intensity and monotonous resistance training. However, no marker other than a sustained decrease in performance has been established as a reliable indicator of overtraining in resistance exercise.

The complex goal of improving health status of the citizens of home nations while ensuring the right of health workers to migrate generates policy discussions and decisions that often are not adequately informed by evidence. In times of global public health crises like the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic, the need for equitable distribution and adequate training of health workers globally becomes even more pressing. Brugha et al report suboptimal training and working conditions among Irish and foreign medical doctors practicing in Ireland, while predicting large-scale outward migration. We comment on health personnel migration and retention based on our own experience in this area of research. Drawing from our examination of medical migration dynamics from sub-Saharan Africa, we argue for greater consideration of health workforce retention in research and policy related to resource-limited settings. The right to health suggests the need to retain healthcare providers whose education was typically subsidized by the home nation. The right to migrate may conflict with the right to health. Hence, a deeper understanding is needed as to healthcare worker motives based on interactions of psychosocial processes, economic and material determinants, and quality of work environments.","Tankwanchi, Akhenaten Siankam; Hagopian, Amy; Vermund, Sten H",International journal of health policy and management,92,11

RESULTS No extraumbilical port was required. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. The peri- and postoperative course was quite smooth with rapid recovery, and the patient was discharged home on the fifth postoperative day. DISCUSSION The laparoendoscopic single-site surgery with homemade single-port allowed extraperitoneal and transperitoneal procedures to be carried out at the same time, which was feasible and safe with negligible complications.

Indeed, electrochemical sensors combine disposability, fast response, high sensitivity, and portability. Here, a low-cost and high-surface-area electrode, based on Au-decorated NiO nanowalls, demonstrates a highly sensitive PCR-free detection of a real sample of Mycoplasma agalactiae (Ma) DNA. NiO nanowalls, synthesized by aqueous methods, thermal annealing, and Au decoration, by electroless deposition, ensure a high-surface-area platform for successful immobilization of Ma thiolated probe DNA. The morphological, chemical, and electrochemical properties of the electrode were characterized, and a reproducible detection of synthetic Ma DNA was observed and investigated by impedance measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) ascribed the origin of impedance signal to the Ma DNA hybridization with its probe immobilized onto the electrode. The electrode successfully discriminates between DNA extracted from healthy and infected sheep milk, showing the ability to detect Ma DNA in concentrations as low as 53 ± 2 copy number μL-1. The Au-decorated NiO nanowall electrode represents a promising route toward PCR-free, disposable, rapid, and molecular detection.","Urso, Mario; Tumino, Serena; Bruno, Elena; Bordonaro, Salvo; Marletta, Donata; Loria, Guido Ruggero; Avni, Adi; Shacham-Diamand, Yosi; Priolo, Francesco; Mirabella, Salvo",ACS applied materials & interfaces,92,16

Simulated patients (SPs) are increasingly engaged as an interactive means of teaching, applying and practising communication skills with immediate feedback. There is a large body of research into the use of manikin-based simulation but a gap exists in the body of research on the effectiveness of SP-based education to teach communication skills that impact patient outcomes. The aim of this systematic review was to critically analyse the existing research, investigating whether SP-based communication skills training improves learner-patient communication, how communication skill improvement is measured, and who measures these improvements. METHODS The databases Medline, ProQuest (Health & Medical Complete, Nursing and Allied Health Source) and CINAHL (EBSCOhost) Education Resources Information Centre (ERIC) were searched for articles that investigated the effects of SP-based education on the communication skills of medical, nursing and allied health learners. RESULTS There were 60 studies included in the review. Only two studies reported direct patient outcomes, one reporting some negative impact, and no studies included an economic analysis. Many studies reported statistically significant third-party ratings of improved communication effectiveness following SP-based education; however, studies were unable to be pooled for meta-analysis because of the outcome collection methods. There were a small number of studies comparing SP with no training at all and there were no differences between communication skills, contradicting the results from studies reporting benefits. Of the 60 studies included for analysis, 54 (90%) met the minimum quality score of 7/11, with four articles (7%) scoring 11/11. CONCLUSION SP-based education is widely accepted as a valuable and effective means of teaching communication skills but there is limited evidence of how this translates to patient outcomes and no indication of economic benefit for this type of training over another method.","Kaplonyi, Jessica; Bowles, Kelly-Ann; Nestel, Debra; Kiegaldie, Debra; Maloney, Stephen; Haines, Terry; Williams, Cylie",Medical education,92,1

In this review, we discuss the history of immunotherapy for the treatment of NMIBC and future developments, focusing on novel intravesical treatments. RECENT FINDINGS The term BCG unresponsive NMIBC encompasses patients with both BCG refractory and BCG relapsing disease. This definition was adopted to standardize inclusion criteria for patients enrolling in clinical trials in this setting. A host of intravesical immuno-oncologic therapies that include gene therapies, oncolytic viruses, cell surface molecule delivered immunotoxins, and cytokine driven agonism of cellular immunity, are in various phases of the drug development pipeline. In addition, pembrolizumab, an immune-checkpoint inhibitor, has recently been approved as a treatment option for BCG unresponsive NMIBC. SUMMARY Patients with BCG unresponsive disease face many difficulties. Although radical cystectomy is the most effective treatment option for these patients, it is associated with significant morbidity, difficult recovery challenges, and refusal by many patients. Cancer immunotherapies may provide bladder sparing options for some patients who develop BCG unresponsive disease.","Hugar, Lee A; Gilbert, Scott M; Sexton, Wade J; Kamat, Ashish M; Li, Roger",Current opinion in urology,92,17

METHODS This prospective study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the State of Zurich, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Sixty-one patients who underwent LRYGB received upper abdominal CT on postoperative day 1, with the following scan parameters: 0.6 mm collimation, 1.2 mm pitch, CareKV with reference 120 mAs and 120 kV, and 0.5 s rotation time. Diluted water-soluble radiographic contrast-medium (50 mL) was administered to achieve gastric pouch distension without movement of the patient. 3D images were evaluated to assess postoperative complications and the radiation dose received was analysed. RESULTS From the 70 patients initially enrolled in the study, 9 were excluded from analysis upon the intraoperative decision to perform a sleeve gastrectomy and not a LRYGB. In all of the 61 patients who were included in the analysis, CT was feasible and there were no instances of aspiration or vomiting. In 7 patients, two upper abdominal scans were necessary as the pouch was not distended by contrast medium in the first acquisition. Radiologically, no leak and no relevant stenosis were found on the first postoperative day. These early postoperative CT findings were consistent with the findings at clinical follow-up 6 wk postoperatively, with no leaks, stenosis or obstructions being diagnosed. The average total dose length product in CT was 536.6 mGycm resulting in an average effective dose of 7.8 mSv. The most common surgical complication, superficial surgical site infections (n = 4), always occurred at the upper left trocar site, where the circular stapler had been introduced. CONCLUSION Early LRYGB postoperative multislice spiral CT scan is feasible, with low morbidity, and provides more accurate anatomical information than standard upper gastrointestinal contrast study.","Delko, Tarik; Mattiello, Diana; Koestler, Thomas; Zingg, Urs; Potthast, Silke",World journal of radiology,92,1

CTP reliability, however, is limited. This study aims to identify regions misclassified as ischemic core on CTP, using infarct on follow-up noncontrast CT. We aim to assess differences in volumetric and perfusion characteristics in these regions compared to areas that ended up as infarct on follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 35 patients with >100 mm brain coverage CTP. CTP processing was performed using Philips software (IntelliSpace 7.0). Final infarct was automatically segmented on follow-up noncontrast CT and used as reference. CTP and follow-up noncontrast CT image data were registered. This allowed classification of ischemic lesion agreement (core on CTP: rMTT≥145%, aCBV<2.0 ml/100g and infarct on follow-up noncontrast CT) and misclassified ischemic core (core on CTP, not identified on follow-up noncontrast CT) regions. False discovery ratio (FDR), defined as misclassified ischemic core volume divided by total CTP ischemic core volume, was calculated. Absolute and relative CTP parameters (CBV, CBF, and MTT) were calculated for both misclassified CTP ischemic core and ischemic lesion agreement regions and compared using paired rank-sum tests. RESULTS Median total CTP ischemic core volume was 49.7ml (IQR:29.9ml-132ml); median misclassified ischemic core volume was 30.4ml (IQR:20.9ml-77.0ml). Median FDR between patients was 62% (IQR:49%-80%). Median relative mean transit time was 243% (IQR:198%-289%) and 342% (IQR:249%-432%) for misclassified and ischemic lesion agreement regions, respectively. Median absolute cerebral blood volume was 1.59 (IQR:1.43-1.79) ml/100g (P<0.01) and 1.38 (IQR:1.15-1.49) ml/100g (P<0.01) for misclassified ischemic core and ischemic lesion agreement, respectively. All CTP parameter values differed significantly. CONCLUSION For all patients a considerable region of the CTP ischemic core is misclassified. CTP parameters significantly differed between ischemic lesion agreement and misclassified CTP ischemic core, suggesting that CTP analysis may benefit from revisions.","Geuskens, Ralph R E G; Borst, Jordi; Lucas, Marit; Boers, A M Merel; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Roos, Yvo B W E M; van Walderveen, Marianne A A; Jenniskens, Sjoerd F M; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik W J; Majoie, Charles B L M; Marquering, Henk A",PloS one,92,7

Although respiratory symptoms are a key feature of the disease, many people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 also suffer acute kidney injury, a condition that exacerbates patient mortality and may have to be treated through renal replacement therapy. Much of the focus on hospital capacity during the pandemic has centered on the availability of ventilators. However, supplies for dialysis treatment, including dialysate, have also run dangerously low in hospitals at the epicenter of the pandemic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop materials that can efficiently and rapidly regenerate dialysate, removing toxins and restoring electrolyte concentrations so that this vital resource remains readily available. In this work, Ti3C2Tx, a two-dimensional transition metal carbide (MXene) that is known to efficiently adsorb urea, was used to remove creatinine and uric acid from an aqueous solution and dialysate, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 45.7 and 17.0 mg/g, respectively. We systematically analyzed and modelled the adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, thus determining the rate-limiting step and adsorption mechanism. A fixed-bed column loaded with Ti3C2Tx was designed to further evaluate the adsorption performance under continuous fluid-flow conditions, mirroring conditions of continuous renal replacement therapy modalities. The maximum capacity and 50% breakthrough volume were calculated to further approach the practical application of Ti3C2Tx for removal of uremic toxins. Our findings suggest that Ti3C2Tx has the potential to be used as an efficient sorbent for the regeneration of dialysate, allowing for accelerated dialysate regeneration by removing filtered toxins and leading to more portable dialysis devices.","Zhao, Qi; Seredych, Mykola; Precetti, Eliot; Shuck, Christopher Eugene; Harhay, Meera; Pang, Rui; Shan, Chongxin; Gogotsi, Yury",ACS nano,92,16

A novel self-anchoring barbed suture material that does not require knot tying can eliminate knot failure and reduce operating time. The goal of this study was to compare the in vivo efficacy of two novel knotless barbed sutures (absorbable and nonabsorbable) for use with the Endo Stitch™ device (Covidien), against conventional suture (Endo Stitch device with Polysorb™ suture; Covidien) for laparoscopic closure of viscerotomies in canine stomach, jejunum, and colon. METHODS Following Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval, 24 dogs underwent laparoscopic creation of 25-mm viscerotomies, three each in the stomach, jejunum, and colon. All viscerotomies were closed with the Endo Stitch device using the absorbable or nonabsorbable barbed suture or conventional suture. Closure time for each viscerotomy was recorded. Animals were survived for 3, 10, or 21 days, at which point the viscerotomies were burst-pressure tested. RESULTS The closure leak rate in this study with 216 total viscerotomy closures was 0%. There was no statistically significant difference in mean burst pressure between viscerotomies closed with barbed suture versus control suture at any of the survival intervals. Barbed suture with the Endo Stitch device was associated with statistically significantly faster closure times than the control suture with the Endo Stitch device (P<.05), resulting in a reduction in closure time between 35% and 42%. CONCLUSION This study reports the first use of barbed suture for the Endo Stitch device in laparoscopic gastrointestinal closure. The barbed suture for the Endo Stitch device is effective for laparoscopic single-layer gastrointestinal closure and is associated with a significantly reduced closure time.","Omotosho, Philip; Yurcisin, Basil; Ceppa, Eugene; Miller, Jeffrey; Kirsch, David; Portenier, Dana D",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The Conformable GORE TAG (CTAG) device (W. L. Gore & Associates, Flagstaff, Ariz) was specifically designed to be more conformable in tortuous anatomy, more resistant to compression, and more accommodating to various aortic diameters compared with the original GORE TAG device. This prospective, multicenter study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the CTAG endograft in the repair of descending TAA. METHODS This was a prospective, multicenter regulatory study with a primary end point of freedom from major device event through 1 month after treatment. Two-year outcomes included aneurysm-related morbidity (endoleaks and morphology changes), aneurysm-related mortality, and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Fifty-one patients were enrolled between October 2009 and October 2010, with at least one endograft implanted in 50 patients. After the regulatory study successfully completed its primary end point and expanded to a continued-access phase, 15 additional patients were enrolled in the continued-access arm of the study from February 2011 until September 2011, for a total treatment group of 66 patients for the early results and 65 patients for the long-term clinical results with imaging evaluation. There was one 30-day death (1.5%), two patients (3%) with spinal cord ischemia, and two central strokes (3%) ≤30 days. Five patients (7.6%) died ≤1 year; 1 of ascending aortic aneurysm rupture, 2 of cardiac disease, and 2 of respiratory failure. The core laboratory adjudicated 1-month imaging in 60 patients (92.3%), where nine endoleaks (15.0%) were identified (1 type Ia, 4 type II, and 4 indeterminate). Forty-five patients (69.2%) had 2-year imaging with five endoleaks (11.1%; two type II and three indeterminate), and one patient had a distal aortic dilatation that required a secondary intervention. At 2 years, 20 of 38 imaged patients (52.6%) had aneurysm shrinkage ≥5 mm, 15 (39.5%) had no change in diameter, and three patients (7.9%) had an increase in aneurysm diameter of ≥5 mm. There were no conversions, fractures, compressions, or aneurysm ruptures of the treated segment through 2 years. CONCLUSIONS This next-generation thoracic endograft has a low rate of major device events through 2 years, with no graft compressions or device failures. The data for this new endograft demonstrate favorable outcomes and confirm low risks for treatment for patients with TAA. Follow-up will be continued for 5 years.","Jordan, William D; Rovin, Joshua; Moainie, Sina; Bavaria, Joseph; Cambria, Richard; Fillinger, Mark; McMillan, William; Matsumura, Jon S",Journal of vascular surgery,92,1

One of the challenges in implementing telemedicine for the spine care provider is completing a comprehensive spinal examination. Currently, there is no standardized methodology to complete a full spinal examination through telemedicine. Methods We propose a novel, remote spinal examination methodology that is easily implemented through telemedicine, where the patient is an active participant in the successful completion of his or her examination. This type of examination has been validated in a neurology setting. To facilitate the telemedicine visit, we propose that video instruction be shared with the patient prior to the telemedicine visit to increase the efficacy of the examination. Results Since the issuance of stay-at-home order across the states, many spine practices around the country have rapidly adopted and increased their telemedicine program to continue provide care for patients during COVID-19 pandemic. At a tertiary academic center in a busy metropolitan area, nearly 700 telemedicine visits were successfully conducted during a 4-week period. There were no remote visits being done prior to the shutdown. Conclusions Implementation of our proposed remote spinal examination has the potential to serve as a guideline for the spine care provider to efficiently assess patients with spine disease using telemedicine. Because these are only suggestions, providers should tailor examination to each individual patient's needs. Level of Evidence V. Clinical Relevance It is likely that physicians will incorporate telemedicine into health care delivery services even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides because of telemedicine's efficiency in meeting patient needs. Using the standard maneuvers provided in our study, spine care providers can perform a nearly comprehensive spine examination through telemedicine.

The calculation is applied to the case of a male cancer patient who used I-131 lying on a bed, and a male caregiver standing beside the patient. The equivalent dose rate to the thyroid of the caregiver is calculated at 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 and 1m away from the patient, when the caregiver is standing near the patient's abdomen, chest and neck area. The results show that the dose rate to the thyroid of the male contact greatly depends on his standing position and there are clear differences between the results calculated with the point source and those calculated with the patient source. In summary, using activity distributions in the patient's body as well as the right communication circumstance helps to calculate the optimal dose for people who has been in contact with patients.","Phuong Thao, Nguyen Thi; Dubois, Pedro Arce; Trung, Nguyen Thien; Nguyen Vo, Khoa Anh; Duy, Nguyen Khanh; Son, Nguyen Dong",Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,92,1

We investigated differences in LOS, discharge disposition, and charges between hospitalizations for serious infections in patients with and without OUD. METHODS AND FINDINGS We utilized the 2016 National Inpatient Sample-a nationally representative database of all discharges from US acute care hospitals. The population of interest was all hospitalizations for infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis. The exposure was OUD, and the primary outcome was LOS until discharge, assessed by using a competing risks analysis to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of discharge disposition and adjusted differences in hospital charges were also reported. Of 95,470 estimated hospitalizations for serious infections (infective endocarditis, epidural abscess, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis), the mean age was 49 years and 35% were female. 46% had Medicare (government-based insurance coverage for people age 65+ years), and 70% were non-Hispanic white. After adjustment for potential confounders, OUD was associated with a lower probability of discharge at any given LOS (aHR 0.61; 95% CI 0.59-0.63; p < 0.001). OUD was also associated with lower odds of discharge to home (aOR 0.38; 95% CI 0.33-0.43; p < 0.001) and higher odds of discharge to a post-acute care facility (aOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.57-2.17; p < 0.001) or patient-directed discharge (also referred to as ""discharge against medical advice"") (aOR 3.47; 95% CI 2.80-4.29; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in average total hospital charges, though daily hospital charges were significantly lower for patients with OUD. Limitations include the potential for unmeasured confounders and the use of billing codes to identify cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that among hospitalizations for some serious infections, those involving patients with OUD were associated with longer LOS, higher odds of discharge to post-acute care facilities or patient-directed discharge, and similar total hospital charges, despite lower daily charges. These findings highlight opportunities to improve care for patients with OUD hospitalized with serious infections, and to reduce the growing associated costs.","Kim, June-Ho; Fine, Danielle R; Li, Lily; Kimmel, Simeon D; Ngo, Long H; Suzuki, Joji; Price, Christin N; Ronan, Matthew V; Herzig, Shoshana J",PLoS medicine,92,1

We investigate the effect of active and sham Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) treatment on working memory function of patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) considering Task Positive and Default Mode networks (TPN and DMN). METHODS An experiment with 4 levels of visuospatial n-back task was used to investigate the pattern of cortical activation in 17 men with moderate or severe OSAS before and after 2 months of therapeutic (active) or sub-therapeutic (sham) CPAP treatment. RESULTS Patients with untreated OSAS had significantly less deactivation in the temporal regions of the DMN as compared to healthy controls, but activation within TPN regions was comparatively relatively preserved. After 2 months of treatment, active and sham CPAP groups exhibited opposite trends of cerebral activation and deactivation. After treatment, the active CPAP group demonstrated an increase of cerebral activation in the TPN at all task levels and of task-related cerebral deactivation in the anterior midline and medial temporal regions of the DMN at the 3-back level, associated with a significant improvement of behavioral performance, whereas the sham CPAP group exhibited less deactivation in the temporal regions of Default Mode Network and less Task Positive Network activation associated to longer response times at the 3-back. CONCLUSION OSAS has a significant negative impact primarily on task-related DMN deactivation, particularly in the medial temporal regions, possibly due to nocturnal hypoxemia, as well as TPN activation, particularly in the right ventral fronto-parietal network. After 2 months of active nasal CPAP treatment a positive response was noted in both TPN and DMN but without compete recovery of existing behavioral and neuronal deficits. Initiation of CPAP treatment early in the course of the disease may prevent or slow down the occurrence of irreversible impairment.","Prilipko, Olga; Huynh, Nelly; Schwartz, Sophie; Tantrakul, Visasiri; Kushida, Clete; Paiva, Teresa; Guilleminault, Christian",PloS one,92,7

We analyzed 1,030,558 words from 4,313 scientific abstracts published over four decades using four previously trained lexicon-based models and one recursive neural tensor network model. We find frequently used terms share both a general and a domain-specific value, with either positive (success, protect, growth) or negative (threaten, loss, risk) sentiment. Sentiment trends suggest that reintroduction studies have become less variable and increasingly successful over time and seem to capture known successes and challenges for conservation biology.

The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated increased use of telehealth, but one limitation of telehealth is the inability to collect respiratory specimens. We initiated a protocol for at-home collection of oropharyngeal (OP) swabs from children with CF. METHODS Home respiratory specimen collection was offered during telehealth encounters. Home OP swab kits were sent to participating families via mail with instructions for collection and return. Specimens were returned by overnight shipping or dropped off at a hospital lab for processing and culture. We evaluated demographic data and compared culture results from the home-collected specimen to the most recent specimen collected in clinic. We also tracked the frequency of newly identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS Home OP swab kits were sent to families of 33 children with CF (range 1.5-19 yrs). OP swab kits were successfully returned from 19 children (range 1.5-19 yrs). One or more CF pathogens grew from 79% of the specimens. For 4 individuals, the home collected specimen demonstrated new growth of P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS Home collection of OP swabs for bacterial culture is feasible in children with CF across a range of ages. Most home-collected specimens demonstrated growth of one or more CF pathogens and results were similar to recent in-clinic specimens, suggesting acceptable sample collection technique. Anti-pseudomonal therapy was initiated for 4 children based on growth of P. aeruginosa from the home respiratory specimen. This article is protected by copyright.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted problems of sustainable infection prevention and control measures worldwide, particularly the emerging issues with an insufficient supply of personal protective equipment. The aim of this study was to provide an action plan for mitigation of occupational hazards and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 through a failure mode analysis based on observations during in situ simulations. METHODS A multicenter, cross-sectional, observational, simulation-based study was performed in Latvia from March 2 to 26, 2020. This study was conducted at 7 hospitals affiliated with Riga Stradiņš University. The presentation of a COVID-19 patient was simulated with an in situ simulations, followed by a structured debrief. Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis is a tool for conducting a systematic, proactive analysis of a process in which harm may occur. We used Healthcare Failure Modes and Effects Analysis to analyze performance gaps and systemic issues. RESULTS A total of 67 healthcare workers from 7 hospitals participated in the study (range = 4-17). A total of 32 observed failure modes were rated using a risk matrix. Twenty-seven failure modes (84.4%) were classified as either medium or high risk or were single-point weaknesses, hence evaluated for action type and action; 11 (40.7%) were related to organizational, 11 (40.7%) to individual, and 5 (18.5%) to environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS Simulation-based failure mode analysis helped us identify the risks related to the preparedness of the healthcare workers and emergency departments for the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. We believe that this approach can be implemented to assess and maintain readiness for the outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases in the future.","Balmaks, Reinis; Grāmatniece, Alise; Vilde, Aija; Ļuļļa, Mārtiņš; Dumpis, Uga; Gross, Isabel Theresia; Šlēziņa, Ieva",Simulation in healthcare : journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare,92,19

RECENT FINDINGS Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) patients have significantly higher rSO2 compared with no bystander CPR patients. It is unclear how quickly rSO2 changes with hemodynamic instability. rSO2 during mechanical CPR varies between 44 and 55% and manual CPR varies between 20 and 40%, representing a significant relative rSO2 increase. Studies have found a relationship between rSO2 and restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and rSO2 increase can be used as a sign of ROSC. rSO2 evaluation is effective for monitoring quality of resuscitation and neurological prognostication. It seems that cardiac arrest patients with good neurologic outcome have significantly higher rSO2 levels (CPC 1-2 median rSO2 68%, CPC 3-5 median rSO2 58%, P < 0.01) and good neurologic outcome (CPC 1-2) increased 'in proportion to the patients' rSO2 levels irrespective of their ROSC status at hospital arrival'. However, most of the studies are small and a prospective outcome study focusing on rSO2 values is needed. SUMMARY Near-infrared spectroscopy and rSO2 have been used as a monitor during CPR, detection of ROSC, after ROSC, and during post-resuscitation care. Prospective, controlled, randomized clinical studies are needed to document their wide use.","Wik, Lars",Current opinion in critical care,92,17

So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions-conceptual, methodological and procedural-that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.","Biller-Andorno, Nikola; Ferrario, Andrea; Joebges, Susanne; Krones, Tanja; Massini, Federico; Barth, Phyllis; Arampatzis, Georgios; Krauthammer, Michael",Journal of medical ethics,92,24

This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and cosmetic results of a novel technique: single incision laparoscopic (SIL) appendectomy. METHODS The study enrolled consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Appendectomy was performed using three trocars and conventional laparoscopic instruments through a single small umbilical incision (length, ~3 cm). The patients received standard pre- and postoperative care and presented for a follow-up visit after a mean of 27 days. RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 26 patients (10 women and 16 men) with an average age of 44 years (range, 13-83 years). Of 26 appendectomies, 22 (85%) were achieved through a single surgical site. The mean SIL appendectomy operative time was 58 min (range, 33-107 min). No operative complications occurred. The average postoperative hospital stay was 1.2 days for nonperforated appendicitis and 2.7 days for perforated appendicitis. At the follow-up visit, no patient showed any evidence of incisional hernia. The operative incisions were minimally visible, and all the individuals reported a highly favorable cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSIONS The results of the study demonstrated that laparoscopic appendectomy can be achieved through a single umbilical incision using conventional instruments and that this approach is successful, safe, and aesthetic.","Chiu, Connie G; Nguyen, Nam H; Bloom, Scott W",Surgical endoscopy,92,1

The latest data estimated that exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, contributes to approximately 4 million deaths worldwide due to cardiopulmonary conditions such as heart disease and stroke, respiratory infections, chronic lung disease and lung cancer. During recent years, there has been growing concern about the adverse effects of this global threat on oral health which is one of key components of general health and quality of life. Although a few studies have reported such possible association, the findings are still far from conclusion. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To our knowledge, the analysis of literature regarding this scope has yet been published. Thus, current work systematically assesses existing evidences on the potential association between exposure to PM2.5 and the development of various oral diseases as well as figures out the plausible paradigm of PM2.5-induced damages in the oral cavity through its toxic chemical constituents along with its ability to induce oxidative stress via reactive oxygen species production.

MATERIALS & METHODS The records of the patients who underwent our modified laparoscopic partial nephrectomy technique were evaluated retrospectively. The patients' medical records, including tumor complexity calculated via R.E.N.A.L nephrometry scores, operation time, estimated blood loss, blood transfusions, hospital stay, pre- and postoperative serum creatinine levels, complications via the Clavien classification system, pathological status of surgical margin, and follow-up times, were documented. RESULTS The data of 55 patients with 58 renal units were evaluated. Almost all tumors were in the low complex group (91%), with a mean size of 31.74 ± 7.38 mm (range: 12-46 mm). Mean operation time, estimated blood loss, and transfusion rates were 138.62 ± 38.45 minutes (range: 90-240 min), 242.24 ± 107.12 mL (range: 100-500 mL), and 19%, respectively. The hemoglobin level decreased by a mean of 2.05 ± 0.87 g/dL. Whereas the perioperative complications were Clavien grades I, II, and III (74%, 23%, and 3%, respectively), mean hospital stay and follow-up time were 4.05 ± 1.97 and 19.67 ± 13.57 (ranges: 2-10 days and 1-44 months), respectively.

METHODS In a prospective fashion, N95 respirators (n = 15) were randomized to a decontamination process (time, dry heat, or ultraviolet C light [UVC]) in outpatient clinics. Each respirator was re-used up to 5 separate clinic sessions. Swabs on each respirator for SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and fungi were obtained before clinic, after clinic and post-treatment. Mask integrity was checked after each treatment (n = 68). Statistical analyses were performed to determine factors for positive samples. RESULTS All three decontamination processes reduced bacteria counts similarly. On multivariate mixed model analysis, there were an additional 8.1 colonies of bacteria (95% CI 5.7 to 10.5; p < 0.01) on the inside compared to the outside surface of the respirators. Treatment resulted in a decrease of bacterial load by 8.6 colonies (95% CI -11.6 to -5.5; p < 0.01). Although no decontamination treatment affected the respirator filtration efficiency, heat treatments were associated with the breakdown of thermoplastic elastomer straps. Contamination with fungal and SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were minimal to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS Time, heat and UVC all reduced bacterial load on reused N95 respirators. Fungal contamination was minimal. Heat could permanently damage some elastic straps making the respirators nonfunctional. Given its effectiveness against microbes, lack of damage to re-treated respirators and logistical ease, UVC represents an optimal decontamination method for individual N95 respirators when reuse is necessary.","Jiang, Zi Yang; Huang, Zhen; Schmale, Isaac; Brown, Eric L; Lorenz, Michael C; Patlovich, Scott J; Goswami, Karan; Wilson, Hannah B; Ahmad, Jumah; Alexander, Ronda; Bryan, William; Burke, Luke; Citardi, Martin J; Elias, Jose; Ho, Tang; Jacob, Jack; Low, Garren; Miramón, Pedro; Patki, Aniruddha U; Yao, William C; Luong, Amber U",American journal of otolaryngology,92,19

We further aimed to investigate the correlation of laboratory data and lymph node stiffness to provide a reference basis for the early diagnosis of NFKD. METHODS Lymph node stiffness measurements were prospectively performed in 47 patients with NFKD, 56 patients with BCL, and 56 HC using SWE. Cervical SWE was compared in the groups. Factors associated with increased cervical lymph node stiffness were studied. RESULTS The mean elasticity of the largest cervical lymph nodes was significantly higher in the BCL group than the NFKD and HC groups (mean elasticity ± SD, 16.37 ± 2.45, 12.22 ± 2.64, and 7.81 ± 1.67 kPa, respectively; P < .01), with a cutoff of 14.55 kPa (area under the curve, 0.885; sensitivity, 89%; and specificity, 76%). In patients with NFKD, interleukin 6 (standardized β = 0.363; P = .01), alanine aminotransferase (standardized β = 0.253; P = .03), aspartate aminotransaminase (standardized β = 0.536; P = .047), and total bilirubin (standardized β = 0.486; P < .01) values were correlated with increased largest cervical lymph node stiffness. CONCLUSIONS Cervical lymph node stiffness was different between NFKD and BCL.

For this purpose, 200 one day old broilers were randomly allotted into four groups, each with five replicates (10 birds per replicate). Four starter and finisher experimental rations were formulated by using (A) 0, (B) 1.25, (C) 2.5, and (D) 3.75 g kg-1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Experimental diets were contaminated with aflatoxin B1 (100 ppb kg-1 diet). The experimental chicks were kept under standard managerial conditions, and the vaccination program was followed against infectious bursal disease (IBD), infectious bronchitis (IB), and Newcastle disease (ND) diseases. At the end of the feeding trial, carcass, organ weight, and blood samples were collected randomly to determine the carcass traits and antibody titer against ND and IBD viruses. Throughout the experiment, the addition of 3.75 g kg-1 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall (Group-D) in feed resulted in the highest weight gain, final weight, feed intake, and the lowest FCR values followed by C group compared with the other groups. All carcass traits were significantly (p > 0.05) improved by increasing the inclusion levels of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in broiler diets. It could be concluded that the broiler diet supplemented with 2.5 or 3.75 g kg-1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a biodegrading agent resulted in improved growth performance, immunity activity and carcass traits, and supplementation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae at these levels can be used effectively in broiler diets without negatively affecting bird health status.","Arif, Muhammad; Iram, Atia; Bhutta, Muhammad A K; Naiel, Mohammed A E; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E; Othman, Sarah I; Allam, Ahmed A; Amer, Mahmoud S; Taha, Ayman E",Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,92,1

Its N-terminal region harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, and its C-terminus contains a cap assembling line composed of a capping domain and a methyltransferase domain (MTase) followed by a C-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function. The L protein MTase catalyzes methylation at the 2'-O and N-7 positions of the cap structures. In addition, the MTase of Ebola virus can induce cap-independent internal adenosine 2'-O-methylation. In this work, we investigated the CTD role in the regulation of the cap-dependent and cap-independent MTase activities of the L protein. We found that the CTD, which is enriched in basic amino acids, plays a key role in RNA binding and in turn regulates the different MTase activities. We demonstrated that the mutation of CTD residues modulate specificaly the different MTase activities. Altogether, our results highlight the pivotal role of the L protein CTD in the control of viral RNA methylation, which is critical for Ebola virus replication and escape from the innate response in infected cells.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus infects human and non-human primates causing severe infections that are often fatal. The epidemics, in West and Central Africa, emphasize the urgent need to develop antiviral therapies. The Ebola virus large protein (L), which is the central protein for viral RNA replication/transcription, harbors a methyltransferase domain followed by a C-terminal domain of unknown function. We show that the C-terminal domain regulates the L protein methyltransferase activities and consequently participates in viral replication and escape of the host innate immunity.","Valle, Coralie; Martin, Baptiste; Debart, Françoise; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Imbert, Isabelle; Canard, Bruno; Coutard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne",Journal of virology,92,28

RESULTS Psychiatric history and current social support and mental health were not statistically significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19 after analyses controlled for other characteristics. In order of magnitude, having any friends or family who had COVID-19, being a veteran, having a greater number of close friends or relatives, having any history of homelessness, having an advanced degree, or being a student was significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19.

However, no study has investigated whether pain intensity and pain perception thresholds are distinct or similar between sexes within various chronic pain entities. We investigated whether average pain intensities and pain thresholds assessed using quantitative sensory testing (QST) differed between women and men suffering from three distinct chronic pain conditions: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS type I), peripheral nerve injury (PNI) or polyneuropathy (PNP), as compared to paired healthy volunteers. METHODS QST data of 1252 patients (669 female, 583 male) with PNI (n=342), PNP (n=571) or CRPS (n=339), and average pain intensity reports from previously published studies were included. Absolute and z-values (adjusted for age and body region) of cold, heat, pressure (PPT) and pinprick pain thresholds were compared in generalized linear models with aetiology, duration of underlying pain disease and average pain intensity as fixed effects. RESULTS Average pain intensity during the past four weeks did not differ between women and men, in both mean and range. In women absolute pain thresholds for cold, heat and pinprick were lower than in males across all diagnoses (p<.05). However, after z-transformation these differences disappeared except for PPT in CRPS (p=.001). DISCUSSION Pain thresholds in patients show only minor sex differences. However, these differences mimic those observed in healthy subjects and do not seem to be linked to specific pathophysiological processes. SIGNIFICANCE Female healthy participants and female patients with neuropathic pain conditions or CRPS I report lower pain thresholds compared to males, but pain intensity is similar and there is no sex difference in the extent to which the thresholds are altered in neuropathic pain or CRPS. Thus, the sex differences observed in various chronic pain conditions mimic those obtained in healthy participants, indicating that these differences are not linked to specific pathophysiological processes and are of minor clinical relevance.","Meyer-Frießem, C H; Attal, N; Baron, R; Bouhassira, D; Finnerup, N B; Freynhagen, R; Gierthmühlen, J; Haanpää, M; Hansson, P; Jensen, T S; Kemp, H; Kennedy, D; Leffler, A-S; Rice, Asc; Segerdahl, M; Serra, J; Sindrup, S; Solà, R; Tölle, T; Schuh-Hofer, S; Treede, R-D; Pogatzki-Zahn, E; Maier, C; Vollert, J",European journal of pain,92,7

Physical activity is recommended as a primary treatment for mild to moderate depression and a secondary treatment for moderate to severe depression. Despite this, specific guidelines are still lacking on how to best promote physical activity in this population. Accordingly, this policy brief provides evidence-based recommendations for primary care providers and allied health professionals to promote lifelong physical activity in individuals with depression. Recommendations include asking for permission to discuss physical activity with the individual; framing physical activity as something that they have control over in order to feel better; clarifying that incorporating even a few more minutes of weekly physical activity is better than nothing and that mild forms are enough to achieve mental health benefits; and providing choices of activities to try and accompanying them on their first few sessions. Moreover, this article highlights the importance of promoting physical activity enjoyment for this population, which can be done by guiding the individual to slowly build up the frequency, duration and intensity of activity; encouraging them to be self-compassionate toward physical activity; suggesting they engage in outdoor activity, listen to music, and/or participate with a buddy or group; and incorporate self-monitoring or journalling to solidify the link between physical activity and improved mood. Practitioners are encouraged to use these evidence-informed recommendations-especially maximizing choices, enhancing physical activity enjoyment and emphasizing personal preferences-to help individuals with depression move, recover and flourish. These recommendations may also be used to tailor future interventions and inform policy guidelines to reduce depression rates in Canada.","Fortier, Michelle; McFadden, Taylor; Faulkner, Guy","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",92,1

Since endoscopic intraoperative anastomotic testing allows direct visualization of anastomosis, complication rates may be theoretically reduced by the use of this technique. METHODS A prospective study involving 118 consecutive oncologic patients undergoing endoscopically tested gastrointestinal stapled anastomoses was carried out. As controls, 148 historical patients without anastomotic testing were used for comparisons. RESULTS In the study group, anastomotic testing revealed 16 defects: 11 (9.3%) air leaks and five (4.3%) bleeding anastomoses. All leaks were oversewn and secured. Bleeding anastomoses were managed under direct visualization, and one non-patent anastomosis was redone. Forty-one (15.4%) postoperative anastomotic complications were observed: eight (3%) bleeding anastomoses, seven (2.6%) stenoses, and 26 (9.8%) clinical leaks. No early dehiscence or bleeding occurred if anastomoses were intraoperatively checked, while these complications were significantly more frequent in non-checked anastomoses (6.1% and 5.4%, respectively). Conversely, late leak and stenosis rates were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSION Endoscopic anastomotic testing was a safe and reliable method to assess integrity of gastrointestinal anastomoses, to correct any defect under direct visualization, and to avoid early complications. However, this method seemed inadequate to predict late anastomotic complications.","Lieto, Eva; Orditura, Michele; Castellano, Paolo; Pinto, Margherita; Zamboli, Anna; De Vita, Ferdinando; Pignatelli, Carlo; Galizia, Gennaro",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,92,29

However, almost no studies focused on cold warning systems to prevent those health effects. For Nordic regions, like the province of Quebec in Canada, winter is long and usually very cold with an observed increase in mortality and hospitalizations throughout the season. However, there is no existing system specifically designed to follow in real-time this mortality increase throughout the season and to alert public health authorities prior to cold waves. OBJECTIVE The aim is to establish a watch and warning system specifically for health impacts of cold, applied to different climatic regions of the province of Quebec. METHODOLOGY A methodology previously used to establish the health-heat warning system in Quebec is adapted to cold. The approach identifies cold weather indicators and establishes thresholds related to extreme over-mortality or over-hospitalization events in the province of Quebec, Canada. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The final health-related thresholds proposed are between (-15 °C, -23 °C) and (-20 °C, -29 °C) according to the climatic region for excesses of mortality, and between (-13 °C, -23 °C) and (-17 °C, -30 °C) for excesses of hospitalization. These results suggest that the system model has a high sensitivity and an acceptable number of false alarms. This could lead to the establishment of a cold-health watch and warning system with valid indicators and thresholds for each climatic region of Quebec. It can be seen as a complementary system to the existing one for heat warnings, in order to help the public health authorities to be well prepared during an extreme cold event.","Yan, Bixun; Chebana, Fateh; Masselot, Pierre; Campagna, Céline; Gosselin, Pierre; Ouarda, Taha B M J; Lavigne, Éric",The Science of the total environment,92,1

Our results show strong stockpiling effects for most of the products in the first week of adoption of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, the number of new cases at the municipal level is associated with reductions in sales, pointing towards increased fears of being infected as the main driver of the slowdown in sales.

This study was designed to assess the prognostic significance of NPS in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to compare its prognostic accuracy with that of other systemic inflammatory and nutritional index. METHODS We retrospectively examined 165 patients with locally advanced ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by curative resection between January 2011 and September 2019. Patients were divided into three groups based on their NPS before neoadjuvant therapy (Group 0: NPS = 0; Group 1: NPS = 1-2; Group 2: NPS = 3-4). We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and survival rates among the groups. RESULTS The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001). The NPS was superior to other systemic inflammatory and nutritional index for predicting prognoses, as determined using area under the curves (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the NPS was a significant predictor of poor RFS (Group 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.897, P = 0.049; Group 2: HR 3.979, P < 0.001) and OS (Group 1: HR 2.152, P = 0.033; Group 2: HR 3.239, P = 0.006).

Integrins are bidirectional, cell surface receptors that transduce mechanical and chemical signals to and from the extracellular matrix. We recently reported that keratinocyte α3β1 is required for interleukin (IL)-1α secretion. Importantly, IL-1α regulates fibroblast Cox-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) secretion, thereby linking keratinocyte integrin function to a paracrine signal that suppresses the myofibroblast phenotype. We now report that fibroblast integrin α4β1 is required for this IL-1α-induced, Cox-2 expression. Moreover, Cox-2 induction by IL-1α requires Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), the master regulator of redox homeostasis; and integrin α4β1 is necessary to maintain IL-1α-dependent, Nrf2 levels. Treating fibroblasts with a Nrf-2 activating compound inhibits TGF-β-dependent, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and stress fibre formation. Our data suggest that fibroblast integrin α4β1 regulates-depending on microenvironmental cues-the differentiated state of fibroblasts through a signalling network in which IL-1α, Cox-2 and Nrf2 participate.","Zheng, Rui; Varney, Scott D; Wu, Lei; DiPersio, C Michael; Van De Water, Livingston",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,92,1

METHODS Regional data on SI and SSI certification in the period after the onset of the lockdown (19 March 2020-18 June 2020) were compared to the period immediately before lockdown (1 January 2020-18 March 2020) and to the same periods in 2019. Change documented was compared to post-lockdown reductions in primary and secondary ophthalmic care activity. RESULTS In 2019, during the 3-month period (19 March 2019-18 June 2019), 115 individuals were certified as sight impaired (SI 36, SSI 75, unspecified 4). Of those certified, 65 were female, 49 male. Principal causes of certification were: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (N = 45), glaucoma (N = 20) and diabetic eye disease (DED) (N = 10). Mean VA, recorded from the better eye of those certified, was 0.96 LogMAR. In the 3 months following the onset of lockdown (19 March 2020-18 June 2020), only 37 individuals were certified (SI 6, SSI 31), 12 female and 25 male. AMD was the most frequent cause of sight impairment (N = 20). There were only two DED certifications and one due to glaucoma. Mean VA in the better eye of those certified was 1.15LogMAR. The numbers of CVI certifications completed following the introduction of COVID-19 lockdown fell by 68%, compared to the 2019 data. There was a significant reduction in the proportion of female certifications (p = 0.01), and in certifications due to glaucoma (p = 0.02). The proportion of those certified as SSI as opposed to SI in the period after the onset of lockdown rose from 68% in 2019 to 84% in 2020. The mean VA of those certified in the period after the onset of lockdown, when compared to those certified in the other three periods, was worse by between 0.21 and 0.19 LogMAR (p = 0.06). Reductions reflected change in overall primary and secondary ophthalmic care activity. CONCLUSIONS It is inconceivable that COVID-19 has reduced the incidence of sight-threatening eye disease. We must therefore assume that a flood of newly presenting sight loss will present once the pandemic has passed. New presentations will include those who would normally have attended during the lockdown period, and patients who, had they accessed ophthalmic care at the appropriate time, would have been saved from severe levels of blindness. The implications of the predicted increase in demand for medical, social and low vision related services are huge.","Jackson, Jonathan; Silvestri, Giuliana; Stevenson, Michael; Sinton, Janet; Witherow, Jacqueline; McCann, Roseleen; Moutray, Tanya; Cushley, Laura",Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians,92,28

Amid reported health and mental health disparities, and economic insecurity, we conducted a scoping review to explore the breadth of the literature, map and summarize the evidence, and identify knowledge gaps on LGBT+ inclusion and human rights in Thailand. METHODS We conducted a scoping review in accordance with the methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We systematically searched 16 databases for peer-reviewed literature, and government and nongovernmental organization websites for grey literature, published in English or Thai from January 1, 2000-August 21, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened studies according to pre-set criteria. We abstracted and analyzed data on publication characteristics and focal populations, and synthesized findings in six domains of LGBT+ inclusion: political and civic participation, education, family, personal security and violence, economic well-being, and health. RESULTS The review captured 3327 results in total, which was scoped to 76 peer-reviewed articles and 39 grey literature sources, the majority published after 2010. Gay men and transgender women were the primary focal populations in the peer-reviewed literature, LGBT+ people as a whole in the grey literature. Health was the predominant domain across publications. Key findings include the absence of generalized antidiscrimination legislation for LGBT+ individuals and lack of recourse for transgender individuals to change their legal gender; multifaceted stigma and discrimination in the educational system; social isolation and exclusion in families; disproportionate prevalence of sexual violence and reluctance to report to police; discrimination and marginalization in employment; and LGBT+ disparities in health and mental health. CONCLUSIONS Future research and programmatic initiatives on LGBT+ inclusion in Thailand should aim to address: 1) understudied populations-lesbian and bisexual women, transmasculine persons; 2) underrepresented topics, including constraints to LGBT+ advocacy; 3) strategic policy initiatives around anti-discrimination laws and legal recognition of same-sex marriage and families; and 4) the need for consistent collection of disaggregated data on LGBT+ persons in education, family, economic, personal security/violence, and health domains in order to assess indicators of inclusion and progress in advancing human rights for LGBT+ people in Thailand.","Newman, Peter A; Reid, Luke; Tepjan, Suchon; Akkakanjanasupar, Pakorn",BMC public health,92,1

Patients complain about difficulty to remember knowledge that has been recently learnt together with its context (episodic memory, EM) but also more complex events that have been personally experienced (autobiographical memory, AM). While deficits at both encoding and retrieval have been shown to account for EM disorders in schizophrenia, the cognitive mechanisms involved in AM disorders are more difficult to approach. This is partly explained by the conceptual difference between EM and AM. Some methodological limitations inherent to the AM research also reduce the possibility to investigate the early processing of complex and dynamic real-life events at encoding; rather the retrieval processes engaged have therefore been the focus of the bulk of extant research. The aim of this review is to summarize the main findings related to EM and AM research in patients with schizophrenia, to discuss the putative mechanisms that may account for patients' AM impairment, based in particular on the literature about EM, and to provide an agenda for future research aiming to further elucidate the role of encoding deficits in AM in patients.","Kwok, Sze Chai; Xu, Xinming; Duan, Wei; Wang, Xinyi; Tang, Yingying; Allé, Mélissa C; Berna, Fabrice",Clinical psychology review,92,16

METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 141 patients with 146 varicoceles (mean age: 29.3 years; range: 13 - 60 years) who underwent foam sclerotherapy with polidocanol 2% (range: 2 - 12 ml) in an outpatient setting between January 2007 and December 2013. For the follow-up, telephone interviews with the patients were conducted (mean follow-up time: 46.4 months, standard deviation: 20.17 months). RESULTS The technical success rate was 91.8%. There was a 55.8% response rate to the telephone interviews. Follow-up revealed a clinical success rate of 83.9% and a persistence or relapse rate of 16.1%. Of the patients, 81.9% were absolutely satisfied with the outcome. In 94.9% of cases, pain or discomfort resolution was reported, and in 97% of cases, aesthetic issues were no longer a problem. Of partners, 63.2% achieved pregnancy, and in 50% of patients with preprocedural testicular atrophy, catch-up growth was observed. One patient with pampiniform plexus phlebitis received inpatient treatment with no long-term damage recorded. CONCLUSIONS Polidocanol foam varicocele sclerotherapy is a safe and effective procedure, with a high rate of patients' satisfaction, clinical and technical success, and considerable catch-up growth and pregnancy achievement. KEY POINTS • Varicocele treatment using polidocanol foam sclerotherapy is a safe and effective procedure. • It is easily feasible in an outpatient setting. • The clinical and technical success rates are high. • It shows a high rate of patients' satisfaction and symptom resolution. • Postinterventional catch-up growth and pregnancy achievement are considerable.","Ali, Alma; Wirth, Stefan; Treitl, Karla Maria; Treitl, Marcus",European radiology,92,2

We examined changes in the prevalence of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) between February 2019 and March-April 2020; if there were changes in major depression and GAD during six weeks of nationwide lockdown; and we identified factors that predicted major depression and GAD across the six-week lockdown period. Nationally representative samples of Irish adults were gathered using identical methods in February 2019 (N = 1020) and March-April 2020 (N = 1041). The latter was reassessed six weeks later. Significantly more people screened positive for depression in February 2019 (29.8% 95% CI = 27.0, 32.6) than in March-April 2020 (22.8% 95% CI = 20.2, 25.3), and there was no change in GAD. There were no significant changes in depression and GAD during the lockdown. Major depression was predicted by younger age, non-city dwelling, lower resilience, higher loneliness, and higher somatic problems. GAD was predicted by a broader set of variables including several COVID-19 specific variables. These findings indicate that the prevalence of major depression and GAD did not increase as a result of, or during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.","Hyland, Philip; Shevlin, Mark; Murphy, Jamie; McBride, Orla; Fox, Robert; Bondjers, Kristina; Karatzias, Thanos; Bentall, Richard P; Martinez, Anton; Vallières, Frédérique",Psychiatry research,92,1

METHODS From August 2010 to August 2014, a total of 112 patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax undergoing thoracoscopic bullectomy were enrolled. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics between recurrent and non-recurrent cases and examined their association with the material used for visceral pleural coverage: polyglycolic acid sheet versus oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh. RESULTS 57 patients underwent thoracoscopic bullectomy plus coverage using oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh and 55 underwent thoracoscopic bullectomy plus coverage using polyglycolic acid sheet. The recurrence rate among all patients was 13.3%. No severe postoperative complications were observed in either group. There were no significant differences in the perioperative outcomes. However, the postoperative recurrence rate was significantly higher in the oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh group than in the polyglycolic acid sheet group (22.8 vs 3.6%). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that coverage with oxidized regerated cellulose mesh was not superior to coverage with polyglycolic acid sheet for postoperative recurrent pneumothorax.","Ozawa, Yuichiro; Sakai, Mitsuaki; Ichimura, Hideo",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,92,1

METHODS This is a retrospective population-based study. The data used came from Taiwan's National Health Insurance reimbursement claims dataset, the National Account compiled by Taiwan's Statistical Bureau of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the National Health Account by Taiwan's Department of Health from 2001 to 2005. Frequency and expenditure variables were derived from these datasets. RESULTS The annual scintigraphy use rate in Taiwan was 13.57/1000 people from 2001-2005. On average, expenditures for scintigraphy accounted for 0.24% of National Health Insurance expenditures, 0.13% of the nation's total health expenditures and 0.00008% of the gross domestic product of Taiwan. The ratio of scintigraphy to computed tomography use was 0.37 and the scintigraphy to magnetic resonance imaging ratio was 1.14. The ratio of expenditures for scintigraphy and computed tomography was 0.23 and that for scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging was 0.36. CONCLUSION A comparative approach is useful for assessing healthcare needs. Although the Taiwanese experience might not apply to all countries, the results of this study can serve as an international benchmark for assessing the need for scintigraphy in countries around the world.","Chan, Wing P; Liao, Chih-Hsien; Hsu, Chung-Huei; Yang, Che-Ming",Nuclear medicine communications,92,1

In the absence of an effective vaccine, the pandemic is likely to persist in the medium term and during this time it is important that the feasibility and effectiveness of remote solutions is considered. We have previously established the feasibility of the Rehabilitation Strategies following Oesophago-gastric Cancer (ReStOre) intervention - a face to face multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer survivors. This study will examine the feasibility of a virtually delivered 12-week multi-component ReStOre@Home programme. Methods: This single arm feasibility study will recruit 12 patients who have completed curative treatment for oesophago-gastric cancer. Participants will complete the 12-week ReStOre@Home programme consisting of exercise (aerobic and resistance training), 1:1 dietary counselling and group education sessions through virtual delivery. Underpinned by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Framework, feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, adherence, retention, incidents, and acceptability. Acceptability will be assessed qualitatively through post-intervention interview and the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes will be assessed pre and post-intervention and will include measures of physical performance (cardiopulmonary exercise test, short physical performance battery, hand grip strength, Godin Leisure Time Questionnaire, and body composition), health related quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and oesophago-gastric cancer specific subscale (EORTC-QLQ-OG25), fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20), and venous blood samples will be collected for the UGI Cancer Survivorship Biobank.

The oral, nasal, and pharyngeal cavities (ONP) contain lymphoid tissue and epithelium that are in contact with the amniotic fluid. The ability of the ONP epithelium and lymphoid tissue to initiate a FIR is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine if FIR occurs after selective ONP exposure to LPS in fetal sheep. METHODS Using fetal recovery surgery, we isolated ONP from the fetal lung, GI tract, and amniotic fluid by tracheal and esophageal ligation and with an occlusive glove fitted over the snout. LPS (5 mg) or saline was infused with 24 h Alzet pumps secured in the oral cavity (n = 7-8/group). Animals were delivered 1 or 6 days after initiation of the LPS or saline infusions. RESULTS The ONP exposure to LPS had time-dependent systemic inflammatory effects with changes in WBC in cord blood, an increase in posterior mediastinal lymph node weight at 6 days, and pro-inflammatory mRNA responses in the fetal plasma, lung, and liver. Compared to controls, the expression of surfactant protein A mRNA increased 1 and 6 days after ONP exposure to LPS. CONCLUSION ONP exposure to LPS alone can induce a mild FIR with time-dependent inflammatory responses in remote fetal tissues not directly exposed to LPS.","Maneenil, Gunlawadee; Kemp, Matthew W; Kannan, Paranthaman Senthamarai; Kramer, Boris W; Saito, Masatoshi; Newnham, John P; Jobe, Alan H; Kallapur, Suhas G",PloS one,92,16

We have developed kinase translocation reporters (KTRs), which enable multiplexed measurements of the dynamics of kinase activity at a single-cell level. These KTRs are composed of an engineered construct in which a kinase substrate is fused to a bipartite nuclear localization signal (bNLS) and nuclear export signal (NES), as well as to a fluorescent protein for microscopy-based detection of its localization. The negative charge introduced by phosphorylation of the substrate is used to directly modulate nuclear import and export, thereby regulating the reporter's distribution between the cytoplasm and nucleus. The relative cytoplasmic versus nuclear fluorescence of the KTR construct (the C/N ratio) is used as a proxy for the kinase activity in living, single cells. Multiple KTRs can be studied in the same cell by fusing them to different fluorescent proteins. Here, we present a protocol to execute and analyze live-cell microscopy experiments using KTRs. We describe strategies for development of new KTRs and procedures for lentiviral expression of KTRs in a cell line of choice. Cells are then plated in a 96-well plate, from which multichannel fluorescent images are acquired with automated time-lapse microscopy.

Using flow diverter stent alone to treat cerebral aneurysm is recognized as a safe and effective method. However, flow diverter stents currently available have limitations due to their braided structures. In this paper a novel flow diverter stent is proposed. It is made out of nitinol tubes that provide adequate radial stiffness and tailored surface coverage to overcome problems of currently available braided stents while retaining low porosity and excellent longitudinal flexibility. Finite element analysis using Abaqus has been conducted to investigate radial stiffness, longitudinal flexibility, and maximum strain during packaging of a series of novel stent designs with varied geometric parameters. Results show that porosity below 70% can be achieved and provides radial stiffness and longitudinal flexibility comparable to those of the Neuroform stent that is commonly used for stent assisted coiling. The novel flow diverter has showed great potential for direct treatment of cerebral aneurysms.","Ma, Jiayao; You, Zhong; Byrne, James; Rizkallah, Rafik R",Annals of biomedical engineering,92,16

To improve the quality of care and to minimize healthcare costs and its economic burden, many healthcare organizations introduce care pathways to improve efficiency across the continuum of cancer care. However, there is limited research on the effects of cancer care pathways in different settings. METHODS The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis described in this protocol is to synthesize existing literature on the effects of oncological care pathways. We will conduct a systematic search strategy to identify all relevant literature in several biomedical databases, including Cochrane library, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. We will follow the methodology of Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC), and we will include randomized trials, non-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies. In addition, we will include full economic evaluations (cost-effectiveness analyses, cost-utility analyses, and cost-benefit analyses), cost analyses, and comparative resource utilization studies, if available. Two reviewers will independently screen all studies and evaluate those included for risk of bias. From these studies, we will extract data regarding patient, professional, and health systems outcomes. Our systematic review will follow the PRISMA set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

In this study, the effects of CO exposure on the dentate gyrus (DG) were investigated in a Wistar rat model by histochemical and molecular methods. Model rats showed significant cognitive impairment in the passive-avoidance test beginning 7 days after CO exposure. Immunohistochemistry showed that compared to the control, the cell number of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2)+/brain lipid binding protein (BLBP)+/glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ cells in the DG was significantly less, but the number of SOX2+/GFAP- cells was not, reflecting a decreased number of type 1 and type 2a neural precursor cells. Compared to the control, the numbers of CD11b+ cells and neuron glial antigen 2+ cells were significantly less, but the number of SOX2-/GFAP+ cells was not. Flow cytometry showed that the percent of live microglial cells isolated from the hippocampus in this CO rat model was significantly lower than in controls. Furthermore, mRNA expression of fibroblast growth factor 2 and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, which are neurogenic factors, was significantly decreased in that area.

The degree of ventricular arrhythmias was assessed, and the ischemic area was evaluated in percent of the area at risk. Microscopic characterization of the myocardium was employed to assess the cardioprotective effect of hypoxic and/or hyperoxic preconditioning. According to Kruskal-Wallis test, the greatest resistance of the myocardium to ischemic and reperfusion injury was observed after hypoxic-hyperoxic preconditioning (H=42.459; p=0.009). The rabbits subjected to this type of preconditioning demonstrated the least damaged myocardium in comparison with nonconditioned controls.","Mandel', I A; Podoksenov, A Yu; Sukhodolo, I V; Podoksenov, Yu K; Svirko, Yu S; Kamenshchikov, N O; Mikheev, S L; Sementsov, A S; Rogovskaya, Yu V; An, D A; Shipulin, V M; Maslov, L N",Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,92,1

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of ischemic stroke after intraprocedural thrombosis after stent-assisted coiling and pipeline embolization device placement. METHODS A retrospective analysis of intracranial aneurysms treated with stent-assisted coiling or pipeline embolization device placement between 2007 and 2016 at 4 major academic institutions was performed to identify procedures that were complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis. RESULTS Intraprocedural thrombosis occurred in 34 (4.6%) procedures. Postprocedural ischemic stroke and hemorrhage occurred in 20.6% (7/34) and 11.8% (4/34) of procedures complicated by intraprocedural thrombosis, respectively. Current smoking was an independent predictor of ischemic stroke. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of ischemic stroke or postprocedural hemorrhage with the use of abciximab compared with the use of eptifibatide in treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS Current protocols for treatment of intraprocedural thrombosis associated with placement of intra-arterial devices were effective in preventing ischemic stroke in ≈80% of cases. Current smoking was the only independent predictor of ischemic stroke.","Adeeb, Nimer; Griessenauer, Christoph J; Moore, Justin M; Foreman, Paul M; Shallwani, Hussain; Motiei-Langroudi, Rouzbeh; Gupta, Raghav; Baccin, Carlos E; Alturki, Abdulrahman; Harrigan, Mark R; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Thomas, Ajith J",Stroke,92,27

The alphavirus small membrane proteins 6K and TF have been reported to be palmitoylated and to positively regulate budding. 6K and TF are isoforms that are identical in their N termini but unique in their C termini due to a -1 ribosomal frameshift during translation. In this study, we used cysteine (Cys) mutants to test differential palmitoylation of the Sindbis virus 6K and TF proteins. We modularly mutated the five Cys residues in the identical N termini of 6K and TF, the four additional Cys residues in TF's unique C terminus, or all nine Cys residues in TF. Using these mutants, we determined that TF palmitoylation occurs primarily in the N terminus. In contrast, 6K is not palmitoylated, even on these shared residues. In the C-terminal Cys mutant, TF protein levels increase both in the cell and in the released virion compared to the wild type. In viruses with the N-terminal Cys residues mutated, TF is much less efficiently localized to the plasma membrane, and it is not incorporated into the virion. The three Cys mutants have minor defects in cell culture growth but a high incidence of abnormal particle morphologies compared to the wild-type virus as determined by transmission electron microscopy. We propose a model where the C terminus of TF modulates the palmitoylation of TF at the N terminus, and palmitoylated TF is preferentially trafficked to the plasma membrane for virus budding. IMPORTANCE Alphaviruses are a reemerging viral cause of arthritogenic disease. Recently, the small 6K and TF proteins of alphaviruses were shown to contribute to virulence in vivo Nevertheless, a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which either protein acts to promote virus infection is missing. The TF protein is a component of budded virions, and optimal levels of TF correlate positively with wild-type-like particle morphology. In this study, we show that the palmitoylation of TF regulates its localization to the plasma membrane, which is the site of alphavirus budding. Mutants in which TF is not palmitoylated display drastically reduced plasma membrane localization, which effectively prevents TF from participating in budding or being incorporated into virus particles. Investigation of the regulation of TF will aid current efforts in the alphavirus field searching for approaches to mitigate alphaviral disease in humans.","Ramsey, Jolene; Renzi, Emily C; Arnold, Randy J; Trinidad, Jonathan C; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana",Journal of virology,92,27

Using Inter-ViSTA with proteomics and molecular virology, we define virus-host interactions for the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) anti-apoptotic protein, pUL37x1. We find that spatiotemporal controlled interactions underlie pUL37x1 functions, facilitating the pro-viral remodeling of mitochondria and peroxisomes during infection. Reciprocal isolations, microscopy, and genetic manipulations further characterize these associations, revealing the interplay between pUL37x1 and the MIB complex, which is critical for mitochondrial integrity. At the peroxisome, we show that pUL37x1 activates PEX11β to regulate fission, a key aspect of virus assembly and spread.","Federspiel, Joel D; Cook, Katelyn C; Kennedy, Michelle A; Venkatesh, Samvida S; Otter, Clayton J; Hofstadter, William A; Jean Beltran, Pierre M; Cristea, Ileana M",Cell reports,92,19

Understanding how parents make this initial treatment decision is critical for developing interventions to improve counselling for these families. METHODS We conducted focus groups in four academic medical centres across the United States of America with a purposive sample of parents who chose termination, palliative care, or surgery for their foetus or neonate diagnosed with severe CHD. RESULTS Ten focus groups were conducted with 56 parents (Mage = 34 years; 80% female; 89% White). Results were constructed around three domains: decision-making approaches; values and beliefs; and decision-making challenges. Parents discussed varying approaches to making the decision, ranging from relying on their ""gut feeling"" to desiring statistics and probabilities. Religious and spiritual beliefs often guided the decision to not terminate the pregnancy. Quality of life was an important consideration, including how each option would impact the child (e.g., pain or discomfort, cognitive and physical abilities) and their family (e.g., care for other children, marriage, and career). Parents reported inconsistent communication of options by clinicians and challenges related to time constraints for making a decision and difficulty in processing information when distressed.

In awake morbidly obese volunteers, we hypothesized that the FRC would be higher after a five-minute period of positive pressure ventilation compared with spontaneous ventilation at zero inspiratory pressure. METHODS Using a prospective crossover randomized trial design, obese subjects underwent, in a randomized order, a combination of one of three positions, supine (S), beach chair (BC), and reverse Trendelenburg (RT), and one of two ventilation strategies, spontaneous ventilation at zero inspiratory pressure (ZEEP-SV) or with positive pressure (PP-SV) set to an inspiratory pressure of 8 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.21. RESULTS Seventeen obese volunteers with a mean (standard deviation; SD) body mass index of 50 (8) kg·m-2 were included. Mean (SD) FRC in the three positions (S, BC, RT) was significantly higher using PP-SV compared with ZEEP-SV [2571 (477) vs 2215 (481) mL, respectively; mean difference, 356; 95% confidence interval (CI), 209 to 502; P < 0.001].

Unfortunately, it remains technically challenging, requiring advanced laparoscopic skills which have limited its popularity among surgeons. The robotic platform has the potential to overcome these challenges. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term quality of life and outcomes following robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair, since these data have not been reported up to now. From October 2012 to October 2015, 159 inguinal hernias in 82 consecutive patients were repaired with 3D mesh (BARD) using da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The patients' demographics and intraoperative data were documented. Patients were seen 2 and 6 weeks after the surgery and the complications were recorded. Patients were assessed 6 weeks after the surgery by a survey using a universal pain assessment tool to document their post-operative pain, narcotic use and time of return to work and exercise. A modified short form 12 (SF 12) was also sent out to the patients 12-36 months after the surgery to measure their health-related quality of life prior to surgery and at the 12- to 36-month follow-up, and to document any evidence of recurrence. Postoperative health-related quality of life scores were compared to the pre-operative baseline quality of life scores using the unpaired t test. Over the course of 3 years, 159 robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair were performed in 82 patients, 73 men and 9 women by one surgeon as an outpatient basis. The mean age was 53 and mean body mass index was 26. There were no intraoperative complications or conversions. The average operative time was 99 min. Four patients developed urinary retention post-operatively and one patient developed postoperative bowel obstruction requiring laparoscopic lysis of adhesion with no long-term complications. All patients completed the pain assessment survey and the median pain score, 3 days after the surgery was 3. Narcotics were used for an average of 3.1 days. The modified SF 12 survey assessing for quality of life before and 12-36 months after surgery was completed and returned by 29 patients (response rate of 35.4% and median follow-up of 32 months). Only one recurrence was reported which was repaired with open technique. The analysis of the SF 12 survey that evaluated patient's quality of life, pain score and the ability to perform activities of daily living before and after surgery revealed a significant improvement in those measures 12-36 months after the surgery compare to their baseline. Hernia recurrence, chronic pain and physical impairment are the major long-term concerns after any type of inguinal hernia repair. Our results demonstrate that robotic assisted TAPP inguinal hernia repair appears to be a technically feasible, reproducible and safe minimally invasive alternative with low recurrence, low chronic pain and high health-related quality of life in the long term.","Iraniha, Andrew; Peloquin, Joshua",Journal of robotic surgery,92,16

This study aimed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of PTX-loaded polymeric nanoparticles based on α-TOS (PTX-NPs) administered by direct intratumoral injection into a Hypopharynx carcinoma squamous cells (FaDu) tumor xenograft mouse model. The nanocarrier system based on block copolymers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a methacrylic derivative of α-TOS was synthesized and PTX was loaded into the delivery system. Tumor volume was measured to evaluate the antitumor effect of the PTX-NPs. The relative mechanisms of apoptosis, cell proliferation, growth, angiogenesis, and oxidative and nitrosative stress were detected by Western blotting, fluorescent probes, and immunohistochemical analysis. The antitumor activity results showed that compared to free PTX, PTX-NPs exhibited much higher antitumor efficacy and apoptosis-inducing in a FaDu mouse xenograft model and demonstrated an improved safety profile. Ki-67, EGFR, and angiogenesis markers (Factor VIII, CD31, and CD34) expression were significantly lower in the PTX-NPs group compared with other groups (p < .05). Also, PTX-NPs induced oxidative and nitrosative stress in tumor tissue.

Current technology platforms delivering interventions are largely mobile apps and online websites, although efforts have been made to create more personalized and embodied technology experiences. To extend and improve on these platforms, the field of robotics has been increasingly included in conversations of how to deliver technology-assisted, interactive, and responsive mental health and psychological well-being interventions. Socially assistive robots (SARs) are robotic technology platforms with audio, visual, and movement capabilities that are being developed to interact with individuals socially while also assisting them with management of their physical and psychological well-being. However, little is known about the empirical evidence or utility of using SARs in mental health interventions. OBJECTIVE The review synthesizes and describes the nascent empirical literature of SARs in mental health research and identifies strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement in future research and practice. METHODS Searches in Medline, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore yielded 12 studies included in the final review after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstract and full-text reviews were conducted by two authors independently. RESULTS This systematic review of the literature found 5 distinct SARs used in research to investigate the potential for this technology to address mental health and psychological well-being outcomes. Research on mental health applications of SARs focuses largely on elderly dementia patients and relies on usability pilot data with methodological limitations.

Data from recycling facilities in Victoria, Australia, were collected and used as the basis for a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) study. Analyses were conducted by considering several replacement ratios of virgin material by its recycled counterpart in the so-called wet and dry method. A case study considering the production of recycled-plastic asphalt to be applied in the construction of a typical surface layer of a road in Victoria was evaluated. In general, the results show that recycling plastics as a polymer for bitumen modification and as a synthetic aggregate replacement in asphalt mixes has the potential to be environmentally advantageous compared to their virgin counterpart (i.e. virgin polymers and natural quarry aggregates).","Santos, J; Pham, A; Stasinopoulos, P; Giustozzi, F",The Science of the total environment,92,14

We propose a semiautomatic method to obtain breast vascular maps and to measure the number of blood vessels in the breast. METHODS From January 2011 to December 2013, 188 patients underwent breast contrast-enhanced MRI; patients with unilateral and histopathologically confirmed breast lesions were included in this study; 123 patients had malignant lesions and 65 patients had benign tissue diagnoses. Breast semiautomatic vascular map detection was performed using Hessian matrix-based method and morphologic operators. Blood vessels detection was compared with radiologic interpretation findings to evaluate algorithm goodness. Increase in vascularity associated with ipsilateral cancer was also assessed. Chi square test was used to observe statistically significant difference. RESULTS A total of 1315 blood vessels were identified using semiautomatic procedure; 1034 were correctly classified (78.7 %), 261 (19.8 %) were incorrectly classified, and 20 (1.5 %) were missing. A significant association was found between one-sided increased breast vascularity and ipsilateral malignancy (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, detection of vascularity increase as risk factor for developing breast cancer could be performed with semiautomatic vascular mapping of contrast-enhanced MR imaging.","Fusco, Roberta; Sansone, Mario; Filice, Salvatore; Petrillo, Antonella",Breast cancer,92,16

STUDY TYPE Cross-sectional multi-institutional survey. METHODS An online survey of 55 otolaryngology departments across North America. RESULTS As of March 25, 2020, almost all (n = 53 of 55, 96.3%) otolaryngology departments had canceled elective cases and were performing only urgent consults. Most residents continued to participate in operative cases (n = 45 of 49, 91.8%) and take call (n = 48 of 50, 96.0%). Of the respondents, 27 of 29 (93.1%) stated that they were deferring nonemergent tracheostomy procedures for the time being. The use of personal protective equipment followed a general trend of an increasing level of protection with an increased risk of the procedure; most (n = 49 of 54, 90.7%) incorporated N95 mask usage for bedside/clinic examinations with flexible laryngoscopy. Powered air-purifying respirators and N95 masks were used mainly for procedures involving the mucosal surfaces. DISCUSSION Due to the high viral density in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19, basic examinations and common otolaryngology procedures place practitioners at high risk of exposure. Although there is variability in practice among otolaryngologists across North America in managing the COVID-19 outbreak, most are primarily seeing urgent ambulatory and inpatient consultations. Most are also incorporating personal protective equipment appropriate to the level of transmission across mucous membranes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE In these rapidly evolving times, it is helpful to find solidarity and assurance among health care providers. Current data aimed to provide (1) perceived methods regarding the safe care of otolaryngology patients and (2) updated practice patterns at a national level.","Wickemeyer, Johanna L; Billings, Kathleen R; Valika, Taher S",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,92,20

We sought to determine the efficacy of flow diverting stents to treat small, unruptured aneurysms of the M1 segment. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated with flow diversion for an unruptured saccular aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) between February 2009 and February 2016. The relationship to early cortical branches, aneurysm fundus size, number and type of flow diverting stent (FDS), complications and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS In total 15 patients were identified that matched our inclusion criteria (11 female and 4 male). The average age of the patients was 58.3 years (range 14-76 years). All patients had a single aneurysm affecting the M1 segment of the MCA, 10 (66.6%) of which were related to early cortical branches and 10 aneurysms were located on the left (66.6%). The average aneurysm fundus size was 3 mm (range 2-9 mm) and 13 patients had follow-up angiographic studies. In total, 8 aneurysms were completely excluded, and 6 remained incompletely occluded (3 modified Raymond-Roy classification [mRRC] II and 3 mRRC IIIa). One patient suffered a stroke and another patient had an iatrogenic vessel dissection that was not flow limiting. CONCLUSION Flow diversion can be used to treat small, unruptured aneurysms of the M1 segment of the MCA and even though side vessel occlusion can occur clinically relevant infarction occurs infrequently.","Bhogal, Pervinder; Martinez, Rosa; Gansladt, Oliver; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans; Aguilar, Marta",Clinical neuroradiology,92,27

Hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment for post-menopausal OP, but estrogen has poor tissue selectivity and severe side effects. RESULTS In this study, we constructed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs)-based drug delivery system to co-load 17β estradiol (E2) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) together, modified with alendronate (AL) to achieve bone targeting and realize a magnetically remote-controllable drug release. The NPs were fabricated through the emulsion solvent diffusion method. The particle size was approximately 200 nm while the encapsulation efficiency of E2 was 58.34 ± 9.21%. The NPs were found to be spherical with a homogenous distribution of particle size. The NPs showed good stability, good biocompatibility, high encapsulation ability of E2 and excellent magnetic properties. The NPs could be effectively taken up by Raw 264.7 cells and were effective in enriching drugs in bone tissue. The co-loaded NPs exposed to an external magnetic field ameliorated OVX-induced bone loss through increased BV/TV, decreased Tb.N and Tb.Sp, improved bone strength, increased PINP and OC, and downregulated CTX and TRAP-5b. The haematological index and histopathological analyses displayed the NPs had less side effects on non-skeletal tissues. CONCLUSIONS This study presented a remote-controlled release system based on bone-targeted multifunctional NPs and a new potential approach to bone-targeted therapy of OP.","Guo, Yuanyuan; Liu, Yongwei; Shi, Chen; Wu, Tingting; Cui, Yongzhi; Wang, Siyuan; Liu, Ping; Feng, Xiaobo; He, Yu; Fu, Dehao",Journal of nanobiotechnology,92,1

Little is known about its clinicopathological features, prognosis and potential therapeutic strategies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the breast. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with PSCCB in our center. All pathological slides were reviewed by an experienced pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. Furthermore, we searched the public database for patients with SCC of the breast. Then, we analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment methods and patient outcomes. RESULTS We identified 14 patients with primary SCC of the breast in our center. Additionally, 739 patients with SCC of the breast from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database were diagnosed between 1975 and 2016. Only 453 patients who underwent surgery were included in this study. Patients from the SEER database had a more advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage than patients from our center. The median overall survival (OS) of all patients was 104 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.2-120.8 months), and the 5-year OS was 60.8% (95% CI, 56.1%-65.5%). Most of the patients (58%) tested negative for hormonal receptor expression. Multivariate analysis showed that PORT was an independent prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION The results of our study demonstrate that SCC of the breast presents aggressive behavior with unique clinical characteristics. PORT improved OS significantly in patients with SCC of the breast. Longer-term studies are needed to confirm our findings.","Wang, Xuanyi; Zhang, Li; Luo, Jurui; Jin, Kairui; Yang, Zhaozhi; Meng, Jin; Zhang, Xiaomeng; Zhang, Zhen; Shao, Zhimin; Guo, Xiaomao; Chen, Xingxing; Yu, Xiaoli",Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,92,1

Using the International Retrospective Study of Pipeline Embolization Device registry, we studied complication rates in groups of patients who underwent platelet testing and those who did not undergo platelet testing to determine if these test results were associated with improved outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients in the International Retrospective Study of Pipeline Embolization Device registry with an unruptured aneurysm were categorized as those who underwent platelet testing before Pipeline embolization device treatment or those who did not. Complication rates were compared by using the Fisher exact or Pearson χ(2) test. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine if platelet function testing was independently associated with poor outcomes after adjusting for age, number of devices and aneurysms, aneurysm location and size, and practitioner and center volume. RESULTS Compared with the patients who received a Pipeline embolization device without platelet testing, those who underwent platelet testing and Pipeline embolization device placement experienced higher rates of intracranial hemorrhage (0 of 187 [0.0%] vs 12 of 511 [2.3%], respectively; P = .04), neurologic morbidity (4 of 187 [2.1%] vs 42 of 511 [8.2%], respectively; P < .01), and combined neurologic morbidity and mortality (6 of 187 [3.2%] vs 45 of 511 [8.8%], respectively; P = .01). More patients in the platelet testing and Pipeline embolization device group were treated with multiple devices (227 [38.0%] vs 56 [27.8] patients, respectively; P = .01). On multivariate analysis, the group of patients who underwent platelet testing and Pipeline embolization device placement had higher odds of neurologic morbidity (OR, 3.25 [95% CI, 1.10-9.61]; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS Platelet testing in patients who undergo Pipeline embolization device placement is associated with higher rates of morbidity. Additional prospective studies are needed to determine if and when platelet testing in these patients is appropriate.","Brinjikji, W; Lanzino, G; Cloft, H J; Siddiqui, A H; Hanel, R A; Kallmes, D F",AJNR.

All large-scale studies of the CAVI have investigated patients <80 years old. Thus, the clinical characteristics of high CAVI in patients aged 80 or more remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated (1) the CAVI in very elderly patients and (2) the determinants of a high CAVI in high-risk patients, including very elderly patients. The Cardiovascular Prognostic Coupling Study in Japan (Coupling Registry) is a prospective observational study of Japanese outpatients with any cardiovascular risk factors. We enrolled 5109 patients from 30 institutions (average age 68.7 ± 11.4 years, 52.4% males). We investigated the determinants of the CAVI by separating the patients into three groups: 970 middle-aged (<60 years), 3252 elderly (60-79 years), and 887 very elderly (≥80 years) patients. The CAVI values of the males were significantly higher those of the females in all age groups (<60 years: 7.81 ± 1.11 vs. 7.38 ± 0.99, P < .001; 60-79 years: 9.20 ± 1.29 vs. 8.66 ± 1.07, P < .001; ≥80 years: 10.26 ± 1.39 vs. 9.51 ± 1.12, P < .001). In all age groups, the CAVI of the patients with diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder was higher than that of the patients without diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder (<60 years: 7.82 ± 1.22 vs 7.58 ± 1.03, P = .002; 60-79 years: 9.23 ± 1.20 vs 8.78 ± 1.19, P < .001; ≥80 years: 10.04 ± 1.24 vs 9.75 ± 1.32, P = .002). The determinants of the CAVI in these very elderly patients were age, male sex, low BMI, and mean blood pressure. Diabetes/glucose tolerance disorder and glucose were independently associated with the CAVI in the patients aged <60 years and 60-79 years, but not in those aged ≥80 years after adjusting for other covariates.","Kabutoya, Tomoyuki; Hoshide, Satoshi; Fujiwara, Takeshi; Negishi, Keita; Nishizawa, Masafumi; Yamamoto, Mitsuyoshi; Yamagiwa, Kayo; Kawashima, Akihiro; Yoshida, Tetsuro; Nakazato, Jun; Matsui, Yoshio; Sekizuka, Hiromitsu; Abe, Hideyasu; Abe, Yasuhisa; Fujita, Yumiko; Sato, Kei; Narita, Keisuke; Tsuchiya, Norihiro; Kubota, Yoshiaki; Hashizume, Toshikazu; Kario, Kazuomi",Journal of clinical hypertension,92,16

Although there are various ways to approach environmental education and raise public awareness, games are potentially an effective vehicle of knowledge and engagement because they vulgarize the scientific information in a universal 'language' and bring people together. Here, we designed a game, EcoDragons, that integrates principles of ecology, biological conservation, life history, and taxonomy. The protagonists of the game are dragonflies and damselflies. The aim of the game is to colonize habitats with different species and use ecological processes (e.g., predation, competition, and mutualism) and conservation measures (e.g., restoration and reintroduction) to face random environmental disturbances (e.g., climate warming, drought, pollution, and biological invasion). The version of the game presented in this paper was based on European species. The game includes 50 species (25 dragonflies and 25 damselflies). The winner of the game is the one who occupies more habitats, establishes and maintains the largest number of species, and solves more anthropogenic disturbances. EcoDragons has a global outreach potential to educate the public about ecology, conservation, and organismic life history, and will probably engage people in environmental advocacy.","Khelifa, Rassim; Mahdjoub, Hayat",Insects,92,1

The lack of consensus definition, and practical diagnostic tools for evaluating waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients are barriers to early detect and initiate therapeutic management for sarcopenic obesity. Although sarcopenia leads to poor clinical outcomes, posttransplant obesity yields conflicting results. Exercise and nutritional managements are common therapies for sarcopenic obese patients; however, surgery weight loss or bariatric surgery in both transplant candidates and potential living kidney donors shows promising benefits for kidney transplant access in waitlist obese candidates but may require to be selected for appropriate patients. RECENT FINDINGS Pathogenesis and management for sarcopenia and obesity are interconnected. The benefits of exercise to improve muscle mass and function is clear in waitlist kidney transplant candidates and transplant recipients. However, there are several barriers for those to increase exercise and improve physical activity including patient, provider, and healthcare or environmental factors. The advantages of fat mass reduction to lose weight can promote muscle mass and strength. However, epidemiological data regarding the obesity paradox in dialysis-dependent patients when overnutrition provides survival benefits for this population should be taken into account when performing weight loss especially bariatric surgery. SUMMARY Barriers in providing optimal care to kidney transplant waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients may partly result from underdiagnosis of sarcopenic obesity; notwithstanding that this entity has increasingly been more recognized. Mechanistic studies to better understand pathogenesis of sarcopenic obesity will help determine pathogenesis and clinical tools for diagnosis of this entity, which can facilitate further studies related to the outcomes and weight management to ultimately improve kidney transplant outcomes.","Tantisattamo, Ekamol; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Halleck, Fabian; Duettmann, Wiebke; Naik, Marcel; Budde, Klemens",Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension,92,16

Since oxalate-producing fungi can effect geochemical transformation of Mn oxides, an understanding of the fate of Co during such processes could provide new insights on the geochemical behaviour of Co. In this work, the transformation of Mn oxides by Aspergillus niger was investigated using a Co-bearing manganiferous laterite, and a synthetic Co-doped birnessite. A. niger could transform laterite in both fragmented and powder forms, resulting in formation of biomineral crusts that were composed of Mn oxalates hosting Co, Ni and, in transformed laterite fragments, Mg. Total transformation of Co-doped birnessite resulted in precipitation of Co-bearing Mn oxalate. Fungal transformation of the Mn oxide phases included Mn(III,IV) reduction by oxalate, and may also have involved reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). These findings demonstrate that oxalate-producing fungi can influence Co speciation in Mn oxides, with implications for other hosted metals including Al and Fe. This work also provides further understanding of the roles of fungi as geoactive agents which can inform potential applications in metal bioremediation, recycling and biorecovery.","Ferrier, John; Csetenyi, Laszlo; Gadd, Geoffrey Michael",Environmental microbiology,92,8

We determined the quantities of Ceacam1 transcripts encoding membrane-bound and secreted isoforms in mouse organs and a set of cell lines. In vivo, the lowest receptor mRNA levels were found in brain and muscle and these were similar to those in easily infectable cultured cells. While the quantities of the receptor transcripts varied between mouse organs, their abundance did not correlate with susceptibility to MHV infection. The proportion of transcripts encoding secreted isoforms also could not explain the selection of sites for virus replication, as it was constant in all organs.

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the need for more public health nurses in the workforce. The number of novice nurses entering into public health roles is declining, demonstrating a clear need to mentor pre-licensure nursing students into the public health nursing workforce. Scholarly concentration (SC) programs are a method to explore specialty roles through in-depth scholarly activities, outside of core curriculum. However, SC programs have not been described in the nursing literature. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development of a SC program to engage pre-licensure Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) students in scholarly activities related to public health nursing. PROGRAM OVERVIEW This Public Health Nurse Scholars program was developed in 2014 with the goal of developing a cadre of generalist CNL students with experiences in public health nursing scholarly activities. The program aimed to increase awareness of career and scholarship opportunities through mentorship with public health nursing faculty. Students were encouraged to attend and present at professional conferences, participate in active scholarly projects and conduct quality improvement projects from a public health nursing perspective. The program was designed to foster students' public health nursing leadership and presentation skills and enhance their self-directed learning. RESULTS To date, 46 pre-licensure nursing students were selected as Public Health Nurse Scholars. Sixty-seven percent (n = 31) have graduated as Public Health Nurse Scholars; 33% (n = 15) are current Public Health Nurse Scholars. Twelve public health nursing faculty have served as mentors. As a result of the program 15 scholars attended and 3 scholars presented respectively at community/public health nursing conferences, and several scholars had related professional development opportunities. A majority of Public Health Nurse Scholars have designed and implemented a capstone quality improvement project with a public health nursing perspective, 15 of which were completed at community-based sites. CONCLUSIONS In the face of our current global, public health crisis, there is a clear need to develop a cadre of novice nurses prepared to enter the public health nursing workforce. The Public Health Nurse Scholars program shows promise towards encouraging an interest in public health nursing scholarship. Schools of nursing may consider the implementation of similar SC programs as an approach to mentor pre-licensure nurses in other specialty areas such as gerontological and neonatal nursing.","Reed, Monique; Cygan, Heide; Bejster, Mallory",Journal of professional nursing : official journal of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing,92,30

AD, a degenerative brain disease, is the most common cause of dementia and is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles disposition. Some studies have recently demonstrated that Aβ and tau cannot fully explain the pathophysiological development of AD and that metabolic disease factors, such as insulin, adiponectin, and antioxidants, are important for the sporadic onset of nongenetic AD. Obesity prevention and treatment can be an efficacious and safe approach to AD prevention. Adiponectin is a benign adipokine that sensitizes the insulin receptor signaling pathway and suppresses inflammation. It has been shown to be inversely correlated with adipose tissue dysfunction and may enhance the risk of AD because a range of neuroprotection adiponectin mechanisms is related to AD pathology alleviation. In this study, we summarize the recent progress that addresses the beneficial effects and potential mechanisms of adiponectin in AD. Furthermore, we review recent studies on the diverse medications of adiponectin that could possibly be related to AD treatment, with a focus on their association with adiponectin. A better understanding of the neuroprotection roles of adiponectin will help clarify the precise underlying mechanism of AD development and progression.","Kim, Jong Youl; Barua, Sumit; Jeong, Ye Jun; Lee, Jong Eun",International journal of molecular sciences,92,11

To sum, mothers of ELBW infants' perceived stress is related to their children's severity of prematurity developmental outcomes, 4-16 years after birth. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","Zerach, Gadi; Elsayag, Adi; Shefer, Shahar; Gabis, Lidia",Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress,92,7

The supplementary motor area (SMA) is involved in movement preparation and bimanual coordination. How the SMA controls bimanual coordination remains unclear, although there is evidence suggesting that the SMA could modulate interhemispheric interactions. With a delayed-response task, we investigated interhemispheric interactions underlying normal movement preparation and the role of the SMA in these interactions during the delay period of unimanual or bimanual hand movements. We used functional MRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation in 22 healthy volunteers (HVs), and then in two models of SMA dysfunction: (a) in the same group of HVs after transient disruption of the right SMA proper by continuous transcranial magnetic theta-burst stimulation; (b) in a group of 22 patients with congenital mirror movements (CMM), whose inability to produce asymmetric hand movements is associated with SMA dysfunction. In HVs, interhemispheric connectivity during the delay period was modulated according to whether or not hand coordination was required for the forthcoming movement. In HVs following SMA disruption and in CMM patients, interhemispheric connectivity was modified during the delay period and the interhemispheric inhibition was decreased. Using two models of SMA dysfunction, we showed that the SMA modulates interhemispheric interactions during movement preparation. This unveils a new role for the SMA and highlights its importance in coordinated movement preparation.","Welniarz, Quentin; Gallea, Cécile; Lamy, Jean-Charles; Méneret, Aurélie; Popa, Traian; Valabregue, Romain; Béranger, Benoît; Brochard, Vanessa; Flamand-Roze, Constance; Trouillard, Oriane; Bonnet, Cécilia; Brüggemann, Norbert; Bitoun, Pierre; Degos, Bertrand; Hubsch, Cécile; Hainque, Elodie; Golmard, Jean-Louis; Vidailhet, Marie; Lehéricy, Stéphane; Dusart, Isabelle; Meunier, Sabine; Roze, Emmanuel",Human brain mapping,92,26

This study was carried out to measure and characterise the ""care dependency"" phenomenon in this phase and to obtain deeper knowledge about this phenomenon. BACKGROUND The end of a human life is often characterised by a physical decline, often implying that a high amount of care is needed. Non-malignant diseases can develop unpredictably; therefore, it is difficult to detect the onset of the EoL phase. DESIGN Data were collected in a cross-sectional multicentre study, using the Austrian Nursing Quality Measurement 2.0. METHODS Descriptive and multivariate statistical methods were used. Care dependency was measured with the Care Dependency Scale (CDS). The study follows the STROBE guideline. RESULTS Ten per cent (n = 389) of the sample (N = 3589) were allocated to ""a pathway for management of patients at the end of life."" The patients and residents in the EoL phase are significantly older and more often diagnosed with dementia, and circulatory system and musculoskeletal system diseases. Of these patients, 60% were care dependent completely or to a great extent. Dementia and age represent main influencing factors that affect the degree of care dependency at the end of life. CONCLUSION Our results show that the ""typical"" EoL patient or resident is female, old and affected by dementia and/or circulatory system diseases. Dementia and age were identified as main factors that contribute to very high care dependency. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE The measurement of care dependency may support the identification of special care needs in the EoL phase. Gaining deeper knowledge about the care dependency phenomenon can also help healthcare staff better understand the needs of patients with non-malignant conditions in their last phase of life.","Schüttengruber, Gerhilde; Halfens, Ruud J G; Lohrmann, Christa",Journal of clinical nursing,92,29

DATA AND METHODS This study used the 2001 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort, a longitudinal cohort of 3.5 million individuals, of which 764,000 were classified as immigrants (foreign-born). Postal codes from annual income tax files were used to account for mobility among respondents and to assign annual PM2.5 concentrations from 1998 to 2016. Exposures were estimated as a three-year moving average prior to the follow-up year. Cox survival models were used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for cause-specific mortality, comparing the Canadian and foreign-born populations, with further stratification by year of immigration grouped into 10-year cohorts. RESULTS Differences in urban-rural settlement patterns resulted in greater exposure to PM2.5 for immigrants compared with non-immigrants (mean = 9.3 vs. 7.5 μg/m3), with higher exposures among more recent immigrants. In fully adjusted models, immigrants had higher HRs per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration compared with Canadian-born individuals for cardiovascular mortality (HR [95% confidence interval] = 1.22 [1.12 to 1.34] vs. 1.12 [1.07 to 1.18]) and cerebrovascular mortality (HR = 1.25 [1.03 to 1.52] vs. 1.03 [0.93 to 1.15]), respectively. However, tests for differences between the two groups were not significant when Cochran's Q test was used. No significant associations were found for respiratory outcomes, except for lung cancer in non-immigrants (HR = 1.10 [1.02 to 1.18]). When stratified by year of immigration, differences in HRs across varied by cause of death. DISCUSSION In Canada, PM2.5 is an equal-opportunity risk factor, with immigrants experiencing similar if not higher mortality risks compared with non-immigrants for cardiovascular-related causes of death. Some notable differences also existed with cerebrovascular and lung cancer deaths. Continued reductions in air pollution, particularly in urban areas, will improve the health of the Canadian population as a whole.","Erickson, Anders C; Christidis, Tanya; Pappin, Amanda; Brook, Jeffrey R; Crouse, Daniel L; Hystad, Perry; Li, Chi; Martin, Randall V; Meng, Jun; Pinault, Lauren; von Donkelaar, Aaron; Weichenthal, Scott; Tjepkema, Michael; Burnett, Richard T; Brauer, Michael",Health reports,92,30

However, the instruments to assess PCEs are scarce. Objective In this study, we assessed the validity and reliability of the Benevolent Childhood Experiences (BCEs) scale, a new instrument of PCEs, in a large sample of Chinese adults. Furthermore, we examined associations of PCEs with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, as well as, prosocial behaviours across different levels of trauma. Method Participants were 6929 adults (33% male; mean age 38.04 years, SD = 7.81, ranging from 18 to 81.) recruited from Jiangxi and Hunan provinces in China. Self-administrated questionnaires were used to measure PCEs, childhood trauma, lifetime trauma, PTSD, depression, and prosocial behaviours. Multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine the interdependent and interactive effects of PCEs, lifetime trauma, childhood trauma on symptoms of PTSD and depression and prosocial behaviours. Results In the current sample, the Cronbach's α of the BCEs scale was 0.70. PCEs were not related to lifetime trauma, while modestly associated with childhood trauma, demonstrating excellent discriminant validity. PCEs were negatively correlated with severity of PTSD and depression, while positively correlated with prosocial behaviours, indicating good predictive validity. PCEs, lifetime trauma and childhood trauma were independently associated with severity of PTSD and depression and prosocial behaviours. Moreover, the interaction of PCEs and lifetime trauma negatively predicted severity of PTSD and depression, while the interaction of PCEs and childhood trauma negatively predicted prosocial behaviours. PCEs had a protective effect on PTSD and depression in high level of lifetime trauma, and showed a reduced positive effect on prosocial behaviours in high level of childhood trauma. Conclusions The Chinese BCEs scale is a reliable and valid instrument. PCEs can buffer adversity and foster positive outcomes in adulthood.","Zhan, Nalan; Xie, Dongjie; Zou, Jiaqi; Wang, Jian; Geng, Fulei",European journal of psychotraumatology,92,1

This review synthesizes recent research evaluating APRV mode and provides perspectives on the utility of this mode in children with ARDS. RECENT FINDINGS Two single-center clinical trials on APRV, one adult and one pediatric, have been published this year. These two trials have not only elicited editorials and letters that highlight some of their strengths and weaknesses but also rekindled debate on several aspects of APRV. Despite their contradicting results, both trials provide significant insights into APRV strategies that work and those that may not. This review places the newer evidence in the context of existing literature and provides a comprehensive analysis of APRV use in children. SUMMARY There have been significant recent advancements in our understanding of the clinical utility of APRV in children with ARDS. The recent trial highlights the urgent need to evolve a consensus on definition of APRV and identify strategies that work. Pending further research, clinicians should avoid the use of a zero-PLOW Personalized-APRV strategy as a primary ventilation modality in children with moderate-severe ARDS.","Lalgudi Ganesan, Saptharishi",Current opinion in critical care,92,1

Both longer closure times and wound infections contribute to higher medical costs and patient morbidity. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore determined whether (1) biologic and treatment factors greater influenced wound healing than the choice of sutures or staples; and (2) different times to closure affected cost when sutures or staples are used in patients with musculoskeletal tumors. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 511 patients who had sarcoma resections of the buttock, thigh, and femur from 2003 to 2010; 376 had closure with sutures and 135 with staples. Data were abstracted on patient demographics, comorbidities, select procedural data, and wound complications. Wound complications were defined by hospitalization within 6 months postoperatively for a wound problem, irrigation and débridement, or infection treated with antibiotics. We determined the association between staples versus sutures and wound complications after controlling for confounding factors. The minimum followup was 2 weeks. A prospective, timed analysis of wounds closed with either sutures or staples was also performed. RESULTS We found an association between obesity and radiation and wound complications. Wounds were closed an average of 5.3 minutes faster with staples than with suture (0.29 minutes versus 5.6 minutes, respectively), saving a mean 2.1% of the total operating time although the total operating time was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS We found no difference in wound complications after closure with sutures or staples, although obesity and radiation treatment appear to affect wound outcomes. Data suggest that time saved in the operating room by closing with staples compensates for added material costs and does not compromise wound care in patients with lower extremity sarcomas.

Outcomes of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients remain understudied. METHODS We used a multicenter federated research network to compare clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with SOT to a propensity matched cohort of patients without SOT. RESULTS We identified 2,307 SOT recipients and 231,047 non-transplant patients with COVID-19. Transplant patients were more likely to be male, older, have a BMI >30kg/m2, and have comorbid hypertension, diabetes, nicotine dependence, heart failure and ischemic heart disease compared to non-transplant group (p-value <0.05). 1:1 matching was performed for diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, race, nicotine dependence, heart failure, ischemic heart disease and gender. There was no difference in the composite outcome of intubation or mechanical ventilation at 30 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI: 0.86-1.26) or 60 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.86-1.24) between the two groups. Hospitalization rate was higher in the transplant cohort (30.97% vs 25.47%, RR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.11-1.34). There was no difference in mortality at 30 days (6.45% vs 5.29%, RR 1.22, 95% CI: 0.88-1.68) or 60 days post diagnosis (RR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.83-1.32). More patients in the SOT group developed acute renal injury compared to non-SOT cohort (24.73% vs 14.29%; RR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.53-1.96). CONCLUSION Patients with SOT have high COVID-19 related mortality, however propensity matched analyses reveal that this increased risk is secondary to higher burden of comorbidities. SOT status independently increases risk of hospital admission and acute kidney injury.","Hadi, Yousaf B; Naqvi, Syeda Fz; Kupec, Justin T; Sofka, Sarah; Sarwari, Arif",Transplantation,92,19

Are spinal and/or supraspinal perturbations implicated in central fatigue induced in the plantar flexor muscles following prolonged trail running races? What is the main finding and its importance? The present study confirmed the presence of central fatigue following various trail running distances from 40- to 170-km. The reduction in V-wave in conjunction with the lack of change in H-reflex suggests that a major component of this central fatigue may arise from supraspinal mechanisms in the plantar flexor muscles. ABSTRACT Trail running races are known to induce considerable impairments in neuromuscular function of which central mechanisms are a substantial component. However, the loci of this central fatigue (i.e. supraspinal and/or spinal) is not well identified. The aim of this study was to better understand central fatigue aetiology induced in the plantar flexor muscles by various trail running distances from 40- to 170-km. Eighteen runners participated in the study and neuromuscular function of their plantar flexors was tested before (PRE) and after (POST) various races during the Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc. Neuromuscular function was evaluated with voluntary and evoked contractions using electrical tibial nerve stimulation. H-reflex and V-wave responses were also measured during submaximal and maximal voluntary contraction, respectively. Reductions in maximal voluntary contraction torque (-29%; p<0.001) and voluntary activation level (-12%; p<0.001) were observed after trail running races. V-wave was reduced in soleus (-35%; p = 0.003) and gastrocnemius medialis (-28%; p = 0.031), with no changes for H-reflex in soleus (p = 0.577). The present study confirmed the presence of central fatigue following trail running exercise. The reduction in V-wave in conjunction with the lack of change in H-reflex suggests that a major component of this central fatigue may arise from supraspinal mechanisms.

This study was designed to determine the prevalence of multiple renal arteries in patients referred for RDN, to propose a classification for anatomical eligibility and to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple arteries and blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients referred for RDN who underwent noninvasive imaging of the renal arteries before treatment were included in present analysis. Eligible patients were treated. Renal function and BP were evaluated 6 months after treatment. RESULTS Hundred and twenty-six patients referred for RDN were included in present analysis. Thirty-four per cent had multiple arteries. Sixty-nine patients underwent RDN. Office BP significantly reduced from 195 (± 26)/106 (± 14) mmHg to 165 (± 24)/95 (± 14) mmHg (P < 0·001). BP reduction in patients with multiple arteries which were all treated was comparable to patients with solitary arteries. However, patients with multiple which were not all treated showed a trend towards a less pronounced effect of RDN (β: 11·6, P = 0·11). The proposed classification appeared useful by identifying eligible anatomy. Renal function at 6 months did not differ from baseline in all subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Based on our results and the high prevalence of multiple arteries, it seems reasonable not to exclude patients with multiple renal arteries from RDN. Current analysis suggests that BP reduction may be less pronounced in patients with multiple renal arteries of whom not all arteries were treated.","Verloop, Willemien L; Vink, Eva E; Spiering, Wilko; Blankestijn, Peter J; Doevendans, Pieter A; Bots, Michiel L; Vonken, Evert-Jan; Voskuil, Michiel",European journal of clinical investigation,92,11

However, serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systemic adverse events (AEs) are associated with oral NSAIDs and can be treatment limiting. The efficacy of diclofenac sodium topical solution 1.5% w/w with dimethyl sulfoxide (TDiclo) has been established as superior to placebo and comparable with oral NSAIDs in the management of OA. This study characterizes the safety and tolerability profile of TDiclo compared with placebo through a pooled analysis of data from 1252 patients in 7 randomized controlled trials across 61 centers in the United States and 97 centers in Canada. Patients received TDiclo (n = 911) or placebo (n = 341) for 4 to 12 weeks for management of OA of the hand or knee. The most frequently reported AE was dry skin, occurring in 33.0% of patients receiving TDiclo and 5.0% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.001). Dyspepsia was the most common gastrointestinal reaction, reported by 7.7% of patients receiving TDiclo and 2.9% of patients receiving placebo (P = 0.002). Changes in vital signs and laboratory assessments of hepatic and renal function were similar between the 2 groups; TDiclo did not increase mean blood pressure, nor was it associated with hypertension. The rate of serious AEs favored placebo in both groups (0.9% for TDiclo vs 1.5% for placebo; P = 0.358), as did the rate of severe AEs (4.4% vs 7.6%; P = 0.023). The most common reason for study discontinuation was dry skin (2.5% vs 0.3%). Results from this analysis suggest that TDiclo is well tolerated in a large population and may offer an alternative to oral NSAID therapy for OA of the knee or hand, particularly for patients at increased risk for serious systemic AEs. Larger head-to-head, long-term, multicenter trials would be beneficial to further evaluate safety data comparing both topical and oral NSAIDs.","Roth, Sanford H; Fuller, Philip",Postgraduate medicine,92,1

A total of 1472 (Study 1, S1) and 944 (Study 2, S2) men aged 40-69 years old were recruited as subjects. Subjects were evaluated through combining serum reproductive hormone levels with the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (ADAM) questionnaire and the Aging Males' Symptoms (AMS) scale. A significant difference was found in mean testosterone deficiency (TD) prevalence between S1 and S2, using either serum total testosterone (TT; 14.02% vs. 6.36%) or serum calculated free testosterone (cFT; 43.69% vs. 16.53%) cutoff values. According to the S1 or S2 data, the mean prevalence of LOH was 37.85%/15.47% in the positive ADAM test and 15.42%/9.43% in the positive AMS test (p < .01). According to classifications of TD based on gonadal status, the prevalence of secondary TD (27.34%) was higher than the primary (16.36%) and compensated (15.42%) TD in S1 (p < .01). However, there were significant differences among the prevalence of primary (6.89%), secondary (9.64%), and compensated (27.65%) TD in S2 (p < .05). Different types of testosterone levels, TD cutoff values, and questionnaires influenced the prevalence of TD and LOH. The serum FT cutoff value was an optimal threshold for evaluating and diagnosing TD and LOH, whose prevalence increased gradually with male aging.","Zhou, Shan-Jie; Zhao, Ming-Jia; Yang, Yi-Hong; Guan, Di; Li, Zhi-Guang; Ji, Yu-Dang; Zhang, Bao-Long; Shang, Xue-Jun; Xiong, Cheng-Liang; Gu, Yi-Qun",American journal of men's health,92,17

DESIGN Meta-analysis. SETTING Adult patients undergoing elective surgery. INTERVENTION Intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during pre- and perioperative period. MEASUREMENTS The primary outcome was quality of recovery after surgery. The secondary outcome was the incidence of dexmedetomidine-related adverse events. MAIN RESULTS Moderate to low quality evidence suggested that dexmedetomidine (DEX) increased the quality of recovery after surgery (WMD, weighted mean difference 15.71, 95% CI, confidence interval 0.43 to 31.00; 428 participants; 5 RCTs; low quality evidence), decreased the incidence of postoperative nauseas or vomiting (RR, risk ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.83; 404 participants; 6 RCTs; moderate quality evidence; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.55; 356 participants; 5 RCTs; moderate quality evidence) without increased risk of bradycardia (RR: 1.78, 95% CI 0.78 to 4.02; 275 participants; 4 RCTs; moderate quality evidence), dizziness (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.00; 183 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality evidence), pruritus (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.39 to 4.44; 186 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality evidence), hypotension requiring an intervention (RR: 1.48, 95% CI, 0.68 to 3.23; 254 participants; 3 RCTs; moderate quality evidence) and longer length of hospital stay (WMD: -0.75 days, 95% CI -1.95 to 0.44; 246 participants; 3 RCTs; low quality evidence) in early postoperative period. CONCLUSIONS Dexmedetomidine as an anesthetic adjuvant to general anesthesia was associated with an enhanced quality of recovery (15.71; far more than a clinically significant improvement of 6.3) without increased risk of adverse events in the early postoperative period (moderate to low quality evidence). Further large sample and high quality RCTs are needed to confirm the current findings.","Miao, Mengrong; Xu, Yuehua; Li, Bing; Chang, Enqiang; Zhang, Liyuan; Zhang, Jiaqiang",Journal of clinical anesthesia,92,17

We aimed to test the performance of GRS in the prediction of risk for systemic sclerosis (SSc) for the first time. METHODS Allelic effects were obtained from the largest SSc Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) to date (9 095 SSc and 17 584 healthy controls with European ancestry). The best-fitting GRS was identified under the additive model in an independent cohort that comprised 400 patients with SSc and 571 controls. Additionally, GRS for clinical subtypes (limited cutaneous SSc and diffuse cutaneous SSc) and serological subtypes (anti-topoisomerase positive (ATA+) and anti-centromere positive (ACA+)) were generated. We combined the estimated GRS with demographic and immunological parameters in a multivariate generalised linear model. RESULTS The best-fitting SSc GRS included 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and discriminated between patients with SSc and controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.673). Moreover, the GRS differentiated between SSc and other IMIDs, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome. Finally, the combination of GRS with age and immune cell counts significantly increased the performance of the model (AUC=0.787). While the SSc GRS was not able to discriminate between ATA+ and ACA+ patients (AUC<0.5), the serological subtype GRS, which was based on the allelic effects observed for the comparison between ACA+ and ATA+ patients, reached an AUC=0.693. CONCLUSIONS GRS was successfully implemented in SSc. The model discriminated between patients with SSc and controls or other IMIDs, confirming the potential of GRS to support early and differential diagnosis for SSc.","Bossini-Castillo, Lara; Villanueva-Martin, Gonzalo; Kerick, Martin; Acosta-Herrera, Marialbert; López-Isac, Elena; Simeón, Carmen P; Ortego-Centeno, Norberto; Assassi, Shervin; Hunzelmann, Nicolas; Gabrielli, Armando; de Vries-Bouwstra, J K; Allanore, Yannick; Fonseca, Carmen; Denton, Christopher P; Radstake, Timothy Rdj; Alarcón-Riquelme, Marta Eugenia; Beretta, Lorenzo; Mayes, Maureen D; Martin, Javier",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,92,1

The impact of plastic or self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs) on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided tissue sampling is unclear. This study aimed to assess, using strict pathological criteria, whether stents impair fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or fine-needle biopsy (FNB). METHODS All patients with a solid mass in the head of the pancreas who underwent EUS-guided tissue sampling between 2010 and 2016 at our unit were included. Factors with possible impact on diagnostic performance were analyzed using logistic regression. Analysis was performed using both strict (malignant only) and less strict (suspicious for malignancy) cutoffs. RESULTS Of 631 individuals undergoing 698 procedures, 535 (84.8 %) had a final diagnosis of malignancy, 141 had SEMS, 149 had plastic stents, and 341 had no stent. Using strict criteria, SEMS were associated with an increased occurrence of incorrect diagnosis of EUS tissue sampling, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.96 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.24 - 3.10). Increasing tumor size (OR 0.72, 95 %CI 0.59 - 0.87), increasing number of passes (OR 0.84, 95 %CI 0.72 - 0.99), and fork-tip biopsy needle (OR 0.52, 95 %CI 0.31 - 0.86) were independently associated with a decrease in incorrect diagnosis. Repeat tissue sampling was more common with SEMSs (10.2 %) than with plastic stents (2.9 %) or no stents (4.5 %) (P < 0.02). CONCLUSION SEMS use had a negative impact on tissue diagnosis in pancreatic head masses, whereas use of a fork-tip biopsy needle and increasing number of passes were independently associated with improved accuracy.","Bekkali, Noor L H; Nayar, Manu K; Leeds, John S; Thornton, Lucy; Johnson, Sarah J; Haugk, Beate; Darné, Antony; Howard-Tripp, Nadia; Charnley, Richard M; Bassett, Paul; Oppong, Kofi W",Endoscopy,92,30

Three distinct Nos genes have been so far identified in vertebrates exhibiting a complex expression pattern and transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless, although independent events of Nos duplication have been observed in several taxa, only few studies described the regulatory mechanisms responsible for their activation in non-vertebrate animals. To shed light on the mechanisms underlying neuronal-type Nos expression, we focused on two non-vertebrate chordates: the cephalochordate Branchiostoma lanceolatum and the tunicate Ciona robusta. Here, throughout transphyletic and transgenic approaches, we identified genomic regions in both species acting as Nos functional enhancers during development. In vivo analyses of Nos genomic fragments revealed their ability to recapitulate the endogenous expression territories. Therefore, our results suggest the existence of evolutionary conserved mechanisms responsible for neuronal-type Nos regulation in non-vertebrate chordates. In conclusion, this study paves the way for future characterization of conserved transcriptional logic underlying the expression of neuronal-type Nos genes in chordates.","Caccavale, Filomena; Coppola, Ugo; Vassalli, Quirino A; La Vecchia, Claudia; Palumbo, Anna; D'Aniello, Enrico; Locascio, Annamaria; Ristoratore, Filomena; D'Aniello, Salvatore",Development genes and evolution,92,1

The goal of this study was to indicate transition boundaries from healthy tissue to tumors, namely, hepatic carcinoma, based on the real-time feedback derived from the optical measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five woodchucks with hepatic carcinoma were used for this study. The woodchucks were imaged with contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography with a flat panel detector C-arm system to visualize the carcinoma in the liver. In each animal, 3 insertions were performed, starting from the skin surface toward the hepatic carcinoma under image guidance. In 2 woodchucks, each end point of the insertion was confirmed with pathologic examination of a biopsy sample. While advancing the needle in the animals under image guidance such as fluoroscopy overlaid with cone beam computed tomography slice and ultrasound, optical spectra were acquired at the distal end of the needles. Optical tissue characterization was determined by translating the acquired optical spectra into clinical parameters such as blood, water, lipid, and bile fractions; tissue oxygenation levels; and scattering amplitude related to tissue density. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to study the difference in the derived clinical parameters from the measurements performed within the healthy tissue and the hepatic carcinoma. Kurtoses were calculated to assess the dispersion of these parameters within the healthy and carcinoma tissues. RESULTS Blood and lipid volume fractions as well as tissue oxygenation and reduced scattering amplitude showed to be significantly different between the healthy part of the liver and the hepatic carcinoma (P < 0.05) being higher in normal liver tissue. A decrease in blood and lipid volume fractions and tissue oxygenation as well as an increase in scattering amplitude were observed when the tip of the needle crossed the margin from the healthy liver tissue to the carcinoma. The kurtosis for each derived clinical parameter was high in the hepatic tumor as compared with that in the healthy liver indicating intracarcinoma variability. CONCLUSIONS Tissue blood content, oxygenation level, lipid content, and tissue density all showed significant differences when the needle tip was guided from the healthy tissue to the carcinoma and can therefore be used to identify tissue boundaries during percutaneous image-guided interventions.","Nachabé, Rami; Hendriks, Benno H W; Schierling, Ross; Hales, Jasmine; Racadio, Judy M; Rottenberg, Sven; Ruers, Theo J M; Babic, Drazenko; Racadio, John M",Investigative radiology,92,1

Existing research has examined the role of racism, discrimination, and violence in one's interaction with the health care system and their association with poorer mental and physical health. Systemic racism that underlies the fabric of society often manifests itself in prominent institutions, such as law enforcement agencies, regardless of individual intent. Overt and covert racist laws and policies, personal implicit biases, and other factors result in Black individuals and other people of color being the subject of law enforcement violence and criminal justice system interactions at disproportionately high rates. The demonstrated association between discriminatory law enforcement practices and violence and personal and community health necessitates treating these issues as public health issues worthy of a public policy intervention. Addressing some of the sources of institutional racism and harm through transparency and accountability measures is the first of many steps required to begin correcting historical racial injustices.","Serchen, Josh; Doherty, Robert; Atiq, Omar; Hilden, David",Annals of internal medicine,92,16

Although studies have evaluated large populations, little work has been done on procedure-specific populations. Our objective is to determine if any factors are predictive of 30-day readmission in patients undergoing ventral hernia repair. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients who underwent laparoscopic or open ventral hernia repair over a 4-year period. We evaluated patients based on demographic, preoperative, and operative variables. The primary outcome measure was all-cause 30-day readmission. RESULTS There were 420 patients identified for evaluation. Fifty-one (12%) patients required readmission to the hospital within 30 days. The most common indications for readmission were wound infection (57%; n=29) and gastrointestinal (GI) complication (19%; n=10). On analysis, demographic variables were similar between the two groups. However, patients who were readmitted were more likely to have had more prior abdominal surgeries (4 vs. 2; p<0.0001), more previous hernia repairs (2 vs. 1; p=0.006), open repair (76% vs. 46%; p<0.0001), and active abdominal infection (37% vs. 12%; p<0.0001). In addition, patients also had longer procedures (235 vs. 150 min; p<0.0001) and larger defects (350 vs. 96 cm2; p<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of readmission included presence of fistula [odds ratio (OR)=8.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.21-22.72], defect size>300 cm2 (OR=5.35; 95% CI 2.59-11.05), active abdominal infection (OR=4.37; 95% CI 2.28-8.37), and open repair (OR=4.27; 95% CI 2.17-8.42). CONCLUSIONS Patients undergoing ventral hernia repair can represent a complex group. In our practice, enterocutaneous fistula, defect size>300 cm2, active abdominal infection, and open repair were all independent risk factors (OR>4) for 30-day readmission after ventral hernia repair. Recognition of these high-risk patients can help focus resources to increase surveillance and possible early intervention to reduce readmissions.","Blatnik, Jeffrey A; Harth, Karem C; Aeder, Mark I; Rosen, Michael J",Surgical endoscopy,92,17

A systematic narrative review.,15.678082,8.073928,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND Systematic reviews of research evidence have become an expected basis for decisions about practice guidelines and policy decisions in the health and welfare sectors. Review authors define inclusion criteria to help them determine which studies to search for and include in their reviews. However, these studies may still vary in the extent to which they reflect the context of interest in the review question. While most review authors would agree that systematic reviews should be relevant and useful for decision makers, there appears to be few well known, if any, established methods for supporting review authors to assess the transferability of review findings to the context of interest in the review. With this systematic mapping and content analysis, we aim to identify whether there exists checklists to support review authors in considering transferability early in the systematic review process. The secondary aim was to develop a comprehensive list of factors that influence transferability as discussed in existing checklists. METHODS We conducted a systematic mapping of checklists and performed a content analysis of the checklist criteria included in the identified checklists. In June 2016, we conducted a systematic search of eight databases to identify checklists to assess transferability of findings from primary or secondary research, without limitations related to publication type, status, language, or date. We also conducted a gray literature search and searched the EQUATOR repository of checklists for any relevant document. We used search terms such as modified versions of the terms ""transferability,"" ""applicability,"" ""generalizability,"" etc. and ""checklist,"" ""guideline,"" ""tool,"" ""criteria,"" etc. We did not include papers that discussed transferability at a theoretical level or checklists to assess the transferability of guidelines to local contexts. RESULTS Our search resulted in 11,752 titles which were screened independently by two review authors. The 101 articles which were considered potentially relevant were subsequently read by two authors, independently in full text and assessed for inclusion. We identified 31 relevant checklists. Six of these examined transferability of economic evaluations, and 25 examined transferability of primary or secondary research findings in health (n = 23) or social welfare (n = 2). The content analysis is based on the 25 health and social welfare checklists. We identified seven themes under which we grouped categories of checklist criteria: population, intervention, implementation context (immediate), comparison intervention, outcomes, environmental context, and researcher conduct. CONCLUSIONS We identified a variety of checklists intended to support end users (researchers, review authors, practitioners, etc.) to assess transferability or related concepts. While four of these checklists are intended for use in systematic reviews of effectiveness, we found no checklists for qualitative evidence syntheses or for the field of social welfare practice or policy. Furthermore, none of the identified checklists for review authors included guidance to on how to assess transferability, or present assessments in a systematic review. The results of the content analysis can serve as the basis for developing a comprehensive list of factors to be used in an approach to support review authors in systematically and transparently considering transferability from the beginning of the review process.","Munthe-Kaas, Heather; Nøkleby, Heid; Nguyen, Lien",Systematic reviews,92,16

OBJECTIVE We explored how people with limited health literacy understand asthma and undertake self-management practices. DESIGN We adapted the arts-based qualitative methodology Photovoice. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS We sampled ethnically diverse adults with asthma and limited health literacy from four primary healthcare clinics in Malaysia. After a semistructured in-depth interview, a subset of participants took part in the Photovoice component in which participants undertook a 2-week photo-taking activity and subsequent photo-interview. Interviews, conducted in participants' preferred language, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, translated and analysed thematically. We used the Sorensen's framework (Domains: access, understand, appraise, apply) to describe participants' experience of living with asthma, what they understood about asthma and how they decided on self-management practices. RESULTS Twenty-six participants provided interviews; eight completed the Photovoice activities. Participants with limited health literacy used various sources to access information about asthma and self-management. Doctor-patient communication had a pivotal role in helping patients understand asthma. The lack of appraisal skills was significant and experiential knowledge influenced how they applied information. Self-management decisions were influenced by sociocultural norms/practices, stigmatizing experiences, and available social support. CONCLUSION Locally tailored multilevel interventions (interpersonal, health system, community and policy) will be needed to support people with limited health literacy to live optimally with their asthma in an ethnically diverse population.

We performed gasless laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (GLESS) with abdominal wall lift (AWL) for cholecystectomy and fenestration of liver cyst. This study aims to assess the safety and feasibility of the techniques. METHODS From June to December 2009, 18 cases of gasless laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy (GLESC) and 4 cases of fenestration of liver cyst (GLESF) were performed in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Shandong, China. Subcutaneous abdominal wall lifting system, LAP protector, flexible laparoscopes, and bent and articulating instruments were used during the procedures. Clinical data regarding patient demographics, operating time, blood loss, complications, and postoperative hospital stay were collected and analyzed retrospectively in the study. RESULTS 17 cases of GLESC and 4 cases of GLESF were performed successfully, and 1 case of GLESC was converted to laparoendoscopic single-site cholecystectomy using AWL combined with low-pressure pneumoperitoneum. Mean body mass index was 23.7 ± 3.1 kg/m(2) for GLESC and 22.9 ± 1.5 kg/m(2) for GLESF. Mean operating time was 64 ± 17 min for GLESC and 101 ± 10 min for GLESF. Mean blood loss was 8 ± 3 ml for GLESC and 24 ± 11 ml for GLESF. Despite minor wound complication, no postoperative complications were observed during mean follow-up of 118 and 95 days for GLESC and GLESF, respectively. CONCLUSION GLESS with AWL is safe and feasible for cholecystectomy and fenestration of liver cyst. The techniques provide satisfactory operative field exposure and an easier access method for LESS. Instrument collisions are greatly ameliorated both extra- and intracorporeally through use of flexible laparoscopes and bent and articulating instruments. This may prove to be a better approach for LESS techniques.","Zhang, Guangyong; Liu, Shaozhuang; Yu, Wenbin; Wang, Lei; Liu, Nan; Li, Feng; Hu, Sanyuan",Surgical endoscopy,92,7

Motor vehicle incidents are the leading cause of work-related fatalities in the US, killing more than 1200 workers each year, which make up about a quarter of all work-related deaths. Not only are motor vehicle crashes the top killer at work, but economic expansions can further increase occupational and traffic deaths as they both tend to be procyclical. In this paper, we examine the effects of business cycles on traffic fatalities in the US with a special focus on work-related deaths. Specifically, we implement a longitudinal design across all 50 states by compiling quarterly data for 2004-2012 and consider macroeconomic fluctuations around the Great Recession. Our findings show that traffic deaths during prosperous times are not solely due to an increase in risky behaviors such as drunk driving, but directly related to work. Given the highly preventable nature of traffic crashes, policy makers, public health advocates, and employers can develop effective strategies, including remote work arrangements, to improve both occupational and traffic safety.","French, Michael T; Gumus, Gulcin",Social science & medicine,92,14

In the spinotrapezius muscle (which is not recruited during incline treadmill running) of aged rats, we tested the hypotheses that exercise training will 1) improve the matching of O(2) delivery to O(2) uptake, evidenced through improved microvascular Po(2) (Pm(O(2))), at rest and throughout the contractions transient; and 2) enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation in first-order arterioles. Young (Y, ∼6 mo) and aged (O, >24 mo) Fischer 344 rats were assigned to control sedentary (YSED; n = 16, and OSED; n = 15) or exercise-trained (YET; n = 14, and OET; n = 13) groups. Spinotrapezius blood flow (via radiolabeled microspheres) was measured at rest and during exercise. Phosphorescence quenching was used to quantify Pm(O(2)) in vivo at rest and across the rest-to-twitch contraction (1 Hz, 5 min) transition in the spinotrapezius muscle. In a follow-up study, vasomotor responses to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and -independent (sodium nitroprusside) stimuli were investigated in vitro. Blood flow to the spinotrapezius did not increase above resting values during exercise in either young or aged groups. Exercise training increased the precontraction baseline Pm(O(2)) (OET 37.5 ± 3.9 vs. OSED 24.7 ± 3.6 Torr, P < 0.05); the end-contracting Pm(O(2)) and the time-delay before Pm(O(2)) fell in the aged group but did not affect these values in the young. Exercise training improved maximal vasodilation in aged rats to acetylcholine (OET 62 ± 16 vs. OSED 27 ± 16%) and to sodium nitroprusside in both young and aged rats. Endurance training of aged rats enhances the Pm(O(2)) in a nonrecruited skeletal muscle and is associated with improved vascular smooth muscle function. These data support the notion that improvements in vascular function with exercise training are not isolated to the recruited muscle.","McCullough, Danielle J; Davis, Robert T; Dominguez, James M; Stabley, John N; Bruells, Christian S; Behnke, Bradley J",Journal of applied physiology,92,1

Existing SILS techniques suffer from inefficient triangulation and poor ergonomics. In an effort to improve on existing SILS techniques, we developed the magnet-assisted single trocar (MAST) appendectomy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed all MAST appendectomies performed between March 2010 and February 2011. Outcomes included demographics, diagnosis, operative time, hospital stay, and complications. RESULTS Twenty-three MAST appendectomies were performed in 10 boys and 13 girls. The mean age at operation was 12.22 years (range, 5-19 years), and the mean weight was 46.5 kg (range, 25-82 kg). At presentation the mean white blood cell count was 15,000 with 74% polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The mean operative time was 61 minutes (range, 20-105 minutes), and length of stay was 3.6 days (range, 1-7 days). In total, 4 operations (17%) required one additional 5-mm trocar to complete the operation, and none was converted to an open operation. There were no intraoperative complications, nor were there any wound infections. CONCLUSIONS MAST appendectomy is safe and effective in children. Magnetic instruments provide excellent triangulation and improve ergonomics. This technique uses a single 12-mm trocar and can be performed without the aid of a surgical assistant.","Padilla, Benjamin E; Dominguez, Guillermo; Millan, Carolina; Bignon, Horacio; Buela, Enrique; Bellia, Gaston; Elias, Maria Eugenia; Albertal, Mariano; Martinez-Ferro, Marcelo",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

The lockdown enforced on account of Covid-19 pandemic is a unique opportunity to verify the influence of drastic reduction in aerosols on cloud development and its vertical distribution embedded in identical synoptic conditions. Cloud bases measured by ceilometer in Delhi, the capital of India, are observed to propagate from low level to higher levels as the lockdown progresses. It is explained in terms of trends in temporal variation of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and precursor gases to secondary hygroscopic aerosols. The large reduction (47%) in CCN estimated from aerosol extinction coefficient during the lockdown results in upward shift of cloud bases. Low clouds with bases located below 3 km are found to have reduced significantly from 63% (of total clouds distributed in the vertical) during pre-lockdown to 12% in lockdown period (less polluted). Cloud base height is found to have an inverse correlation with CCN (r = -0.64) and NO2/NH3 concentrations (r = -0.7). The role of meteorology and CCN in modulating the cloud vertical profiles is discussed in terms of anomalies of various controlling factors like lifting condensation level (LCL), precipitable water content (PWC) and mixing layer height (MLH).","R, Latha; B S, Murthy; B S, Sandeepan; Bhanage, Vinayak; Rathod, Aditi; Tiwari, Arpit; Beig, Gufran; Singh, Siddhartha",The Science of the total environment,92,1

The demand for such vaccines is great (since nearly everyone is a candidate for vaccination) yet supplies are currently limited. This raises clear ethical questions regarding the current and future Covid-19 vaccines. Methods: In this paper we highlight the several ethical questions that are raised using a three-fold categorization. We will discuss questions concerning: (1) the design and testing of vaccines; (2) who gets the vaccines; and (3) the tensions between public health and individual interest/autonomy. Each of these three more broad categories encompasses many different and concrete ethical questions. Results: We argue that different ethical frameworks apply both across these three categories, but also within these categories. Conclusion: Despite the fact that ethical conflict might not completely disappear, we argue that distinguishing and discussing separate questions from an ethical perspective can help create the necessary clarity and provide an ethical justification in favour of particular vaccination issues.","Raus, Kasper; Mortier, Eric; Eeckloo, Kristof",Acta clinica Belgica,92,1

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory system-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an important medical problem worldwide. Increased risk of mortality has been reported in patients with cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension (HTN). SARS-CoV-2 invades the pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells by binding to the surface receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) modulators can increase levels of ACE2. Thus, concerns have been raised regarding an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in patients receiving RAS antagonists. AREAS COVERED . We reviewed current literature about the potential association between the utilization of RAS inhibitors, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and likelihood of developing severe COVID-19 infection and whether or not continuation of these medications is appropriate in patients with active disease. EXPERT OPINION . The joint statement from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA), strongly recommends that physicians should not initiate or withdraw their usual RAS-related treatments (ACE-inhibitor/ARB) to COVID-19 infected patients with cardiovascular disease. The decision should be made based upon each patient's clinical presentation and hemodynamic status.","de la Cruz, Angel; Ashraf, Shoaib; Vittorio, Timothy J; Bella, Jonathan N",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,92,8

Methods: Twenty-eight patients [7 males and 21 females; age (15.5±5.5) years] with maxillary transverse deficiency were selected in the Department of Orthodontics, Hospital of Stomatology, Jilin University from February 2017 to October 2019. According to the fusion of the midpalatal suture, the patients were divided into two groups: 10 patients [3 males and 7 females; age (19.9±6.9) years] were in fusion group and 18 patients [4 males and 14 females; age (13.0±2.4) years] were in non-fusion group. Each patient had cone-beam CT (CBCT) images taken immediately after the placement of micro-implants (T1) and the completion of maxillary expansion (T2). The CBCT images were analyzed using the Dolphin Imaging software to evaluate the amount of midpalatal expansion and the percentages of bony expansion, etc. Statistical analysis was carried out to compare the two groups. Results: After MARPE treatment, the amount of sutural expansion in fusion group was (3.23±1.45) mm while that in non-fusion group was (4.97±1.47) mm (P<0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the percentages of bony expansion efficiency between the non-fusion group (71±20)% and the fusion group (46±18)% (P<0.05).

MGs account for a range of public health risks including communicable diseases, waterborne diseases, water treatment, and outbreaks. Objectives The present study aimed to identify public health risks threatening the health of people participating in MGs in Iran. Methods A qualitative study was designed using a conventional qualitative content analysis approach. Participants were selected using a purposive sampling method among the managers and staff who have experiences in the field of health in MGs in Iran. Subjects were interviewed through individual in-depth interviews after obtaining informed consent. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect the data from December 2018 to February 2019. To analyze the data, the content of recorded interviews was written verbatim. Preliminary data were repeatedly and simultaneously retrieved to give a general understanding of them. Results The main theme emerged from data analysis on 16 interviews was related to public health risks involving the following categories: food hygiene deficiencies, communicable diseases risks, defects in health supervision, and the risk of environmental contamination. Conclusion It is of paramount importance to identify the risks threatening the health of people participating in MGs. In the present study, the main public health risks were detected.","Tavan, Asghar; Tafti, Abbasali Dehghani; Nekoie-Moghadam, Mahmood; Ehrampoush, Mohmmadhasan; Nasab, Mohammad Reza Vafaei; Tavangar, Hossein",Indian journal of public health,92,1

Some predisposing genetic backgrounds can hence potentially explain the broad inter-individual variation of disease susceptibility and/or severity. It has been now clearly established that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, infects the host cell through biding and being internalized with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface protein expressed in a noticeable number of human cells, especially in those of upper and lower respiratory tracts, heart, kidney, testis, adipose tissue, gastrointestinal system and in lymphocytes. Accumulating evidence now suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene may modulate intermolecular interactions with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and/or contribute to pulmonary and systemic injury by fostering vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidation and fibrosis. We hence argue that the development of genetic tests aimed at specifically identifying specific COVID-19-susceptible or -protective ACE2 variants in the general population may be a reasonable strategy for stratifying the risk of infection and/or unfavorable disease progression.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Lavie, Carl J; Henry, Brandon M; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,92,8

This retrospective multicenter European study analyzed short- and midterm data in patients treated with WEB-DL. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twelve European neurointerventional centers participated in the study. Clinical data and pre- and postoperative short- and midterm images were collected. An experienced interventional neuroradiologist independently analyzed the images. Aneurysm occlusion was classified into 4 grades: complete occlusion, opacification of the proximal recess of the device, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant. RESULTS Forty-five patients (34 women and 11 men) 35-74 years of age (mean, 56.3 ± 9.6 years) with 45 aneurysms treated with the WEB device were included. Aneurysm locations were the middle cerebral artery in 26 patients, the posterior circulation in 13 patients, the anterior communicating artery in 5 patients, and the internal carotid artery terminus in 1 patient. Forty-two aneurysms were unruptured. Good clinical outcome (mRS < 2) was observed in 93.3% of patients at the last follow-up. Adequate occlusion (complete occlusion, opacification of the proximal recess, or neck remnant) was observed in 30/37 patients (81.1%) in short-term follow-up (median, 6 months) and in 26/29 patients (89.7%) in midterm follow-up (median, 13 months). Worsening of the aneurysm occlusion was observed in 2/28 patients (7.1%) at midterm follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the WEB endovascular treatment of wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms offers stable occlusion in a class of aneurysms that are historically unstable. Additionally, our data show that opacification of the WEB recess can be delineated from true neck or aneurysm remnants.","Lubicz, B; Klisch, J; Gauvrit, J-Y; Szikora, I; Leonardi, M; Liebig, T; Nuzzi, N P; Boccardi, E; Paola, F D; Holtmannspötter, M; Weber, W; Calgliari, E; Sychra, V; Mine, B; Pierot, L",AJNR.

Sociodemographic and risk heterogeneity across the treatment cascade has not yet been comprehensively described or quantified and we seek to systematically review and synthesize research on this topic among adults in Africa. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature in Embase and MEDLINE databases as well as grey literature sources published in English between 2014 and 2018. We included studies that included people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged ≥15 years, and reported a 90-90-90 outcome: awareness of HIV-positive status, ART use among those diagnosed or viral suppression among those on ART. We summarized measures of association between sociodemographics, within each outcome, and as a composite measure of population-wide viral suppression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION From 3533 screened titles, we extracted data from 92 studies (50 peer-reviewed, 42 grey sources). Of included studies, 32 reported on awareness, 53 on ART use, 32 on viral suppression and 23 on population-wide viral suppression. The majority of studies were conducted in South Africa, Uganda, and Malawi and reported data for age and gender. When stratified, PLHIV ages 15 to 24 years had lower median achievement of the treatment cascade (60-49-81), as compared to PLHIV ≥25 years (70-63-91). Men also had lower median achievement of the treatment cascade (66-72-85), compared to women (79-76-89). For population-wide viral suppression, women aged ≥45 years had achieved the 73% target, while the lowest medians were among 15- to 24-year-old men (37%) and women (49%). CONCLUSIONS Considerable heterogeneity exists by age and gender for achieving the HIV 90-90-90 treatment goals. These results may inform delivery of HIV testing and treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, as targeting youth and men could be a strategic way to maximize the population-level impact of ART.","Green, Dylan; Tordoff, Diana M; Kharono, Brenda; Akullian, Adam; Bershteyn, Anna; Morrison, Michelle; Garnett, Geoff; Duerr, Ann; Drain, Paul K",Journal of the International AIDS Society,92,22

METHODS This is a retrospective review of our database examining consecutive patients who underwent an initial first-stage laparoscopic liver resection for CRC metastases, with a planned second-stage resection from 2007 to 2013. RESULTS Seven patients underwent an initial laparoscopic first stage with concurrent right portal vein ligation (RPVL) in two patients. Median operating time was 100 (60-170) min with a median blood loss of 100 (50-400) mL. Median length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. The remaining five patients required post-operative right portal vein embolization (RPVE). All patients had significant hypertrophy of the future liver remnant (FLR) (future liver remnant volume (FLRV) >25%) and six patients subsequently had a successful open right hepatectomy with one attempted laparoscopically converted to open. Two patients had prolonged bile leaks after the second procedure. Three patients remained disease free, with median follow-up of 34 (13-80) months. One patient had disease progression following RPVE precluding performance of second stage. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic first-stage resection of tumours in the left liver can be safely combined with RPVL/RPVE to achieve adequate hypertrophy of the FLR, allowing subsequent right hepatectomy.","Kilburn, Daniel James; Chiow, Adrian Kah Heng; Lewin, Joel; Kienzle, Nicholas; Cavallucci, David Joseph; Bryant, Richard; O'Rourke, Nicholas",ANZ journal of surgery,92,1

However, surgical outcomes of LECS, including for esophagogastric junction (EGJ) tumors requiring advanced skills, remain unknown. METHODS We reviewed patients in whom LECS had initially been attempted for gastric SET at the Cancer Institute Hospital in Tokyo from June 2006 to May 2018. Indications for LECS at the EGJ have gradually expanded during the study period to include tumors with esophageal invasion up to 2 cm, or less than half the EJG circumference, preoperatively. Surgical outcomes and risk factors for conversion to other procedures were investigated. RESULTS Twenty (9.3%) of the 214 total patients had EGJ tumors. Four patients (20%) with EGJ tumors developed postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II). Among 12 patients in whom LECS could be completed for EGJ tumors, only one non-serious complication occurred. Eight patients required conversion to another operation for EGJ tumors (two laparotomy, six proximal gastrectomy). Among conversion cases with EGJ tumors, anastomotic leakage occurred in both patients undergoing laparotomy after LECS, necessitating additional defect closure. There was only one non-serious complication in six proximal gastrectomy patients. On multivariate analysis, EGJ tumor was an independent risk factor for conversion to another operation. CONCLUSION LECS at the EGJ may be a risk factor for conversion operation, and when performing LECS at the EGJ is difficult, conversion to proximal gastrectomy, which can be performed safely, should be considered.","Ri, Motonari; Nunobe, Souya; Makuuchi, Rie; Ida, Satoshi; Kumagai, Koshi; Ohashi, Manabu; Sano, Takeshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,92,32

We prove that the modification of Pt is associated with highly energetic impact of nanobubbles rather than with any electrochemical process. Experiments Nanobubbles are generated by planar Pt or Ti microelectrodes. The process is driven by a series of alternating or single polarity pulses. In the case of Ti electrodes a Pt plate is separated by a gap from the electrodes. Nanoparticles on the surface of platinum are investigated with a scanning electron microscope and elemental composition is analysed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Findings Vigorous formation of Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10 nm is observed when the process is driven by the alternating polarity pulses. The effects of Pt corrosion have different character and cannot explain the phenomenon. Similar nanoparticles are observed when the Pt plate is exposed to a stream of nanobubbles. The process is explained by spontaneous combustion of hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles on Pt surface. The phenomenon can be used to remove strongly adhered particles from solids.","Uvarov, Ilia V; Shlepakov, Pavel S; Postnikov, Alexander V; Svetovoy, Vitaly B",Journal of colloid and interface science,92,31

With the development of national insurance for underprivileged patients, we assessed the current frequency and causes of treatment abandonment among patients with ALL who were enrolled in the Chinese Children's Cancer Group ALL protocol between 2015 and 2016. METHODS Demographic, clinical and laboratory data on patients who abandoned treatment, as well as economic and sociocultural data of their families were collected and analysed. General health-related statistics were retrieved from publicly accessible databanks maintained by the Chinese government. RESULTS At a median follow-up of 119 weeks, 83 (3.1%, 95% CI 2.5% to 3.8%) of the 2641 patients abandoned treatment. Factors independently associated with abandonment included standard/high-risk ALL (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.43 to 4.77), presence of minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.90 to 6.74) and low-income economic region (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.89 to 7.05). According to the family members, economic constraints (50.6%, p=0.0001) were the main reason for treatment abandonment, followed by the belief of incurability, severe side effects and concern over late complications. CONCLUSIONS The rate of ALL treatment abandonment has been greatly reduced in China. Standard/high-risk ALL, residence in a low-income region and economic difficulties were associated with treatment abandonment.

It affects the quality of life of patients and has been associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study aimed to determine the prevalence of fibromyalgia in HIV-positive patients and assess the effect of fibromyalgia on their functional status. METHODOLOGY This was a cross-sectional study comprising 160 treatment-naive HIV-positive patients and 160 age- and sex-matched HIV-negative controls. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia was based on the 2011 modification of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria by assessing the widespread pain index and symptom severity score. The severity of fibromyalgia was assessed with the revised fibromyalgia impact questionnaire. RESULTS The prevalence of fibromyalgia in HIV-positive individuals was found to be 10.6%, which was significantly higher compared with controls (3.1%; P = .008). There was no significant association between fibromyalgia and age, gender, or occupation. There was a significant relationship between CD4 count levels (P < .001), WHO clinical stage (P < .001), and fibromyalgia. A statistically significant higher score on the Revised FM Impact Questionnaire was found in HIV-positive individuals with fibromyalgia (P < .001). CONCLUSION The study found that HIV-positive patients had a significantly higher incidence of fibromyalgia than controls and this was related to active indices of HIV disease. Fibromyalgia had a greater clinical impact on HIV patients than in controls. As a result, fibromyalgia should be identified and treated in people living with HIV.","Emorinken, Airenakho; Dic-Ijiewere, Mercy Ofunami; Erameh, Cyril Oshomah; Ugheoke, Asuwemhe Johnson; Agbebaku, Folasade Ojuolape; Agbadaola, Oluwaseun Remi",International journal of rheumatic diseases,92,20

When evaluating published works, one should assess the integrity and academic credentials of the authors, who serve as putative experts. A relationship with a relevant manufacturer may increase the potential risk for bias in relevant studies. Objective To characterize the association of industrial payments by device manufacturers, self-declared conflict of interest (COI), and relevance of publications among physicians receiving the highest compensation. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based bibliometric analysis identified 10 surgical and medical device manufacturing companies and the 10 physicians receiving the highest compensation from each company using the 2015 Open Payments Database (OPD) general payments data. For each of the 100 physicians, the total amount of general payments, number of payments, institution type, and academic rank were recorded. Royalty or license payments were excluded. A search of PubMed identified articles published by each physician from January 1 through December 31, 2016, and their associated COI declaration. Scopus was used to identify bibliometric data reported as the h index (number of papers by a researcher with at least h citations each). Main Outcomes and Measures Discrepancy between self-declared COI and industry payments. Results The 100 physicians included in the sample population (88% men) were paid a total of $12 446 969, with a median payment of $95 993. Fifty physicians (50.0%) were faculty at academic institutions. The mean (SD) h index was 18 (18; range, 0-75) for the authors. In 2016, 412 articles were published by these physicians, with a mean (SD) of 4 (6) publications (range, 0-25) and median of 1 (36 physicians had no publications). Of these articles, 225 (54.6%) were relevant to the general payments received by the authors. Only in 84 of the 225 relevant publications (37.3%) was the potential COI declared by the authors. Conclusions and Relevance A high level of inconsistency was found between self-declared COI and the OPD among the physicians receiving the highest industry payments. Therefore, a policy of full disclosure for all publications, regardless of relevance, is proposed. No statistically significant association was demonstrated between academic rank or productivity and industrial payments.","Ziai, Kasra; Pigazzi, Alessio; Smith, Brian R; Nouri-Nikbakht, Roxana; Nepomuceno, Helene; Carmichael, Joseph C; Mills, Steven; Stamos, Michael J; Jafari, Mehraneh D",JAMA surgery,92,1

Several studies have investigated orofacial injuries during contact sports in different countries, but there is a lack of data that is specific for French handball players. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of orofacial injuries and the proportion of handball players using a mouthguard in Eastern France. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected from handball players aged over 15 years old from five handball clubs in the Lorraine Region (Eastern France). A questionnaire containing 26 questions about the general characteristics of participants, orofacial injury experiences, emergency procedures following tooth avulsion, and use of mouthguards was self-administered. RESULTS Two hundred and sixty-three handball players, of which 76.8% (202) were males, aged 23 ± 8 years on average, with a mean playing experience of 11 ± 6 years, participated in the study. Among them, 24.7% (65) reported at least one orofacial injury. A total of 237 orofacial injuries was declared. The main types of orofacial injuries including lip, cheek and tongue injuries were reported by 18.6% of handball players (49); dental injuries were reported by 9.9% (26) and injuries to the temporomandibular joint were reported by 4.9% (13). Most participants knew about mouthguards (97.3%, 254) and considered them efficient for preventing dental injuries in handball (95.3%, 242/254), but only 3.0% (8) used them. CONCLUSION The prevalence of orofacial injuries among French handball players was high while mouthguards were very rarely used. Information should be provided to handball teams regarding mouthguard use and the management of dental injuries.","Hacquin, Manon; Nguyen-Thi, Phi Linh; Yasukawa, Kazutoyo; Baudet, Alexandre",Dental traumatology : official publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology,92,1

The anti-proverbs under study describe the most important parts of people's lives that were changed during the pandemic: the new disease, life in quarantine, working in quarantine, and fighting with the disease. These five spheres allowed dividing all the anti-proverbs into five semantic modules bearing the same names. The substitutes in the anti-proverbs are semantically related to the four semantic fields: disease, health, work and internet. The theoretical ground for the study of anti-proverbs is based on the idea that they are syntactically independent units that express certain wisdom and are used as means of language play. They produce an emotional impact on people and thus become a tool for influencing social opinion. The mechanisms of the creation of the anti-proverbs are studied in the article and the most widely used mechanisms are revealed.","Menshakova, N. N.; Frolova, T. P.; Shlyakhova, S. S.; Kretova, L.

In total, 12 studies (i.e. 9 analytical experimental, 1 cohort study, 1 cross-sectional and 1 case series) were included. Two cleaning methods were identified as likely being most promising: five-minute submersion in 70% alcohol and the 'Milton method'. Each eliminated bacterial colonization without affecting the physical properties of the catheters. All other cleaning methods were either non-bactericidal or caused gross visual or microscopic damage to the catheters, rendering their reuse unsafe. Additional higher-powered studies confirming the safety and efficacy of these cleaning methods must be obtained before we would feel comfortable challenging current clinical recommendations.","Grasdal, M.; Walter, M.; Krassioukov, A.

Symptomatic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) implies the presence of significant endothelial dysfunction and is a risk factor for severe COVID-19. However, many patients with no history of CVD exhibit severe COVID-19. We hypothesised that CVD risk calculators could serve as a proxy for significant endothelial dysfunction and predict COVID-19 outcomes in those without symptomatic CVD. We reviewed 230 patients aged 35 to 65 years, hospitalized with COVID-19 at our institution. 190 patients with no history of symptomatic CVD were included. 23% developed severe respiratory failure (RF, requiring mechanical or non-invasive ventilation), while 4% (7/164) of those without prior end-stage renal disease required renal replacement therapy (RRT). In univariate analysis, age (β = 0.057 ± 0.02, p= 0.02), BMI (β = 0.05 ± 0.03, p = 0.049) and T2DM (β = 0.81 ± 0.41, p = 0.048) predicted RF. In keeping with a link between insulin resistance and severe COVID-19, an association was observed between triglycerides and RF (β = 0.26 ± 0.14, P = 0.058). CVD risk indices QRISK3 (0.07 ± 0.02, P <0.001), a CVD Risk Algorithm that predicts the risk of a CV event in next 10 years, and CHADS2VASC (0.53 ± 0.20, P=0.01) were both associated with RF. Age and QRISK3 were associated with a requirement for RRT and length of stay. We observed a threshold effect for QRISK3: when 10 year risk of a CV event was > 5% the risk of RF markedly increased (OR: 6.86 (95% CI: 2.30 - 20.5, P<0.001). The risk of RF was similar across all strata of QRISK3 >5%. A similar trend was observed when analysis was limited to those with T2DM (Ventilatory support in T2DM: QRISK<5% - 0/8, QRISK>5%: 11/30). All cases of RRT occurred in those with QRISK >5%. CVD risk calculators predict severe COVID-19, supporting a role for subclinical CVD in severe COVID-19. Patients hospitalized with QRISK3 >5% may be candidates for early intervention and enhanced monitoring.","Lockhart, Sam Sheikh Anum Griffiths Hary Latorre Julia Calvo Daly Aideen B.; Sibal, Latika",Diabetes,92,33

Therefore, early detection and identification of minority viral haplotypes may help to promptly adjust the patient's treatment plan preventing potential disease complications. Minority haplotypes can be identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS), but sequencing noise hinders accurate identification. The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.","Knyazev, Sergey; Tsyvina, Viachaslau; Shankar, Anupama; Melnyk, Andrew; Artyomenko, Alexander; Malygina, Tatiana; Porozov, Yuri B.; Campbell, Ellsworth M.; Mangul, Serghei; Switzer, William M.; Skums, Pavel; Zelikovsky, Alex",bioRxiv,92,25

The complete solution is validated using independently measured mobility data and accurate predictions of COVID-19 case dynamics in multiple countries. It replicates the observed phenomenology, quantitates pandemic dynamics, and provides simple analytical tools for policy makers. Of particular note, it projects that increased social containment measures shorten an epidemic and reduce the ultimate number of cases and deaths. In contrast, the widely used Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) models, based on an approximation to Kermack and McKendricks original equations, project that strong containment measures delay the peak in daily infections, causing a longer epidemic. These projections contradict both the complete solution and the observed phenomenology in COVID-19 pandemic data. The closed-form solution elucidates that the two parameters classically used as constants in approximate SIR models cannot, in fact, be reasonably assumed to be constant in real epidemics. This prima facie failure forces the conclusion that the approximate SIR models should not be used to characterize or manage epidemics. As a replacement to the SIR models, the closed-form solution and the expressions derived from the solution form a complete set of analytical tools that can accurately diagnose the state of an epidemic and provide proper guidance for public health decision makers.","Duclos, T.

However, the current locomotion mode recognition systems being developed for intelligent high-level control and decision-making use mechanical, inertial, and/or neuromuscular data, which inherently have limited prediction horizons (i.e., analogous to walking blindfolded). Inspired by the human vision-locomotor control system, we designed and evaluated an advanced environment classification system that uses computer vision and deep learning to forward predict the oncoming walking environments prior to physical interaction, therein allowing for more accurate and robust locomotion mode transitions. In this study, we first reviewed the development of the ExoNet database – the largest and most diverse open-source dataset of wearable camera images of indoor and outdoor real-world walking environments, which were annotated using a hierarchical labelling architecture. We then trained and tested over a dozen state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the ExoNet database for large-scale image classification of the walking environments, including: EfficientNetB0, InceptionV3, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201. Lastly, we quantitatively compared the benchmarked CNN architectures and their environment classification predictions using an operational metric called NetScore, which balances the image classification accuracy with the computational and memory storage requirements (i.e., important for onboard real-time inference). Although we designed this environment classification system to support the development of next-generation environment-adaptive locomotor control systems for robotic prostheses and exoskeletons, applications could extend to humanoids, autonomous legged robots, powered wheelchairs, and assistive devices for persons with visual impairments.","Laschowski, Brokoslaw; McNally, William; Wong, Alexander; McPhee, John",bioRxiv,92,25

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between liver damage and observed symptoms and laboratory parameters. Materials and Methods: Patients followed-up with diagnoses of COVID-19 between March and August 2020 were included in the study. Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were compared according to liver damage status. Results: Four hundred and thirteen COVID-19 cases were included. The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was 19.8%, the most common being nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (10.4%, 6.1%, and 2.9%, respectively). CT-confirmed pneumonia, intensive care requirement, and mean length of hospitalization differed significantly depending on liver damage status (p 0.001, p= 0.006, p= 0.002, respectively). Significant differences were determined between the groups with and without liver damage in terms of all the laboratory parameters examined, apart from white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR), total bilirubin, and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) (p 0.05). Significant associations were present between alanine aminotransferase levels and all other laboratory parameters apart from NLR and PTT (p 0.001). Aspartate aminotransferase (OR: 1.22, CI: 1.16-1.28) and albumin (OR: 2.28, CI: 1.12-4.63) were identified as significant independent risk factors for liver damage in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients. Liver damage may be associated with progression to intensive care and systemic inflammation.","Alay, H.; Can, F.

The main limitations of the conventional techniques are their dependency on virus-specific receptors and reagents that need to be custom-developed for each recently-emerged pathogen, the time required for this development as well as for sample preparation and detection, the need for biological amplification, which can increase false positive outcomes, and the cost and size of the necessary equipment. Thus, new platform technologies that can be readily modified as soon as new pathogens are detected, sequenced, and characterized are needed to enable rapid deployment and mass distribution of biosensors. This need can be addressed by the development of adaptive, multiplexed, and affordable sensing technologies that can avoid the conventional biological amplification step, make use of the optical and/or electrical signal amplification, and shorten both the preliminary development and the point-of-care testing time frames. We provide a comparative review of the existing and emergent photonic biosensing techniques by matching them to the above criteria and capabilities of preventing the spread of the next global pandemic.","Blevins, Morgan G.; Fernandez-Galiana, Alvaro Hooper Milo J.; Boriskina, Svetlana V.",Photonics,92,20

The integrated threat theory (ITT) was used to formulate questions surrounding incivility and moral foundations within Twitter discourses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected tweets and retweets posted by English-speaking Twitter users in the United States (US) across the following three phases: (1) initial discovery of COVID-19 in China, (2) high US mortality rate from COVID-19 and (3) the announcement that a vaccine would soon be available in the US. Findings The authors found a significant difference in uncivil tweets posted in cities with higher levels of reported hate crimes against Asians than cities with low levels. Lastly, English-speaking Twitter users tended to employ moral virtue words and moral vice words when discussing China and Chinese culture/populations. Research limitations/implications The bags-of-words employed are limited in capturing nuanced and metaphorical terms. In addition, the analysis focused solely on Tweets composed in English and thus did not capture the thoughts and opinions of non-English speakers. Lastly, this study did not address all Asian countries. In this sense, the findings of this study might not be applicable to Tweets about other nations. Practical implications Given that many Twitter users tend to use terms of moral virtue in support of Asians and Asian communities, the authors suggest that non-governmental organization administrators provide morally supportive social media campaigns that encourage users to engage in civil discourse. Social implications These findings have theoretical implications as the frameworks of integrated threats and moral foundations were used to offer group-level explanations for online behavior. Additional research is needed to explore whether these frameworks can be used to explain negativity in other communication environments.

As the protons enter from the viral exterior, four central His37 residues control the channel activation by binding subsequent protons, which opens the Trp41 gate and allows proton flux to the viral interior. Asp44 is essential for maintaining the Trp41 gate in a closed state at high pH, which results in asymmetric conduction. The prevalent D44N mutant disrupts this gate and opens the C-terminal end of the channel, resulting in overall increased conduction in the physiologically relevant pH range and a loss of this asymmetric conduction. Here, we use extensive Multiscale Reactive Molecular Dynamics (MS-RMD) and Quantum Mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations with an explicit, reactive excess proton to calculate the free energy of proton transport in the M2 mutant and to study the dynamic molecular-level behavior of D44N M2. We find that this mutation significantly lowers the barrier of His37 deprotonation in the activated state and shifts the barrier for entry up to the Val27 tetrad. These free energy changes are reflected in structural shifts. Additionally, we show that the increased hydration around the His37 tetrad diminishes the effect of the His37 charge on the channel’s water structure, facilitating proton transport and enabling activation from the viral interior. Altogether, this work provides key insight into the fundamental characteristics of PT in WT M2 and how the D44N mutation alters this PT mechanism, and it expands our understanding of the role of emergent mutations in viroporins.","Watkins, Laura C.; DeGrado, William F.; Voth, Gregory A.",bioRxiv,92,20

Design: A retrospective, descriptive cohort study examining routinely collected data from BORN Ontario, which captures linkable population data for prenatal and neonatal health encounters across a variety of settings (e.g., laboratories, birthing hospitals and midwifery practice groups). Setting: A province-wide and publicly funded prenatal screening program in Ontario, Canada offering cfDNA screening for those at increased risk of having a pregnancy with T21 or T18. Participants: 373,682 singleton pregnancies with an estimated due date between September 1 2016 and March 31, 2019 who were offered publicly funded prenatal screening. Main outcome measures: Prenatal detection of T21 or T18, ascertained by cytogenetic results. Performance was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value against confirmatory diagnostic cytogenetic results and birth outcomes. The secondary objective was to determine the impact of contingent cfDNA screening by measuring uptake and the proportion of T21 screen-positive pregnancies undergoing subsequent cfDNA screening and invasive prenatal diagnostic testing (PND). Results: 69% of pregnancies in Ontario underwent prenatal screening for T21/T18. The modified-contingent screen sensitivity was 89.9% for T21 and 80.5% for T18. The modified-contingent screen-positive rate was 1.6% for T21 and 0.2% for T18. The cfDNA screening test failure rate was 2.2% (final result including multiple attempts). The PND rate among pregnancies screened was 2.4%. Conclusions: This study is the largest evaluation of population-based performance of a publicly funded cfDNA prenatal screening system. We demonstrated a robust screening system with high sensitivity and low PND consistent with smaller validation studies.","Dougan, S. D.; Okun, N.; Bellai-Dussault, K.; Meng, L.; Howley, H.

Antibodies persist in the blood after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Since COVID-19 vaccines induce immune response to the Spike protein of the virus, which is the main serosurveillance target to date, alternative targets should be explored to distinguish infection from vaccination. Methods Multiplex immunoassay data from 1,513 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-tested individuals (352 positive and 1,161 negative) with a primary infection and no vaccination history were used to determine the accuracy of Nucleoprotein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in detecting past SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described Spike S1 and Nucleoprotein-specific IgG responses in 230 COVID-19 vaccinated individuals (Pfizer/BioNTech). Results The sensitivity of Nucleoprotein seropositivity was 85% (95% confidence interval: 80-90%) for mild COVID-19 in the first two months following symptom onset. Sensitivity was lower in asymptomatic individuals (67%, 50-81%). Participants who had experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 11 months preceding vaccination, as assessed by Spike S1 seropositivity or RT-qPCR, produced 2.7-fold higher median levels of IgG to Spike S1 [≥]14 days after the first dose as compared to those unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 at [≥]7 days after the second dose (p=0.011). Nucleoprotein-specific IgG concentrations were not affected by vaccination in naive participants. Conclusions Serological responses to Nucleoprotein may prove helpful in identifying SARS-CoV-2 infections after vaccination. Furthermore, it can help interpret IgG to Spike S1 after COVID-19 vaccination as particularly high responses shortly after vaccination could be explained by prior exposure history.","van den Hoogen, L.

Following the fundamental theoretical frameworks of motivation, the authors argue that remote work tasks and the environment highly determine employees' productivity and satisfaction, which in turn influence their intention to continue working from home once the restrictions are relaxed. Design/methodology/approach Data from 363 remote work employees were collected, indicating their personal experiences of working from home during COVID-19 quarantine. The analyses were carried out using partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology, employing the SmartPLS3 software. Findings The results reveal the possibility for reconciliation and the adequate remote work's flow as motivating, and the interruptions and technology-related anxiety as interfering impacts, in the process of achieving functional home office. However, although employees might be productive, it is not a sufficient condition for them to show an intention to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, contrary to their satisfaction, which is found crucial for their future intentions.

Here, we employed live-cell microscopy to compare the spindle dynamics of mitosis and meiosis I in fission yeast cells and demonstrated that the conserved kinesin-14 motor Klp2 plays a specific role in maintaining metaphase spindle length during meiosis I, but not during mitosis. Moreover, the maintenance of metaphase spindle stability during meiosis I requires the synergism between Klp2 and the conserved microtubule crosslinker Ase1 as the absence of both proteins causes exacerbated defects in metaphase spindle stability. The synergism is not necessary for regulating mitotic spindle dynamics. Hence, our work reveals a new molecular mechanism underlying meiotic spindle dynamics and provides insights into understanding differential regulation of meiotic and mitotic events.","Zheng, Fan; Dong, Fenfen; Yu, Shuo; Li, Tianpeng; Jian, Yanze; Nie, Lingyun; Fu, Chuanhai",bioRxiv,92,16

Here we show the interplay between B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B.1.526 (Iota) in New York (NY) from December 2020 to April 2021 through phylogeographic analyses, space-time scan statistics, and cartographic visualization. Our results indicate that B.1.526 likely evolved in the Bronx in late 2020, providing opportunity for an initial foothold in the heavily interconnected New York City (NYC) region, as evidenced by numerous exportations to surrounding locations. In contrast, B.1.1.7 became dominant in regions of upstate NY where B.1.526 had limited presence, suggesting that B.1.1.7 was able to spread more efficiently in the absence of B.1.526. Clusters discovered from the spatial-time scan analysis supported the role of competition between B.1.526 and B.1.1.7 in NYC in March 2021 and the outsized presence of B.1.1.7 in upstate NY in April 2021. Although B.1.526 likely delayed the rise of B.1.1.7 in NYC, B.1.1.7 became the dominant variant in the Metro region by the end of the study period. These results reveal the advantages endemicity may grant to a variant (founder effect), despite the higher fitness of an introduced lineage. Our research highlights the dynamics of inter-variant competition at a time when B.1.617.2 (Delta) is overtaking B.1.1.7 as the dominant lineage worldwide. We believe our combined spatiotemporal methodologies can disentangle the complexities of shifting SARS-CoV-2 variant landscapes at a time when the evolution of variants with additional fitness advantages is impending.","Russell, A.; O'Connor, C.; Lasek-Nesselquist, E.; Plitnick, J.; Kelly, J.

These are processed primarily by the chymotrypsin-like main proteinases (M(pro)s). So far, M(pro)s have been studied only for corona-, arteri-, and roniviruses. Here, we report the characterization of the M(pro) of toroviruses, the fourth main Nidovirus branch. Comparative sequence analysis of polyprotein 1a of equine torovirus (EToV) strain Berne, identified a serine proteinase domain, flanked by hydrophobic regions. Heterologous expression of this domain resulted in autoprocessing at flanking cleavage sites. N-terminal sequence analysis of cleavage products tentatively identified FxxQ downward arrow(S, A) as the substrate consensus sequence. EToV M(pro) combines several traits of its closest relatives. It has a predicted three-domain structure, with two catalytic beta-barrel domains and an additional C-terminal domain of unknown function. With respect to substrate specificity, the EToV M(pro) resembles its coronavirus homologue in its preference for P1-Gln, but its substrate-binding subsite, S1, more closely resembles that of arteri- and ronivirus M(pro)s, which prefer P1-Glu. Surprisingly, in contrast to the M(pro)s of corona- and roniviruses, but like that of arterivirus, the torovirus M(pro) uses serine instead of cysteine as its principal nucleophile. Under the premise that the M(pro)s of corona- and toroviruses are more closely related to each other than to those of arteri- and roniviruses, the transition from serine- to cysteine-based proteolytic catalysis (or vice versa) must have happened more than once in the course of nidovirus evolution. In this respect, it is of interest that a mutant EToV M(pro) with a Ser165-->Cys substitution retained partial enzymatic activity.","Smits, Saskia L; Snijder, Eric J; de Groot, Raoul J",Journal of virology,92,33

From 1990 to 2001 in Florida, the nonsuicidal poisoning death rate increased 325%. To characterize recent trends in drug overdose death rates in Florida, CDC analyzed data from the Florida Medical Examiners Commission. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which found that, from 2003 to 2009, the number of annual deaths in which medical examiner testing showed lethal concentrations of one or more drugs increased 61.0%, from 1,804 to 2,905, and the death rate increased 47.5%, from 10.6 to 15.7 per 100,000 population. During 2003-2009, death rates increased for all substances except cocaine and heroin. The death rate for prescription drugs increased 84.2%, from 7.3 to 13.4 per 100,000 population. The greatest increase was observed in the death rate from oxycodone (264.6%), followed by alprazolam (233.8%) and methadone (79.2%). By 2009, the number of deaths involving prescription drugs was four times the number involving illicit drugs.

MAbs V-3-2B and Y-18 were specific to gp116 and gp64 envelope proteins, respectively, while Y-19 was specific to a 20 kDa putative nucleoprotein p20. As a preliminary step, the site of reactivity of the 3 MAbs in YHV was determined by immuno-electron microscopy using ultra-thin sections of YHV-infected shrimp tissue and negatively stained, semi-purified YHV particles. As expected, MAb Y-19 reacted with viral nucleocapsids in ultra-thin sections but not with negatively stained, whole virions; MAb V-3-2B did react with negatively stained, whole virions, but not with virions or nucleocapsids in ultra-thin sections. Unexpectedly, MAb Y-18 did not react with whole or sectioned virions. By immunohistochemistry, MAbs Y-19 and Y-18 reacted with Penaeus monodon tissues infected with either YHV or with gill-associated virus (GAV) from Australia, while MAb V-3-2B reacted with YHV only. In addition, all the YHV and GAV tissue samples gave positive in situ hybridization reactions with a cDNA probe specific to the ORF1b gene of YHV. They also gave expected differential RT-PCR results for YHV and GAV. By contrast, 2 natural Thai shrimp specimens with no gross signs of disease gave similar immunohistochemical reactions and RT-PCR reactions to GAV. However, sequencing of their RT-PCR products showed that they shared 92.7% identity with GAV, but only 79.0% identity with YHV. Although specimens from Ecuador and India displayed histopathology suggestive of YHV infection, they gave negative immunohistochemical reactions with all 3 Mabs, and negative in situ hybridization results. Additional work is required to determine whether a virus from the yellow head complex was responsible for their observed histopathology.

The goal of this study was to compare robotic-assisted surgery with pure laparoscopic surgery in a single center. METHODS One hundred and 16 patients underwent minimally invasive adrenalectomies in our department between June 1994 and December 2014, 41 of whom were treated with a robotic-assisted approach (robotic adrenalectomy, RA). Patients who underwent RA were matched according to BMI, age, gender, and nodule dimensions, and compared with 41 patients who had undergone laparoscopic adrenalectomies (LA). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for independent samples, and the relationship between the operative time and other covariates were evaluated with a multivariable linear regression model. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Mean operative time was significantly shorter in the RA group compared to the LA group. The subgroup analysis showed a shorter mean operative time in the RA group in patients with nodules ≥6 cm, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and in those who had previous abdominal surgery (p < 0.05). Results from the multiple regression model confirmed a shorter mean operative time with RA with nodules ≥6 cm (p = 0.010). Conversion rate and postoperative complications were 2.4 and 4.8 % in the LA group and 0 and 4.8 % in the RA group.

Concomitant ligation of the vessels is not a standard procedure due to an expected risk of stapler dysfunction and the development of arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). Using the EndoGIA stapler 45/2.5 mm, we compared en bloc ligation with individual ligation during LN and nephroureterectomy (LNU) with a special focus on the development of AVF and technique safety. METHODS This was a retrospective study of all patients undergoing LN or LNU at the Department of Urology, Roskilde Hospital, Denmark, between January 2010 and April 2014. The follow-up period was minimum six months. RESULTS A total of 228 patients underwent LN and 56 patients underwent LNU. In the LN group, 77 patients underwent en bloc ligation. The mean surgical time was significantly reduced to 89 minutes in the en bloc group compared to 109 minutes in the conventional group (p = 0.0001). The difference remained significant with multivariate analysis. In the LNU group, seven patients underwent en bloc ligation. There was no significant difference between conventional ligation and en bloc ligation with respect to surgical time in either the univariate or the multivariate analyses. None of the patients needed blood transfusion. With a mean follow-up of 13.5 months, no AVF were found. CONCLUSIONS En bloc ligation appears to be safe and can reduce the surgical time during LN without increased risk of blood transfusion and without development of AVF. Further studies are needed to assess any advantages associated with use of the method during LNU. FUNDING none.

In this study, we have explored the nature of the virus-spleen cell interaction that leads to IFN-alpha/beta induction and the reason for the poor response to some virus strains. IFN-alpha/beta induction by horse serum-sensitive, but not -resistant, strains of influenza virus was inhibited in the presence of horse serum, indicating that binding of the virus to sialylated cell receptors is a necessary step in the induction process. Furthermore, influenza viruses A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/WS/33 (H1N1), which were poor inducers of IFN-alpha/beta in spleen cells, were shown to have a more active neuraminidase than strains that induced higher IFN levels, and IFN-alpha/beta induction by A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/WS/33 (H1N1) was restored in the presence of a neuraminidase inhibitor. Growth of virus in different cell types altered the level of IFN-alpha/beta induced in spleen cells by particular virus strains, suggesting that the nature of the carbohydrate moieties on the viral glycoproteins may also influence IFN-alpha/beta induction in this system. Consistent with this notion, treatment of egg-grown virus with periodate to oxidize viral carbohydrate greatly reduced its capacity for IFN-alpha/beta induction. Furthermore, induction of IFN-alpha/beta was inhibited in the presence of the saccharides yeast mannan and laminarin. Together these findings indicate: (i) a requirement for interaction of the virus with sialylated receptors on the IFN-producing cell; (ii) an influence of viral carbohydrate on the response; and (iii) possible involvement of a lectin-like receptor on the IFN-producing cell in the induction of IFN-alpha/beta or in regulation of this response.","Miller, Joanna L; Anders, E Margot",The Journal of general virology,92,16

Because equine rotavirus of the single P genotype, P[12], is predominant in the equine population worldwide, an RT-LAMP primer set was designed to target the genotype P[12] sequence and thus detect equine rotavirus. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was 10(3) copies of viral RNA, whereas that of semi-nested RT-PCR for genotype P[12] was 10(5) copies. The RT-LAMP assay specifically amplified genotype P[12] but did not amplify the other P genotype strains.

These results indicate that the RT-LAMP assay is specific for equine rotavirus and more sensitive than semi-nested RT-PCR. Because it is easy to manipulate without the need for a thermal cycler or gel electrophoresis, the RT-LAMP assay should be applicable to diagnosis of equine rotavirus infections in diagnostic laboratories.","Nemoto, Manabu; Imagawa, Hiroshi; Tsujimura, Koji; Yamanaka, Takashi; Kondo, Takashi; Matsumura, Tomio",The Journal of veterinary medical science,92,1

201329,201329,201329,FiY1: A reflective account of the foundation interim year 1 post,15.449246,7.9662266,2021,"BACKGROUND Seafarers are usually exposed to many stressors that are related to different duties on board. Several notable researchers have argued that stress is a transactional phenomenon between the individual and the environment that is largely dependent on the meaning given to the stimulus by the perceiver. One of the many causes of stress are poor communication skills. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The aim of the study was to xplain why respondents drop out of research. The project was originally supposed to take place over a period of two years and involve a minimum of 30 respondents per group (30 skippers and 30 seafarers) who would take part in the research for at least four weeks while on board, or during the skipper season. Activity was to be measured with the Polar A370 fitness tracker, worn as a wrist-watch or bracelet and used for 24-hour heart rate, bodily activity and sleep pattern tracking for every respondent. The other device used is TANITA MC780MA, which is a segmental body composition analyser. RESULTS We contacted overall 146 seafarers, of whom: 40 (27.4%) skippers, 43 (29.5%) deck officers and 63 (43.1%) engine officers. Participation was refused by 18 (12.3% of all contacted) individuals and 108 (74.0%) respondents dropped out during the research. Due to group dispersal and a low number of respondents who reached the end of the research, the project will have to be prolonged. CONCLUSION We believe that the reasons behind respondent dispersal can be found in their inability to recognize the state they are in and in poor communication skills, while at the same time being exposed to extreme and possibly precarious work conditions. This forms a closed loop that only continues to generate even higher stress levels. Further research is needed to look into this phenomenon.","Russo, Andrea; Mandić, Nikola; Slišković, Merica; Mulić, Rosanda",Psychiatria Danubina,92,1

Authors' reply",15.751725,8.026052,2020,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) has a tripartite negative-strand genome and causes a mosquito-borne disease among humans and livestock in sub-Saharan African and Arabian Peninsula countries. Phlebovirus L, M, and N mRNAs are synthesized from the virus-sense RNA segments, while NSs mRNA is transcribed from the anti-virus-sense S segment. The present study determined the 3' termini of all RVFV mRNAs. The 3' termini of N and NSs mRNAs were mapped within the S-segment intergenic region and were complementary to each other by 30 to 60 nucleotides. The termini of M and L mRNAs were mapped within 122 to 107 nucleotides and 16 to 41 nucleotides, respectively, from the 5' ends of their templates. Viral RNA elements that control phlebovirus transcriptional terminations are largely unknown. Our studies suggested the importance of a pentanucleotide sequence, CGUCG, for N, NSs, and M mRNA transcription terminations. Homopolymeric tracts of C sequences, which were located upstream of the pentanucleotide sequence, promoted N and M mRNA terminations. Likewise, the homopolymeric tracts of G sequences that are found upstream of the pentanucleotide sequence promoted NSs mRNA termination. The L-segment 5'-untranslated region (L-5' UTR) had neither the pentanucleotide sequence nor homopolymeric sequences, yet replacement of the S-segment intergenic region with the L-5' UTR exerted N mRNA termination in an infectious virus. The L-5' UTR contained two 13-nucleotide-long complete complementary sequences, and their sequence complementarities were important for L mRNA termination. A computer-mediated RNA secondary structure analysis further suggested that RNA secondary structures formed by the sections of the two 13-nucleotide-long sequences and by the sequence between them may have a role in L mRNA termination. Our data demonstrated that viral RNA elements that govern L mRNA termination differed from those that regulate mRNA terminations in the M and S segments.","Ikegami, Tetsuro; Won, Sungyong; Peters, C J; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,92,20

Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant occurring naturally in some foods and used to treat primary apnoea in premature babies. However high caffeine intake can be harmful, and caffeine is transmitted into breastmilk. AIM To systematically review the evidence on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption during breastfeeding on the breastfed child. METHOD A systematic search was conducted to October 2017 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. The British Library catalogue, which covers doctoral theses, was searched and PRISMA guidelines followed. Two reviewers screened for experimental, cohort, or case-control studies and performed independent quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The main reviewer performed data extraction, checked by the second reviewer. RESULTS Two cohort, two crossover studies, and one N-of-1 trial were included for narrative synthesis. One crossover and two cohort studies of small sample sizes directly investigated maternal caffeine consumption. No significant effects on 24-hour heart rate, 24-hour sleep time, or frequent night waking of the breastfed child were found. One study found a decreased rate of full breastfeeding at 6 months postpartum. Two studies indirectly investigated caffeine exposure. Maternal chocolate and coffee consumption was associated with increased infant colic, and severe to moderate exacerbation of infant atopic dermatitis. However, whether caffeine was the causal ingredient is questionable. The insufficient and inconsistent evidence available had quality issues impeding conclusions on the effects of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child. CONCLUSION Evidence for recommendations on caffeine intake for breastfeeding women is scant, of limited quality and inconclusive. Birth cohort studies investigating the potential positive and negative effects of various levels of maternal caffeine consumption on the breastfed child and breastfeeding mother could improve the knowledge base and allow evidence-based advice for breastfeeding mothers.

Cattle, a major reservoir host for the zoonotic pathogen Escherichia coli O157, are known to exhibit a high degree of heterogeneity in bacterial shedding densities. By relating bacterial count to infectiousness and fitting dynamic epidemiological models to prevalence data from a cross-sectional survey of cattle farms in Scotland, we identify a robust pattern: approximately 80% of the transmission arises from the 20% most infectious individuals. We examine potential control options under a range of assumptions about within- and between-host variability in infection dynamics. Our results show that the within-herd basic reproduction ratio, R(0), could be reduced to <1 with targeted measures aimed at preventing infection in the 5% of individuals with the highest overall infectiousness. Alternatively, interventions such as vaccination or the use of probiotics that aim to reduce bacterial carriage could produce dramatic reductions in R(0) by preventing carriage at concentrations corresponding to the top few percent of the observed range of counts. We conclude that a greater understanding of the cause of the heterogeneity in bacterial carriage could lead to highly efficient control measures to reduce the prevalence of E. coli O157.","Matthews, L; Low, J C; Gally, D L; Pearce, M C; Mellor, D J; Heesterbeek, J A P; Chase-Topping, M; Naylor, S W; Shaw, D J; Reid, S W J; Gunn, G J; Woolhouse, M E J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,92,16

Medicine, a profession of traditional principles and virtues, has faced unprecedented challenges in the light of scarce and unequal distribution of ventilators, testing, and personal protective equipment. Healthcare workers have been- and are increasingly likely to be- forced into situations that require difficult decision making under life-and-death conditions. Concepts of ""medical necessity"" and ""maximum benefit"" challenge healthcare systems that already struggle to manage unequal treatment and access to services, giving rise to moral distress and moral injury on the front lines. METHOD: This article focuses on moral injury in the context of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic. I review recent literature to highlight the psychological impact of many morally-injurious events that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the help of a clinical vignette, I point out how healthcare systems adopt many utilitarian policies in times of excessive healthcare burden and offer a viewpoint that many morally injurious events happen when physicians, traditionally practicing Kantian and virtue ethics, are forced to follow utilitarian policies of healthcare system. CONCLUSION: One form of moral injury may arise from inherent conflicts between individual deontological moral judgments and organizational utilitarian moral judgments. More research is needed to validate the philosophical viewpoint as well as to explore whether increased awareness and education of key principles within moral philosophy can better equip healthcare workers in situations when public health takes precedence over individual health.","Akram, Faisal",Ethics Med Public Health,92,24

METHODS: A survey was emailed to all ESNR members and associates as well as distributed via professional social media channels. The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home. While 81% felt safe at work during the crisis, fewer than 50% had sufficient personal protection equipment for the duration of the entire crisis. Mental wellbeing is an area of concern, with 61% feeling (much) worse than usual. Many followed online courses/congresses and considered these a viable alternative for the future.

METHODS: This descriptive study was carried out with the 185 oncology nurses between April and May 2020 in Turkey. Research data were collected through online survey using ""Nurse Information Form"" and ""Nurse Information Scale for COVID-19."" Multilinear regression analysis was used in determining the factors affecting oncology nurses' information regarding COVID-19. RESULTS: According to the data delivered from 185 oncology nurses, 57.7% of the participants had an undergraduate degree, 74.1% were working in adult oncology units, and 52.4% of them were working as clinical nurses, 48.1% of the nurses received education for COVID-19 (51.9% did not receive) and 70.3% followed and read the COVID-19 Guidelines published by the Ministry of Health (29.7% did not follow guidelines). Using multiple regression analysis, a model based on the relationship between the variables was created. In the model, the descriptive characteristics of the oncology nurses and their experiences of COVID-19 were found to explain 29.1% of their knowledge level for COVID-19. Nurses' education level, the presence of a relative diagnosed with COVID-19, and following the COVID-19 guidelines were found to statistically significantly affect the knowledge levels of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that hospital management and the Ministry of Health should provide more information for the oncology nurses to better control of cancer patients from the infectious disease.","Semerci, Remziye; Kudubes, Asli Akdeniz; Esref, Ferhan Çetin",Support. care cancer,92,9

Phenanthrene is one of the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in aquatic environments. In this study, different concentrations of phenanthrene were degraded by single-chamber air-cathode microbial fuel cells. The electrochemical parameter of microbial fuel cells and biofilm changes on the anode were observed. The results showed that the addition of phenanthrene reduced the power output of the microbial fuel cell which affected the process of microbial electricity generation. Meanwhile, microorganisms destroyed the original structure of phenanthrene through anaerobic metabolism, and achieved good average degradation of 94.9-98.4%. Observation of the anodic biofilm found that the microbes had tolerance to phenanthrene and the biofilm exhibited to be well-constructed. Bacterial community distribution showed a decrease in the relative abundance of Acidovorax and Aquamicrobium, whereas the relative content of the main electroactive organism, Geobacter, increased by a factor of three. The results show that it is feasible for microbial fuel cells to biodegrade phenanthrene, and provide some references for the changes of microbial community during degradation process.","Hua, Tao; Wang, Haonan; Li, Shengnan; Chen, Peng; Li, Fengxiang; Wang, Wei",,92,11

This is coordinated by insulin, which triggers kinase signalling cascades to modulate numerous metabolic proteins, leading to increased glucose uptake and anabolic processes like lipogenesis. Given recent evidence that glucose is dispensable for adipocyte respiration, we sought to test whether glucose is necessary for insulin-stimulated anabolism. Examining lipogenesis in cultured adipocytes, glucose was essential for insulin to stimulate the synthesis of fatty acids and glyceride-glycerol. Importantly, glucose was dispensable for lipogenesis in the absence of insulin, suggesting distinct carbon sources are used with or without insulin. Metabolic tracing studies revealed glucose was required for insulin to stimulate pathways providing carbon substrate, NADPH, and glycerol 3'-phosphate for lipid synthesis and storage. Glucose also displaced leucine as a lipogenic substrate and was necessary to suppress fatty acid oxidation. Together, glucose provided substrates and metabolic control for insulin to promote lipogenesis in adipocytes. This contrasted with the suppression of lipolysis by insulin signalling, which occurred independently of glucose. Given previous observations that signal transduction acts primarily before glucose uptake in adipocytes, these data are consistent with a model whereby insulin initially utilises protein phosphorylation to stimulate lipid anabolism, which is sustained by subsequent glucose metabolism. Consequently, lipid abundance was sensitive to glucose availability, both during adipogenesis and in Drosophila flies in vivo. Together, these data highlight the importance of glucose metabolism to support insulin action, providing a complementary regulatory mechanism to signal transduction to stimulate adipose anabolism.","Krycer, James R; Quek, Lake-Ee; Francis, Deanne; Zadoorian, Armella; Weiss, Fiona C; Cooke, Kristen C; Nelson, Marin E; Diaz-Vegas, Alexis; Humphrey, Sean J; Scalzo, Richard; Hirayama, Akiyoshi; Ikeda, Satsuki; Shoji, Futaba; Suzuki, Kumi; Huynh, Kevin; Giles, Corey; Varney, Bianca; Nagarajan, Shilpa R; Hoy, Andrew J; Soga, Tomoyoshi; Meikle, Peter J; Cooney, Gregory J; Fazakerley, Daniel J; James, David E",J. biol. chem,92,20

A 33-year-old woman presented to the hospital with a one-week history of cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia, with no other significant past medical history. She tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently, her respiratory function rapidly deteriorated, necessitating endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. She had severe hypoxic respiratory failure requiring a protracted period on the mechanical ventilator with different ventilation strategies and multiple cycles of prone positioning. During her proning, after two weeks on the intensive care unit, she developed tension pneumothorax that required bilateral intercostal chest drains (ICD) to stabilise her. After 24 days, she had a percutaneous tracheostomy and began her respiratory wean; however, this was limited due to the ongoing infection. Thorax CT demonstrated a left-sided pneumothorax, with bilateral pneumatoceles and a sizeable, complex hydropneumothorax. Despite the insertion of ICDs, the hydropneumothorax persisted over months and initially progressed in size on serial scans needing multiple ICDs. She was too ill for surgical interventions initially, opting for conservative management. After 60 days, she successfully underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for a washout and placement of further ICDs. She was successfully decannulated after 109 days on the intensive care unit and was discharged to a rehabilitation unit after 116 days of being an inpatient, with her last thorax CT showing some residual pneumatoceles but significant improvement. Late changes may mean patients recovering from the COVID-19 infection are at increased risk of pneumothoracies. Clinicians need to be alert to this, especially as bullous rupture may not present as a classical pneumothorax.","Rehnberg, Lucas; Chambers, Robert; Lam, Selina; Chamberlain, Martin; Dushianthan, Ahilanandan",Case Rep Crit Care,92,33

One member of the Elovls family, Elovl4, has been regarded as a critical enzyme involved in the biosynthesis pathway of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). To explore the role of Elovl4 in PUFA synthesis in Trachinotus ovatus, the cDNA of the Elovl4b gene is cloned from T. ovatus (ToElovl4b). The ORF of ToElovl4b was 918 bp and encoded 305 amino acid (aa) protein sequences. Sequence alignment showed that the deduced amino acids contained significant structural features of the Elovl4 family, such as a histidine box motif (HXXHH), multiple transmembrane domains and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis revealed that ToElovl4b was highly conserved with that of Rachycentron canadum Elovl4b. Moreover, heterologous expression in yeast demonstrated that ToElovl4b could efficiently elongate 18:2n-6, 18:3n-6 and 20:5n-3 FAs up to 20:2n-6, 20:3n-6 and 22:5n-3, respectively. Furthermore, the tissue expression profile indicated that mRNA expression of ToElovl4b was higher in the gonads and brain than in other tissues. Additionally, nutritional regulation suggested the highest mRNA levels of ToElovl4b in liver and brain were under feeding with 1:1 FO-SO (fish oil, FO; soybean oil, SO) and 1:1 FO-CO (corn oil, CO)), respectively. These new insights were useful for understanding the molecular basis and regulation of LC-PUFA biosynthesis in fish.","Zhu, Ke-Cheng; Song, Ling; Liu, Bao-Suo; Guo, Hua-Yang; Zhang, Nan; Guo, Liang; Jiang, Shi-Gui; Zhang, Dian-Chang",Gene,92,32

The network of SARS-CoV-2 regulatory mechanisms was used to study potential engagement of oncogenes, tumor suppressors, other regulators of tumorigenesis and clinical markers used in the management of cancer patients. Our network analysis confirms links between COVID-19 and tumorigenesis that were predicted in epidemiological reports. The COVID-19 network shows the involvement of tumorigenesis regulators and clinical markers. Regulators of cell proliferation, death, migration, and the immune system were retrieved. Examples are pathways initiated by EGF, VEGF, TGFß and FGF. The SARS-CoV-2 network engages markers for diagnosis, prognosis and selection of treatment. Intersection with cancer diagnostic signatures supports a potential impact of the virus on tumorigenesis. Clinical observations show the diversity of symptoms correlating with biological processes and types of cells engaged by the virus, e.g. epithelial, endothelial, smooth muscle, glial and immune system cells. Our results describe an extensive engagement of cancer-relevant mechanisms and clinical markers by COVID-19.

In this work, superstructured macroporous carbon rods composed of defective graphitic nanosheets are synthesized by direct carbonization of crystalline poly tannic acid (PTA) rods as precursors. During carbonization, PTA rods with a highly ordered lamellar structure induce a spatially confined two-step localized contraction that takes place in different dimensions and directions in each step.

METHODS: From January 21 to February 18, 2020, all of the patients who were suspected of novel coronavirus infection and verified by RT-PCR tests were retrospectively enrolled in our study. All of the patients underwent serial RT-PCR tests and serial CT imaging. The temporal relationship between the serial RT-PCR results (negative conversion to positive, positive to negative) and serial CT imaging was investigated, and serial CT changes were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 155 patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. Chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than RT-PCR test (p = 0.000). The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (p = 0.000). Three stages were identified from the onset of the initial symptoms: stage 1 (0-3 days), stage 2 (4-7 days), and stage 3 (8-14 days and later). Ground glass opacity (GGO) was predominant in stage 1, then consolidation and crazy paving signs were dramatically increased in stage 2. In stage 3, fibrotic lesions were rapidly increased. There were significant differences in the main CT features (p = 0.000), number of lobes involved (p = 0.001), and lesion distribution (p = 0.000) among the different stages. CONCLUSION: Chest CT detected COVID-19 pneumonia earlier than the RT-PCR results and can be used to monitor disease course. Combining imaging features with epidemiology history and clinical information could facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. KEY POINTS: â¢ The chest CT detection time of COVID-19 pneumonia was 2.61 days earlier than that of an initial RT-PCR positive result (t = - 7.31, p = 0.000). â¢ The lung CT improvement time was significantly shorter than that of RT-PCR conversion to negative (t = - 4.72, p = 0.000). â¢ At the early stage (0-3 days), the CT features of COVID-19 were predominantly GGO and small-vessel thickening; at stage 2 (4-7 days), GGO evolved to consolidation and crazy paving signs. At stage 3 (8-14 days and later), fibrotic lesions significantly increased, accompanied by consolidation, GGO, and crazy paving signs.","Gu, Jinfeng; Yang, Li; Li, Tao; Liu, Ye; Zhang, Jing; Ning, Kejia; Su, Dajian",Eur. radiol,92,9

The study uses the retrospective analysis of space-time scan statistic to detect the clusters of COVID-19 in mainland China with a different maximum clustering radius at the family-level based on case dates of onset. The results show that the detected clusters vary with the clustering radius. Forty-three space-time clusters were detected with a maximum clustering radius of 100 km and 88 clusters with a maximum clustering radius of 10 km from 2 December 2019 to 20 June 2020. Using a smaller clustering radius may identify finer clusters. Hubei has the most clusters regardless of scale. In addition, most of the clusters were generated in February. That indicates China's COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control strategy is effective, and they have successfully prevented the virus from spreading from Hubei to other provinces over time. Well-developed provinces or cities, which have larger populations and developed transportation networks, are more likely to generate space-time clusters. The analysis based on the data of cases from onset may detect the start times of clusters seven days earlier than similar research based on diagnosis dates. Our analysis of space-time clustering based on the data of cases on the family-level can be reproduced in other countries that are still seriously affected by the epidemic such as the USA, India, and Brazil, thus providing them with more precise signals of clustering.","Xu, Min; Cao, Chunxiang; Zhang, Xin; Lin, Hui; Yao, Zhong; Zhong, Shaobo; Huang, Zhibin; Shea Duerler, Robert",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),92,20

Initially, COVID-19 is a disease that attacks the respiratory tract, but now the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are various, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Emergency surgeries such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for AIS must be performed without any delay even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce morbidity and mortality. Besides the focus on patient’s health, the safety of healthcare workers must also be considered. The aim of the study was to evaluate and summarize the scientific literature systematically to explore MT for AIS in the COVID-19 pandemic.Data synthesisThe independent reviewers searched the literature through 12 electronic databases, searching for articles fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria.

We then explore the time-varying consistency of the relationships between cryptocurrencies' size and their returns and volatility. There, we demonstrate that there is greater consistency between size and volatility than size and returns. Finally, we study the spread of volatility behaviours across the market changing with time by examining the structure of Wasserstein distances between probability density functions of rolling volatility.

METHODS: A multi-site cross-sectional design was conducted from 1st through 30th of August 2020 at public health facilities of the study area. Adult outpatients with T2DM and hypertension visiting hospitals and health centers were included in the study. A proportion to size allocation method was used to determine the required sample size per facility. Data was collected using the 8-item Morisky medication adherence scale. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were used to analyze data. A 95% confidence interval and p&#8804;0.05 statistical significance was considered to determine factors associated with poor medication adherence. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients were included in the present study. About 57% of the patients reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed negative impacts on either of their follow-up visits, availability of medications, or affordability of prices. And, 21% have reported that they have been affected in all aspects. The overall magnitude of poor medication adherence was 72%. Patients with extreme poverty were more likely to have good medication adherence (AOR: 0.59; 95%C.I: 0.36-0.97), whereas attendance to a health center (AOR: 1.71; 95%C.I: 1.02-2.85), presence of comorbidity (AOR: 2.05; 95%C.I: 1.13-3.71), and current substance use history (AOR: 11.57; 95%C.I: 1.52-88.05) predicted high odds of poor adherence. CONCLUSION: Over a three-fourth of the patients, in the study setting, have poor adherence to their anti-diabetic and antihypertensive medications.

VITT resembles heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT) in that it is associated with platelet-activating antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4)4; however, patients with VITT develop thrombocytopaenia and thrombosis without exposure to heparin. Here we sought to determine the binding site on PF4 of antibodies from patients with VITT. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis5, we found that the binding of anti-PF4 antibodies from patients with VITT (n = 5) was restricted to eight surface amino acids on PF4, all of which were located within the heparin-binding site, and that the binding was inhibited by heparin. By contrast, antibodies from patients with HIT (n = 10) bound to amino acids that corresponded to two different sites on PF4. Biolayer interferometry experiments also revealed that VITT anti-PF4 antibodies had a stronger binding response to PF4 and PF4-heparin complexes than did HIT anti-PF4 antibodies, albeit with similar dissociation rates. Our data indicate that VITT antibodies can mimic the effect of heparin by binding to a similar site on PF4; this allows PF4 tetramers to cluster and form immune complexes, which in turn causes FcÎ³ receptor IIa (FcÎ³RIIa; also known as CD32a)-dependent platelet activation. These results provide an explanation for VITT-antibody-induced platelet activation that could contribute to thrombosis.","Huynh, Angela; Kelton, John G; Arnold, Donald M; Daka, Mercy; Nazy, Ishac",Nature (Lond.),92,16

Carbon dioxide removal is possible with substantially less extracorporeal blood flow than needed for oxygenation. Techniques for extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal include (1) pumpless arterio-venous circuits, (2) low-flow venovenous circuits based on the technology of continuous renal replacement therapy, and (3) venovenous circuits based on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation technology. INDICATIONS: Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has been shown to enable more protective ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, even beyond the so-called ""protective"" level. Although experimental data suggest a benefit on ventilator induced lung injury, no hard clinical evidence with respect to improved outcome exists. In addition, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is a tool to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease failing non-invasive ventilation. This concept has been shown to be effective in 56-90% of patients. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal has also been used in ventilated patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure to correct acidosis, unload respiratory muscle burden, and facilitate weaning. In patients suffering from terminal fibrosis awaiting lung transplantation, extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal is able to correct acidosis and enable spontaneous breathing during bridging. Keeping these patients awake, ambulatory, and breathing spontaneously is associated with favorable outcome. COMPLICATIONS: Complications of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal are mostly associated with vascular access and deranged hemostasis leading to bleeding.

Kidney failure remains independently associated with increased cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes, underlining the specific adverse influence of kidney disease on cardiovascular risk. Vascular injury develops in asymptomatic patients with kidney failure early in the course of the disease. Defective arterial vasodilation, increased arterial stiffness, increased intima-media thickness, and vascular calcification develop in patients with kidney disease long before clinical evidence of cardiovascular events. Even mildly reduced kidney function is associated with subclinical vascular disease which is a predictor of worse cardiovascular outcome in patients with kidney failure, similarly to the general population and patients with diabetes. Insulin resistance is a typical feature of kidney disease that occurs during the entire span of the disorder, from mild dysfunction to the dialysis phase. Insulin resistance (or its clinical manifestations, the metabolic syndrome or its components) is independently associated with subclinical vascular injury in patients with kidney disease. Additionally, the risk for developing incident kidney disease and for rapid decline of kidney function is higher in patients with insulin resistance. Animal protein consumption increases dietary acid load and intensifies insulin resistance. Consistently, meat intake promotes diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney failure while consumption of plant-based food is protective against the development of vascular disease. Insulin resistance is a robust cardiovascular risk factor in the general population, patients with diabetes and patients with kidney disease.","Adeva-Andany, María M; Fernández-Fernández, Carlos; Adeva-Contreras, Lucía; Carneiro-Freire, Natalia; Domínguez-Montero, Alberto; Mouriño-Bayolo, David",Current cardiology reviews (Online),92,16

Indeed, it has been suggested that the death rate in developing countries may be far lower than in high-income countries--an outcome that would be starkly different from the typical pattern for many other infectious diseases. MethodsWe systematically reviewed the literature to identify all serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples of specimens collected by early 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analyzed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible. ResultsSeroprevalence in many developing country locations was markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity. In most locations, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age-groups. Age-specific IFRs were 1.3-2.5x higher than in high-income countries. The median value of population IFR was 0.5% among developing countries with satisfactory death reporting as of 2016, compared to a median of 0.05% for other developing countries. ConclusionThe burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare. These results underscore the critical need to accelerate the provision of vaccine doses to vulnerable populations in developing countries. Key Points- Age-specific prevalence and infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 for developing countries has not been well assessed. - Seroprevalence in developing countries (as measured by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2) is markedly higher than in high-income countries but still far short of herd immunity. - Seroprevalence among older adults is broadly similar to that of younger age-groups. - Age-specific IFRs in developing countries are roughly twice those of high-income countries. - Population IFR in developing countries with satisfactory death reporting (based on UN/WHO data as of 2016) is ten times higher than in other developing countries. - These results underscore the urgency of disseminating vaccines to vulnerable people in developing countries.","Levin, Andrew T; Owusu-Boaitey, Nana; Pugh, Sierra; Fosdick, Bailey K; Zwi, Anthony B.; Malani, Anup; Soman, Satej; Besançon, Lonni; Kashnitsky, Ilya; Ganesh, Sachin; McLaughlin, Aloysius; Song, Gayeong; Uhm, Rine; Meyerowitz-Katz, Gideon",,92,21

To contain it, preventive measures including social distancing, economic shutdown, and school closures were introduced, carrying the risk of mental health burden in adults and children. Although the knowledge base regarding children's response to trauma and adverse events in general has broadened, descriptions of their mental health during epidemics remain scarce. In particular, the role of family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health are poorly understood. METHODS: We assessed the correlates of children's emotional difficulties and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention during the COVID-19 lockdown in a French community-based sample. Data came from 432 community-based parents (27-46 years, TEMPO cohort) and their children (mean age 6.8 ± 4.1) interviewed online. Children's symptoms of emotional difficulties and hyperactivity/inattention were assessed using the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire during the 5th week of home confinement. Family socioeconomic characteristics and parental mental health and substance use were assessed weekly during the first 5 weeks of home confinement. Data were analyzed using logistic regression models. RESULTS: 7.1% of children presented symptoms of emotional difficulties and 24.7% symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention. Family financial difficulties and parental symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as children's sleeping difficulties and screen time, were associated with the presence of psychological difficulties. CONCLUSION: Children's emotional and behavioural difficulties are associated with parental mental health and socioeconomic difficulties. In the unprecedented situation of the COVID-19 epidemic, parents and professionals involved in caring for children should pay special attention to their mental health needs.","Moulin, Flore; El-Aarbaoui, Tarik; Bustamante, Joel José Herranz; Héron, Mégane; Mary-Krause, Murielle; Rouquette, Alexandra; Galéra, Cédric; Melchior, Maria",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,92,21

In airway chips infected with influenza A, the co-administration of nafamostat with oseltamivir doubled the treatment-time window for oseltamivir. In chips infected with pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinically relevant doses of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine inhibited infection but clinical doses of hydroxychloroquine and other antiviral drugs that inhibit the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines under static conditions did not. We also show that amodiaquine showed substantial prophylactic and therapeutic activities in hamsters challenged with native SARS-CoV-2.

These include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, fibrosis, etc. Timely diagnosis of lung disease is essential. Many image processing and machine learning models have been developed for this purpose. Different forms of existing deep learning techniques including convolutional neural network (CNN), vanilla neural network, visual geometry group based neural network (VGG), and capsule network are applied for lung disease prediction. The basic CNN has poor performance for rotated, tilted, or other abnormal image orientation. Therefore, we propose a new hybrid deep learning framework by combining VGG, data augmentation and spatial transformer network (STN) with CNN. This new hybrid method is termed here as VGG Data STN with CNN (VDSNet). As implementation tools, Jupyter Notebook, Tensorflow, and Keras are used. The new model is applied to NIH chest X-ray image dataset collected from Kaggle repository. Full and sample versions of the dataset are considered. For both full and sample datasets, VDSNet outperforms existing methods in terms of a number of metrics including precision, recall, F0.5 score and validation accuracy. For the case of full dataset, VDSNet exhibits a validation accuracy of 73%, while vanilla gray, vanilla RGB, hybrid CNN and VGG, and modified capsule network have accuracy values of 67.8%, 69%, 69.5% and 63.8%, respectively. When sample dataset rather than full dataset is used, VDSNet requires much lower training time at the expense of a slightly lower validation accuracy. Hence, the proposed VDSNet framework will simplify the detection of lung disease for experts as well as for doctors.","Bharati, Subrato; Podder, Prajoy; Mondal, M. Rubaiyat Hossain",Inform. Med.

Hepatic dysfunction and the slight elevation of liver enzymes have been reported in cases of COVID-19 infection. Transient hyperphosphatasemia is a benign condition characterized by the elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase and the return to normal levels within weeks or months of first observation. We reported the first infant case of severe hyperphosphatasemia because of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in a 9-month-old child admitted to the Pediatric Covid-19 Unit of Amiens University Hospital. Given the hepatic tropism and COVID-19-related hyperinflammatory reactions, our case suggests that, an isolated severe hyperphosphatasemia in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection should increase the possibility of transient hyperphosphatasemia, even if is also demonstrated a classic natural history of the transient hyperphosphatasemia during viral infection, especially in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tchidjou, Hyppolite Kuekou; Caron, Fiorella; Ferec, Adeline; Braun, Karine; Hery, Loic; Castelain, Sandrine; Romeo, Bernard",Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,92,27

In addition to a hypercoagulable state, D-dimer is also a biomarker of inflammation. We investigated the relationship between D-dimer level and chest computed tomography (CT) severity score, which could reflect the severity of inflammation in SARS-COV-2 pneumonia patients. We retrospectively enrolled 86 consecutive SARS-COV-2 pneumonia patients. CT severity scores were computed to quantify the overall lung involvement. The D-dimer level among CT score tertiles and the association of the D-dimer level with CT score were analyzed. Our results showed that the median D-dimer level was 0.70 mg/L (IQR 0.35-1.76). 42 patients (48.8%) had D-dimer levels above the median level. The D-dimer levels were significantly different across CT score tertiles (0.37 mg/l [IQR 0.31-0.87], 0.66 mg/l [IQR 0.39-1.43], 1.83 mg/l [IQR 0.85-4.41], P < 0.001). The natural logarithm of the D-dimer level was significantly associated with the CT score (rs = 0.586, P < 0.001). In conclusion, the D-dimer level may be associated with the severity of inflammation of SARS-COV-2 pneumonia prior to coagulopathy/thrombosis. This could be an additional explanation for the mechanism of the relationship between elevated D-dimer level and higher mortality.","Wang, Lan; Yang, Ling; Bai, Lang; Huang, Zhixin; Peng, Yong",Sci Rep,92,16

Setting The First Hospital of Changsha, First People's Hospital of Huaihua, and the Central Hospital of Loudi, Hunan province, China. Methods This was a retrospective multi-center case-series analysis. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis hospitalized at the study centers from January 17 to February 10, 2020, were included. The following data were obtained from electronic medical records: demographics, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings, computer tomography scans, and treatment measures. Main outcome measure Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatments. Results A total of 54 patients were included (51 had the common-type COVID-19, three had the severe-type), the median age was 41, and 52% of them were men. The median time from the first symptoms to hospital admission was seven days. Among patients with the common-type COVID-19, the median length of stay was nine days, and 21 days among patients with severe COVID-19. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (74.5%), cough (56.9%), and fatigue (43.1%) among patients in the common-type group. Fourteen patients (37.8%) had a reduced WBC count, 23 (62.2%) had reduced eosinophil ratio, and 21 (56.76%) had decreased eosinophil count. The most common patterns on chest-computed tomography were ground-glass opacity (52.2%) and patchy bilateral shadowing (73.9%). Pharmacotherapy included recombinant human interferon &#945;2b, lopinavir/ritonavir, novaferon, antibiotics, systematic corticosteroids and traditional Chinese medicine prescription. The outcome of treatment indicated that in patients with the common-type COVID-19, interferon-&#945;2b, but not novaferon, had some benefits, antibiotics treatment was not needed, and corticosteroids should be used cautiously. Conclusion As of February 10, 2020, the symptoms of COVID-19 patients in Hunan province were relatively mild comparing to patients in Wuhan, the epicenter.

Para isso, foram realizadas projeções de investimentos e analisadas as condições de operacionalização do programa no momento atual. Foi adotada uma metodologia quanti-quali de análise. Na abordagem quantitativa, foram construídos cenários com projeções de investimentos na política pública; na qualitativa, realizaram-se entrevistas não estruturadas com atores-chave na execução do programa. Os resultados revelaram que o aumento de recursos investidos no programa em um cenário otimizado pode proporcionar ampla capilarização dos benefícios. Identificou-se que o PAA é estratégico para o enfrentamento aos efeitos negativos da COVID-19 porque escoa os produtos da agricultura familiar, o que promove estruturação de cadeias produtivas, acesso a novos mercados e indução ao dinamismo econômico, além de atuar no combate à fome e à miséria de famílias que vivem em situação de vulnerabilidade. O programa não só apresenta condições de operacionalização durante a pandemia da COVID-19, como tem se adaptado à realidade atual, seguindo protocolos estabelecidos pelas autoridades de saúde. Concluiu-se que o PAA pode minimizar as crises sanitária e econômica, principalmente para a população mais vulnerável, apresentando ações que vão ao encontro das demandas da sociedade civil organizada e de recomendações de organismos nacionais e internacionais especializados, visando à redução dos impactos econômicos e sociais da pandemia causada pelo novo coronavírus.","Sambuichi, Regina Helena Rosa; Almeida, Ana Flávia Cordeiro Souza de; Perin, Gabriela; Spínola, Paulo Asafe Campos; Pella, Antônio Fernando Costa",Rev. adm. pública (Online),92,24

Among the most accessible health professionals, pharmacists have responsibilities to individual patients and to public health, and this has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacists in high-volume community settings provide a growing number of clinical services (i.e., immunizations and point-of-care testing), but according to job satisfaction and workplace survey data, demands related to filling prescriptions, insufficient staffing, and working conditions are often not optimal for these enhanced responsibilities and lead to job dissatisfaction. Professional codes of ethics require a high level of practice that is currently difficult to maintain due to a number of related barriers. In this paper, we summarize recent changes to the scope of practice of pharmacists, cite ethical responsibilities from the American Pharmacists Association Code of Ethics, review data and comments from workplace surveys, and make a call for change. Corporate managers, state boards of pharmacy, and professional organizations have a shared responsibility to work with community pharmacists in all settings to find solutions that ensure optimal and ethical patient care. Attention to these areas will enhance patient care and increase job satisfaction.","Owens, C. T.; Baergen, R.",Pharmacy : A Journal Of Pharmacy Education And Practice,92,1

METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched on April 28, 2020, to extract published articles that reported the outcomes of COVID-19 patients. The search terms were ""coronavirus"" and ""clinical characteristics"". ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, ARDS, Pneumonia, death was considered serious events. The comorbidities assessed in the study were Hypertension (HTN), Diabetes mellitus (DM), Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and Chronic Kidney disease (CKD). Subsequently, comparisons between comorbidity patient group and the non-comorbidity patient groups, in terms of serious events were made using the pooled estimates of odd's ratio (OR) RESULTS: We identified 688 published results and 16 studies with 3994 patients were included in the systematic review. Serious events were seen in 526(13.16%) patients. Presence of hypertension with OR 2.95, diabetes mellitus with OR 3.07, Cardio vascular disease with OR 4.58, COPD with OR 6.66 and Chronic kidney disease with OR 5.32 had significant association in patients with COVID 19 on having serious events. Presence of diabetes mellitus (OR 2.78)) had a significant impact on death in COVID 19 patients with a p-value 0.004. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of medical comorbidities in COVID-19 leads to higher risk of developing serious events i.e. ICU admission, mechanical intubation and mortality. The presence of Diabetes mellitus has a significant impact on mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.","Nandy, Kunal; Salunke, Abhijeet; Pathak, Subodh Kumar; Pandey, Apurva; Doctor, Chinmay; Puj, Ketul; Sharma, Mohit; Jain, Abhishek; Warikoo, Vikas",Diabetes Metab Syndr,92,16

As a result, there is a need for data-driven approaches to pinpoint the unique constellation of clinical and social determinants of health (SDOH) risk factors that give rise to poor patient outcomes following infection in US communities. We combined county-level COVID-19 testing data, COVID-19 vaccination rates, and SDOH information in Tennessee. Between February-May 2021, we trained machine learning models on a semi-monthly basis using these datasets to predict COVID-19 incidence in Tennessee counties. We then analyzed SDOH data features at each time point to rank the impact of each feature on model performance. Our results indicate that COVID-19 vaccination rates play a crucial role in determining future COVID-19 disease risk. Beginning in mid-March 2021, higher vaccination rates significantly correlated with lower COVID-19 case growth predictions. Further, as the relative importance of COVID-19 vaccination data features grew, demographic SDOH features such as age, race, and ethnicity decreased while the impact of socioeconomic and environmental factors, including access to healthcare and transportation, increased. Incorporating a data framework to track the evolving patterns of community-level SDOH risk factors could provide policymakers with additional data resources to improve health equity and resilience to future public health emergencies.","Wylezinski, Lukasz S; Harris, Coleman R; Heiser, Cody N; Gray, Jamieson D; Spurlock, Charles F",,92,2

Research linking medical spending to variation in neighborhood resources is critical to building the case for increased funding for social conditions. However, few studies link neighborhood factors to medical spending. This study assesses the relationship between neighborhood social and environmental resources and medical spending across the spending distribution. METHODS: Individual-level health outcomes were drawn from a sample of Medicaid enrollees living in Baltimore, Maryland during 2016. A multidimensional index of neighborhood social and environmental resources was created and stratified by tertile (high, medium, and low). Differences were examined in individual-level medical spending associated with living in high-, medium-, or low-resource neighborhoods in unadjusted and adjusted 2-part models and quantile regression models. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS: Enrollees who live in neighborhoods with low social and environmental resources incur significantly higher spending at the mean and across the distribution of medical spending even after controlling for age, race, sex, and morbidity than those who live in neighborhoods with high social and environmental resources. On average, this spending difference between individuals in low- and those in high-resource neighborhoods is estimated to be $523.60 per person per year. CONCLUSIONS: Living in neighborhoods with low (versus those with high) resources is associated with higher individual-level medical spending across the distribution of medical spending. Findings suggest potential benefits from efforts to address the social and environmental context of neighborhoods in addition to the traditional orientation to addressing individual behavior and risk.","Sherry, Melissa K; Bishai, David M; Padula, William V; Weiner, Jonathan P; Szanton, Sarah L; Wolff, Jennifer L",Am. j. prev. med,92,21

The clinical characteristics and spectrum are still unknown. Facing this unknown and emerging pathogen, we aimed to collect current evidence about COVID-19 in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic review in PubMed and Embase to find relevant case series. Because some reports were published in Chinese journals, the journals and publications of the Chinese Medical Association related to COVID-19 were completely reviewed. A random effects model was used to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: Nine case series were included. In the pooled data, most of patients (75%) had a household contact history. The disease severity was mainly mild to moderate (98%). Only 2 children (2%) received intensive care. Fever occurred in 59% of the patients, while cough in 46%. Gastrointestinal symptoms (12%) were uncommon. There are 26% children are asymptomatic. The most common radiographic finding was ground glass opacities (48%). Currently, there is no evidence of vertical transmission to neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Compared with the most relevant virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe disease. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has distinct features in children. The disease severity is mild.

Therefore, we aimed to analyze the changes in clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients over time. METHODS: We recruited 896 patients who were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between 30th January 2020 and 16st March 2020. We conducted a retrospective study collecting clinical characteristics, radiologic and laboratory findings, treatments administered, and clinical outcomes in the patients. The data collected were compared between patients with onset of illness in January 2020 and patients with onset of illness in February 2020, in Wuhan, China. Categorical data and non-normally distributed continuous data were examined by the &#967;2 test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test respectively, and the Kaplan-Meier plot was used to analyze survival data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. RESULTS: A total of 896 patients were enrolled; the median age was 60 (range, 47-69) years, 685 (76.5%) were categorized into group A (patients with onset of illness in January 2020), and 211 (23.5%) were categorized into group B (patients with onset of illness in February 2020). Compared with group B, group A had a higher incidence of fever (P<0.001), and a lower rate of asymptomatic individuals (P<0.001). Group A patients had a higher incidence of neutrophilia (P=0.043), an elevated D-dimer (P<0.001), and an increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P=0.002), but a lower incidence of a normal computed tomography (CT) scan (P=0.001). CD3 cell counts (P=0.015) and CD4 cell counts (P=0.04) were significantly reduced in group A patients. Critically ill patients were less frequent (P=0.005) and patients with milder disease were more common (P=0.001) in group B. The fatality rate was significantly less in group B patients (P=0.028). Multivariate regression indicated that older age (odds ratio 1.086, 95% CI: 1.061-1.111, per year increase; P<0.001) increased the risk of in-hospital death. Female sex (odds ratio 0.523, 95% CI: 0.316-0.865; P=0.012) and being in group B (odds ratio 0.423, 95% CI: 0.212-0.844; P=0.015) significantly decreased the risk of in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: The condition of patients with onset of illness in January was more serious than that of patients with onset of illness in February 2020. The time of onset of illness was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death comparing January and February 2020. Changing pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and improved healthcare may have contributed to the results, however, more basic research is required to support this hypothesis.","Yang, Ruhao; Wei, Jie; Hu, Weihua; Xiong, Jun; Liu, Menglin; Hu, Ke",Ann Palliat Med,92,29

Appropriate planning is therefore important to continue with cancer treatment services and simultaneously avoiding the risk of infection to the patients and healthcare staff and not allowing community transmission of viral infection. Methods and Results: We modified our practice measures in cancer patients receiving systemic therapy. Tele-consultations and use of electronic means, providing the best supportive care at or near home, and involvement of local/ family physicians were widely practiced. We minimised in-patient admissions, however, day-care chemotherapies were continued to provide optimum oncology services.

While pharmacy graduate programs across the U.S. have reported adjustments due to the pandemic, there is currently no data on the PhGS' wellness, and the impact on and extent to which offered supports and guidance has met PhGS needs. OBJECTIVE: This study's objectives were 1) to explore PhGS' perspectives on their challenges and the impact of these challenges on their wellness, and 2) to identify PhGS' suggestions for pharmacy graduate programs to improve guidance and support offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study conducted semi-structured interviews based on the Objective, Reflective, Interpretative, Decisional (ORID) methodology. Pharmacy students working on completing a PhD in programs across the United States were invited to participate. All interviews were conducted using the Zoom platform between May and June 2020. Digital audio recordings were auto transcribed using the Trint platform. Thematic analysis was conducted using the six-dimensional model of wellness developed by Hettler as a guide, while open coding of the PhGS' suggestions was conducted inductively. RESULTS: Thirteen PhGS across six universities in the U.S. were interviewed. During the pandemic, all six dimensions of the Wellness model were found to be challenged for PhGS. PhGS' challenges differed based on their laboratory-based vs. non-laboratory-based research settings. International PhGS reported differing challenges from domestic PhGS. PhGS also provided 18 practical suggestions for improving the teaching process and facilitating student's academic growth in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, graduate programs should continue developing a robust and tailored system to encourage and maintain mentorship programs to facilitate graduate students' successful path through their doctoral studies. Moreover, the suggestions offered by the PhGS participants in this study, when appropriately implemented, can also position graduate program success post-pandemic.","Imeri, Hyllore; Jadhav, Saumil; Barnard, Marie; Rosenthal, Meagen",Res. soc. adm. pharm,92,16

Diante disso, o curso de Medicina da Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) implantou em 2015 um programa de mentoria que se propõe a contribuir para o desenvolvimento profissional e pessoal do estudante, adotando-se como um diferencial a realização de atividades integrativas. Método: Participam desse programa 25 professores do curso de Medicina da UFRN, que atuam como mentores, 25 monitores ou mentores juniores, que têm o papel de intermediar a comunicação entre os participantes, como também auxiliar no planejamento e desenvolvimento das atividades, e 317 alunos de diversos períodos do curso médico. Além dos encontros mensais regulares, no final de cada semestre, os mentores e mentores juniores organizam a atividade integrativa que agrega todos os discentes e docentes do programa e possibilitam a construção de uma relação mais próxima entre mentores e mentorandos, bem como contribuem para a estruturação de um ambiente universitário mais acolhedor e equânime. Resultado: Em avaliação on-line sobre o programa, os alunos destacaram a ""troca de experiências, de sugestões e a ajuda no curso sobre diversos temas"" e ""adquirir experiência de um profissional experiente"" como principais motivações para participar da atividade. Contudo, enfatizaram a falta de tempo para conciliar os encontros com as demais atividades acadêmicas como principal obstáculo para participar do programa. Com a pandemia da Covid-19, mantiveram-se as atividades do programa no modelo on-line, e obteve-se importante engajamento dos participantes, o que representou uma estratégia de enfrentamento do isolamento social e de promoção da saúde mental para os estudantes. Conclusão: Observamos, a partir do engajamento e dos feedbacks recebidos, que o programa, apesar de apresentar alguns desafios, vem se configurando como uma iniciativa capaz de transformar as relações interpessoais entre discentes e mentores, ao promover a integração entre alunos dos diferentes períodos do curso e criar um ambiente favorável ao diálogo e à construção do conhecimento.","Moreira, Simone da Nóbrega Tomaz; Albuquerque, Iana Ciara Santos de; Pinto Junior, Francisco Edilson Leite; Gomes, Alexandre Henrique Bezerra",Rev. bras. educ. méd,92,32

243613,243613,243613,Observations from the COVID-19 Pandemic,15.62761,8.1729,2020,"BACKGROUND: Full level 1 personal protective equipment (PPE) is used in various domains and contexts. Prior research has shown influences of such equipment on performance, comfort, and contamination levels. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced a pervasive requirement of PPE, with little preparation, rushed deployment, inadequate time for training, and massive use by personnel who are inexperienced or not qualified in its effective use. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the key human factors (physical and ergonomic, perceptual and cognitive) that influence the use of level 1 PPE when attending to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: The research approach consisted of a short survey disseminated to health care professionals in two countries, Israel and Portugal, with similar demographics and health care systems. The survey included 10 items with a 5-point Likert scale regarding the key human factors involved in level 1 PPE, as identified in prior research. RESULTS: A total of 722 respondents from Israel and 301 respondents from Portugal were included in the analysis. All the respondents reported using level 1 PPE with patients with COVID-19 in the range of several hours daily to several hours weekly. The Cronbach &#945; was .73 for Israel and .75 for Portugal. Responses showed high levels of difficulty, with medians of 4 for items related to discomfort (n=539/688, 78% in Israel; n=328/377, 87% in Portugal), hearing (n=236/370, 64% in Portugal; n=321/642, 50% in Israel), seeing (n=697/763, 89% in Israel; n=317/376, 84% in Portugal), and doffing (n=290/374, 77% in Portugal; n=315/713, 44% in Israel). A factor analysis showed a set of strongly related variables consisting of hearing, understanding speech, and understanding the situation. This suggests that degradation in communication was strongly associated with degradation in situational awareness. A subsequent mediation analysis showed a direct effect of PPE discomfort on situational awareness (P<.001); this was also influenced (mediated) by difficulties in communicating, namely in hearing and understanding speech. CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic is paving the way for updating PPE design. The use of already deployed technology affords ample opportunities to improve, adapt, and overcome caveats. The findings here suggest that the use of level 1 PPE with patients with COVID-19 has perceptual and cognitive effects, in addition to physical and ergonomic influences. Efforts should be taken to mitigate the harmful effects of such influences, both regarding the performance of medical actions and the risk of contamination to health care workers. Such efforts involve the design of PPE; the introduction of technologies to enhance vision, hearing, and communicating during the use of PPE; and training staff in using the equipment and in effective communication and teamwork protocols.","Parush, Avi; Wacht, Oren; Gomes, Ricardo; Frenkel, Amit",J Med Internet Res,92,1

RESULTS: Overall, the 28-day mortality of patients with comorbid CVD was 3.25 times of that of patients without comorbid CVD (40.63% vs 12.50%, P=0.011). Clinic symptoms on admission were similar for the two groups. However, patients with comorbid CVD had higher levels of Interleukin-10 (22.22% vs 0%, P=0.034), procalcitonin (22.6% vs 3.13%, P<0.001), high-sensitivity troponin I (20 pg/mL vs 16.05 pg/mL, P=0.019), and lactic dehydrogenase (437 U/L vs 310 U/L, P=0.015). In addition, patients with comorbid CVD experienced a high incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (59.38% vs 15.63%, P<0.001), and required more invasive mechanical ventilation (40.63% vs 12.50%, P=0.011). Methylprednisolone was found to improve the survival of patients without comorbid CVD (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid CVD resulted in a higher mortality rate for COVID-19 patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was the primary reason of death for COVID-19 patients with comorbid CVD, followed by acute myocardial infarction. METHODS: This retrospective study used propensity score matching to divide 64 COVID-19 patients into two groups with and without comorbid CVD. Clinic symptoms, laboratory features, treatments, and 28-day mortality were compared between the two groups.","Xu, Hui; Ai, Ling; Qiu, Chun; Tan, Xi; Jiao, Bo; Luo, Ailin; Li, Shusheng; Liu, Shangkun; Yan, Li",Aging (Albany NY),92,33

Blockade of interleukin-6, a key cytokine in COVID-19 pathogenesis, may improve the hypercoagulable state induced by inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of subcutaneous tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor on coagulation parameters. METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed moderate to critical COVID-19 pneumonia and hyperinflammation, who received a single 324 mg subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab on top of standard of care were enrolled in this analysis. Coagulation parameters were measured before tocilizumab and at day 1, 3, and 7 after treatment. All patients were followed-up for 35 days after admission or until death. RESULTS: 70 patients (mean age 60 years, interquartile range 52-75) were included. Treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a reduction in D-dimer levels (-56%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -68% to -44%), fibrinogen (-48%; 95%CI, -60% to -35%), C-reactive protein (-93%; 95%CI, -99% to -87%), prothrombin time (-4%; 95%CI,-9% to 0.8%), and activated thromboplastin time (-4%; 95%CI,-8.7% to 0.8%), and an increase in platelet count (34%; 95%CI, 23% to 45%). These changes occurred already one day after treatment with sustained reductions throughout day 7. The improvement in coagulation was consistently observed in patients receiving prophylactic or therapeutic dose anticoagulants, and was paralleled by a rapid improvement in respiratory function. CONCLUSIONS: Subcutaneous tocilizumab was associated with significant improvement of blood coagulation parameters independently of thromboprophylaxis dose.","Di Nisio, Marcello; Potere, Nicola; Candeloro, Matteo; Spacone, Antonella; Pieramati, Leonardo; Ferrandu, Giovanna; Rizzo, Giulia; La Vella, Matteo; Di Carlo, Silvio; Cibelli, Donatella; Parruti, Giustino; Levi, Marcel; Porreca, Ettore",Eur. j. intern. med,92,1

METHODS: This systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020210643) is according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, SciELO, Lilacs, Web of Science, and DOAJ databases were used. Clinical trials and research articles studying receptors related to COVID-19 were included in this review. R programming language was used to elaborate charts and receptors network and SPSS(26v) software was used to perform statistical analyses. RESULTS: The majority of studies regarding the involvement of receptors in COVID-19 included plasma receptors and G protein-coupled receptor families (p<0.05). These receptors are highly expressed in the brain (24%) and 80% of them can interact with each other in a protein network, exerting some regulatory effects in various tissues. The main influential receptor on the network of receptors involved in COVID-19 was the EGFR and the majority of receptors were associated with pathological processes in the disease (p<0.05), including the amplification of inflammatory responses in COVID-19, which may be related to neurological disorders in some cases. Humans from the United States, Spain, and Brazil were the most used model in studies adressing receptors involved in COVID-19 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma receptors and G protein-coupled receptors, especially the EGFR, and involved with pathological effects on the COVID-19 inflammatory process in the brain have shown significant importance in this review.","Câmara, Alice Barros; Brandão, Igor Augusto",Curr. med. chem,92,16

Care for older people with comorbid dementia and COVID-19 is a challenge to health care professionals due to their complex needs. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease which typically presents with respiratory symptoms; however, in older people with dementia, it may present atypically with delirium. Delirium may precede respiratory symptoms, and in some cases, it may be the only symptom, leading to a delay in the diagnosis. Therefore, screening for delirium should be part of the routine clinical practice for older people with dementia and suspected COVID-19 infection. Due to the complexity of care required for older people with dementia affected by COVID-19, a holistic and individualised approach that includes acute, transitional and long-term care is required. Advanced decision-making, for example, ceiling of care and resuscitation decisions, should be made early on admission to hospital. Screening for frailty with clinical frailty scale may help to aid decision-making. Palliative care and relief of suffering should be considered from the outset. Early and regular involvement of patients and their families in care plans and periodic updates regarding any changes in the clinical condition are good clinical practice. The introduction of telehealth programmes that are suitable for older people with poor cognitive function and also cover diverse cultural backgrounds are urgently required for the future support of this vulnerable group of patients.","Emmerton, Demelza; Abdelhafiz, Ahmed H",SN Compr Clin Med,92,17

The diagnosis is challenging, as it might mimic an infectious, inflammatory, or metabolic disease. Acrometastasis are most commonly found in patients with lung, gastrointestinal, kidney, and breast cancer. Only 3 cases of cervical cancer associated with hand metastasis have been reported in the literature. PATIENT CONCERNS: Herein, we report a 58-year-old patient with locally advanced cervical cancer and recurrence in the right thumb as presentation of widespread disseminated disease. She initially presented with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and was treated with concurrent chemoradiation followed by high-dose rate brachytherapy. Six months later, she developed an insidious onset of pain and swelling in the right thumb, erythema, and edema, mimicking cellulitis. DIAGNOSIS: A biopsy of the soft tissues of the thumb was performed, and the histopathology indicated metastasis of adenocarcinoma to the bone and soft tissues. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: The patient rejected further treatment and died of progressive disease 4 months after the diagnosis of the recurrence. CONCLUSION: Metastases in unusual sites are a diagnostic challenge, and there is no standardized treatment. Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis of these patients and might preserve their quality of life.","Gallardo-Alvarado, Lenny; Ramos, Alma Astorga; Perez-Montiel, Delia; Ramirez-Morales, Rebeca; Diaz, Erick; Leon, David Cantu-de",Medicine (Baltimore),92,16

The present study examined the mediating role of cognitive social capital on the relationship between structural social capital and mental health among older adults in urban China in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from the Yangpu district in Shanghai, China, in July-August 2020. A quota sampling approach was used to recruit 472 respondents aged 60 years and older from 23 communities in the Yangpu district. Mental health was measured by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Cognitive social capital was assessed through trust and reciprocity, and structural social capital was assessed through organization memberships, and COVID-19 related volunteering and citizenship activity. Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediation model. The results show that cognitive social capital had a full mediation effect on the association between structural social capital and mental health indicators (life satisfaction: b = 0.122, SD = 0.029, p < 0.001; depressive symptoms: b = -0.343, SD = 0.119, p < 0.01).

One mechanism of aging is the progressive shortening of telomeres, which are protective structures at chromosome ends. Critically short telomeres impair the regenerative capacity of tissues and trigger loss of tissue homeostasis and disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects many different cell types, forcing cell turn-over and regeneration to maintain tissue homeostasis. We hypothesize that presence of short telomeres in older patients limits the tissue response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measure telomere length in peripheral blood lymphocytes COVID-19 patients with ages between 29 and 85 years-old. We find that shorter telomeres are associated to increased severity of the disease. Individuals within the lower percentiles of telomere length and higher percentiles of short telomeres have higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 pathologies.","Sanchez-Vazquez, Raul; Guío-Carrión, Ana; Zapatero-Gaviria, Antonio; Martínez, Paula; Blasco, Maria A",Aging (Albany NY),92,1

These features are reminiscent of several adverse reactions triggered by angiotensin II and opposed by angiotensin1-7, in many experimental models. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 binds to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors and entries into the cell through the fusion of its membrane with that of the cell. Hence, it downregulates these receptors. The loss of ACE2 receptor activity from the external site of the membrane will lead to less angiotensin II inactivation and less generation of antiotensin1-7. In various experimental models of lung injury, the imbalance between angiotensin II overactivity and of antiotensin1-7 deficiency triggered inflammation, thrombosis, and other adverse reactions. In COVID-19, such imbalance could play an important role in influencing the clinical picture and outcome of the disease. According to this line of thinking, some therapeutic approaches including recombinant ACE2, exogenous angiotensin1-7, and angiotensin receptor blockers seem particularly promising and are being actively tested.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Spanevello, Antonio; Angeli, Fabio",Hypertension,92,16

It is unknown whether this practice variation contributed to outcome differences. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of all adult patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 admitted between March 11 and May 31, 2020 to a medical or surgical ICU at three Massachusetts hospitals. Medical charts were manually reviewed by physicians and abstracted into a standardized REDCap database. Chi-square test for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables were performed using R version 4.0.2. Results: Data from 429 patients were analyzed. Among the three institutions, there were significant differences in race, prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, duration of COVID-19 symptoms on presentation, and days between admission and intubation. Significant differences were observed in presentation acuity by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score but not simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) or PaO2:FiO2 ratios. Hospital A intubated more patients on the day of admission and utilized more inhaled nitric oxide and less immunosuppression (steroids, anti-IL6 agents). Hospital B treated more patients with remdesivir, other experimental antivirals, and early paralysis (within 48 hours of intubation) but less awake prone positioning. Hospital C utilized more non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and high flow oxygen in lieu of intubation;it also administered more statins and steroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and used less early proning within 48 hours of intubation. No difference in hydroxychloroquine use was seen across institutions. There were no statistical differences across hospitals in reintubation, ventilator-free days at 28 days, or in-hospital mortality. Transition to comfort measures was more common at hospital C. There was a trend at hospital A toward lower 30-day (A=25.3%, B=32.1%, C=39.4%;p=0.054) and 90-day (A=28.5%, B=36.1%, C=41.4%;p=0.085) mortality. At hospital A there was significantly longer hospital length-of-stay (A=25.0, B=19.0, C=15.0;p=0.004) and ICU length-of-stay (A=18.0, B=15.0, C=12.0;p=0.001). Conclusions: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts, there were significant differences in patient characteristics and treatments administered across three institutions. One institution demonstrated a trend toward lower 30-day and 90-day mortality despite later presentation from symptom onset, higher admission acuity, and less utilization of remdesivir or steroids. Practice variation across institutions may explain differences in outcomes, independent of baseline characteristics, and should be studied further as it may inform future management of COVID-19.","Jesudasen, S.

Here, we utilize a rhesus macaque (RM) model of SARS-CoV-2 infection to delineate perturbations in the innate immune system during acute infection using an integrated systems analysis. We found that SARS-CoV-2 initiated a rapid infiltration (two days post infection) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lower airway, commensurate with IFNA production, natural killer cell activation, and induction of interferon-stimulated genes. At this early interval, we also observed a significant increase of blood CD14-CD16+ monocytes. To dissect the contribution of lung myeloid subsets to airway inflammation, we generated a novel compendium of RM-specific lung macrophage gene expression using a combination of sc-RNA-Seq data and bulk RNA-Seq of purified populations under steady state conditions. Using these tools, we generated a longitudinal sc-RNA-seq dataset of airway cells in SARS-CoV-2-infected RMs. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a rapid recruitment of two subsets of macrophages into the airway: a C206+MRC1-population resembling murine interstitial macrophages, and a TREM2+ population consistent with CCR2+ infiltrating monocytes, into the alveolar space. These subsets were the predominant source of inflammatory cytokines, accounting for ~75% of IL6 and TNF production, and >90% of IL10 production, whereas the contribution of CD206+MRC+ alveolar macrophages was significantly lower. Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected RMs with baricitinib (Olumiant(R)), a novel JAK1/2 inhibitor that recently received Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, was remarkably effective in eliminating the influx of infiltrating, non-alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space, with a concomitant reduction of inflammatory cytokines.

Methods: We conducted a representative online survey with partnered women (18-65 years) between 22 April and 8 May 2020, when participants had been under lockdown for a month. We determined the prevalence of several forms of violence within the previous month using both direct elicitation and a list experiment. We conducted a multivariable logistic regression to assess the impact of pandemic-associated risk factors. Findings: Of our 3818 survey respondents, 118 (3.09%; 95% confidence interval, CI: 2.54 to 3.64) reported incidents of physical conflict, 293 (7.67%; 95% CI: 6.83 to 8.52) reported emotional abuse, and 97 (6.58%; 95% CI: 5.31 to 7.85) of 1474 respondents with children reported child corporal punishment. We estimated that 3.57% (95% CI: -0.33 to 7.46) had non-consensual intercourse with their partner. Our regression analysis revealed an increased risk of physical conflict with home quarantine (odds ratio, OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.56 to 3.61), financial worries (OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 0.98 to 2.61), poor mental health (OR: 3.41; 95% CI: 2.12 to 5.50) and young (< 10 years) children (OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.32 to 4.64); we obtained similar results for other forms of violence.

The gastrointestinal tract is now an appreciated portal of infection. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the serine protease TMPRSS2. Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are inflammatory conditions caused by chronic type 2 (T2) inflammation. However, the effects of the T2 atopic inflammatory milieu on SARS-COV-2 viral entry gene expression in the GI tract is poorly understood. We analyzed tissue ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis (EG) and in normal adult esophagi using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets. Similar to findings evaluating the airway, there was no difference in tissue ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in EoE or EG when compared to control non-EoE/EG esophagus/stomach. ACE2 gene expression was significantly lower in esophagi from children with or without EoE and from adults with EoE as compared to normal adult esophagi. Type 2 immunity and pediatric age could be protective for infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract due to decreased expression of ACE2.","Chiang, Austin W T; Duong, Loan D; Shoda, Tetsuo; Nhu, Quan M; Ruffner, Melanie; Hara, Takeo; Aaron, Bailey; Joplin, Erik; Manresa, Mario; Abonia, J Pablo; Dellon, Evan; Hirano, Ikuo; Gonsalves, Nirmala; Gupta, Sandeep; Furuta, Glenn; Rothenberg, Marc E; Lewis, Nathan E; Muir, Amanda B; Aceves, Seema S",J. pediatr. gastroenterol. nutr,92,21

While the application EHTERAZ (Arabic for precaution) in Qatar has fallen short in adhering to the responsible AI requirements, it has contributed significantly to controlling the pandemic. On the other hand, the UK's NHS COVID-19 application has exhibited limited success in fighting the virus despite relatively abiding by these requirements. This underlines the need for obtaining a practical and contextual view for a comprehensive discourse on responsible AI in healthcare.

Until safe and efficacious vaccines or antiviral drugs become widely available, viral testing remains the primary mitigation measure for rapid identification and isolation of infected individuals. We aimed to assess the economic trade-offs of expanding and accelerating testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the USA in different transmission scenarios. METHODS: We used a multiscale model that incorporates SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and daily viral load dynamics at the individual level to assess eight surveillance testing strategies that varied by testing frequency (from daily to monthly testing) and isolation period (1 or 2 weeks), compared with the status-quo strategy of symptom-based testing and isolation. For each testing strategy, we first estimated the costs (incorporating costs of diagnostic testing and admissions to hospital, and salary lost while in isolation) and years of life lost (YLLs) prevented under rapid and low transmission scenarios. We then assessed the testing strategies across a range of scenarios, each defined by effective reproduction number (Re), willingness to pay per YLL averted, and cost of a test, to estimate the probability that a particular strategy had the greatest net benefit. Additionally, for a range of transmission scenarios (Re from 1·1 to 3), we estimated a threshold test price at which the status-quo strategy outperforms all testing strategies considered. FINDINGS: Our modelling showed that daily testing combined with a 2-week isolation period was the most costly strategy considered, reflecting increased costs with greater test frequency and length of isolation period. Assuming a societal willingness to pay of US$100â000 per YLL averted and a price of $5 per test, the strategy most likely to be cost-effective under a rapid transmission scenario (Re of 2·2) is weekly testing followed by a 2-week isolation period subsequent to a positive test result. Under low transmission scenarios (Re of 1·2), monthly testing of the population followed by 1-week isolation rather than 2-week isolation is likely to be most cost-effective. Expanded surveillance testing is more likely to be cost-effective than the status-quo testing strategy if the price per test is less than $75 across all transmission rates considered. INTERPRETATION: Extensive expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing programmes with more frequent and rapid tests across communities coupled with isolation of individuals with confirmed infection is essential for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, resources recouped from shortened isolation duration could be cost-effectively allocated to more frequent testing.

The photocurrent intensity was the strongest when the excitation source was polarized along the 1D chains with dichroic ratios of 4:1 and 1.2:1 for ZrS3 and TiS3, respectively. This behavior is explained by symmetry selection rules applicable to both valence and conduction band states. Symmetry selection rules are seen to be applicable to the experimental band structure, as is observed in polarization-dependent nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Based on these band symmetry assignments, it is expected that the dichroic ratios for both materials will be maximized using excitation energies within 1 eV of their band gaps, providing versatile polarization sensitive photodetection across the visible spectrum and into the near-infrared.","Gilbert, Simeon J; Yi, Hemian; Chen, Jia-Shiang; Yost, Andrew J; Dhingra, Archit; Abourahma, Jehad; Lipatov, Alexey; Avila, Jose; Komesu, Takashi; Sinitskii, Alexander; Asensio, Maria C; Dowben, Peter A",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),92,16

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics.","Janssen, Marijn; van der Voort, Haiko",Int J Inf Manage,92,26

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review was performed at a large paediatric academic institution to identify patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a screening electrocardiogram by their primary care providers and were subsequently referred for outpatient cardiology consultation due to an abnormal electrocardiogram. The outcomes were the results from their cardiology evaluations, including testing and final diagnoses. RESULTS: Among 46 patients, during their preceding COVID-19 illness, the majority had mild symptoms, 4 were asymptomatic, and 1 had moderate symptoms. The median length of time from positive SARS-CoV-2 test to screening electrocardiogram was 22 days, and many electrocardiogram findings that prompted cardiology consultation were normal variants in asymptomatic adolescent athletes. Patients underwent frequent additional testing at their cardiology appointments: repeat electrocardiogram (72%), echocardiogram (59%), Holter monitor (11%), exercise stress test (7%), and cardiac MRI (2%). Five patients were incidentally diagnosed with CHD or structural cardiac abnormalities, and three patients had conduction abnormalities (pre-mature atrial contractions, pre-mature ventricular contractions, borderline prolonged QTc), although potentially incidental to COVID-19. No patients were diagnosed with myocarditis or ventricular dysfunction. CONCLUSION: In a small cohort of children with prior COVID-19, who were primarily either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, subsequent screening electrocardiograms identified various potential abnormalities prompting cardiology consultation, but no patient was diagnosed with myocarditis.

We present data from the rapid implementation of virtual visits in a large, academic, movement disorder practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the strategic shift to virtual visits and retrospectively examine elements that impacted the ability to switch to telemedicine visits using historical prepandemic in-person data as a comparator, including demographics, distance driven, and diagnosis distribution, with an additional focus on patients with deep brain stimulators. Results: A total of 686 telemedicine visits were performed over a five-week period (60% of those previously scheduled for in-office visits). The average age of participants was 65 years, 45% were female, and 73% were Caucasian. Men were more likely to make the transition (p = 0.02). Telemedicine patients lived farther from the clinic than those seen in person (66.47 km vs. 42.16 km, p < 0.001), age was not associated with making the switch, and patient satisfaction did not change. There was a significant shift in the distribution of movement disorder diagnoses seen by telemedicine compared to prepandemic in-person visits (p < 0.001). Patients with deep brain stimulators were more likely to use telemedicine (11.5% vs. 7%, p < 0.001).

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

There was a significant reduction in square-root-transformed eye strain in the intervention group (-0.08, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) compared to controls (0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.09; difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03; P=.02). Change in sleep quality was similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This digital behavior change intervention reduced children's anxiety and eye strain during COVID-19-associated online schooling.

In this short paper, we report on efforts to enable whistleblowers to leak sensitive documents to journalists more safely. Following a survey of cases where whistleblowers were discovered due to operational or technological issues, we propose a game-theoretic model capturing the power dynamics involved in whistleblowing. We find that the whistleblower is often at the mercy of motivations and abilities of others. We identify specific areas where technology may be used to mitigate the whistleblower's risk. However we warn against technical solutionism: the main constraints are often institutional.","Ahmed-Rengers, Mansoor; Anderson, Ross; Halatova, Darija; Shumailov, Ilia",,92,1

In Europe, the pandemic started to develop strongly at the end of February and beginning of March 2020. It has subsequently spread over the continent, with special virulence in northern Italy and inland Spain. In this study we show that an unusual persistent anticyclonic situation prevailing in southwestern Europe during February 2020 (i.e. anomalously strong positive phase of the North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations) could have resulted in favorable conditions, in terms of air temperature and humidity, in Italy and Spain for a quicker spread of the virus compared with the rest of the European countries. It seems plausible that the strong atmospheric stability and associated dry conditions that dominated in these regions may have favored the virus's propagation, by short-range droplet transmission as well as likely by long-range aerosol (airborne) transmission.","Sanchez-Lorenzo, Arturo; Vaquero-Mart'inez, Javier; Calb'o, Josep; Wild, Martin; Santurt'un, Ana; Lopez-Bustins, Joan-A.; Vaquero, Jose-M.; Folini, Doris; Ant'on, Manuel",,92,16

DESIGN: An anonymous, non-validated, cross-sectional survey was conducted online. Data was collected from April 7-16, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 2019-2020 second year U.S. vitreoretinal surgery fellows in two-year vitreoretinal surgery training programs were invited to participate. INTERVENTION: Online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey questions assessed policies guiding COVID-19 response, known or suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2, changes in clinical duties and volume, and methods to reduce occupational risk including availability of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Completed responses were obtained from 62 of 87 eligible recipients (71.2% response rate). Training settings included academic (58.1%), hybrid academic/private practice (35.5%), and private practice only settings (6.5%). Overall, 19.4% of respondents reported an exposure to a COVID-19 positive patient, 14.5% reported self-quarantining due to possible exposure, and 11.3% reported being tested for COVID-19. In regards to PPE, N95 masks were available in the emergency room (n=40, 64.5%), office (n=35, 56.5%), and operating room settings (n=35, 56.5%). Perceived comfort level with PPE recommendations was significantly associated with availability of an N95 respirator mask in the clinic (p<0.001), emergency room (p<0.001) or operating room (p=0.002) settings. Additional risk mitigation methods outside of PPE were: reduction in patient volume (n=62, 100%), limiting patient companions (n=59, 95.2%), use of a screening process (n=59, 95.2%), use of a slit lamp face shield (n=57, 91.9%), temperature screening of all persons entering clinical space (n=34, 54.84%), and placement of face mask on patients (n=33, 53.2%). Overall, 16.1% reported additional clinical duties within the scope of ophthalmology, and 3.2% reported being re-deployed to non-ophthalmology services. 98.4% of respondents expected a reduction in surgical case volume. No respondents reported loss of employment or reduction in pay or benefits due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: and Relevance: Suspected or confirmed clinical exposure to COVID-19 positive patients occurred in approximately one-fifth of trainee respondents. Perceived comfort level with PPE standards was significantly associated with N95 respirator mask availability. As surgical training programs grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, analysis of trainees' concerns may inform development of mitigation strategies.","Khan, M Ali; Sivalingam, Arunan; Haller, Julia A",,92,16

Although public health experts predicted worst outcomes in Africa, the incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates have been lower in Africa compared to other continents. Interestingly, lower incidence and mortality rates have been observed in women from Africa compared to their cohorts from other continents. Also, in the US non-Hispanic Black females have lower COVID-19 and death rates compared to their white counterparts. It's unclear why this significant difference exists; however, the ovarian function, genetics and immunological statuses could play a major role. Women of African descent have elevated levels of estrogen compared with Caucasians hence we anticipate that estrogen might offer some protection against the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The racial differences in lifestyle, age and inaccessibility to contraceptive usage might also play a role. Here, we provide insight on how the high levels of estrogen in African women might contribute to the lower cases and fatalities in Africa. Specifically, estrogen might offer protection against COVID-19 by suppressing hyper-production of cytokines, promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines, stimulating antibody production and suppressing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This will as well provide useful information on how future pandemics could be managed using Africa as a case study.","Dufailu, Osman A; Afriyie-Asante, Afrakoma; Gyan, Bernard; Kwabena, David Adu; Yeboah, Helena; Ntiakoh, Frank; Asare-Werehene, Meshach",J Ovarian Res,92,19

Global markets and global flows are not as self-evident as they were a few years ago and new modes of governance for managing national food security during crisis are required. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have further showed that global production systems and communications are fragile to a range of different disturbances. This article examines the possibility of managing national food security through collaborative arrangements between public authorities and private food companies through a case study of the Swedish approach to food security. The analysis is based on a theoretical framework that highlights the importance of motivation, leadership, shared understanding, and trust as four dimensions that evaluate collaborative governance in precrisis situations. We conclude that although a broader understnding of the importance of food security has emerged, collaborative governance arrangements run the risk of creating only an illusion of readiness, due to unclear mandates and clear leadership not able to advance trust, legal structures, or concrete agreements for ensuring national food security. © 2021 The Authors.

The implementation of remote provision of healthcare needs to hear from vulnerable populations, such as people living with dementia. AIM: To understand the remote healthcare experiences of patients living with dementia and their family carers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative interviews with community-based patients living with dementia and their carers during early months (May-August 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely by telephone or video call with 30 patients living with dementia and 31 carers. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three main themes were derived relating to: 1) proactive care at the onset of COVID-19 restrictions, 2) avoidance of healthcare settings and services, and 3) difficulties with remote healthcare encounters. People living with dementia and their carers felt check-up calls were reassuring but limited in scope and content. Some avoided healthcare services, wishing to minimise COVID-19 risk, reduce NHS burden, or encountering technological barriers. Difficulties in remote consultations included lack of prompts to remember problems, dealing with new emerging problems, rescheduling/missed calls, and inclusion of the person with dementia's voice. CONCLUSION: While remote consultations could be effective, pro-active calls could be more structured around needs, and consideration should be given to replace non-verbal prompts to describe problems, particularly for new health concerns. In continuing remote consultations, it is important to facilitate engagement with patients living with dementia and their carers to ensure best practice.","Tuijt, Remco; Rait, Greta; Frost, Rachael; Wilcock, Jane; Manthorpe, Jill; Walters, Kate",Br.j.gen.pract,92,29

Here, we test whether this pattern held during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that disproportionately put older adults at risk. We additionally examine potential moderating effects of daily activity and social connectedness, which have been shown to benefit mental health across the life span. We regularly assessed a large sample of adults ages 18-89 using online surveys. As preregistered for this report (https://osf.io/tb4qv), we focus on self-reported measures of affect, depression, stress, and worry as well as self-reported daily activity and perception of social isolation during two time windows for adults in the United States: early (mid-March to early April) and later (mid-April to early May) periods during the spring phase of the pandemic. Increased age benefited emotional well-being for multiple metrics during both time windows assessed. Furthermore, the results confirmed that exercise and perception of social connectedness can buffer against negative mental health outcomes across all ages, although the beneficial effects of age remained even when controlling for these influences. The one exception was worry about one's own health: Once exercise and social connectedness were controlled, increased age was associated with more worry. The results overall suggest that, at least among adults with access to technology, older age was associated with greater resilience during the spring phase of the pandemic. Thus, increased resilience of older adults demonstrated previously extends to the context of the onset of a pandemic.

The UN-Habitat's publication of a Response Plan for mollification of the SARS-CoV-2 based externalities in the cities of the world testifies to that. This article takes the UN-Habitat report as the premise to carry out an empirical investigation in the four major metro cities of India. The report's concern with the urban character of the pandemic has underlined the role of cities in disease transmission. In that wake, the study demarcates factors at the sub-city level that tend to jeopardize the two mandatory precautionary measures during COVID-19 – Social Distancing and Lockdown. It investigates those factors through a Covid Vulnerability Index. The Index devised with the help of Analytic Hierarchy Process demarcates the low, moderate, high, and very high vulnerable city sub-units. Secondly, UN-Habitat's one of the major action areas is evidence-based knowledge creation through mapping and its analysis. In our study, we do it at a granular scale for arriving at a more nuanced understanding. Thus, in harmony with the UN-habitat's we take the urban seriously and identify the gaps that need to be plugged for the pandemic cities of now and of the future.","Mishra, Swasti Vardhan; Gayen, Amiya; Haque, Sk Mafizul",Habitat Int.,92,27

DESIGN: It was carried out a descriptive transversal study in the city of Caruaru, Pernambuco state, Brazil, within the period of 20/02/2020 to 05/05/2020. Data included all official reports for influenza-like illness notified by the municipality health department and the self-reports collected through the participatory surveillance platform Brasil Sem Corona. METHODS: We used linear regression and loess regression to verify a correlation between Participatory Surveillance (PS) and Traditional Surveillance (TS). Also a spatial scanning approach was deployed in order to identify risk clusters for COVID-19. RESULTS: In Caruaru, the PS had 861 active users, presenting an average of 1.2 reports per user per week. The platform Brasil Sem Corona started on March 20th and since then, has been officially used by the Caruaru health authority to improve the quality of information from the traditional surveillance system. Regarding the respiratory syndrome cases from TS, 1588 individuals were positive for this clinical outcome. The spatial scanning analysis detected 18 clusters and 6 of them presented statistical significance (p-value < 0.1). Clusters 3 and 4 presented an overlapping area that was chosen by the local authority to deploy the COVID-19 serology, where 50 individuals were tested. From there, 32 % (nâ¯=â¯16) presented reagent results for antibodies related to COVID-19.

Protocols for the management of poisoning recommend diazepam, although there are uncertainties in its pharmacology and efficacy in this context. The aim was to assess the effects of diazepam in experimental models of chloroquine cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In vitro experiments involved cardiac tissues isolated from rats and incubated with chloroquine alone or in combination with diazepam. In vivo models of toxicity involved chloroquine administered intravenously to pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats and rabbits. Randomised, controlled treatment studies in rats assessed diazepam, clonazepam and Ro5-4864 administered: (i) prior, (ii) during and (iii) after chloroquine and the effects of diazepam: (iv) at high dose, (v) in urethane-anaesthetised rats and (vi) co-administered with adrenaline. KEY RESULTS: Chloroquine decreased the developed tension of left atria, prolonged the effective refractory period of atria, ventricular tissue and right papillary muscles, and caused dose-dependent impairment of haemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters. Cardiac arrhythmias indicated impairment of atrioventricular conduction. Studies (i), (ii) and (v) showed no differences between treatments and control. Diazepam increased heart rate in study (iv) and as with clonazepam also prolonged the QTc interval in study (iii). Combined administration of diazepam and adrenaline in study (vi) improved cardiac contractility but caused hypokalaemia. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Neither diazepam nor other ligands for benzodiazepine binding sites protect against or attenuate chloroquine cardiotoxicity. However, diazepam may augment the effects of positive inotropes in reducing chloroquine cardiotoxicity. LINKED ARTICLES: This article is part of a themed issue on The Pharmacology of COVID-19.

Given an input document, it aims to detect all sentences that contain a claim that can be verified by some previously fact-checked claims (from a given database). The output is a re-ranked list of the document sentences, so that those that can be verified are ranked as high as possible, together with corresponding evidence.

We previously showed that macrophages detect Burkholderia thailandensis via NLRC4, triggering the release of interleukin (IL)-18 and driving an essential interferon (IFN)-Î³ response that primes caspase-11. We now identify the IFN-Î³-producing cells as a mixture of natural killer (NK) and T cells. Although both caspase-1 and caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D in macrophages and neutrophils, we find that NLRC4-activated caspase-1 triggers pyroptosis in macrophages, but this pathway does not trigger pyroptosis in neutrophils.

AIMS: To investigate the trajectory of mental health and well-being during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in adults in the UK. METHOD: A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. RESULTS: A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves. Subgroup analyses showed that women, young people (18-29 years), those from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with pre-existing mental health problems have worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic across most factors. CONCLUSIONS: The mental health and well-being of the UK adult population appears to have been affected in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing rates of suicidal thoughts across waves, especially among young adults, are concerning.","O039,; Connor, Rory C; Wetherall, Karen; Cleare, Seonaid; McClelland, Heather; Melson, Ambrose J; Niedzwiedz, Claire L; Carroll, Ronan E; Connor, Daryl B; Platt, Steve; Scowcroft, Elizabeth; Watson, Billy; Zortea, Tiago; Ferguson, Eamonn; Robb, Kathryn A",Br J Psychiatry,92,26

To face this increase in demand, health care systems need to adapt their response by increasing hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity and by (re-)deploying doctors and other personnel. This paper proposes a forecast approach based on the Vector Error Correction model for the daily counts of hospitalized patients with symptoms and of patients in ICU, using publicly available data on the current COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, Switzerland and Spain. The level of analysis is the local government managing the health care system response, which corresponds to regions for Italy. The one-week-ahead forecasts are validated with out-of-sample data over successive weeks; they are found to provide timely and robust prediction of ICU capacity needs in Lombardy, the most-affected Italian region, starting from the sample of the first 2 weeks of data. The same methodology is successfully validated on other Italian regions, Switzerland and Spain. This approach may be used in other countries/regions/provinces to help adapt the health care system response to COVID-19 (or other similar disease); for this purpose, the open-source software code to produce the forecasts is provided with the paper.","Berta, Paolo; Paruolo, Paolo; Verzillo, Stefano; Lovaglio, Pietro Giorgio",PLoS One,92,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative influences of circumstantial, demographic, and trait-state anxiety variables on health anxiety in this group. METHODS: A total of 168 hospital staff members (mean age: 28.91 years; 56.5% females) participated in the study. They completed a series of questionnaires covering sociodemographic characteristics, health anxiety, state-trait anxiety, and job-related information. Participants also reported whether they had close acquaintances (friends, family members) infected with COVID-19. RESULTS: Higher health anxiety was related to both trait and state anxiety. Working on the frontline, being in contact with close acquaintances infected with COVID-19, and higher state and trait anxiety predicted higher health anxiety. Gender, age, and educational background were not predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of hospital staff, subjective feelings of anxiety about one own's health were related to personality traits, individual experiences of having close acquaintances infected with COVID-19, and working on the frontline.","Shayganfard, Mehran; Mahdavi, Fateme; Haghighi, Mohammad; Sadeghi-Bahmani, Dena; Brand, Serge",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),92,2

With escalating musculoskeletal complications, as evident from 2016 Global Burden of Disease data, NSAID usage is evidently unavoidable. Apart from analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic efficacies, NSAIDs are further documented to offer protection against diverse critical disorders including cancer and heart attacks. However, data from multiple placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses studies alarmingly signify the adverse effects of NSAIDs in gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, cerebral and pulmonary complications. Although extensive research has elucidated the mechanisms underlying the clinical hazards of NSAIDs, no review has extensively collated the outcomes on various multiorgan toxicities of these drugs together. In this regard, the present review provides a comprehensive insight of the existing knowledge and recent developments on NSAID-induced organ damage. It precisely encompasses the current understanding of structure, classification and mode of action of NSAIDs while reiterating on the emerging instances of NSAID drug repurposing along with pharmacophore modification aimed at safer usage of NSAIDs where toxic effects are tamed without compromising the clinical benefits. The review does not intend to vilify these 'wonder drugs'; rather provides a careful understanding of their side-effects which would be beneficial in evaluating the risk-benefit threshold while rationally using NSAIDs at safer dose and duration.","Bindu, Samik; Mazumder, Somnath; Bandyopadhyay, Uday",Biochem Pharmacol,92,16

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed from the medical data of 23 children, aged from 3 months to 17 years and 8 months, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Jiangxi, China from January 21 to February 29, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 23 children with COVID-19, 17 had family aggregation. Three children (13%) had asymptomatic infection, 6 (26%) had mild type, and 14 (61%) had common type. Among these 23 children, 16 (70%) had fever, 11 (48%) had cough, 8 (35%) had fever and cough, and 8 (35%) had wet rales in the lungs. The period from disease onset or the first nucleic acid-positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 to the virus nucleic acid negative conversion was 6-24 days (median 12 days). Of the 23 children, 3 had a reduction in total leukocyte count, 2 had a reduction in lymphocytes, 2 had an increase in C-reactive protein, and 2 had an increase in D-dimer. Abnormal pulmonary CT findings were observed in 12 children, among whom 9 had patchy ground-glass opacities in both lungs. All 23 children received antiviral therapy and were recovered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children aged <18 years often occurs with family aggregation, with no specific clinical manifestation and laboratory examination results. Most of these children have mild symptoms and a good prognosis.

Long ICU hospitalization exposes patients to a high risk of wasting and loss of lean body mass. The complex management precludes the detection of anthropometric parameters for the definition and monitoring of the nutritional status. The use of imaging diagnostics for body composition could help to recognize and treat patients at increased risk of wasting with targeted pathways. COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU underwent computed tomography within 24 hours and about 20 days later, to evaluate the parameters of the body and liver composition. The main results were the loss of the lean mass index and a greater increase in liver attenuation in obese subjects. These could be co-caused by COVID-19, prolonged bed rest, the complex medical nutritional therapy, and the starting condition of low-grade inflammation of the obese. The assessment of nutritional status, with body composition applied to imaging diagnostics and metabolic profiles in COVID-19, will assist in prescribing appropriate medical nutritional therapy.

In the current study, we evaluated the Nanocurcumin effects on the Treg cell population and corresponding factors in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. To investigate the Nanocurcumin effects, 80 COVID-19 patients (40 at the severe stage and 40 at the mild stage) were selected and classified into Nanocurcumin and placebo arms. In both the Nanocurcumin and placebo groups, the Treg cell frequency, the gene expression of Treg transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), and cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-ß), as well as the serum levels of cytokines were measured before and after treatment. In both mild and severe COVID-19 patients, Nanocurcumin could considerably upregulate the frequency of Treg cells, the expression levels of FoxP3, IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-ß, as well as the serum secretion levels of cytokines in the Nanocurcumin-treated group compared to the placebo group. The abovementioned factors were remarkably increased in the post-treatment with Nanocurcumin before pre-treatment conditions.

Based on our in vivo experience with digitoxin as an inhibitor of TNF&#945;-driven NFÄ¸B signaling for cytokine expression in prostate cancer in rats and in cystic fibrosis in humans, we hypothesize that this drug will also block a virally-activated cytokine storm. Materials Methods: Digitoxin was administered intraperitoneally to cotton rats, followed by intranasal infection with 107TCID50/100 g of cotton rat with influenza strain A/Wuhan/H3N2/359/95. Daily digitoxin treatment continued until harvest on day 4 of the experiment. RESULTS: The cardiac glycoside digitoxin significantly and differentially suppressed levels of the cytokines TNF&#945;, GRO/KC, MIP2, MCP1, and IFNÎ³, in the cotton rat lung in the presence of influenza virus. CONCLUSION: Since cytokine storm is a host response, we suggest that digitoxin may have a therapeutic potential not only for influenza and but also for coronavirus infections.","Pollard, Bette S; BLANCOl, Jorge C; Pollard, John R",In Vivo,92,23

PURPOSE: The purpose of this qualitative study was to investigate and compare 3 different impression techniques for osseointegrated dental implant transfer procedures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three impression transfer approaches were evaluated and compared: closed-tray impression technique (CTT), impression with plastic snap-fit impression copings; open-tray impression technique (OTT), impression with independent square copings; and OTT joining the impression copings with a photo-polymerized resin (PPT). A reference acrylic resin model with 4 implants was fabricated. Polyvinyl siloxane with a stock tray was used to make 45 impressions (n=15 for each impression technique), and 45 die definitive stone casts. A computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) titanium framework was fabricated on the reference model. Three blinded operators evaluated the fit of the CAD-CAM titanium framework on each model to find clinically acceptable fit. The Kappa test was used for the agreement between the examiners (&#945;=.05). RESULTS: Agreement was found among the 3 examiners on 44 of 45 specimens (Kappa value= 0.939; P<.001). In the CTT group, 14 casts were found to be acceptable. In the OTT group, nearly half of the specimens produced unacceptable fitting casts, whereas in the PPT group, 13 casts were found acceptable.

Therefore, their metabolic properties and the effects on activity of cytochrome P450 (P450, CYP) enzymes and drug transporters should be considered into when developing the most efficient treatments for patients. METHODS: Scientific literature on the interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with human P450 enzymes and drug transporters was searched using PUBMED.Gov (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the ADME database (https://life-science.kyushu.fujitsu.com/admedb/). RESULTS: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolized by P450 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 in vitro and by P450s 2C8 and 3A4/5 in vivo by N-deethylation. Chloroquine effectively inhibited P450 2D6 in vitro; however, in vivo inhibition was not apparent except in individuals with limited P450 2D6 activity. Chloroquine is both an inhibitor and inducer of the transporter MRP1 and is also a substrate of the Mate and MRP1 transport systems. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibited P450 2D6 and the transporter OATP1A2. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine caused a statistically significant decrease of P450 2D6 activity in vitro and in vivo, inhibiting also its own metabolism by the enzyme. The inhibition indicates a potential for clinical drug-drug interactions when taken with other drugs that are predominant substrates of the P450 2D6. When chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are used clinically with other drugs, substrates of P450 2D6 enzyme, attention should be given to substrate specific metabolism by P450 2D6 alleles present in individuals taking the drugs.","Rendic, Slobodan P; Guengerich, F Peter",Current drug metabolism (Online),92,30

It is unclear whether the pandemic has affected the volume of urgent spinal procedures in the UK, especially surgical decompressions for cauda equina syndrome (CES). METHODS: Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of theatre records and electronic operation notes at our institution to identify all procedures performed for CES before (December 2019 to February 2020) and during (March 2020 to May 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). RESULTS: Forty-four patients underwent surgical decompressions during the study period. Over half (54.5%) were female and the median age was 45 years (range = 22-78 years). Three in four procedures were performed at L4-5 and L5-S1 levels (79.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of decompressions performed each month [&#967;2(5)=1.818; p = 0.874]. On the other hand, the number of referrals for suspected or confirmed CES fell by 81.8% between December 2019 and April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our results did not show any statistically significant decline in the volume of surgical decompressions performed for CES despite the considerable fall in electronic referrals for CES and degenerative spinal conditions. This suggests that patients with critical neurological symptoms continued to present and were treated appropriately despite the restrictions imposed on spinal surgeons during the pandemic.","Jayakumar, Nithish; Ferguson, Lucie; Nissen, Justin; Holliman, Damian",Br J Neurosurg,92,29

Like with other viruses, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host cell proteins is necessary for successful replication, and cleavage of cellular targets by the viral protease also may contribute to the pathogenesis, but knowledge about the human proteins that are processed by the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is still limited. We tested the prediction potentials of two different in silico methods for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleavage sites in human proteins. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) that are present in SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein and human proteins were identified using BLAST analysis, and the NetCorona 1.0 webserver was used to successfully predict cleavage sites, although this method was primarily developed for SARS-CoV. Human C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CTBP1) was found to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, the existence of the cleavage site was proved experimentally by using a His6-MBP-mEYFP recombinant substrate containing the predicted target sequence. Our results highlight both potentials and limitations of the tested algorithms. The identification of candidate host substrates of 3CLpro may help better develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Miczi, Márió; Golda, Mária; Kunkli, Balázs; Nagy, Tibor; Tozsér, József; Mótyán, János András",Int. j. mol. sci.

313420,313420,313420,The perplexing question of trained immunity vs adaptive memory in COVID-19,15.662202,8.269198,2020,"BackgroundThe key role of inflammation in the progression of COVID-19 was evident right from the beginning of the pandemic. Consequently, many authors studied the onset and evolution of the cytokine storm. In contrast, other inflammatory mediators such as oxylipins have received almost no attention. MethodsWe conducted a monocentric observational and retrospective study (IMPRE-COVID-19) with patients (aged [≥] 18 years) admitted to Pisa University Hospital with COVID-19 related pneumonia. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction in a nasopharyngeal swab, while pneumonia was demonstrated by CT scan. Oxylipin plasma levels were analysed in a convenient sample of 52 patients randomly selected from those that had a complete set of cytokine values evaluated for clinical purposes. In 12 cases, plasma samples collected on different days were available at the BMS Multispecialistic Biobank of Pisa University Hospital and were analysed to understand the evolution of the oxylipin levels during hospitalization. The two datasets that included oxylipin and cytokine values were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA), computation of Fishers canonical variable, and a multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. FindingsBetween March and April 2020, 52 patients were enrolled of which 28 were hospitalised in COVID-19 wards, 20 in ICUs, and 4 who were initially hospitalised in the wards and who were then transferred to the ICUs due to deteriorating health conditions. Plasma samples collected on different days were available from 7 patients in the wards, 1 from an ICU, and 4 from patients who were hospitalised in both. The mean age of participants was 61 years (SD 16), 11 were females (21%), and 41 were males (79%), without significant differences between groups in terms of age and gender. PCA of oxylipin data led to a clear differentiation of samples collected in COVID-19 wards and ICUs. This differentiation had not been obtained with cytokine data. In addition, borderline samples were from patients hospitalised in COVID-19 wards that were about to be transferred to the ICUs, thus suggesting that differentiation is not a consequence of a different treatment, but somehow related to a diverse evolution of the pathology. Computation of Fishers canonical variable identified the original input variables that were the most effective in discriminating between the two classes. The combination of the two datasets did not improve the discrimination, thus suggesting that oxylipins are more informative than cytokines for this purpose. A multivariate class model built using the four lowest-order principal components as the input variables, and COVID-19 ward samples as the target class, produced a ROC curve with a resulting area under the curve (AUC) equal to 0{middle dot}92 - which is much higher than most AUC outcomes obtained for individual oxylipins. InterpretationAfter analysing the metabolic pathways of the most informative oxylipins, we speculate that more severe COVID-19 is associated with a selective deficiency of pro-resolving oxylipins leading to ineffective resolutive mechanisms of inflammation, likely worsened by endothelial damage. We believe that our oxylipin data suggest the possibility to predict the evolution of COVID-19 in individual patients at an early stage.

Recent studies suggest that PP in spontaneously breathing, nonintubated patients with acute respiratory failure is well tolerated and improves oxygenation. However, little is known regarding patient triggered ventilation in intubated patients with ARDS undergoing PP. We conducted a retrospective review of our experience with placing patients in the prone position in 2 cohorts of subjects with moderate and severe ARDS (ie, one cohort with ARDS related to COVID-19, the other with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19), many of whom were receiving pressure support ventilation (PSV). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis in a single 22-bed mixed ICU. The subjects included in the analysis were &#8805; 18 y old, met the Berlin definition for moderate or severe ARDS (whether related COVID-19 or not), and underwent PP during invasive ventilation. RESULTS: 39 subjects were included in the analysis: 20 subjects had ARDS related to COVID-19, while 19 had ARDS related to other etiologies. A total of 113 PP episodes were analyzed: 84 during PSV and 29 during volume control continuous mandatory ventilation. PP during PSV was well tolerated and was effective in improving arterial oxygenation (ie, an increase of median [Formula: see text] from 100 mm Hg [interquartile range 75-120] before PP to 135 mm Hg [interquartile range 111-161] at the end of the PP session, P < .0001). No significant difference between continuous mandatory ventilation and PSV was noted regarding arterial oxygenation during PP. Compared with continuous mandatory ventilation mode, PP during PSV was associated with a significant decrease in the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (4% vs 69% of subjects, P < .001), while sedative requirements remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective analysis of consecutive intubated subjects with moderate or severe ARDS, related or not to COVID-19, spontaneous breathing during PP was well tolerated and achieved significant improvement in arterial oxygenation.","Wiart, Adil; Castanares-Zapatero, Diego; Wittebole, Xavier; Maerckx, Guillaume; David, Guillaume; Laterre, Pierre-François; Gerard, Ludovic",Respir Care,92,9

This study analyzed obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality in hospitalized patients younger than 50. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed data of patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized to a large academic hospital system in New York City between March 1, 2020, and May 17, 2020. Data included demographics, comorbidities, BMI, and smoking status. Obesity groups included the following: BMI of 30 to < 40 kg/m2 and BMI &#8805; 40 kg/m2 . Multivariable logistic regression models identified variables independently associated with mortality in patients younger and older than 50. RESULTS: Overall, 3,406 patients were included; 572 (17.0%) patients were younger than 50. In the younger age group, 60 (10.5%) patients died. In the older age group, 1,076 (38.0%) patients died. For the younger population, BMI &#8805; 40 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 5.1; 95% CI: 2.3-11.1). For the older population, BMI &#8805; 40 was also independently associated with mortality to a lesser extent (adjusted odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.3).

Plasma samples of 121 sepsis patients and 60 healthy controls (HCs) were collected, then circ-PRKCI and miR-545 expressions were detected using RT-qPCR. Sepsis patients' demographics, biochemical indexes, medical histories, infection information were recorded. Besides, comprehensive disease scores (APACHE II score and SOFA score) were assessed within 24 h after admission. According to the survival status, 28-day mortality was calculated. Decreased circ-PRKCI expression and increased miR-545 expression were observed in sepsis patients compared to HCs, both of which had close correlations with sepsis risk. Besides, circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with miR-545 in sepsis patients and HCs, respectively. Circ-PRKCI was negatively correlated with serum creatinine, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, APACHE II score, SOFA score, but positively correlated with albumin, which also related to blood stream infection (as primary infection site) and anaerobes infection in sepsis patients. Whereas the miR-545 showed a roughly opposite tendency. Decreased circ-PRKCI and increased miR-545 expressions were discovered in deaths compared to survivors, and both of them had values for predicting 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients, which were slightly lower than the predictive values of APACHE II score and SOFA score for predicting 28-day mortality risk. Multivariate logistic analyses displayed circ-PRKCI as an independent factor predicting decreased 28-day mortality risk. In conclusion, circ-PRCKI insufficiency and miR-545 sufficiency were related to sepsis risk, clinical disease severity and 28-day mortality risk.","Wei, Bohua; Yu, Li",Scand J Clin Lab Invest,92,16

Using immunophenotyping, RNA sequencing, and serum cytokine analysis, we analyzed serial samples from 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of disease severities over 12 weeks from symptom onset. An early robust bystander CD8+ T cell immune response, without systemic inflammation, characterized asymptomatic or mild disease. Hospitalized individuals had delayed bystander responses and systemic inflammation that was already evident near symptom onset, indicating that immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals. Viral load did not correlate with this early pathological response but did correlate with subsequent disease severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities in severe disease correlating with altered inflammatory responses, with signatures associated with increased oxidative phosphorylation replacing those driven by cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6. These late immunometabolic and immune defects may have clinical implications.","Bergamaschi, Laura; Mescia, Federica; Turner, Lorinda; Hanson, Aimee L; Kotagiri, Prasanti; Dunmore, Benjamin J; Ruffieux, Hélène; De Sa, Aloka; Huhn, Oisín; Morgan, Michael D; Gerber, Pehuén Pereyra; Wills, Mark R; Baker, Stephen; Calero-Nieto, Fernando J; Doffinger, Rainer; Dougan, Gordon; Elmer, Anne; Goodfellow, Ian G; Gupta, Ravindra K; Hosmillo, Myra; Hunter, Kelvin; Kingston, Nathalie; Lehner, Paul J; Matheson, Nicholas J; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Petrunkina, Anna M; Richardson, Sylvia; Saunders, Caroline; Thaventhiran, James E D; Toonen, Erik J M; Weekes, Michael P; Göttgens, Berthold; Toshner, Mark; Hess, Christoph; Bradley, John R; Lyons, Paul A; Smith, Kenneth G C",Immunity,92,24

Rapid implementation of treatment modifications was required for patients typically characterized by insecure attachment and vulnerability to separation. AIM: To investigate immediate reactions to the shutdown of services; alternative treatment received; and differences related to age in a clinical sample of patients with PD. DESIGN: A survey performed from June to October 2020 (after the first Covid-19 wave) among 1120 patients from 12 units offering comprehensive group-based PD programs. RESULTS: The response-rate was 12% (N = 133). Negative feelings of anxiety, sadness, and helplessness were noteworthy immediate reactions, but the dominating attitude was accommodation. Younger patients (<26 years) reported more skepticism and less relief. Modified treatment was mainly telephone therapy. Digital therapy was less available, but was more frequent among younger patients. A minority received digital group therapy. Most patients rated the frequency and quality of modified treatments as satisfactory in the given situation, but also worried about own treatment progress, lack of group therapy, and 47% missed seeing the therapist when having telephone consultations. CONCLUSION: The survey confirms a radical modification from comprehensive group-based PD programs to telephone consultations, low availability of digital consultations and group treatments. Taking a short-term, first wave perspective, the survey indicates a noteworthy capacity among poorly functioning patients for accommodating to a clearly challenging situation, as well as considerable concern about treatment progress.","Kvarstein, Elfrida Hartveit; Zahl, Kjell-Einar; Stänicke, Line Indrevoll; Pettersen, Mona Skjeklesaether; Baltzersen, Åse-Line; Johansen, Merete Selsbakk; Eikenaes, Ingeborg Ulltveit-Moe; Arnevik, Espen Ajo; Hummelen, Benjamin; Wilberg, Theresa; Pedersen, Geir",Nord J Psychiatry,92,24

We argue that aggregation of predisposing factors (eg, factors that are defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium or genetic polymorphisms), viral factors (eg, tropism and lytic effects), immune defence factors, and effects of concomitant therapies will determine whether and when the angioinvasion threshold is reached. Management of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should include reducing viral lytic effects, rebalancing immune dysregulation, and systemic and local antifungal therapy.

Method: Children’s hospital nursing early warning system was divided into three modules: hospital nursing early warning platform includes internal and external early warning platform, nursing staff early warning program includes protection, human resources early warning plan and patient early warning program includes outpatient, emergency and ward early warning plan. The data of epidemic training, assessment, prevention and control screening from January to June 2020 were collected from the nursing early warning system to evaluate the application effect of the system. Results: A total of 18 procedures and specifications were formulated, nine hospital-level trainings and about 1000 department-level trainings were organized, two hospital-level assessments (pass rate 95.6% and 98.2%), and 78 nurses were reserved, and 10 popular science articles, five popular science videos were published during the application of the nursing early warning system. A total of 583,435 children and 139,308 caregivers were screened in outpatient, emergency and wards during pre-checks, 2385 suspected cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia were confirmed (0.41%) after the screening and 1 case (0.0002%) was finally confirmed. Conclusion: The nursing early warning system of children’s hospital can prevent and control the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic from each module, ensure early warning and triage of suspected infected patients, reduce the risk of cross-infection in hospital and improve the safety of the children’s hospital medical environment.

Retail pharmacy outlets are the likely facilities for easy access by these patients. The contribution of community pharmacists in these facilities to manage chronic conditions and promote medication adherence during this COVID-19 pandemic will be essential in easing the burden on already strained health systems. This paper highlights the pharmaceutical care practices of community pharmacists for patients with chronic diseases during this pandemic.

After authorizing the use of FFRs certified by other regions of the world, decision-makers in many countries have published alerts, particularly concerning the 'KN95' type. METHODS: This paper investigated the filtration performance of different FFRs using an experimental setup already employed during several studies on FFRs filtration performance. Its high-resolution measuring devices permit to determine filtration performance according to the normative criteria: the pressure drop and the filtration efficiency. Eight different FFRs have been used: four NIOSH-approved FFRs and four not NIOSH-approved with a 'KN95' shape available during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The data show a high disparity between different FFRs purchased by healthcare establishments, and between those that are NIOSH-approved and those that are not NIOSH-approved. The results confirm that the NIOSH certification offers good protection according to the normative criteria. The 'KN95' types present pressure drops which correspond to the normative value, however their efficiencies are lower than the efficiencies of FFRs certified by NIOSH and lower than 95% at the most penetrate particle size. CONCLUSIONS: FFRs marking is not sufficient to conclude on the FFRs' efficiency. Visual inspection can not determine which samples are counterfeit or have manufacturing defects.","Brochot, Clothilde; Saidi, Mohamed N; Bahloul, Ali",Ann. Work Expo. Health,92,1

This article provides clinicians with a distilled understanding of the diagnoses and their epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management. RECENT FINDINGS: Cough-induced headache requires neuroimaging to exclude posterior fossa pathology and recently has been reported as a common symptom in patients with CSF-venous fistula. Clinical overlap is observed between patients with primary exercise headache and primary headache associated with sexual activity. Patients with recurrent thunderclap headache associated with sexual activity should be presumed to have reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome until proven otherwise. De novo external-pressure headache is a common sequela among health care workers using personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily persistent headache is an important mimicker of chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache and is distinguished by a daily-from-onset progression of persistent headache; a treatment-refractory course is often observed, and early involvement of a multidisciplinary team, including a psychotherapist, is advised. SUMMARY: Patients with primary headache disorders that are classified as ""other primary headache disorders"" have presentations with unique diagnostic and management considerations. The disorders are highly recognizable, and an appreciation of the diagnoses will aid clinicians in providing safe and effective care for patients presenting with headache.","Smith, Jonathan H",Continuum (Minneap Minn),92,1

The aim of this review was to systematically review studies examining the efficacy and tolerability of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders among older adults. METHODS: The authors conducted a systematic review, searching PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to English-language articles. The quality of each study was appraised using criteria developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine for randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: A total of 8,785 citations were retrieved and pooled in EndNote and de-duplicated to 3,753. This set was uploaded to Covidence for screening. Two separate screeners (AG and SAF) evaluated the titles, abstracts, and full text of the eligible articles. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, benzodiazepines were associated with decreased anxiety at the end of the study period. The limited tolerability data show mild adverse effects from the benzodiazepines studied. Limitations of the trials included limited data on the long-term use of benzodiazepines for anxiety and a preponderance of trials examining generalized anxiety disorder, with relatively less data on other anxiety disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Benzodiazepines are effective for treating anxiety disorders in late life, at least in the short term, but more data is needed to establish tolerability and their long-term benefits.","Gupta, Aarti; Bhattacharya, Gargi; Farheen, Syeda Arshiya; Funaro, Melissa; Balasubramaniam, Meera; Young, Juan; Tampi, Deena J; Tampi, Rajesh R",Ann Clin Psychiatry,92,1

Trump’s management style, as described in his Art of the Deal, combines a fetishizing of entrepreneurial risk as a “lifestyle” with the insistence that it is not the entrepreneur but his targets who are ultimately exposed to risk. This suggests that we might understand the elevation of “deal-making” to a lifestyle as a characteristic of modernity that, with neoliberalism, is increasingly coming to the fore. Such a critique of modernity, I further argue, is anticipated by Fichte’s Closed Commercial State with its intriguing dialectic of risk. I conclude by arguing that Trump’s politics marks the rise of a new, specifically American style of Fascism—one that demands identification not with the state as supra-individual collective, but with an impersonal system governing over individual lives and rendering them precarious.","Adler, Anthony Curtis",Fudan J.

Additionally, no antiviral drugs or vaccines were developed against the closely related coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV, despite previous zoonotic outbreaks. To identify starting points for such therapeutics, we performed a large-scale screen of electrophile and non-covalent fragments through a combined mass spectrometry and X-ray approach against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one of two cysteine viral proteases essential for viral replication. Our crystallographic screen identified 71 hits that span the entire active site, as well as 3 hits at the dimer interface. These structures reveal routes to rapidly develop more potent inhibitors through merging of covalent and non-covalent fragment hits; one series of low-reactivity, tractable covalent fragments were progressed to discover improved binders. These combined hits offer unprecedented structural and reactivity information for on-going structure-based drug design against SARS-CoV-2 main protease.","Douangamath, Alice; Fearon, Daren; Gehrtz, Paul; Krojer, Tobias; Lukacik, Petra; Owen, C David; Resnick, Efrat; Strain-Damerell, Claire; Aimon, Anthony; Ábrányi-Balogh, Péter; Brandão-Neto, José; Carbery, Anna; Davison, Gemma; Dias, Alexandre; Downes, Thomas D; Dunnett, Louise; Fairhead, Michael; Firth, James D; Jones, S Paul; Keeley, Aaron; Keserü, György M; Klein, Hanna F; Martin, Mathew P; Noble, Martin E M; O039,; Brien, Peter; Powell, Ailsa; Reddi, Rambabu N; Skyner, Rachael; Snee, Matthew; Waring, Michael J; Wild, Conor; London, Nir; von Delft, Frank; Walsh, Martin A",Nat Commun,92,16

METHODS: From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at a tertiary care hospital in Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for 3 months from admission. RESULTS: We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs. 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs. 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs. 15 [45%], p=.03 and 1 [4%] vs. 10 [30%], p=.008). In chest X-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], p<.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs. 19 [58%], p=.003 and 8 [29%] vs. 2 [6%], p=.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (six days [IQR 4-21] vs. 3 [2-4], p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral GGOs and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.","Auvinen, Raija; Nohynek, Hanna; Syrjänen, Ritva; Ollgren, Jukka; Kerttula, Tuija; Mäntylä, Jarkko; Ikonen, Niina; Loginov, Raisa; Haveri, Anu; Kurkela, Satu; Skogberg, Kirsi",Infect Dis (Lond),92,7
333711,333711,333711,The role of chest CT quantitative pulmonary inflammatory index in the evaluation of the course and treatment outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia,15.537199,7.722355,2021,"Health care systems are belligerently responding to the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a specific condition, whose distinctive features are severe hypoxemia associated with (>50% of cases) normal respiratory system compliance. When a patient requires intubation and invasive ventilation, the outcome is poor, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) is usually 2 or 3 weeks. In this article, the authors review several technological devices, which could support health care providers at the bedside to optimize the care for COVID-19 patients who are sedated, paralyzed, and ventilated. Particular attention is provided to the use of videolaryngoscopes (VL) because these can assist anesthetists to perform a successful intubation outside the ICU while protecting health care providers from this viral infection. Authors will also review processed electroencephalographic (EEG) monitors which are used to better titrate sedation and the train-of-four monitors which are utilized to better administer neuromuscular blocking agents in the view of sparing limited pharmacological resources. COVID-19 can rapidly exhaust human and technological resources too within the ICU. This review features a series of technological advancements that can significantly improve the care of patients requiring isolation. The working conditions in isolation could cause gaps or barriers in communication, fatigue, and poor documentation of provided care. The available technology has several advantages including (a) facilitating appropriate paperless documentation and communication between all health care givers working in isolation rooms or large isolation areas; (b) testing patients and staff at the bedside using smart point-of-care diagnostics (SPOCD) to confirm COVID-19 infection; (c) allowing diagnostics and treatment at the bedside through point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) and thromboelastography (TEG); (d) adapting the use of anesthetic machines and the use of volatile anesthetics. Implementing technologies for safeguarding health care providers as well as monitoring the limited pharmacological resources are paramount. Only by leveraging new technologies, it will be possible to sustain and support health care systems during the expected long course of this pandemic.","Rubulotta, Francesca; Soliman-Aboumarie, Hatem; Filbey, Kevin; Geldner, Goetz; Kuck, Kai; Ganau, Mario; Hemmerling, Thomas M",Anesth Analg,92,10

Sarcocysts are formed in the muscles or central nervous system of the intermediate host (IH), while sporocysts develop in the small intestine of the definitive host (DH). Various birds of prey have been confirmed to be DH for Sarcocystis spp. Three Sarcocystis species, S. wobeseri, S. halieti and S. falcatula, have been identified in the muscles of birds of prey, of which the latter are known to be pathogenic and can cause encephalitis in various birds. The aim of this study was to identify Sarcocystis spp. in the muscles of birds of prey from Spain. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2020, muscle tissue samples taken from 59 birds of prey admitted to the Wildlife Recovery Centre in Ilundain (Navarra, Spain) were examined for the presence of Sarcocystis spp. Sarcocysts in fresh squashed samples were morphologically characterized under the light microscope (LM). Sarcocystis spp. were identified by means of 28S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequence analysis. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of squashed tissue samples stained with methylene blue revealed the presence of sarcocysts in three of the 59 (5.1%) birds examined. Only one sarcocyst type was observed under the LM. Sarcocysts were thread-like (1050-2160 × 130-158 µm) and had a thin (0.7-1.4 µm) and smooth cyst wall. Septa divided the cysts into compartments filled with banana-shaped (5.9 × 1.7 µm) bradyzoites. On the basis of DNA sequence results, S. halieti was identified in the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the black kite (Milvus migrans) for the first time. Sarcocysts of S. halieti were shorter and wider compared to those observed in the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the herring gull (Larus argentatus). According to current knowledge, S. halieti may infect birds belonging to four different orders: Suliformes, Charadriiformes, Strigiformes and Accipitriformes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of S. halieti in the western marsh harrier and the black kite as IH. So far, little research has been conducted on birds of prey as IH for Sarcocystis spp. These results indicate that further studies combining morphological, histopathological, and molecular methods are required.","Prakas, Petras; Bea, Antonio; Juozaityte-Ngugu, Evelina; Olano, Iñaki; Villanúa, Diego; Svazas, Saulius; Butkauskas, Dalius",Parasit Vectors,92,20

The present study aims to investigate the self-reported depression status of Chinese university and college students and explore its influencing factors. Methods: We conducted a network-based online survey, and a total of 17,876 participants completed the questionnaire. Depression was measured by the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic analysis were performed to explore the influencing factors of self-reported depression symptoms. Results: The proportion of self-reported depression symptoms, mild self-reported depression symptoms, and moderate to severe (M/S) self-reported depression symptoms was 65.2, 53.7, and 11.5%, respectively. The mean score of self-reported depression was 54.8 ± 9.0. Female, personality type of partial introversion, junior college educational level, ""moderate"" or ""high"" self-perceived risk of infection, ""moderately"" or ""highly"" impacted by the outbreak, and being eager to go back to school were risk factors for M/S self-reported depression symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). While, ""moderate"" or ""high"" concern about the outbreak, ""moderate"" or ""high"" satisfaction with pandemic prevention and control measures, and having health literacy on communicable diseases were protective factors for M/S self-reported depression symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: The status of self-reported depression symptoms among university and college students was severer than expected, and the influencing factors were multifaceted. Government and school administrators should strengthen the dissemination of knowledge on disease prevention and control. Moreover, much attention should be paid to female and junior college students.","Jing, Y.; Han, W.; Wang, Y.; Zhang, J.; Qin, W.; Jing, X.; Niu, A.; Xu, L.",Front Psychiatry,92,16

While masks are known to prevent transmission towards other individuals, it is unclear if different types of facial masks can protect the user from inhalation. The present study compares in-vitro different commercial and custom-made facial masks at different distances and breathing patterns. METHODS: Masks were placed on a head mannequin connected to a lung simulator, using a collecting filter placed after the mannequin airway. Certified, commercial and custom-made masks were tested at three different distances between the emitter and the mannequin: 40 cm, 80 cm and 120 cm. Two patterns of breathing were used, simulating normal and polypneic respiration. A solution of methylene blue was nebulized with a jet nebulizer and different mask-distance-breathing pattern combinations were tested. The primary endpoint was the inhaled fraction, defined as the amount of methylene blue detected with spectrophotometry expressed as percent of the amount detected in a reference condition of zero distance and no mask. FINDINGS: We observed a significant effect of distance (p < 0.001), pattern of breathing (p = 0.040) and type of mask (p < 0.001) on inhaled fraction. All masks resulted in lower inhaled fraction compared to breathing without mask (p < 0.001 in all comparisons), ranging from 41.1% ± 0.3% obtained with a cotton mask at 40 cm distance with polypneic pattern to <1% for certified FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask at all distances and both breathing pattern conditions. DISCUSSION: Distance, type of device and breathing pattern resulted in highly variable inhaled fraction. While the use of all types of masks resulted relevantly less inhalation compared to distancing alone, only high-grade certified devices (FFP3 and the combination of FFP2 + surgical mask) ensured negligible inhaled fraction in all conditions.","Ball, Lorenzo; Alberti, Stefano; Belfortini, Claudio; Almondo, Chiara; Robba, Chiara; Battaglini, Denise; Cravero, Carlo; Pelosi, Paolo; Caratto, Valentina; Ferretti, Maurizio",PLoS One,92,16

Serious health hazards have been described including cardiac diseases, neurological complications, multi-organ failure, and even death. Spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) is rarely described as a result of ecstasy ingestion. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 19-year-old male patient who was admitted to our rehabilitation center, after developing a T11 AIS B SCI/D following recreational use of ecstasy. DISCUSSION: In our case magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive due to artifacts caused by metallic rods used for surgical scoliosis treatment in the past. This individual received no surgical or pharmacological treatments; however, it is questionable whether any specific treatments would have been beneficial. Ecstasy ingestion leads to a serotonin surge and induces microvascular changes. Neurovascular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, de novo aneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture can occur. 5-hydroxytryptamine, which comes from serotonergic terminals, is a very potent vasoconstrictive amine and can thus lead to prolonged vasoconstriction and ischemia. It is most likely that the SCI/D in our case is the result of an ischemic event following the vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion. It is important to stress the possible consequences of recreational ecstasy usage and in unexplained SCI/D, one should consider the possibility of drug-related causes.","Kastaneer, Myrna Elena; Maijers, Maria Christina; Martina, Juan David",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,92,24

The detection and diagnosis have been improved, as well. However, the daily reported cases remaining at a high level make the epidemic trend prediction difficult. METHODS: Since the traditional SEIR model does not evaluate the effectiveness of control strategies, a novel model in line with the current epidemic's process and control measures was proposed, utilizing multisource datasets including the cumulative number of reported, deceased, quarantined and suspected cases. RESULTS: Results show that the trend of the epidemic mainly depends on quarantined and suspected cases. The predicted cumulative numbers of quarantined and suspected cases nearly reached static states, and their inflection points have already been achieved, with the epidemic's peak coming soon. The estimated effective reproduction numbers using model-free and model-based methods are decreasing, as well as new infections, while newly reported cases are increasing. Most infected cases have been quarantined or put in the suspected class, which has been ignored in existing models. CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty analyses reveal that the epidemic is still uncertain, and it is important to continue enhancing the quarantine and isolation strategy and improving the detection rate in mainland China.","Tang, Biao; Xia, Fan; Tang, Sanyi; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Li, Qian; Sun, Xiaodan; Liang, Juhua; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",Int J Infect Dis,92,1

The objective was to review available publications and practice guidelines on management of tracheostomy and laryngectomy in the context of COVID-19. This study performed a review and synthesis of information available in the PubMed database and from national SLP organizations across 6 countries. Observations: From the search, 22 publications on tracheostomy and 3 referring to laryngectomy were identified. After analysis of titles and abstracts followed by full-text review, 4 publications were identified as presenting guidelines for specific approaches to tracheostomy and were selected; all 3 publications on laryngectomy were selected. The main guidelines on tracheostomy described considerations during management (eg, cuff manipulation, suctioning, valve placement) owing to the increased risk of aerosol generation and transmission during swallowing and communication interventions in this population. Regarding laryngectomy, the guidelines focused on the care and protection of both the professional and the patient, offering recommendations on the management of adverse events and leakage of the tracheoesophageal prosthesis.

BACKGROUND: A wide range of evidence has shown that health care workers, currently on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19, are not spared from the psychological and mental health-related consequences of the pandemic. Studies synthesizing the role of coping behaviours, resilience and social support in safeguarding the mental health of health care workers during the pandemic are largely unknown. EVALUATION: This is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis. A total of 31 articles were included in the review. KEY ISSUES: Health care workers utilized both problem-centred and emotion-centred coping to manage the stress associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Coping behaviours, resilience and social support were associated with positive mental and psychological health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of coping behaviours, resilience and social support to preserve psychological and mental health among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: In order to safeguard the mental health of health care workers during the pandemic, hospital and nursing administrators should implement proactive measures to sustain resilience in HCWs, build coping skills and implement creative ways to foster social support in health care workers through theory-based interventions, supportive leadership and fostering a resilient work environment.","Labrague, Leodoro J",J. nurs. manag,92,26

Currently, the global community is facing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 belonging to Betacoronavirus, which appears to be more transmissible but less deadly than SARS-CoV. The current study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors and different evolutionary strategies that were genetically adapted by SARS-CoV-2. Our whole-genome analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendant of Bat SARS/SARS-like CoVs and bats served as a natural reservoir. SARS-CoV-2 used mutations and recombination as crucial strategies in different genomic regions including the envelop, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoproteins to become a novel infectious agent. We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing for genotype adjustment and adaptations in rapidly changing environments. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2, which encompass spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six recombination regions were spotted in the S gene and are undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile this permitted the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to find a way from immune reconnaissance in animals and adapt to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.","Rehman, Saif Ur; Shafique, Laiba; Ihsan, Awais; Liu, Qingyou",Pathogens,92,30

OBJECTIVE: Here we describe the rapid rollout of capabilities by UW Medicine Information Technology Services (ITS) to support our clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic and provide recommendations for health systems to urgently consider, as they plan their own response to this and potentially other future pandemics. METHODS: Our recommendations include establishing a hospital incident command structure that includes tight integration with IT, creating automated dashboards for incident command, optimizing emergency communication to staff and patients, and preparing human resources, security, other policies, and equipment to support the transition of all nonessential staff to telework.We describe how UW Medicine quickly expanded telemedicine capabilities to include most primary care providers and increasing numbers of specialty providers. We look at how we managed expedited change control processes to quickly update electronic health records (EHR) with new COVID-19 laboratory and clinical workflows. We also examine the integration of new technology such as tele-intensive care (ICU) equipment and improved integration with teleconferencing software into our EHR. To support the rapid preparation for COVID-19 at other health systems, we include samples of the UW Medicine's COVID-19 order set, COVID-19 documentation template, dashboard metric categories, and a list of the top 10 things your health care IT organization can do now to prepare. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 response requires new and expedited ways of approaching ITS support to clinical needs. UW Medicine ITS leadership hope that by quickly sharing our nimble response to clinical and operational requests, we can help other systems prepare to respond to this public health emergency.","Grange, Elisha S; Neil, Eric J; Stoffel, Michelle; Singh, Angad P; Tseng, Ethan; Resco-Summers, Kelly; Fellner, B Jane; Lynch, John B; Mathias, Patrick C; Mauritz-Miller, Kristal; Sutton, Paul R; Leu, Michael G",Appl Clin Inform,92,0

The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this considerably further. Further, whether cryptocurrencies provide a diversification for equities is still an unsettled issue. We employ several econometric procedures, including wavelet coherence, and neural network analyses to rigorously examine the role of COVID-19 on the paired co-movements of four cryptocurrencies, with seven equity indices (matching countries particularly impacted by COVID-19). Our period of study includes one year prior to the onset of COVID-19, and one year during the pandemic, extending deeper into the pandemic period (February 2021) than most previous studies. We find co-movements between cryptocurrencies and equity indices gradually increased as COVID-19 progressed. However, most of these co-movements are either modestly positively correlated, or minimal, suggesting cryptocurrencies in general do not provide a diversification benefit during either normal times or downturns. An exception, however, is the co-movement of tether. Tether co-moves negatively with equities to an economically signficant degree, both pre COVID-19, and considerably more during COVID-19. Co-movements between tether and equity indices spiked sharply during identified waves of the pandemic. Tether appears to be an important safe haven during times of market turmoil, consistent with investors seeking USD liquidity during periods of volatility.","Goodell, John W.; Goutte, Stephane",International Review of Financial Analysis,92,24

The RAF at the C8-position of 2AP is noted as the dominant process, which constitutes almost 46.1% of overall reaction routes. The SET mechanism accounts for the second major pathway (39.6%) followed by RAF at the C6-position (14.3%). Formations of 14 transformation products (TPs, i.e., the nonradical end products) in the sonochemical reactions of â¢OH with 2AP have been identified by means of the LC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique. Among the 14 TPs (designated as TP1 to TP14), the lowest and highest mass to charge ratio (m/z) were respectively observed at 129 and 269 in ESI-MS positive ionization mode. The identities of all TPs have been proposed on the basis of elemental composition of [M + H]+ ions and their respective MS-MS fragmentation pattern. Four TPs (including guanine) are considered as obtained directly from primary transients by radical elimination, radical-radical combination/disproportionation reactions. The remaining 10 TPs are postulated as a result of successive self- and/or cross-reactions of primary transients/four first generation TPs with reagents such as â¢OH, O2, and solvent H2O molecules.","Prasanthkumar, Kavanal P; Rayaroth, Manoj P; Alvarez-Idaboy, Juan R",J Phys Chem B,92,6

The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep-learning-based methods. (2) Many public COVID-19 data sets contain only a few images without fine-grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID-19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Meta-Learning with Self-Knowledge Distillation to address the problem of differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self-knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID-19 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID-19 images (347 X-ray?+?2349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X-ray?+?494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine-grained labels of all. Our data set considers not only a bacterial infection or viral infection which causes pneumonia but also a viral infection derived from the influenza virus or coronavirus.","Zheng, Wenbo Yan Lan Gou Chao Zhang Zhi-Cheng Zhang Jun J.; Hu, Ming Wang Fei-Yue",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,92,1

However, it is not economical to install multiple high-performance devices with a great recognition model only for mask recognition, and not fast to use the combination of camera shooting devices and cloud computing. Therefore, this paper put forward an edge-cloud computing system, whose purpose is to use the poor computing resources of the edge server to share the computing pressure of the cloud server. In other words, the recognition tasks are assigned not only to the cloud device but also to the edge devices with poor computing power and a simple recognition model.

In the non-adaptive setting, the most widely used combinatorial objects are disjunct and list-disjunct matrices, which define incidence matrices of test schemes. Disjunct matrices allow the identification of the exact set of defectives, whereas list disjunct matrices identify a small superset of the defectives. Apart from the combinatorial guarantees, it is often of key interest to equip measurement designs with efficient decoding algorithms. The most efficient decoders should run in sublinear time in $n$, and ideally near-linear in the number of measurements $m$. In this work, we give several constructions with an optimal number of measurements and near-optimal decoding time for the most fundamental group testing tasks, as well as for central tasks in the compressed sensing and heavy hitters literature. For many of those tasks, the previous measurement-optimal constructions needed time either quadratic in the number of measurements or linear in the universe size. Most of our results are obtained via a clean and novel approach which avoids list-recoverable codes or related complex techniques which were present in almost every state-of-the-art work on efficiently decodable constructions of such objects.","Cheraghchi, Mahdi; Nakos, Vasileios",,92,16

METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing. As a part of an effort to increase acceptance and uptake of a new vaccine, especially in order to protect children, public health strategies and individual providers should understand caregivers' attitudes toward the approval of a vaccine and consult them appropriately.","Goldman, Ran D; Marneni, Shashidhar R; Seiler, Michelle; Brown, Julie C; Klein, Eileen J; Cotanda, Cristina Parra; Gelernter, Renana; Yan, Tyler D; Hoeffe, Julia; Davis, Adrienne L; Griffiths, Mark A; Hall, Jeanine E; Gualco, Gianluca; Mater, Ahmed; Manzano, Sergio; Thompson, Graham C; Ahmed, Sara; Ali, Samina; Shimizu, Naoki",Clin Ther,92,16

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), a serotonin transporter (Slc6a4), and a microglia maker (Aif1) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Lots of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential. According to our data, we recommend that HCQ be carefully used as a prophylactic drug in people who are susceptible to mental disorders.","Xu, H.; Zhang, X. Y.; Wang, W.

Several methods have been presented to detect COVID-19 disease. Computer vision methods have been widely utilized to detect COVID-19 by using chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. This work introduces a model for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using CT images. A novel handcrafted feature generation technique and a hybrid feature selector are used together to achieve better performance. The primary goal of the proposed framework is to achieve a higher classification accuracy than convolutional neural networks (CNN) using handcrafted features of the CT images. In the proposed framework, there are four fundamental phases, which are preprocessing, fused dynamic sized exemplars based pyramid feature generation, ReliefF, and iterative neighborhood component analysis based feature selection and deep neural network classifier. In the preprocessing phase, CT images are converted into 2D matrices and resized to 256 × 256 sized images. The proposed feature generation network uses dynamic-sized exemplars and pyramid structures together. Two basic feature generation functions are used to extract statistical and textural features. The selected most informative features are forwarded to artificial neural networks (ANN) and deep neural network (DNN) for classification. ANN and DNN models achieved 94.10% and 95.84% classification accuracies respectively.

METHODS: We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS: The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the ""confirmed CFP"" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the ""delay-adjusted CFP,"" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely. If the test strategies depend on age or symptom severity, however, the bias cannot be entirely eliminated. CONCLUSION: Various indicators of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic at population level are used in daily communication. Considering the relevance of the pandemic and the importance of relevant communications, however, the strengths and the limitations of each parameter must be considered carefully.","Gianicolo, Emilio; Riccetti, Nicola; Blettner, Maria; Karch, André",Dtsch Arztebl Int,92,25

Vivli, a non-profit organisation, operates a global platform for sharing of individual participant-level trial data and associated documents. Sharing of these data collected from each trial participant enables combining of these data to drive new scientific insights or assess reproducibility-not possible with the aggregate or summary data tables historically made available. We report on our initial experience including key metrics, lessons learned and how we see our role in the data sharing ecosystem. We also describe how Vivli is addressing the needs of the COVID-19 challenge through a new dedicated portal that provides a direct search function for COVID-19 studies, availability for fast-tracked request review and data sharing. DATA SUMMARY: The Vivli platform was established in 2018 and has partnered with 28 diverse members from industry, academic institutions, government platforms and non-profit foundations. Currently, 5400 trials representing 3.6 million participants are shared on the platform. From July 2018 to September 2020, Vivli received 201 requests. To date, 106 of 201 requests received approval, 5 have been declined, 27 withdrew and 27 are in the revision stage. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has only magnified the necessity for data sharing. If most data are shared and in a manner that allows interoperability, then we have hope of moving towards a cohesive scientific understanding more quickly not only for COVID-19 but also for all diseases. Conversely, if only isolated pockets of data are shared then society loses the opportunity to close vital gaps in our understanding of this rapidly evolving epidemic. This current challenge serves to highlight the value of data sharing platforms-critical enablers that help researchers build on prior knowledge.","Li, Rebecca; Wood, Julie; Baskaran, Amrutha; Neumann, Stanley; Graham, Elizabeth; Levenstein, Marcia; Sim, Ida",BMJ Open,92,24

Quarantine, defined as the separation and restriction of movement of healthy people who have potentially been exposed to the disease, remains contentious especially when the risks and benefits are not fully discussed and not effectively communicated to the people by the organizations who impose this public health measure. Subject and methods: A qualitative evidence synthesis was conducted to examine the phenomenon of adherence to quarantine focused on the following questions: What strategies affect adherence to quarantine? What are the barriers and facilitators to quarantine acceptance? What benefits and harms of quarantine have been described or measured? Results: The evidence synthesis produced 18 findings assessed with high confidence.

Antimalarial peroxides have reported antiviral and anticancer activities. Here, we evaluated the in vitro activities of artesunate (AS) and two ozonides (OZ418 and OZ277) against human &#945;-coronavirus NL63 and ß-coronaviruses OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 in several cell lines. OZ418 had the best selectivity index (SI) in NL63-infected Vero cells and MK2 cells. The overall SI of the tested compounds was cell-type dependent. In OC43-infected human foreskin fibroblasts, AS had the best cell-associated SI, &#8805;17 µM, while the SI of OZ418 and OZ277 was &#8805;12 µM and &#8805;7 µM, respectively. AS did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in either Vero or Calu-3 cells. A comparison of OZ418 and OZ277 activity in SARS-CoV2-infected Calu-3 cells revealed similar EC50 (5.3 µM and 11.6 µM, respectively), higher than the EC50 of remdesivir (1.0 ± 0.1 µM), but the SI of OZ418 was higher than OZ277. A third ozonide, OZ439, inhibited SARS-CoV-2 efficiently in Vero cells, but compared to OZ418 in Calu-3 cells, it showed higher toxicity. Improved inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 was observed when OZ418 was used together with remdesivir. Although the EC50 of ozonides might be clinically achieved in plasma after intravenous administration, sustained virus suppression in tissues will require further considerations, including drug combination. Our work supports the potential repurposing of ozonides and calls for future in vivo models.","Ghosh, Ayan Kumar; Miller, Halli; Knox, Konstance; Kundu, Madhuchhanda; Henrickson, Kelly J; Arav-Boger, Ravit",ACS infect. dis,92,14

Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term 'shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.

In response, a large-scale virtual reality (VR) course was constructed and deployed at Colorado State University for a remote human anatomy course. Enrolled students received a VR capable laptop and head-mounted display and participated in synchronous online laboratory and recitation sessions. The program enabled students to work collaboratively in a common virtual space and learn human anatomy from digital cadavers and volumized medical data (CT and MRI). We hypothesized that VR is an effective method to increase student engagement and knowledge acquisition in human anatomy. Qualitative data was collected on student engagement, confidence, and reactions to the new technology. Quantitative data assessed student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical spatial relationships when using VR and two-dimensional (2D) methods. Results suggested that using VR matched 2D methods in terms of student knowledge acquisition and retention of anatomical relationships. Qualitative data indicated that VR enhanced student engagement and increased opportunities for students to interact with teaching assistants, peers, and the content. Students further reported the unique aspects of the VR program allowed them to explore the content in novel ways. There was a statistically significant increase in student examination scores when compared to previous in-person laboratories. Overall, the virtual classroom maintained the rigor of traditional gross anatomy laboratories without negatively impacting student examination scores and provided a high level of accessibility, without compromising learner engagement. This novel approach provides a highly engaging and interactive solution to distance education.","Heise, Natascha Brown Katelyn Nelson Jordan Eitel Chad Meyer Carolyn Ivie Kenneth Walrond John Clapp Tod",The FASEB Journal,92,14

In patients aged 65 years and older, triage decisions are regularly based on degree of frailty measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). However, the CFS could also be useful in patients younger than 65 years. We aimed to examine the association between CFS score and hospital mortality and between CFS score and admission to intensive care in adult patients of all ages with COVID-19 across Europe. Methods: This analysis was part of the COVID Medication (COMET) study, an international, multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study in 63 hospitals in 11 countries in Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had been admitted to hospital, and either tested positive by PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or were judged to have a high clinical likelihood of having SARS-CoV-2 infection by the local COVID-19 expert team. CFS was used to assess level of frailty: fit (CFS1-3), mildly frail (CFS4-5), or frail (CFS6-9). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was admission to intensive care. Data were analysed using a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for covariates (age, sex, number of drugs prescribed, and type of drug class as a proxy for comorbidities). Findings: Between March 30 and July 15, 2020, 2434 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 55-77]; 1480 [61%] men, 954 [30%] women) had CFS scores available and were included in the analyses. In the total sample and in patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients and mildly frail patients had a significantly higher risk of hospital mortality than fit patients (total sample: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 odds ratio [OR] 2·71 [95% CI 2·04-3·60], p<0·0001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·54 [1·16-2·06], p=0·0030; age &#8805;65 years: CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·90 [2·12-3·97], p<0·0001 and CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·64 [1·20-2·25], p=0·0020). In patients younger than 65 years, an increased hospital mortality risk was only observed in frail patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·22 [1·08-4·57], p=0·030; CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·08 [0·48-2·39], p=0·86). Frail patients had a higher incidence of admission to intensive care than fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·54 [1·21-1·97], p=0·0010), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·71 [0·55-0·92], p=0·0090). Among patients younger than 65 years, frail patients had an increased incidence of admission to intensive care (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 2·96 [1·98-4·43], p<0·0001), whereas mildly frail patients had no significant difference in incidence compared with fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·93 [0·63-1·38], p=0·72). Among patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients had no significant difference in the incidence of admission to intensive care compared with fit patients (CFS6-9 vs CFS1-3 OR 1·27 [0·92-1·75], p=0·14), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS4-5 vs CFS1-3 OR 0·66 [0·47-0·93], p=0·018). Interpretation: The results of this study suggest that CFS score is a suitable risk marker for hospital mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. However, treatment decisions based on the CFS in patients younger than 65 years should be made with caution.

We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m2. Sixteen percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95%CI: 0.25 to 1.06) higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant change in state. A 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was associated with a -1.61 (95%CI: -2.72 to -0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total AF burden for a 5 kg/m2 higher BMI was 0.17 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.68). CONCLUSION: BMI was positively associated with symptoms and negatively associated with one of the two measures of QoL, but not with the total AF burden. However, the strength of association was small and not clinically meaningful.","Koutoukidis, Dimitrios A; Jones, Nicholas R; Taylor, Clare J; Casadei, Barbara; Aveyard, Paul",,92,22

Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube has undergone drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a noninvasive manner. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a US college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. RESULTS: Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between -0.37 and 0.75, all P values less than or equal to .03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between -0.47 and 0.74, all P values less than or equal to .03). Simple machine learning models were shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (mean squared error ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R2 ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrate the feasibility of using pervasive online data to establish noninvasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zhang, Boyu; Zaman, Anis; Silenzio, Vincent; Kautz, Henry; Hoque, Ehsan",JMIR Ment Health,92,1

A key macronutrient proposed to increase hepatosteatosis and NASH risk is fructose. Excessive intake of fructose causes intestinal-barrier deterioration and endotoxaemia. However, how fructose triggers these alterations and their roles in hepatosteatosis and NASH pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we show, using mice, that microbiota-derived Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists promote hepatosteatosis without affecting fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Activation of mucosal-regenerative gp130 signalling, administration of the YAP-induced matricellular protein CCN1 or expression of the antimicrobial peptide Reg3b (beta) peptide counteract fructose-induced barrier deterioration, which depends on endoplasmic-reticulum stress and subsequent endotoxaemia. Endotoxin engages TLR4 to trigger TNF production by liver macrophages, thereby inducing lipogenic enzymes that convert F1P and acetyl-CoA to FA in both mouse and human hepatocytes.","Todoric, Jelena; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Reibe, Saskia; Henstridge, Darren C; Green, Courtney R; Vrbanac, Alison; Ceteci, Fatih; Conche, Claire; McNulty, Reginald; Shalapour, Shabnam; Taniguchi, Koji; Meikle, Peter J; Watrous, Jeramie D; Moranchel, Rafael; Najhawan, Mahan; Jain, Mohit; Liu, Xiao; Kisseleva, Tatiana; Diaz-Meco, Maria T; Moscat, Jorge; Knight, Rob; Greten, Florian R; Lau, Lester F; Metallo, Christian M; Febbraio, Mark A; Karin, Michael",,92,32

The present study aimed to evaluate retrospectively the clinical and chest CT findings of COVID-19 and to analyze CT findings and determine their relationships with clinical severity. METHODS: Chest CT and clinical features of 271 COVID-19 patients were assessed. The presence of CT findings and distribution of parenchymal abnormalities were evaluated, and CT patterns were classified as bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonia (OP), or diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Total extents were assessed using a visual scoring system and artificial intelligence software. Patients were allocated to two groups based on clinical outcomes, that is, to a severe group (requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 55) or a mild group (not requiring O2 therapy or mechanical ventilation, n = 216). Clinical and CT features of these two groups were compared and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: Age, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were significantly different in the two groups. Forty-five of the 271 patients had normal chest CT findings. The most common CT findings among the remaining 226 patients were ground-glass opacity (98%), followed by consolidation (53%). CT findings were classified as OP (93%), DAD (4%), or bronchopneumonia (3%) and all nine patients with DAD pattern were included in the severe group. Uivariate and multivariate analyses showed an elevated procalcitonin (odds ratio [OR], 2.521; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-6.303, P = 0.048), and higher visual CT scores (OR, 1.137; 95% CI, 1.042-1.236; P = 0.003) or higher total extent by AI measurement (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 1.020-1.076; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with a severe clinical course. CONCLUSION: CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia can be classified into OP, DAD, or bronchopneumonia patterns and all patients with DAD pattern were included in severe group.

We also gathered current evidence about the possible effects of RAS in Covid-19, particularly the described cases that course with neurological manifestations. CONCLUSION: Although there are limitations and controversies, the analysis of RAS mechanisms in the CNS certainly represents an interesting field of research. However, further investigation is necessary to support the noteworthy interactions and provide a better comprehension of the cross-talk between RAS and the CNS. Investigations in this research field may shed lights to novel therapeutic targets.","Lanza, Katharina; Dias, Raphael; Dos Santos Oliveira, Rafaela; Belotto, Luís; Miranda, Aline Silva; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Curr. med. chem,92,30

METHODOLOGY: Ninety-seven patients in the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from January 17, 2020 to March 2, 2020 with fecal/perianal swab samples were selected as subjects and the results of real-time fluorescence reverse transcriptase-PCR SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection of fecal/perianal swabs were used to divide subjects into positive and negative groups. RESULTS: Fecal/perianal swabs of 53.61% (52/97) patients were positive including 31 males (59.62%) and 21 females (40.38%). The negative group had more females than males (P = 0.001). The distribution of case classification based on the most severe condition observed after admission was different between groups: five (5.15%) critical type patients were all from the positive group (P = 0.029). There was no statistical difference in clinical manifestations between the groups. In the positive group, the mean nucleic acid-negative conversion time was 14.13 ± 8.61 days, which was significantly later than the negative group (6.98 ± 5.16 days; P < 0.001). In the positive group, 92% (48/52) had nucleic acid-negative conversion with a mean nucleic acid-negative conversion time of 22.58 ± 10.30 days. Among them, 41 (78.85%) cases were delayed compared with pharynx/nasal swab nucleic acid-negative conversion time. CONCLUSIONS: The positive rate of fecal/perianal swab nucleic acid in male patients was higher than that in female patients. Fecal/perianal swab nucleic acid positive may be an indicator of critical conditions in those with COVID-19.","Chen, Gong-Qi; Luo, Wen-Tao; Zhao, Chao-Hui; Li, Chun-Na; Hong, Zhong-Si; Xia, Jin-Yu; Liu, Xi",J Infect Dev Ctries,92,28

We investigated clinical and treatment characteristics of infected medical professionals in a cardiovascular hospital. METHODS: The study was retrospective, conducted in tertiary cardiovascular hospital and included employees with confirmed coronavirus infection. They filled out a questionnaire about health status, symptoms, admission to hospital and treatment. The vaccination status against tuberculosis, hepatitis B and seasonal influenza was assessed. Pneumonia was defined as CT finding of ground glass opacifications (GGO) with consolidations typical for COVID-19. RESULTS: The study included 107 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 out of 726 employees (15%). Most of the infected were from cardiac surgery department (74/107, 69%). Substantial number of employees did not have any symptoms [31 (28.9%)] and 38 patients (35.5%) were admitted to hospital. The average hospital length of stay was 8.1 ± 5.6 days. Seventy-five of 107 (70.1%) received seasonal influenza vaccine. Pneumonia with CT features of GGO and consolidation occurred in 25/107 (23.4%) patients of which 14/107 (13.1%) had bilateral involvement. In multivariate logistic regression analysis including recognized characteristics associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 (obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, current smoking, heart failure, influenza immunization), only influenza immunization remained an independent predictor of occurrence of bilateral pneumonia (OR 0.207; 95%CI[0.050 - 0.847]; p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The association of influenza immunization and less aggressive form of pneumonia might provide a finding that supports the institution of preventive measures that can be beneficial in reduction of global coronavirus burden.","Ilic, Ivan; Zdravkovic, Marina; Timcic, Stefan; Stojanovic, Dragana Unic; Bojic, Milovan; Loncar, Goran",Int. j. infect. dis,92,14

Challenges, strategies, and outcomes associated with online mentoring of graduate students are of primary importance for the individuals within a mentoring dyad and for universities offering online or blended graduate education. The nature of mentoring interactions within an online format presents unique challenges and thus requires strategies specifically adapted to such interactions. There is a need to examine how mentoring relationships have been, and can best be, conducted when little to no faceto-face interaction occurs. This paper undertook a literature review of empirical studies from the last two decades on online master’s and doctoral student mentoring. The main themes were challenges, strategies and best practices, and factors that influence the online mentoring relationship. The findings emphasized the importance of fostering interpersonal aspects of the mentoring relationship, ensuring clarity of expectations and communications as well as competence with technologies, providing access to peer mentor groups or cohorts, and institutional support for online faculty mentors. Within these online mentoring relationships, the faculty member becomes the link to an otherwise absent yet critical experience of academia for the online student, making it imperative to create and foster an effective relationship based on identified strategies and best practices for online mentoring. © 2021","Pollard, R.; Kumar, S.",International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning,92,24

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of participants and analyze the major factors of HIV infection in VCT in Nantong, China. This study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2015, based on the responses to questionnaires and blood test results retrieved from the Chinese National HIV/AIDS Comprehensive Control Information System (CNHCCIS). Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors related to HIV infection. Differences between first-time testers and repeat testers were assessed using the chi-squared or Fisher test. Over six years, a total of 11,560 VCT participants were included, and 420 cases were confirmed to be HIV-positive. Overall, the annual number of participants was relatively stable with a mean of 1927, while there was a rapid increase in the HIV detection rate (from 1.03% in 2010 to 7.52% in 2015). In multivariate analysis, referral counseling and having a HIV-positive spouse/fixed sex partners were found to be significantly associated with HIV infection among all participants, while being unmarried or divorced, having commercial heterosexual behaviors, and male-male sexual behaviors are additional HIV-related factors for males. Compared to first-time testers, repeat testers were more willing to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors and had higher HIV detection rates (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the HIV epidemic in Nantong is still not controlled. Therefore, in the future, it is critical to expand VCT services to increase the detection rate of HIV, which can prevent the transmission of HIV effectively.","Xu, Zhengcheng; Ma, Ping; Chu, Minjie; Chen, Yujia; Miao, Junyan; Xia, Hongli; Zhuang, Xun",Biomed Res Int,92,1

The specific transmission mechanisms end up relying on the knowledge and preferences of the parties involved. Through two online surveys ($n=60$ and $n=250$), we explore the various methods used to transmit sensitive documents, as well as the perceived risk and satisfaction with those methods. We find that users are more likely to recognize risk to data-at-rest after receipt (but not at the sender, namely, themselves). When not using an online portal provided by the recipient, participants primarily envision transmitting sensitive documents in person or via email, and have little experience using secure, privacy-preserving alternatives. Despite recognizing general risks, participants express high privacy satisfaction and convenience with actually experienced situations. These results suggest opportunities to design new solutions to promote securely sending sensitive materials, perhaps as new utilities within standard email workflows.","Warford, Noel; Munyendo, Collins W.; Mediratta, Ashna; Aviv, Adam J.; Maryland, Michelle L.

Advancement in data mining techniques using machine learning (ML) models is paving promising prediction approaches. Data mining is the process of converting massive volumes of raw data created by the healthcare institutions into meaningful information that can aid in making predictions and crucial decisions. Collecting various follow-up data from patients who have had heart failures, analyzing those data, and utilizing several ML models to predict the survival possibility of cardiovascular patients is the key aim of this study. Due to the imbalance of the classes in the dataset, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) has been implemented. Two unsupervised models (K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means clustering) and three supervised classifiers (Random Forest, XGBoost and Decision Tree) have been used in our study. After thorough investigation, our results demonstrate a superior performance of the supervised ML algorithms over unsupervised models. Moreover, we designed and propose a supervised stacked ensemble learning model that can achieve an accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 99.98%. Our study shows that only certain attributes collected from the patients are imperative to successfully predict the surviving possibility post heart failure, using supervised ML algorithms.","Zaman, S.

Items measured behaviors currently established as primary strategies to prevent and reduce the spread of the COVID-19 infection. METHODS: An item pool of 29 questions was generated with the aim of estimating the frequency of specific behaviors and were written to avoid confounding the description of behavioral actions with evaluative judgements. Responses were collected from 401 young adults using an anonymous online survey. RESULTS: An Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted with the purpose of item reduction and subscale development. A 14-item Social Distance Scale emerged, consisting of four subscales: Isolation from Community (IC), Work from Home (WH), Family Contact (FC), and Protective Behaviors (PB). The initial psychometric evaluation of the scales indicated adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability. (4) Conclusions: The Social Distance Scale (v1) is a promising new instrument which may be applied at the population or individual level. It may be used in conjunction with COVID-19 testing to measure interactions between social distancing factors and transmission. In addition, a reliable screening measure has utility for health service providers to assess patient risk and to provide educational/counseling.","Prachthauser, Michaela; Cassisi, Jeffrey E; Le, Thien-An; Nicasio, Andel V",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),92,19

Convalescent plasma may offer treatment, but efficacy and safety are not established. Measuring seroprevalence in donors would inform public health policy. Here, we survey blood services around the world to assess the different research programmes related to COVID-19 planned or in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood collection services were surveyed in June 2020 to determine whether they were participating in serosurveys or convalescent plasma collection and clinical trials. RESULTS: A total of 48 countries (77% of those contacted) responded. Seroprevalence studies are planned or in progress in 73% of countries surveyed and in all continents, including low- and middle-income countries. Most aimed to inform public health policy. Convalescent plasma programmes have been initiated around the globe (79% of surveyed), about three quarters as clinical trials in high-, middle- and low-income countries. CONCLUSION: Blood services around the world have drawn upon their operational capacity to provide much-needed seroprevalence data to inform public health. They have rapidly implemented preparation of potential treatment when few treatments are available and mostly as clinical trials. At the same time, they must continue to provide blood products for recipients despite challenges of working in a state of emergency.

The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days.

After obtaining ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Buea, a questionnaire was administered (May-August 2020) to consenting adults either online or in person. A qualitative thematic analysis was done to analyze the participants' answers to the open questions. A deductive approach was used, that is, the codes and patterns according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) Working Group Matrix of Determinants of vaccine hesitancy. The number of consenting adult Cameroonians who completed the questionnaire were 2512 (Two thousand five hundred and twelve). Vaccine hesitancy to a COVID-19 vaccine was 84.6% in Cameroonians. Using the WHO recommended Matrix of Determinant of Vaccine hesitancy, the most prominent determinants observed in this study were: Communication and Media Environment, Perception of pharmaceutical industry, Reliability and/or source of vaccine and cost. Most Cameroonians agree that even though there are benefits of a clinical trial, they will prefer it should be done out of the continent and involving African scientists for eventual acceptance and uptake.

The three events selected for study include: (i) On January 23, 2020, the first two patients, Chinese nationality, were found infected with covid19;(ii) March 6, 2020: The 17th patient, an international student from the UK, started the wave of covid19 infection in the community in Vietnam;(iii) On March 30, 2020, Vietnam announced the nationwide outbreak of Covid-19 and implemented economic lockdown. The article found that the impact of the three events on pharmaceutical stock prices was sign inconsistency. Cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) is positive after the first and third event is declared but the CAR is negative after the second event is announced. Of the three events, the stock price response to the third was the slowest since CAR (0;7) started to be statistically significant while the other two events CAR (0;2) were statistically significant. The results from this study have added to further insights into the effects of disease on the response of pharmaceutical stock prices.","Lai Cao Mai, Phuong",Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues,92,20

MethodsData from the Mortality Information System were used. Expected deaths for 2020 were estimated from 2015 to 2019 data using a negative binomial log-linear model. ResultsExcess deaths in Brazil in 2020 amounted to 13.7%, and the ratio of excess deaths to COVID-19 deaths was 0.90. Reductions in deaths from cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, and external causes, and an increase in ill-defined causes were all noted. Excess deaths were also found to be heterogeneous, being higher in the Northern, Center-Western, and Northeastern states. In some states, the number of COVID-19 deaths was lower than that of excess deaths, whereas the opposite occurred in others. Moreover, excess deaths were higher in men, in those aged 20 to 59, and in black, yellow, or indigenous individuals. Meanwhile, excess mortality was lower in women, individuals aged 80 years or older, and in whites. Additionally, deaths among those aged 0 to 19 were 7.2% lower than expected, with reduction in mortality from respiratory diseases and external causes. There was also a drop in mortality due to external causes in men and in those aged 20 to 39 years. Furthermore, reductions in deaths from CVD and neoplasms were noted in some states and groups. ConclusionThere is evidence of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths and of the possible impact of restrictive measures in the reduction of deaths from external causes and respiratory diseases. The impacts of COVID-19 on mortality were heterogeneous among the states and groups, revealing that regional, demographic, socioeconomic, and racial differences expose individuals in distinct ways to the risk of death from both COVID-19 and other causes.","Santos, Alcione Miranda dos; Souza, Bruno Feres de; Carvalho, Carolina Abreu de; Campos, Marcos Adriano Garcia; Oliveira, Bruno Luciano Carneiro Alves de; Diniz, Eduardo Moraes; Branco, Maria dos Remedios Freitas Carvalho; Queiroz, Rejane Christine de Sousa; Carvalho, Vitoria Abreu de; Araujo, Waleska Regina Machado; Silva, Antonio Augusto Moura da",,92,3

However, little is known about the relationship between amygdala connectivity and subsequent stress-induced behavior. The current study investigated whether amygdala connectivity measured before experiencing stress is a predisposing neural feature of subsequent stress-induced behavior while individuals face an emergent and unexpected event like the COVID-19 outbreak. Using an fMRI cohort established before the pandemic in Wuhan, Hubei, we found that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the right amygdala with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) was negatively correlated with the stress-induced behavior of these volunteers during the COVID-2019 outbreak in Hubei. Furthermore, the self-connection of the right amygdala, inferred using dynamic causal modeling, was negatively correlated with stress-induced behavior in this cohort. A significant correlation between the right amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and self-connection of the right amygdala was found. Additionally, after three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei when the stressor weakened - and in another cohort collected in regions outside Hubei where the individuals experienced a lower level of stress - the relationship between the amygdala-dmPFC rsFC and the stress-induced behavior disappeared. Our findings support that amygdala connectivity is a predisposing neural feature of stress-induced behavior in the COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei, suggesting the amygdala connectivity before stress predicts subsequent behavior while facing an emergent and unexpected event. And thus our findings provide an avenue for identifying individuals vulnerable to stress using intrinsic brain function before stress as an indicator.","Zhou, Yuan; He, Yuwen; Jin, Yuening; Rong, Bei; Zeidman, Peter; Huang, Huan; Feng, Yuan; Cui, Jian; Zhang, Shudong; Wang, Yun; Wang, Gang; Xiang, Yutao; Wang, Huiling",,92,12

Generally, the inner barrel and syringe of PFS are coated with silicone oil (SO) for lubrication. Multiple studies have focused on the fact that the SO adsorbs denatured antibody molecules, and induces antibody aggregation. Aggregated antibodies are recognized as a potential risk for evoking immunogenic responses in patients. The characteristics of the aggregated antibody-SO complexes, including their concentration, population, shape, three-dimensional (3D) image, and FcÎ³ Receptors (FcÎ³Rs) activation have been obscurely acknowledged so far. In the present work, we prepared aggregated antibody-SO complexes by agitation and analyzed using multifaceted techniques such as flow imaging, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and cell-based assays for FcÎ³Rs activation. The results emphasized that the SO accelerates the increase in sub-visible particles and antibody aggregation. The confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis revealed the high-resolution 3D images of aggregated antibody-SO complexes. The FcÎ³Rs reporter cell assay clarified that the pre-mixed and agitated Ab + SO have higher FcÎ³Rs activation capability compared to the agitated Ab. Overall, this study advances the view that SO has an effect to increase the risk of agitation-induced aggregated antibody particles.","Kiyoshi, Masato; Tada, Minoru; Shibata, Hiroko; Aoyama, Michihiko; Ishii-Watabe, Akiko",J. pharm. sci,92,16

The resulting observational study provides a platform to rapidly disseminate detailed data and insights crucial to improving outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an international, multicentre, observational study of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to ICUs. This is an evolving, open-ended study that commenced on 1 January 2020 and currently includes >350 sites in over 48 countries. The study enrols patients at the time of ICU admission and follows them to the time of death, hospital discharge or 28 days post-ICU admission, whichever occurs last. Key data, collected via an electronic case report form devised in collaboration with the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium/Short Period Incidence Study of Severe Acute Respiratory Illness networks, include: patient demographic data and risk factors, clinical features, severity of illness and respiratory failure, need for non-invasive and/or mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and associated complications, as well as data on adjunctive therapies.

During the pandemic outbreak, society has become worried about the spread of infections and the shortage of protective equipment. This common fear among the public subsequently deepens each person's fear, increasing their belief in the content reported by the media and thus actively compelling these individuals to engage in the behavior of panic buying. In this study, we explored the effects of the public's risk perception, state anxiety, and trust in social media on the herding effect among individuals. The study was based on an online questionnaire survey and convenience sampling. The results showed that the public's risk perception increased their state anxiety and then deepened their willingness to wait in line for a purchase. In addition, the more people that trust the message delivered by the media, the more actively they will join the queue to buy goods. This study also found that anxiety had a greater impact on the public's willingness to wait for a purchase than trust in social media.

Many patients will require intensive care with ventilatory support. Despite progress and best efforts, the mortality rates projected remain high. Historical data outlook points towards 80% expected fatality for patients progressing to advanced pulmonary disease, even when hospitalized in the intensive care unit. This is particularly true among the patient population over 65. Novel life-saving strategies are desperately needed to mitigate the high mortality that will be associated with the late stage SARS-CoV-2 viral infection associated with the fatal respiratory distress. We hypothesize that the morbidity, severity of the disease, and underlying physiological events leading to mortality are closely linked to the TRPV1 expressing neuronal system (afferent/efferent neurons) in the lungs. TRPV1 expressing cells are responsible for pain transmission, inflammation and immunomodulation throughout the entire pulmonary system and are modulating the processes associated with localized cytokine release (storm) and overall rapid disease progression. We suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting TRPV1 containing nerve fibers in the lungs will modulate the inflammatory and immune signal activity, leading to reduced mortality and better overall outcomes. We also propose to further explore the use of resiniferatoxin (RTX), an ultra-potent TRPV1 agonist currently in clinical trials for cancer and osteoarthritis pain, as a possible ablating agent of TRPV1 positive pulmonary pathways in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease.","Nahama, Alexis; Ramachandran, Roshni; Cisternas, Alvaro Francisco; Ji, Henry",Med Drug Discov,92,1

This occurrence has been rarely reported in the literature and described only in very few case reports. During the surge of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in our region, we noted an increase in the simultaneous occurrence of cardio-cerebral infarction. This led us to explore the possible mechanisms and pathophysiology that could contribute to this increase. The retrospective nature of the study limited us from drawing any conclusion about causation. Rather, we aimed to formulate a hypothesis for future, more rigorous studies. PATIENT CONCERNS: We present an overview of 5 cases of simultaneous cardio-cerebral infarction that we encountered in our emergency department within 1 month. DIAGNOSIS: In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed using an electrocardiogram, assessment of laboratory cardiac markers, and imaging. INTERVENTIONS: In all cases, dual antiplatelet therapy was started and thrombolysis was held, as the condition was considered high risk in most of the patients. Cardiac catheterization lab was not activated either because the patient was unstable or the risk of COVID-19 in staff outweighed the benefit added in patient treatment. OUTCOMES: Two out of 5 patients died because of early complications that lasted for few days. The remaining 3 were discharged from the hospital in moderate functionality for extensive therapy and rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: Early recognition and immediate treatment is important in different scenarios leading to thrombosis as the outcome. Additionally, addressing the unknown risks that could contribute to our traditional understanding of these causative mechanisms is important. The hypothesis of exacerbated damage caused by inflammatory and immunological endothelial systemic damage should further be explored to be able to delineate new possibilities in managing these conditions.","Eskandarani, Rawan; Sahli, Seham; Sawan, Shaima; Alsaeed, Asim",Medicine (Baltimore),92,26

The present manuscript is aimed at specifically describing the echocardiographic assessment of the right ventricle, mainly focusing on the most useful parameters and the time of examination. The RV direct involvement happens quite often due to preferential lung tropism of COVID-19 infection, which is responsible for an interstitial pneumonia characterized also by pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction (and thus an RV afterload increase), often evolving in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The indirect RV involvement may be due to the systemic inflammatory activation, caused by COVID-19, which may affect the overall cardiovascular system mainly by inducing an increase in troponin values and in the sympathetic tone and altering the volemic status (mainly by affecting renal function). Echocardiographic parameters, specifically focused on RV (dimensions and function) and pulmonary circulation (systolic pulmonary arterial pressures, RV wall thickness), are to be measured in a COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure and ARDS. They have been selected on the basis of their feasibility (that is easy to be measured, even in short time) and usefulness for clinical monitoring. It is advisable to measure the same parameters in the single patient (based also on the availability of valid acoustic windows) which are identified in the first examination and repeated in the following ones, to guarantee a reliable monitoring. Information gained from a clinically-guided echocardiographic assessment holds a clinical utility in the single patients when integrated with biohumoral data (indicating systemic activation), blood gas analysis (reflecting COVID-19-induced lung damage) and data on ongoing therapies (in primis ventilatory settings).","Lazzeri, Chiara; Bonizzoli, Manuela; Batacchi, Stefano; Peris, Adriano",Intern. emerg. med,92,1

This is why increasingly in developed countries the first trimester anomaly scan is being offered as part of standard care. We have developed a Virtual Reality (VR) approach to improve the diagnostic abilities of 2D ultrasound. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound datasets are used in VR assessment, enabling real depth perception and unique interaction. The aim of this study is to investigate whether first trimester 3D VR ultrasound is of additional value in terms of diagnostic accuracy for the detection of fetal anomalies. Health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness and also the perspective of both patient and ultrasonographer on the 3D VR modality will be studied. METHODS: Women in the first trimester of a high risk pregnancy for a fetus with a congenital anomaly are eligible for inclusion. This is a randomized controlled trial with two intervention arms. The control group receives 'care as usual': a second trimester 2D advanced ultrasound examination. The intervention group will undergo an additional first trimester 2D and 3D VR ultrasound examination. Following each examination participants will fill in validated questionnaires evaluating their quality of life and healthcare related expenses. Participants' and ultrasonographers' perspectives on the 3D VR ultrasound will be surveyed. The primary outcome will be the detection of fetal anomalies. The additional first trimester 3D VR ultrasound examination will be compared to 'care as usual'. Neonatal or histopathological examinations are considered the gold standard for the detection of congenital anomalies. To reach statistical significance and 80% power with a detection rate of 65% for second trimester ultrasound examination and 70% for the combined detection of first trimester 3D VR and second trimester ultrasound examination, a sample size of 2800 participants is needed. DISCUSSION: First trimester 3D VR detection of fetal anomalies may improve patients' quality of life through reassurance or earlier identification of malformations. Results of this study will provide policymakers and healthcare professionals with the highest level of evidence for cost-effectiveness of first trimester ultrasound using a 3D VR approach.

Higher degrees of vaccine efficacy significantly increased individuals' willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, while a high incidence of minor side effects, a co-pay, and Emergency Use Authorization to fast-track the vaccine decreased willingness. The vaccine manufacturer had no influence on public willingness to vaccinate.

The first one was the pandemic of COVID-19, which brought unprecedented uncertainty and resulted in a dramatic drop in property prices on rental market and hampered growth of the sales market. Another significant event this article is going to examine was the judgment C-724/18 of the European Court of Justice issued on 22 September 2020. The ECJ ruled that the authorisation scheme for short-term rental does not constitute a breach of the freedom of services warranted by the EU. The judgment concerns the legitimacy of the constraints imposed by local authorities on entrepreneurs operating short-term rentals. It also establishes the applicability of the EU's Services Directive (2006/123/EC)1 to short-term rental. The ECJ holds in the judgment that the measure requiring an authorisation for short-term rental aimed at tackling shortage of long-term rental housing represents an overriding reason of public interest and as such it is justified. The article analyses the importance of the ECJ judgment for the market of short-term rentals, in view of the existing legal regulations and in respect of its possible consequences for short-term rental in the EU member states.","Badura, Ewelina PhD",Zbornik Pravnog Fakulteta u Zagrebu,92,16

In addition, adding an on-ramp module that develops basic skills improved students' transfer ability. In the current study, we improved the accuracy of the transfer measurement by identifying and excluding students who interacted with the learning modules differently from what was expected and examined two possible mechanisms by which the on-ramp module could improve student transfer. Based on a two by two framework of self-regulated learning, we hypothesized that students with a performance-avoidance oriented goal are more likely to consistently guess on their initial attempts, leaving a distinctive pattern in the log data and resulting in an underestimation of students' actual transfer ability. We divided the remaining student sample according to whether they passed the on-ramp module before or after accessing the instructional materials and compared their performance to a propensity score-matched sample from a previous semester. Improvement in transfer ability was found to primarily occur among students who passed the on-ramp module before learning. A possible explanation is that the on-ramp module served as an effective reminder for students who already possess the essential skills, but may be insufficient to develop those skills for other students. Our results suggest that online learning modules can be an accurate and flexible tool in assessing students' transfer ability. Further, our results demonstrate that the analysis of online learning data can produce more accurate and insightful results when taking into account details of student learning behavior and learning strategy.","Whitcomb, Kyle M.; Guthrie, Matthew W.; Singh, Chandralekha; Chen, Zhongzhou",,92,29

Many previous approaches examining these phenomena have focused on broad campaigns rather than the small groups responsible for instigating or sustaining them. To reveal latent (i.e., hidden) networks of cooperating accounts, we propose a novel temporal window approach that relies on account interactions and metadata alone. It detects groups of accounts engaging in various behaviours that, in concert, come to execute different goal-based strategies, a number of which we describe. The approach relies upon a pipeline that extracts relevant elements from social media posts, infers connections between accounts based on criteria matching the coordination strategies to build an undirected weighted network of accounts, which is then mined for communities exhibiting high levels of evidence of coordination using a novel community extraction method. We address the temporal aspect of the data by using a windowing mechanism, which may be suitable for near real-time application. We further highlight consistent coordination with a sliding frame across multiple windows and application of a decay factor. Our approach is compared with other recent similar processing approaches and community detection methods and is validated against two relevant datasets with ground truth data, using content, temporal, and network analyses, as well as with the design, training and application of three one-class classifiers built using the ground truth; its utility is furthermore demonstrated in two case studies of contentious online discussions.","Weber, Derek; Neumann, Frank",,92,21

The analysis is based on the application of a modified version of the GTAP model. We simulate mandatory closures in all countries or parts of countries that had imposed them as of 7 April for three-month and six-month cases. For the three-month scenario, we estimate a 20.3% decline of U.S. GDP on an annual basis, or $4.3 trillion. The employment decline of 22.4% in the U.S. for the three-month closure represents 35.2 million workers for that period. If the mandatory closures are extended to six months because of a second wave, these negative impacts would slightly more than double. The employment impacts are slightly greater in percentage terms than the GDP impacts because most service sectors, which are generally more labour-intensive, are more negatively impacted by the closures than are ‘essential’ sectors. Our results should be considered upper-bound estimates given such assumptions as businesses laying off workers no longer paying them wages or salaries. Note also that the article examines the mandatory closures alone and does not factor in any countervailing fiscal or monetary policies.","Walmsley, Terrie Louise; Rose, Adam; Wei, Dan",Appl. Econ.

Although thoracic epidural analgesia provides excellent pain relief, recent trends suggest search for effective alternatives. Systemic morphine is often used as an alternative analgesic technique. However, it does not provide dynamic analgesia and can often impede recovery in patients undergoing major surgery on the abdomen. The authors present the first report of a novel analgesic regimen in this cohort with good outcomes. Methods Five patients undergoing open radical nephrectomy and inferior vena cava exploration received erector spinae plane infusion and intra thecal opioid analgesia at a tertiary care university teaching hospital. Outcomes included dynamic analgesia, length of hospital stay and complications Results Five adult patients undergoing major upper abdominal surgery, who refused thoracic epidural analgesia, received erector spinae plane infusion and intrathecal opioid analgesia. Patients reported effective dynamic analgesia, minimal use of rescue analgesia, early ambulation and enhanced recovery. Conclusion The novel regimen that avoids both epidural analgesia and systemic morphine can be an option in enabling enhanced recovery in this cohort.","Ratnayake, Ashani; Goh, Lihxuan; Woolsey, Lee; Thawale, Roshan; Jackson, Benjamin L; Niraj, G",Scandinavian journal of pain (Online),92,29

An important distinction is the prevalence of ""exposure"" versus ""clinical infectivity,"" which determine the risk versus benefit of modifying potentially highly curative therapies in leukemia. At present, the rate of clinical infection is <1-2% worldwide.

Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analyses were conducted to analyze the impact of corticosteroids on mortality and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance, respectively. We performed a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to control confounding factors.RESULTSOf 774 eligible patients, 409 patients received corticosteroids, with a median time from hospitalization to starting corticosteroids of 1.0 day (IQR 0.0-3.0 days) . As compared with usual care, treatment with corticosteroids was associated with increased rate of myocardial (15.6% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.041) and liver injury (18.3% vs. 9.9%, P = 0.001), of shock (22.0% vs. 12.6%, P < 0.001), of need for mechanical ventilation (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P < 0.001), and increased rate of 28-day all-cause mortality (44.3% vs. 31.0%, P < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid therapy was associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01-2.13, P = 0.045). High dose (>200 mg) and early initiation (&#8804;3 days from hospitalization) of corticosteroid therapy were associated with a higher 28-day mortality rate. Corticosteroid use was also associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance in the competing risk analysis (subhazard ratio 1.59, 95% CI 1.17-2.15, P = 0.003).CONCLUSIONAdministration of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19-related ARDS is associated with increased 28-day mortality and delayed SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA clearance after adjustment for time-varying confounders.FUNDINGNone.","Liu, Jiao; Zhang, Sheng; Dong, Xuan; Li, Zhongyi; Xu, Qianghong; Feng, Huibin; Cai, Jing; Huang, Sisi; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Lidi; Chen, Yizhu; Zhu, Wei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yongan; Wang, Tao; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Annane, Djillali; Qu, Jieming; Chen, Dechang",J Clin Invest,92,20

The current focus of several therapeutic design efforts explores attempts at affecting the binding potential between the two proteins to limit the activity of the virus and disease progression. In this work, we analyze the stability of the spike protein under all possible single-point mutations in the RBD and computationally explore mutations that can affect the binding with the ACE2 enzyme. We unravel the mutation landscape of the receptor region and assess the toxicity potential of single and multi-point mutations, generating insights for future vaccine efforts on mutations that might further stabilize the spike protein and increase its infectivity. We developed a tool, called SpikeMutator, to construct full atomic protein structures of the mutant spike proteins and shared a database of 3800 single-point mutant structures. We analyzed the recent 65,000 reported spike sequences across the globe and observed the emergence of stable multi-point mutant structures. Using the landscape, we searched through 7.5 million possible 2-point mutation combinations and report that the (R355D K424E) mutation produces one of the strongest spike proteins that therapeutic efforts should investigate for the sake of developing effective vaccines.","Smaoui, Mohamed Raef; Yahyaoui, Hamdi",Sci Rep,92,21

Nonetheless, Israel has seen a steady rise in COVID-19 morbidity since June 2021, reaching over 1,000 cases per million by August. This outbreak is attributed to several events that came together: the temporal decline of the vaccines effectiveness (VE); lower effectiveness of the vaccine against the current Delta (B.1.617.2) variant; highly infectiousness of Delta; and temporary halt of mandated NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) or any combination of the above. Using a novel spatial-dynamic model and recent aggregate data from Israel, we examine the extent of the impact of the Delta variant on morbidity and whether it can solely explain the outbreak. We conclude that both Delta infectiousness and waning immunity could have been able to push Israel below the HIT independently, and thus, to mitigate the outbreak effective NPIs are required. Our analysis cautions countries that once vaccines will wane a highly infectious spread is expected, and therefore, the expected decline in the vaccines effectiveness in those countries should be accompanied by another vaccination campaign and effective NPIs.","De-Leon, Hilla; Aran, Dvir",,92,16

Their compliance with infection control measures is a key factor to mitigate the spread of the disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 and their correlates among Jordanian adolescents. An online cross-sectional survey was utilized. A total of 1,054 Jordanian adolescents aged 12-18 completed and returned the survey. Overall, Jordanian adolescents showed a good base of knowledge regarding COVID-19 (regardless of their demographic characteristics) and tended to hold positive attitudes toward the country's curfew and other protective measures. The majority of adolescents reported that television and social media were their main source of information on COVID-19, while few reported receiving such information from their schools. The majority reported practicing effective health protective behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which was significantly predicted by their knowledge and attitudes toward these measures. However, there was a relatively small, yet clinically significant, percentage of adolescents who showed poor knowledge on COVID-19, had negative attitudes toward protective measures, and reported being engaged in risky practices related to infection spread. Tailored efforts are needed to improve the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and practices among adolescents. Raising awareness and promoting positive attitudes are vital to change adolescents' health practices. Policy makers should ensure that school nurses are available in all schools and working to their full scope. School nurses are the eyes and ears of public health and primary care. They are essential members on pandemic preparedness, reopening and reentry planning teams, and can lead health care in schools and practice in a holistic culturally competent proactive manner to address the needs of students.","Dardas, Latefa Ali; Khalaf, Inaam; Nabolsi, Manar; Nassar, Omayyah; Halasa, Suhaila",J Sch Nurs,92,7

This paper provides a techno-economic assessment of an industrial-scale calcium looping (CaL) process with simultaneous TCES and CO2 capture. The process is assumed to make profit by selling dispatchable electricity and by providing CO2 capture services to a certain nearby emitter (i.e., transport and storage of CO2 are not accounted). Thus, the process is connected to two other facilities located nearby: a renewable non-dispatchable energy source that charges the storage and a plant from which the CO2 in its flue gas flow is captured while discharging the storage and producing dispatchable electricity. The process, which offers the possibility of long-term storage at ambient temperature without any significant energy loss, is herein sized for a given daily energy input under certain boundary conditions, which mandate that the charging section runs steadily for one 12-h period per day and that the discharging section can provide a steady output during 24 h per day. Intercoupled mass and energy balances of the process are computed for the different process elements, followed by the sizing of the main process equipment, after which the economics of the process are computed through cost functions widely used and validated in literature. The economic viability of the process is assessed through the breakeven electricity price (BESP), payback period (PBP), and as cost per ton of CO2 captured. The cost of the renewable energy is excluded from the study, although its potential impact on the process costs if included in the system is assessed. The sensitivities of the computed costs to the main process and economic parameters are also assessed. The results show that for the most realistic economic projections, the BESP ranges from 141 to −20 $/MWh for different plant sizes and a lifetime of 20 years. When the same process is assessed as a carbon capture facility, it yields a cost that ranges from 45 to −27 $/tCO2-captured. The cost of investment in the fluidized bed reactors accounts for most of the computed capital expenses, while an increase in the degree of conversion in the carbonator is identified as a technical goal of major importance for reducing the global cost.","Guío-Pérez, Diana Carolina Papadokonstantakis Stavros Pallarès David Johnsson Filip",Energies,92,1
428959,428959,428959,Cytokine storm in COVID-19 and parthenolide: Preclinical evidence,15.52421,8.232421,2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread across the world. At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100 000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DEVELOPMENT: We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term. Cognitive and neuropsychological function should be closely monitored in COVID-19 survivors.","Serrano-Castro, P J; Estivill-Torrús, G; Cabezudo-García, P; Reyes-Bueno, J A; Ciano Petersen, N; Aguilar-Castillo, M J; Suárez-Pérez, J; Jiménez-Hernández, M D; Moya-Molina, M Á; Oliver-Martos, B; Arrabal-Gómez, C; Rodríguez de Fonseca, F",Neurologia,92,16

Consistently, neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitors alleviated the neuropathic pain. Previous studies demonstrated that aripiprazole is capable of modulating NO synthesis and also has been reported its modulatory effect on NF-kB activity. METHODS: Aripiprazole was administered daily to the male Wistar rats at the same time with establishing neuropathic model by I.P. injection of vincristine every 2 days, over 2 weeks. Efficacy of aripiprazole in suppressing the development of neuropathy was evaluated by assessing changes in body weight, mechanical threshold, withdrawal latency, sciatic nerve conduction velocity (SNCV), and compound motor action potential (CMAP) characteristics. Expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation were evaluated by western blotting RESULTS: Rats receiving aripiprazole during neuropathy establishment period demonstrated a normal weight gain pattern, a significantly higher mechanical withdrawal threshold, and SNCV compared to vincristine-treated group. Furthermore, the amplitude and area of CMAP were significantly higher in aripiprazole group. Western blotting demonstrated a significantly reduced expression of nNOS and NF-kB activation in dorsal root ganglia of aripiprazole co-treated rats. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, aripiprazole effectively prevents from vincristine-induced neuropathy by limiting nNOS overexpression and NF-kB hyperactivation.","Khalilzadeh, Mina; Hassanzadeh, Fereshteh; Aghamiri, Helia; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Shafaroodi, Hamed",Cancer chemother. pharmacol,92,29

So far, there is no specific drug or vaccine for COVID-19. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a rapid and sensitive early diagnosis platform, which is of great significance for physical separation of infected persons after rapid diagnosis. Here, we propose a colorimetric/SERS/fluorescence triple-mode biosensor based on AuNPs for the fast selective detection of viral RNA in 40 min. AuNPs with average size of 17 nm were synthesized, and colorimetric, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), and fluorescence signals of sensors are simultaneously detected based on their basic aggregation property and affinity energy to different bio-molecules. The sensor achieves a limit detection of femtomole level in all triple modes, which is 160 fM in absorbance mode, 259 fM in fluorescence mode, and 395 fM in SERS mode. The triple-mode signals of the sensor are verified with each other to make the experimental results more accurate, and the capacity to recognize single-base mismatch in each working mode minimizes the false negative/positive reading of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed sensing platform provides a new way for the fast, sensitive, and selective detection of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Gao, Yakun; Han, Yingkuan; Wang, Chao; Qiang, Le; Gao, Jianwei; Wang, Yanhao; Liu, Hong; Han, Lin; Zhang, Yu",Anal Chim Acta,92,16

This novel virus and its spread affected every aspect of modern medical practice, ranging from investigating transmission of this new pathogen, antigen testing of symptomatic patients, imaging, assessing different treatment regimens and the production of a new vaccine. Imaging played a crucial role in the diagnosis of COVID-19-related lung disease, with plain radiography and CT being the main diagnostic modalities, with ultrasound a useful bedside imaging tool. The accurate and early diagnosis of the disease was not the only issue faced by Radiology Departments across the world; prevention of nosocomial infection, creating capacity with elective imaging suspension, management and protection of the workforce being few of the numerous challenges. The purpose of this manuscript is to present the steps that the Radiology Department of a large urban tertiary facility with a local vulnerable population, undertook to adapt the imaging service and structure, both initially escalating and then de-escalating a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A step-by-step management strategy, effective and sustained staff deployment, imaging management are presented and discussed, to provide a guide for managing a major incident in a radiology department.","Panayiotou, Andreas; Rafailidis, Vasileios; Puttick, Thomas; Satchithananda, Keshthra; Gray, Adam; Sidhu, Paul S",Br J Radiol,92,16

Improvements or worsening in diet quality (IDQ or WDQ) were verified using an exploratory online survey which investigated whether participants (n = 4780) increased or decreased their consumption of food subgroups that mark positive or negative food patterns. Respondents also agreed or disagreed with their beliefs about food safety, cooking skills, family support, home characterization, feelings and behaviors. All factors of influence on the IDQ or WDQ groups were always compared against the general participants (who did not change their diet sufficiently to be classified into these groups). Individuals from the IDQ group spent more time on food (81.4% versus 62.0%), started to cook more often (91.4%), were more confident with their cooking skills (p < 0.01) and positive feelings were at least 2.5 times more prevalent. Adjusted analysis showed the chance to improve diet was 1.39 higher among those who did not feel overworked and increased 1.07 in each additional cooking chore shared between household members. For each additional positive feeling, the odds were 1.41 to IDQ and 0.67 to WDQ. Moreover, for each additional negative feeling the chances for WDQ were 1.21 and 0.90 for IDQ. Those in the WDQ group were more unaware of issues related to contagion during meals, they were not afraid of eating food prepared outside their home and agreed that industrialized food is safer (OR = 1.85). These results highlight the associated factors in improving or worsening diet patterns as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting messages presented in Dietary Guidelines.","Tribst, Alline Artigiani Lima; Tramontt, Cláudia Raulino; Baraldi, Larissa Galastri",Appetite,92,12

We will investigate the development of these psychological disturbances in HCPs at the treatment front line and second line during the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in different countries. Additionally, we will explore whether personal resilience factors and a work-related sense of coherence influence the development of mental health problems in HCPs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to carry out a sequential qualitative-quantitative mixed-methods design study. The quantitative phase consists of a longitudinal online survey based on six validated questionnaires, to be completed at three points in time. A qualitative analysis will follow at the end of the pandemic to comprise at least nine semistructured interviews. The a priori sample size for the survey will be a minimum of 160 participants, which we will extend to 400, to compensate for dropout. Recruitment into the study will be through personal invitations and the 'snowballing' sampling technique. Hierarchical linear regression combined with qualitative data analysis, will facilitate greater understanding of any associations between resilience and mental health issues in HCPs during pandemics.

It can cause mild to critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. In the United States, Black and Hispanic individuals comprise a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths due to COVID-19, likely related to underlying social and healthcare disparities.1,2 There are limited studies identifying predictors of outcome among COVID-19,3 in minority patients. The aim of this study was to identify the predictors of mortality among laboratory confirmed COVID-19 minority patients with severe clinical disease admitted to the ICU. METHODS:Clinical data at the time of ICU admission was extracted from electronic records for a total of 95 sequentially admitted patients to the medical ICU with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses. Demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values that included inflammatory markers, ICU course, mortality and discharge status data were collected. The primary outcome was ICU mortality treated as a binary outcome. Summary characteristics were described based on survival status with a test of significance using ANOVA, kwallis and chisquare as appropriate. A univariate logistic regression was used to identify mortality predictor variables of statistical significance which were then included in a final multivariate regression model. Inflammatory markers were added individually to this finalized model to avoid collinearity. Findings were summarized using odds ratios and confidence intervals. RESULTS:The mean (SD) age was 61.54(14) years, 34(36%) were men, 67(71%) were African Americans and 20 (16%) were Hispanic. Most common comorbidities were hypertension 55 (58%) and diabetes 46 (48%). Fifty-three (56%) were intubated, 23 (25%) required pressor support, and 15 (16%) patients had their initial blood culture positive. Inflammatory markers were elevated in most all patients which was associated with mortality. ICU mortality was 48% (45 patients). Univariate analysis identified age ≥ 65yrs (odds ratio [OR]=1.25;95% CI,1.02-1.52;p= 0.032), higher SOFA scores of 2 and 3{ (OR=1.74, 95% CI ,1.05-2.89,p=0.035) and (OR=1.90,95%CI,1.1-3.29;p=0.024 respectively)}, vasopressor use ( OR=1.77;95%CI,1.44-2.18;p&lt;0.001), severe ARDS (OR=;1.45;95%CI,1.05-2.01;p=0.027), mechanical ventilation use (OR=1.46;95%CI,1.22-1.79;p&lt;0.001), procalcitonin&gt;2.5ng/ml (OR=1.84;95% CI, 95%CI,1.03-3.29;p=0.042), ferritin&gt;2000ng/ml (OR=1.45;95% CI,1.12-1.89;p=0.007), CRP&gt;20mg/dl (OR=1.67 OR=;95CI,1.3-2.13;p&lt;0.001) and LDH&gt;400 (OR=1.68;95%C,1.26-2.23;p&lt;0.001) as predictors of ICU morality. Of these, only age ≥ 65yrs, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor use remained statistically significant independent predictors of mortality in multivariable regression model. CONCLUSIONAmong predominantly minority patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to the ICU, older patients who become intubated, requiring vasopressor support and/or had elevated biomarkers of inflammation had a significantly higher ICU mortality.","Rougui, L.; Weze, K.; Donaldson, S.

Little is known, however, about provider practices for identifying patients who experience financial hardship and the strategies for mitigating hardship and addressing patient needs. In this editorial, we discuss a study of practices within the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. McLouth and colleagues found disparities in the use of screening and financial navigation and reliance on inadequate screening methods. To address these disparities, we emphasize the importance of comprehensive and ongoing financial hardship screening throughout the course of cancer treatment and survivorship care, as well as the necessity of accompanying counseling, navigation, and referrals. We also recommend key attributes of screening tools and a process for systematic implementation within clinical practice. With adverse health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affecting people who are racial or ethnic minorities, uninsured or underinsured, or living in poverty, the need to address medical financial hardship is more urgent than ever, to ensure that all people have an equal opportunity for high quality cancer treatment and survival.See related article by McLouth et al., p. 669.","Yabroff, K Robin; Bradley, Cathy J; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina",Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,92,16

The peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients have increased numbers of neutrophils which are important in controlling the bacterial infections observed in COVID-19. We sought to evaluate the cytotoxic capacity of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients. 34 confirmed COVID-19 patients (29 severe, five mild disease), and nine healthy controls were recruited from the Masih Daneshvari Hospital (Tehran, Iran) from March to May 2020. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells were isolated from whole blood and incubated with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labelled methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the florescence of co-cultures of bacteria and neutrophils and reported as the lag time before exponential growth. The number of viable bacteria was determined after 70 hours as colony-forming units (CFU). The immunophenotype of tested cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Isolated neutrophils have higher surface expression of CD16 and CD62L with negative markers for PMN-MDSC. Bacterial growth in the presence of SA (22 ± 0.9 versus 9.2 ± 0.5 h, P &lt;.01) and PA (12.4 ± 0.6 versus 4.5 ± 0.22, P &lt;.01) was significantly reduced in COVID-19 patients. After 70 h incubation of PMN with bacteria (SA and PA), CFUs were significant increased in COVID-19 patients SA (2.6 ± 0.09 × 108 CFU/mL-severe patients and 1.4 ± 0.06 × 108 CFU/mL-mild patients, P &lt;.001) and PA (2.2 ± 0.09 × 109 CFU/mL-severe patients and 1.6 ± 0.03 × 109 CFU/mL-mild patients, P &lt;.001). Gentamycin proliferation assays confirmed the presence of intracellular bacteria. Reduced bacterial killing by neutrophils from COVID-19 patients may be responsible for the high bacterial yield seen in these patients.","Nomani, M.; Varahram, M.; Tabarsi, P.; Hashemian, S.

The aim of this study was to update the monthly COVID-19 and rehabilitation literature research up to October 31th, 2020. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Methodology described in the second edition of the rapid living systematic review 2020 conducted by Cochrane Rehabilitation REH-COVER action was applied. PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PEDro databases were searched, and papers related to COVID-19 and rehabilitation were retrieved and summarized descriptively. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The database search retrieved 2704 publications. Duplicates were removed, and 1185 unique records were screened for inclusion. After screening titles, abstracts and full-texts, 22 papers were included in the present review. According to OCEBM 2011 Levels of Evidence table, 17 studies (77%) fall within the level of evidence 4 category, while the remainder (23%) are categorized as level of evidence 3. Most studies (N.=19; 86%) provided epidemiological data about the disease natural history/determining factor or the clinical presentation of COVID-19 infection, while only two studies focused on health service organization and intervention efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The most recent published COVID-19 research relevant to rehabilitation primarily provides data on the clinical course and the clinical presentation of the pathology, rather than on rehabilitation interventions or service delivery. Studies with high levels of evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions, long-term monitoring, or new health service organization models are lacking.","Negrini, Francesco; De Sire, Alessandro; Andrenelli, Elisa; Lazzarini, Stefano G; Patrini, Michele; Ceravolo, Maria G",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,92,12

The gradient hydrophobic surface is stable in air, phosphate buffer solution (PBS), and flowing PBS. Additionally, the gradient hydrophobic surface on PYC shows spontaneous droplet motion and much lower flow resistance than bare PYC. Compared to bare PYC, the gradient hydrophobic surface on PYC exhibits better blood compatibility and anti-adhesion performance. The results presented in this paper confirm that creating a gradient hydrophobic surface is an effective way of achieving long-lasting anti-thrombosis property.","Zhang, Quanchao; Yang, Zheng; Deng, Xiaoyan; Peng, Mengxia; Wan, Yizao; Zhou, Jianye; Ouyang, Chenxi; Yao, Fanglian; Luo, Honglin",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,92,16

Speculation is rife about the impact of the crisis on employees. Countries and organizations worldwide have categorized some work as essential and, by extension, other work as nonessential. This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic by examining the relationship between work disruptions (at time 1) and general distress (at time 2) through various work stressors, contrasting the experiences of employees in essential versus nonessential work. For employees with essential jobs, there is a significant indirect effect of work disruptions on general distress through hindrance stressors. This relationship is not found for employees with nonessential jobs. The general distress of these employees is more strongly affected by disruptions through social stressors (here, social isolation). Hence, this study demonstrates how general distress is affected in different ways for employees conducting essential work and those conducting nonessential work. We further highlight the importance of considering social stressors in this relationship, especially for nonessential work. Organizational change communication quality mitigates the relationship between isolation and general distress for employees with nonessential jobs, but not for those with essential jobs.","van Zoonen, Ward; Ter Hoeven, Claartje L",J Bus Psychol,92,26

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 438 adults (200 male and 238 female) were interviewed in the waiting rooms of three primary care medicine outpatient clinics. The participants completed three validated questionnaires: the Italian Adjustment of Risk Perception of Infectious Diseases questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy (GSE) scale, and the Italian Version of Personality Inventory (ITAPI). RESULTS: Only 5% of the respondents believed it likely that they would contract a disease caused by a novel virus in the following months, even though 5.9% considered this probability higher than that of other people of the same age and gender. Gender (P < .04), age (P = .002), and marital status (P = .002) significantly affected the perceived risk of getting a disease caused by a novel virus. Self-efficacy (P < .001), imagination (P < .001), and empathy (P < .001) were significant predictors of perceived personal susceptibility. Self-efficacy (P = .04) and imagination (P = .04) were predictive of perceived comparative susceptibility.

However, the learning curve for laparoscopic para-aortic lymphadenectomy is poorly reported, specifically that for the extraperitoneal approach. METHODS: We examined the learning curve for laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy by cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis by retrospectively analyzing 134 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer who had undergone laparoscopic extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy, including the first case. Data on the surgical factors that improved and were statistically correlated with the number of procedures experienced were extracted and used to create CUSUM curves. RESULTS: The average time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy was 149.4 min to harvest an average of 65.3 para-aortic lymph nodes. Intra- and postoperative complications were observed in nine cases (6.7%). A switch to the transperitoneal approach was necessary in three cases (2.2%). The number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes and the procedure time were strongly correlated with the number of procedures the patient underwent (p < 0.01). The CUSUM curve of the number of harvested para-aortic lymph nodes indicated an inflection point at the 51st case. The procedure time for para-aortic lymphadenectomy stabilized after the 59th case. CUSUM analysis of ""unexpected events,"" including intra- and postoperative complications and switch to the transperitoneal approach, showed an improved incidence at 60 cases and later. CONCLUSION: Gaining proficiency in laparoscopic extraperitoneal thorough para-aortic lymphadenectomy is associated with a long learning curve of over 60 procedures. Careful management is required when introducing the procedure.","Yoshida, Hiroshi; Yamamoto, Megumi; Shigeta, Hiroyuki",Surg Oncol,92,16

RESULTS: Four hundred forty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 18 positive RT-qPCR samples, 14 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 77.7%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is lower in children than in adults. Nevertheless, considering the good values of specificity, negative and positive predictive values this test could be used as a frontline test to obtain quick results, although the negative values with COVID-19 high clinical suspicion should be confirmed using RT-qPCR.","González-Donapetry, Patricia; García-Clemente, Paloma; Bloise, Iván; García-Sánchez, Consuelo; Sánchez Castellano, Miguel Ángel; Romero, María Pilar; Gutiérrez Arroyo, Almudena; Mingorance, Jesús; de Ceano-Vivas La Calle, María; García-Rodriguez, Julio",Pediatr Infect Dis J,92,16

In addition, since ES proteins circulate in the extracellular space, they can be more accessible to drugs than other proteins, which makes ES proteins optimal targets for the development of new and better pharmacological strategies. Monogeneans are a group of parasitic Platyhelminthes that includes some pathogenic species problematic for finfish aquaculture. In the present study, 8297 putative ES proteins from four monogenean species which genomic resources are publicly available were identified and functionally annotated by bioinformatic tools. Additionally, for comparative purposes, ES proteins in other parasitic and free-living platyhelminths were identified. Based on data from the monogenean Gyrodactylus salaris, 15 ES proteins are considered potential drug targets. One of them showed homology to 10 cathepsins with known 3D structure. A docking molecular analysis uncovered that the anthelmintic emodepside shows good affinity to these cathepsins suggesting that emodepside can be experimentally tested as a monogenean's cathepsin inhibitor.","Caña-Bozada, Víctor; Chapa-López, Martha; Díaz-Martín, Rubén D; García-Gasca, Alejandra; Huerta-Ocampo, José Ángel; de Anda-Jáuregui, Guillermo; Morales-Serna, F Neptalí",Infect Genet Evol,92,7

The COVID-19 pandemic leads to several debates regarding the possible risk for healthcare professionals during surgery. SAGES and EAES raised the issue of the transmission of infection through the surgical smoke during laparoscopy. They recommended the use of smoke evacuation devices (SEDs) with CO2 filtering systems. The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of different SEDs evaluating the CO2 environmental dispersion in the operating theater. Methods. We prospectively evaluated the data of 4 group of patients on which we used different SEDs or standard trocars: AIRSEAL system (S1 group), a homemade device (S2 group), an AIRSEAL system + homemade device (S3 group), and with standard trocars and without SED (S4 group). Quantitative analysis of CO2 environmental dispersion was carried out associated to the following data in order to evaluate the pneumoperitoneum variations: a preset insufflation pressure, real intraoperative pneumoperitoneum pressure, operative time, total volume of insufflated CO2, and flow rate index. Results. 16 patients were prospectively enrolled. The [CO2] mean value was 711 ppm, 641 ppm, 593 ppm, and 761 ppm in S1, S2, S3, and S4 groups, respectively. The comparison between data of all groups showed statistically significant differences in the measured ambient CO2 concentration. Conclusion. All tested SEDs seem to be useful to reduce the CO2 environmental dispersion respect to the use of standard trocars. The association of AIRSEAL system and a homemade device seems to be the best solution combining an adequate smoke evacuation and a stable pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery.","Bracale, Umberto; Silvestri, Vania; Pontecorvi, Emanuele; Russo, Immacolata; Triassi, Maria; Cassinotti, Elisa; Merola, Giovanni; Montuori, Paolo; Boni, Luigi; Corcione, Francesco",Surg Innov,92,1

We investigated the immediate consequences of such a lockdown for patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS: Using the Danish nationwide administrative databases, we investigated the incidence of new-onset HF and hospitalizations for worsening HF before and after the lockdown (January 1 to March 11 versus March 12 to March 31) in 2020 versus 2019. We also investigated the mortality for all patients with HF and in COVID-19-infected patients with HF. RESULTS: Rates of new-onset HF between January 1 and March 11 were comparable for 2020 and 2019 (1.83 versus 1.78 per 10 000 person-years; P=0.19), while hospitalizations for worsening HF were slightly higher in 2020 versus 2019 (1.04 versus 0.93 per 1000 person-years; P=0.02). In the lockdown period, rates of new-onset HF diagnoses (1.26 versus 2.25 per 1000 person-years) and of hospitalizations for worsening HF (0.63 versus 0.99 per 1000 person-years) were significantly lower in 2020 versus 2019 (P for both, <0.0001). Mortality was similar before and after the national lockdown for the population with HF. We observed 90 HF patients with diagnosed COVID-19 infection, of whom 37% (95% CI, 23%-50%) died within 15 days. CONCLUSIONS: The number of patients hospitalized with worsening HF or diagnosed with new-onset HF was markedly reduced after lockdown but has not yet impacted mortality in HF patients at a population-based level. However, these data raise concerns for a potential undertreatment of HF currently that may impact prognosis in the longer term.","Andersson, Charlotte; Gerds, Thomas; Fosbøl, Emil; Phelps, Matthew; Andersen, Julie; Lamberts, Morten; Holt, Anders; Butt, Jawad H; Madelaire, Christian; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Schou, Morten",Circ Heart Fail,92,23

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To evaluate trends in online interest, we first examined the frequency of worldwide YouTube searches for ""kidney stones"" from 2015 to 2020. We then queried YouTube with terms related to symptoms and treatment of kidney stones and analyzed English-language videos with over 5,000 views. Quality was assessed using the validated DISCERN instrument. Evidence-based content analysis of video content and viewer comments was performed. RESULTS: Online searches for videos about kidney stones doubled between 2015 and 2019 (P<0.001). We analyzed 102 videos with a median of 46,539 views (range 5024-3,631,322). The mean DISCERN score was 3.0 (SD 1.4) out of 5, indicating ""moderate"" quality; scores were significantly higher for 21 videos (21%) authored by academic hospitals (mean 3.7 vs. 2.8, p=0.02). Inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims were identified in 23 videos (23%); none of the videos authored by academic institutions contained inaccurate claims. Videos with inaccurate statements had more than double the viewer engagement (viewer-generated comments, ""thumbs up"" and ""thumbs down"" ratings) compared to videos without inaccuracies (p<0.001). Among viewer comments, 43 videos (43%) included comments with inaccurate or non-evidence-based claims, and a large majority (82 videos, 80%) had ""chatbot"" recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in YouTube videos about nephrolithiasis has doubled since 2015. While highly-viewed videos vary widely in quality and accuracy, videos produced by academic hospitals have significantly fewer inaccurate claims. Given the high prevalence of stone disease and poor-quality videos, patients should be directed to evidence-based content online.","Huang, Mitchell M; Winoker, Jared S; Allaf, Mohamad E; Matlaga, Brian R; Koo, Kevin",BJU int,92,26

PRRs typically recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that are usually widely conserved, some even across kingdoms. Here, we report an oomycete-specific family of small secreted cysteine-rich (SCR) proteins that displays divergent patterns of sequence variation in the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans A subclass that includes the conserved effector PcF from Phytophthora cactorum activates immunity in a wide range of plant species. In contrast, the more diverse SCR74 subclass is specific to P. infestans and tends to trigger immune responses only in a limited number of wild potato genotypes. The SCR74 response was recently mapped to a G-type lectin receptor kinase (G-LecRK) locus in the wild potato Solanum microdontum subsp. gigantophyllum. The G-LecRK locus displays a high diversity in Solanum host species compared to other solanaceous plants. We propose that the diversification of the SCR74 proteins in P. infestans is driven by a fast coevolutionary arms race with cell surface immune receptors in wild potato, which contrasts the presumed slower dynamics between conserved apoplastic effectors and PRRs. Understanding the molecular determinants of plant immune responses to these divergent molecular patterns in oomycetes is expected to contribute to deploying multiple layers of disease resistance in crop plants.IMPORTANCE Immune receptors at the plant cell surface can recognize invading microbes. The perceived microbial molecules are typically widely conserved and therefore the matching surface receptors can detect a broad spectrum of pathogens. Here we describe a family of Phytophthora small extracellular proteins that consists of conserved subfamilies that are widely recognized by solanaceous plants. Remarkably, one subclass of SCR74 proteins is highly diverse, restricted to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and is specifically detected in wild potato plants. The diversification of this subfamily exhibits signatures of a coevolutionary arms race with surface receptors in potato. Insights into the molecular interaction between these potato-specific receptors and the recognized Phytophthora proteins are expected to contribute to disease resistance breeding in potato.","Lin, Xiao; Wang, Shumei; de Rond, Laura; Bertolin, Nicoletta; Wouters, Roland H M; Wouters, Doret; Domazakis, Emmanouil; Bitew, Mulusew Kassa; Win, Joe; Dong, Suomeng; Visser, Richard G F; Birch, Paul; Kamoun, Sophien; Vleeshouwers, Vivianne G A A",mBio (Online),92,29

Binning assembled sequences into individual groups, which represent microbial genomes, is the key step and a major challenge in metagenomic research. Both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods have been employed in binning. Genome binning belonging to unsupervised method clusters contigs into individual genome bins by machine learning methods without the assistance of any reference databases. So far a lot of genome binning tools have emerged. Evaluating these genome tools is of great significance to microbiological research. In this study, we evaluate 15 genome binning tools containing 12 original binning tools and 3 refining binning tools by comparing the performance of these tools on chicken gut metagenomic datasets and the first CAMI challenge datasets. RESULTS: For chicken gut metagenomic datasets, original genome binner MetaBat, Groopm2 and Autometa performed better than other original binner, and MetaWrap combined the binning results of them generated the most high-quality genome bins. For CAMI datasets, Groopm2 achieved the highest purity (> 0.9) with good completeness (> 0.8), and reconstructed the most high-quality genome bins among original genome binners. Compared with Groopm2, MetaBat2 had similar performance with higher completeness and lower purity. Genome refining binners DASTool predicated the most high-quality genome bins among all genomes binners. Most genome binner performed well for unique strains. Nonetheless, reconstructing common strains still is a substantial challenge for all genome binner. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we tested a set of currently available, state-of-the-art metagenomics hybrid binning tools and provided a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic binning by comparing range of purity, completeness, adjusted rand index, and the number of high-quality reconstructed bins. Furthermore, available information for future binning strategy were concluded.","Yue, Yi; Huang, Hao; Qi, Zhao; Dou, Hui-Min; Liu, Xin-Yi; Han, Tian-Fei; Chen, Yue; Song, Xiang-Jun; Zhang, You-Hua; Tu, Jian",BMC Bioinformatics,92,3

At the same time, it is also a test of concepts and practices of what good care is and requires, and how quality of care can be accounted for. In this paper, we present our Care-Ethical Model of Quality Enquiry (CEMQUE) and apply it to the case of residential care for older people in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of thinking about care in healthcare and social welfare as a set of separate care acts, we think about care as a complex practice of relational caring, crossed by other practices. Instead of thinking about professional caregivers as functionaries obeying external rules, we think about them as practically wise professionals. Instead of thinking about developing external quality criteria and systems, we think about cultivating (self-)reflective quality awareness. Instead of abstracting from societal forces that make care possible but also limit it, we acknowledge them and find ways to deal with them. Based on these critical insights, the CEMQUE model can be helpful to describe, interrogate, evaluate, and improve existing care practices. It has four entries: (i) the care receiver considered from their humanness, (ii) the caregiver considered from their solicitude, (iii) the care facility considered from its habitability and (iv) the societal, institutional and scholarly context considered from the perspective of the good life, justice and decency. The crux is enabling all these different entries with all their different aspects to be taken into account. In Corona times this turns out to be more crucial than ever.","Timmerman, Guus; Baart, Andries; den Bakker, Jan",Med Health Care Philos,92,31

Despite a plethora of information on the internet, there is little supporting evidence and no human studies. The risk of multiplex ventilation is that ventilation and PEEP effects are largely uncontrollable and depend on the difference between patients' resistance and compliance. It is not clear whether volume control ventilation or pressure control ventilation is safer or more effective. We designed a simulation-based study to allow complete control over the relevant variables to determine the effects of various degrees of resistance-compliance imbalance on tidal volume (VT), end-expiratory lung volume (EELV), and imputed pH. METHODS: Two separate breathing simulators were ventilated with a ventilator using pressure control and volume control ventilation modes. Evidence-based lung models simulated a range of differences in resistance and compliance (6 pairs of simulated patients). Differences in VT, EELV, and imputed pH were recorded. RESULTS: Depending on differences in resistance and compliance, differences in VT ranged from 1% (with equal resistance and compliance) to 79%. Differences in EELV ranged from 2% to 109%, whereas differences in pH ranged from 0% to 5%. Failure due to excessive VT (ie, > 8 mL/kg) did not occur, but failure due to excessive EELV difference (ie, > 10%) was evident in 50% of patient pairs. There was no difference in failure rate between volume control and pressure control ventilation modes. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments confirmed the potential for markedly different ventilation and oxygenation for patients with uneven respiratory system impedances during multiplex ventilation. Three critical problems must be solved to minimize risk: (1) partitioning of inspiratory flow from the ventilator individually between the 2 patients, (2) measurement of VT delivered to each patient, and (3) provision for individual PEEP. We provide suggestions for solving these problems.","Chatburn, Robert L; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoglu, Umur",Respir Care,92,33

We aimed to determine if behavioural responses in a food neophobia test (exposure to a novel total mixed ration) reflected boldness and exploratory personality traits derived from 3 traditional tests (open field, novel human and novel object) in dairy calves. We performed two Principal Component Analyses, one using behaviours from 3 traditional tests (3 factors: 'Bold', 'Exploratory' and 'Active'), and one using behaviours from the food neophobia test (3 factors: 'Eating', 'Inspecting', and 'Avoidance'). A regression analysis determined if individual factor scores from the food neophobia test predicted factor scores from the traditional tests. Contrary to our expectations, 'Avoidance' (latencies to approach and eat the novel food) did not predict boldness trait, and the factors 'Inspecting' (time spent inspecting food and empty buckets) and 'Eating' (time spent eating food and total intake) did not predict exploration trait, but they did predict active trait. These results suggest that the food neophobia test in our study resulted in context-specific behaviours, or that behavioural responses to a novel food present different underlying personality traits. The application of food neophobia to assess specific or generalized personality traits of dairy calves deserves further work.","Costa, Joao H C; Neave, Heather W; Weary, Daniel M; von Keyserlingk, Marina A G",Sci Rep,92,24

Although it is still a new subject, there is no research that addresses parents’ physical activity knowledge, needs and recommendations for the physical activity experiences of children with ASD during the COVID-19 outbreak, and offers solutions accordingly. Considering this gap in the literature, the aim of this qualitative study is to explore parents’ perceptions on physical activity for their children with ASD. Participants of the study were 10 parents with children with ASD, who participated in one-to-one semi-structured phone calls. Interview data were analyzed thematically. The analysis of the data revealed three main themes: 1) Possible benefits of physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak, 2) Physical activity barriers during the COVID-19 outbreak, and 3) Recommendations for physical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results revealed that parents thought that physical activities had a positive effect on the development areas of their children with ASD. It was determined that parents want to involve their children in physical activities in the home environment, but they have barriers that they need to overcome.","Esentürk, Oğuz Kaan",Int. J.,92,16

Lockdown because of new coronavirus strain (COVID-19) pandemic has further complicated the issue of hypoglycemia due to limitations in access to food, outpatient clinics, pathological services and medicines. AIM: To assess the factors associated with the risk of hypoglycemia during April-May 2020 lockdown in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed the data retrospectively from 146 patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) reporting to the emergency department (ED) during lockdown period with symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia. RESULTS: The majority of patients were male (90/146) with a mean age of 59.88 ± 10.09 years and a mean random blood glucose level of 57.67 ± 9.00 mg/dL. Two-third of patients (70.83%) had level 1 hypoglycemia, while level 2 hypoglycemia was reported in 29.16% of patients. A combination of Metformin and Sulfonylureas (SU) was most commonly associated with the risk of hypoglycemia (65.75%) followed by insulin (33.56%). Subjects who received insulin reported a lower blood glucose value (50.75 ± 8.20 mg/dL) as compared to those receiving a combination of metformin and SU (60.95 ± 7.10 mg/dl). 330.56% of patients who had received prophylaxis hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg twice a day along with the routine anti-hyperglycemic agents without their dose adjustment reported hypoglycemia. Patients with hypertension, micro-vascular, macro-vascular complications, and coexistent with each other had a higher propensity to the risk of hypoglycemia (46.58%, 33.56%, 23.29%, and 32.88%) respectively. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown has shown to influence the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM, especially those receiving SU, insulin, HCQ especially in patients with associated co-morbidities. Patient education, support, and telemedicine plays a pivotal role to prevent hypoglycemia.","Shah, Kiran; Tiwaskar, Mangesh; Chawla, Purvi; Kale, Mayura; Deshmane, Rajesh; Sowani, Alpana",Diabetes Metab Syndr,92,24

Several reports have described the gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in the infected patients. The systematic review was designed to highlight the gaps in our knowledge about the prevalence and clinical significance of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database and Google articles published in both English and Chinese up to June 3, 2020, using search terms ""Clinical features"", ""2019 novel coronavirus"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""COVID-19"", or ""SARS-Cov-2"". Observational studies, case reports or letters describing the clinical features or observational studies regarding the detection and/or isolation of SARS-Cov-2 viruses in stools were included. RESULTS: A total of 22 publications were finally selected. It was reported that GI symptoms occurred in about 3%-40.7% of patients. GI manifestations included nausea, diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, belching, abdominal distension and GI haemorrhage. Diarrhea was the most common GI symptom. Infected patients had various degrees of liver dysfunction, and the severity of liver dysfunction was significantly associated with the severity of the disease. Therapy focusing on digestive system like liver supportive therapy or nutrition support or probiotics have been demonstrated to be effective interventions, which greatly improve prognosis. Fecal-oral transmission route is a potential risk for transmission. CONCLUSIONS: GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Strengthening the recognition on abnormalities in digestive system of patients with COVID-19 is crucial for early identification and timely treatment, especially for those atypical patients.

Currently in the spotlight as vital components of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, LNPs play a key role in effectively protecting and transporting mRNA to cells. Liposomes, an early version of LNPs, are a versatile nanomedicine delivery platform. A number of liposomal drugs have been approved and applied to medical practice. Subsequent generations of lipid nanocarriers, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, and cationic lipid-nucleic acid complexes, exhibit more complex architectures and enhanced physical stabilities. With their ability to encapsulate and deliver therapeutics to specific locations within the body and to release their contents at a desired time, LNPs provide a valuable platform for treatment of a variety of diseases. Here, we present a landscape of LNP-related scientific publications, including patents and journal articles, based on analysis of the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific knowledge. Rising trends are identified, such as nanostructured lipid carriers and solid lipid nanoparticles becoming the preferred platforms for numerous formulations. Recent advancements in LNP formulations as drug delivery platforms, such as antitumor and nucleic acid therapeutics and vaccine delivery systems, are discussed. Challenges and growth opportunities are also evaluated in other areas, such as medical imaging, cosmetics, nutrition, and agrochemicals.

DESIGN/SAMPLE: Using qualitative description, in-depth interviews were conducted among Hispanic fathers between the ages of 18 and 24 years, from community-based fatherhood program. The interviews of seven young Hispanic fathers were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The participants' initial and ongoing fears about COVID-19 resulted from not having adequate information about the severity of the disease and how easily one can contract and transmit it to others. They also expressed concerns about the threat of the pandemic on their family's well-being, finances, and employment status. Providing for their families was their main priority, with some continuing to work, despite the risks of becoming infected with COVID-19. Despite their many hardships, fathers found strength in their families and remained hopeful in overcoming the challenges during the pandemic.

Inflammatory factors play vital roles in the pathogenesis of diseases. The interaction between inflammatory factors is extremely complex. Once the dynamics of inflammatory factors are unbalanced, inflammatory responses and cytokine storm syndrome develop, leading to disease exacerbation and even death. Stem cells have become ideal candidates for the treatment of such diseases due to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the mechanisms by which stem cells affect inflammation and immune regulation are still unclear. This article discusses the therapeutic mechanism and potential value of MSCs in the treatment of sepsis and the novel COVID-19, outlines how MSCs mediate innate and acquired immunity at both the cellular and molecular levels, and described the anti-inflammatory mechanisms and related molecular pathways.

Here the localization term is very generic and refers to the idea of breaking up a global assimilation into subproblems. This unsupervised localization technique based on a linearizedstate-observation measure is general and does not rely on any prior information such as relevant spatial scales, empirical cut-off radius or homogeneity assumptions. It automatically segregates the state and observation variables in an optimal number of clusters (otherwise named as subspaces or communities), more amenable to scalable data assimilation.The application of this method does not require underlying block-diagonal structures of prior covariance matrices. In order to deal with inter-cluster connectivity, two alternative data adaptations are proposed. Once the localization is completed, an adaptive covariance diagnosis and tuning is performed within each cluster. Numerical tests show that this approach is less costly and more flexible than a global covariance tuning, and most often results in more accurate background and observations error covariances.","Cheng, Sibo; Argaud, Jean-Philippe; Iooss, Bertrand; Ponccot, Ang'elique; Lucor, Didier",,92,21

It is well recognized that membrane lipoproteins are immunostimulants exerting as LPS and play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory responses upon M. pneumoniae infection. Here, we report that the M. pneumoniae-derived lipids are another proinflammatory agents. Using an antibody-neutralizing assay, RNA interference, or specific inhibitors, we found that TLR4 is essential for M. pneumoniae lipid-induced TNF-&#945; and IL-1ß production. We also demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome, autophagy, and NF-&#954;B-dependent pathways are critical for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, while inhibition of TLR4 significantly abrogates these events. Further characterisation revealed that autophagy-mediated inflammatory responses involved the activation of NF-&#954;B. In addition, the activation of NF-&#954;B also promoted lipid-induced autophagosome formation, as revealed by assays using pharmacological inhibitors, 3-MA and Bay 11-7082, or silencing of atg5 and beclin-1. These findings suggest that, unlike the response to lipoprotein stimulation, the inflammation in response to M. pneumoniae lipids is mediated by the TLR4 pathway, which subsequently initiates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and formation of a positive feedback loop between autophagy and NF-&#954;B signalling cascade, ultimately promoting TNF-&#945; and Il-1ß production in macrophages.","Luo, Haodang; He, Jun; Qin, Lianmei; Chen, Yiwen; Chen, Liesong; Li, Ranhui; Zeng, Yanhua; Zhu, Cuiming; You, Xiaoxing; Wu, Yimou",Clin. exp. immunol,92,24

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to use a poststructural feminist framework to challenge a particular kind of hegemonic reproduction of PE, particularly to explore the notion of ‘Joe Wicks as PE’. Participants and settings: Collaborative autoethnography framed this study and participants included three queer leaning female-identified early/mid-career PE teacher educators. Data collection/analysis: Over the course of eight weeks, we collected and generated a variety of texts individually and collectively. To capture our reactions, we decided to collect data around two ‘prompts’, namely the recorded podcast titled ‘Is Joe Wicks the face of PE?’ of an Association Internationale des Écoles Supérieures d’Éducation Physique (AIESEP) hosted chat, and our participation in a 9 am ‘PE with Joe’ session. We presented the data gathered in this project poetically. Findings: We divided the findings into two parts corresponding with our responses (collaborative autoethnographies) to the two themes, namely ‘We can’t fix this/that’ (aka ‘Banging our heads against a brick wall’) and ‘Joe Wicks as PE’ (aka ‘Feminist killjoys’). Implications: We believe that a poetic representation, in addition to nurturing and amplifying the emotional and lyrical data collected, presented an opportunity to contribute to, and extends this kind of representational style in PE. In addition to this, collaborative autoethnography allowed us as a community to advance scholarship and provides a space for collective empowerment. © 2021 Association for Physical Education.","Lambert, K.; Luguetti, C.; Lynch, S.",Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy,92,1

To reduce the spread of the virus, strict lockdown policies and control measures were put in place all over the world. Due to these enforced limitations, a drastic drop in air pollution and an improvement in air quality were observed. The present study used six air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO and O3) to observe trends before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Nanjing, China. The data were divided into six phases: P1–P3, pre-lockdown (1 October–31 December 2019), lockdown (1 January–31 March 2020), after lockdown (1 April–30 June 2020), P4–P6: the same dates as the lockdown but during 2017, 2018 and 2019. The results indicate that compared with the pre-lockdown phase, the PM10 and PM2.5 average concentrations decreased by –27.71% and –5.09%. Compared with the previous three years, 2017–2019, the reductions in PM10 and PM2.5 were –37.99% and –33.56%, respectively. Among other pollutants, concentrations of SO2 (–32.90%), NO2 (–34.66%) and CO (–16.85%) also decreased during the lockdown, while the concentration of O3 increased by approximately 25.45%. Moreover, compared with the pre- and during lockdown phases, PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 showed decreasing trends while SO2, CO and O3 concentrations increased. These findings present a road map for upcoming studies and provide a new path for policymakers to create policies to improve air quality.","Hasnain, Ahmad Hashmi Muhammad Zaffar Bhatti Uzair Aslam Nadeem Basit Wei Geng Zha Yong Sheng Yehua",Atmosphere,92,23

Although the use and discharge of NBFRs are increasing all over the world, little information is available about their fates and removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This study investigated the occurrence and behavior of 2,4,6-tribromophenyl allyl ether (ATE), 2,3-dibromopropyl tribromophenyl ether (DPTE), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), pentabromobenzyl acrylate (PBBA), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromo-phthalate (TBPH), and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) in a municipal WWTP in Beijing, China. Four of the NBFRs (ATE, BTBPE, TBPH, and DBDPE) were detected in all wastewater and biosolid samples. The dominant compound in both wastewater and biosolid samples was DBDPE, with concentrations in the ranges of 6.4-18 ng/L and 83-288 ng/g dry weight (dw), respectively. A mass flow analysis indicated that the overall removal efficiencies were 31±18% for ATE, 97±1.5% for DPTE, 79±11% for BTBPE, 87±5.3% for TBPH, and 93±3.3% for DBDPE, but the removal efficiency in aqueous phase only ranged from -43 (ATE) to 57% (DBDPE). The low and negative removal efficiencies of ATE were possibly due to the transformation of DPTE during the anaerobic treatment processes. Under the aerobic conditions, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE underwent a very slow biodegradation. A total of 68-91% of the initial mass loadings of ATE, BTBPE, TBPH and DBDPE were found in the biosolid samples, suggesting that the four NBFRs were removed mainly via sorption in the WWTP.The biosolid was a huge reservoir of target NBFRs, and effective removal of NBFRs during treatment in the WWTP is critical.","Wang, Hongping; Liu, Songqing; Zhang, Cunxu; Wan, Yi; Chang, Hong",Water Res,92,14

This provided the opportunity to investigate the role of school-age children and school settings for transmission. METHODS: We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children, teachers and the general working population in Luxembourg during two epidemic waves: a spring wave from March-April 2020 corresponding to general lockdown with schools being closed and May-July 2020 corresponding to schools being open. We assessed the number of secondary transmissions occurring in schools between May and July 2020 using routine contact tracing data. RESULTS: During the first wave in March-April 2020 when schools were closed, the incidence in pupils peaked at 28 per 100,000, while during the second wave in May-July 2020 when schools were open, incidence peaked 100 per 100,000. While incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in adults than in children during the first spring wave, no significant difference was observed during the second wave in early summer. Between May and July 2020, we identified a total of 390 and 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 90,150 school-age children and 11,667 teachers, respectively. We further estimate that 179 primary cases caused 49 secondary cases in schools. While some small clusters of mainly student-to-student transmission within the same class were identified, we did not observe any large outbreaks with multiple generations of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Luxembourg schools was limited during an early summer epidemic wave in 2020. Precautionary measures including physical distancing as well as easy access to testing, systematic contact tracing appears to have been successful in mitigating transmission within educational settings.","Mossong, Joël; Mombaerts, Laurent; Veiber, Lisa; Pastore, Jessica; Coroller, Gwenaëlle Le; Schnell, Michael; Masi, Silvana; Huiart, Laetitia; Wilmes, Paul",BMC Infect Dis,92,16

After detecting a case of infection, rt-PCR was administered to all prisoners (some of whom had been vaccinated 21-23 days previously with a dose of AVChOx1) and to staff. Infection rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations were calculated, as was vaccine effectiveness. ResultsOne hundred and eighty-four asymptomatic prisoners (50.3% vaccinated) and 33 staff were screened. Forty-eight (25.9%) infections by the SCV-B.1.17 variant were recorded in prisoners and none in staff. Infection rates were higher in younger prisoners, immigrants, and those admitted [≥]7 days previously. In all, 22.6% of vaccinated subjects were infected vs. 29.3% of unvaccinated. Vaccine effectiveness was 23%. Only 6.2 cases would have been prevented by vaccinating the unvaccinated individuals. At seven days, the rt-PCR was negative in 46.2% of vaccinated subjects vs. 13.6% of unvaccinated (p = 0.02). DiscussionIn a prison outbreak, a dose of AVChAdOx1 administered 21-23 days earlier did not significantly prevent the occurrence of infections, but did reduce the duration of rt-PCR positivity.

CNS infections in HIV-infected patients are often challenging to diagnose by traditional microbiological testing, impacting treatment and outcome. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances in diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are changing the landscape of microbiological testing, mainly in resource-rich settings. Pathogen discovery techniques offer a hypothesis-free approach to diagnostic testing, yielding comprehensive analysis of microbial genetic material. Given the extent of genetic material produced, deep sequencing tools not only hold promise in the diagnosis of CNS infections but also in defining key pathogenic steps which have previously been unanswered. Significant challenges remain to implementing pathogen discovery techniques in routine clinical practice including cost, expertise and infrastructure needed including laboratory and bioinformatics support, and sample contamination risk. The use in resource-limited regions where the burden of CNS complications due to HIV/AIDS is highest remains poorly defined. Though, major opportunities utilizing pathogen discovery techniques exist to enhance surveillance and diagnosis and improve our understanding of mechanisms of neuroinvasion in CNS conditions associated with HIV.","Thakur, Kiran T",,92,15

Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters often preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) remotely and can be utilised to recognise early clinical deterioration. METHODS: We describe the protocol for a pilot, proof-of-concept, observational study to be conducted in an engineered hotel near London airports, UK. The study is set to continue for the duration of the pandemic. Individuals arriving to London with mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or returning from high-risk areas requiring quarantine, as recommended by the Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 unable to isolate at home will be eligible for a wearable patch to be applied for the duration of their stay. Notifications will be generated should deterioration be detected through the sensor and displayed on a central monitoring hub viewed by nursing staff, allowing for trend deterioration to be noted. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of remote monitoring systems in detecting clinical deterioration for quarantined individuals in a hotel. DISCUSSION: This trial should prove the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a global pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Potential benefits would include reducing infection risk of COVID-19 to healthcare staff, with earlier recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor.

Study Design Mixed methods approach, literature review and audit. Methods First, a literature review of published research studies and second, an audit of studies HCWs have been invited to complete. For the literature review, we searched Medline, PsycINFO and Nexis, webpages of three medical organisations (Royal Society of Medicine, Royal College of Nursing and British Medical Association), and the YouGov website. For the audit, a non-random purposive sample of six HCWs from different London NHS Trusts reviewed email, WhatsApp and SMS messages they received for study invitations. Results The literature review identified 27 studies;the audit identified 70 study invitations. Studies identified by the literature review were largely of poor methodological rigor: only eight studies (30%) provided response rate, one study (4%) reported having ethical approval and one study (4%) reported funding details. There was substantial overlap in the topics measured. In the audit, volunteers received a median of 12 invitations. The largest number of study invitations were for national surveys (n = 23), followed by local surveys (n = 16) and research surveys (n = 8).

Although an optimal medical treatment of COVID-19 remains uncertain, an unprecedented global effort to develop an effective vaccine hopes to restore pre-pandemic conditions. Since cancer patients as a group have been shown to be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19, the development of safe and effective vaccines is crucial. However, cancer patients may be underrepresented in ongoing phase 3 randomised clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, we encourage stakeholders to provide real-time data about the characteristics of recruited participants, including clearly identifiable subgroups, like cancer patients, with sample sizes large enough to determine safety and efficacy. Moreover, we envisage a prompt implementation of suitable registries for pharmacovigilance reporting, in order to monitor the effects of COVID-19 vaccines and immunisation rates in patients with cancer. That said, data extrapolation from other vaccine trials (e.g. anti-influenza virus) showed a favourable safety and efficacy profile for cancer patients. On the basis of the evidence discussed, we believe that the benefits of the vaccination outweigh the risks. Consequently, healthcare authorities should prioritise vaccinations for cancer patients, with the time-point of administration agreed on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology are advocating for cancer patients a high priority status, in the hope of attenuating the consequences of the pandemic in this particularly vulnerable population.","Corti, Chiara; Crimini, Edoardo; Tarantino, Paolo; Pravettoni, Gabriella; Eggermont, Alexander M M; Delaloge, Suzette; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Eur J Cancer,92,16

To study the factors affecting the rate of government securities yields of these countries, regression models using the least squares method and vector autoregression framework, namely the Granger test, were constructed. The models investigate the impact of various independent variables, namely government debt, government budget balance, real effective exchange rate and GDP on profitability of the national bonds. It was proved that in the conditions of the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy, which continually stimulates demand for government securities, internal factors are no longer the main ones in determining the yields on national bonds and, accordingly, the cost of servicing the public debt of the euro area countries. The consequences of the ECB’s monetary policy were most evident in 2020, when unprecedented financial stimulus measures were implemented in the fight against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a drop in government bond yields in Southern Europe to historically low levels. Such a strong dependence of the demand for government bonds and the cost of servicing public debt of Southern European countries on an external factor-the policy of the European Central Bank can lead to serious shocks for national economies in the future, especially when the ECB is forced to abandon the over-expansionary monetary policy. © 2021, Transition Academia Press.

If not effectively addressed, the consequences of such psychological distress can progress to more severe conditions. METHODS: A systematic search of several databases on the effect of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 epidemics on the mental health of HCWs was performed according to both the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the WHO Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research. RESULTS: The 77 reviewed studies highlighted that work organization and individual characteristics can add to mental health risk. Providing adequate training to prevent infection and prepare HCWs to handle the epidemic, strengthening team work to improve organization, and ensuring appropriate protective equipment is available can help prevent risk of psychiatric illness. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring and addressing through tailored interventions the mental health consequences of pandemics in HCWs is necessary.","Ferrara, Maria; Funaro, Melissa C; Vacca, Francesca; Kusmann, Federica; Tedeschini, Enrico; Galeazzi, Gian Maria; Scattoni, Maria Luisa; Starace, Fabrizio",Ann Ist Super Sanita,92,6

We aimed to assess the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of CS in hospitalized patients with TS. All patients with TS were identified from the National Inpatient Sample database from September 2006 to December 2017. The cohort was divided into those with versus without CS and logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of CS and mortality in patients admitted with TS. A total of 260,144 patients with TS were included in our study, of whom 14,703 (6%) were diagnosed with CS. In-hospital mortality in patients with CS was approximately six-fold higher compared with those without CS (23% vs 4%, p <0.01). TS patients with CS had a higher incidence of malignant arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (15.0% vs 4%, p <0.01) and non-shockable cardiac arrests (12% vs 2%, p <0.01). Independent predictors of CS were male gender, Asian and Hispanic ethnicity, increased burden of co-morbidities including congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and chronic diabetes. Independent predictors of mortality were male gender, advanced age, history of congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic liver disease. In conclusion, CS occurs in approximately 6% of patients admitted with TS, in-hospital mortality in TS patients with CS was approximately six-fold higher compared with those without CS (23% vs 4%, p <0.01), male gender and increased burden of co-morbidities at baseline were independent predictors of CS and mortality.","Syed, Moinuddin; Khan, Muhammad Zia; Osman, Mohammed; Alharbi, Anas; Khan, Muhammad Usman; Munir, Muhammad Bilal; Balla, Sudarshan",Am. j. cardiol,92,1

This study presents the demographic and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in a large private healthcare center in Santiago, Chile, during the first month of the pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the demographics, laboratory and clinical characteristics including severity and outcome of all patients diagnosed with Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. SARS-2-CoV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR in nosopharyngeal samples. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality. Clinical and laboratory parameters of hospitalized patients were analyzed regarding their association with the primary outcome. RESULTS: From March 3 to April 4, 2020, 3679 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 in our hospital. Of those, 381 had Covid-19 and were included into this analysis. Most patients (99.2%) were Chileans, 12% returning from recent travel. The median age was 39 years (IQR 31-49) and 52% were female. A total of 88 patients (23.1%) were hospitalized; 18 (3.7%) required ICU and/or died. The overall mortality was 0.7%. Increased body mass index (BMI) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) were independently associated with ICU care or death. CONCLUSION: During the first weeks of the pandemic in Chile, most Covid-19 patients were young, with low rates of hospitalization, ICU requirement, and fatality. BMI and CRP on admission were predictors for severity.

In light of the recent data highlighting an association between COVID-19 and diabetes, a detailed analysis aimed at evaluating ACE2 expression pattern distribution in human pancreas is still lacking. Here, we took advantage of INNODIA network EUnPOD biobank collection to thoroughly analyze ACE2, both at mRNA and protein level, in multiple human pancreatic tissues and using several methodologies. Using multiple reagents and antibodies, we showed that ACE2 is expressed in human pancreatic islets, where it is preferentially expressed in subsets of insulin producing ß-cells. ACE2 is also highly expressed in pancreas microvasculature pericytes and moderately expressed in rare scattered ductal cells. By using different ACE2 antibodies we showed that a recently described short-ACE2 isoform is also prevalently expressed in human ß-cells. Finally, using RT-qPCR, RNA-seq and High-Content imaging screening analysis, we demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines, but not palmitate, increase ACE2 expression in the ß-cell line EndoC-ßH1 and in primary human pancreatic islets. Taken together, our data indicate a potential link between SARS-CoV-2 and diabetes through putative infection of pancreatic microvasculature and/or ductal cells and/or through direct ß-cell virus tropism.","Fignani, Daniela; Licata, Giada; Brusco, Noemi; Nigi, Laura; Grieco, Giuseppina E; Marselli, Lorella; Overbergh, Lut; Gysemans, Conny; Colli, Maikel L; Marchetti, Piero; Mathieu, Chantal; Eizirik, Decio L; Sebastiani, Guido; Dotta, Francesco",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),92,29

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in a representative population-based cohort in Iquitos, one of the regions with the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 in Peru, where a devastating number of cases occurred in March, 2020. METHODS: We did a population-based study of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Iquitos at two timepoints: July 13-18, 2020 (baseline), and Aug 13-18, 2020 (1-month follow-up). We obtained a geographically stratified representative sample of the city population using the 2017 census data, which was updated on Jan 20, 2020. We included people who were inhabitants of Iquitos since COVID-19 was identified in Peru (March 6, 2020) or earlier. We excluded people living in institutions, people receiving any pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, people with any contraindication for phlebotomy, and health workers or individuals living with an active health worker. We tested each participant for IgG and IgM anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech, China). We used survey analysis methods to estimate seroprevalence accounting for the sampling design effect and test performance characteristics. FINDINGS: We identified 726 eligible individuals and enrolled a total of 716 participants (99%), distributed across 40 strata (four districts, two sexes, and five age groups). We excluded ten individuals who: did not have consent from a parent or legal representative (n=3), had moved to Iquitos after March 6, 2020 (n=3), were in transit (n=2), or had respiratory symptoms (n=1). After adjusting for the study sampling effects and sensitivity and specificity of the test, we estimated a seroprevalence of 70% (95% CI 67-73) at baseline and 66% (95% CI 62-70) at 1 month of follow-up, with a test-retest positivity of 65% (95% CI 61-68), and an incidence of new exposures of 2% (95% CI 1-3). We observed significant differences in the seroprevalence between age groups, with participants aged 18-29 years having lower seroprevalence than those aged younger than 12 years (prevalence ratio 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·98]; p=0·029). INTERPRETATION: After the first epidemic peak, Iquitos had one of the highest rates of seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies worldwide. Nevertheless, the city experienced a second wave starting in January, 2021, probably due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 P1 variant, which has shown higher transmissibility and reinfection rates.

ACE2 also facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into host cells. Drugs that interact with the renin-angiotensin system may impact ACE2 expression and COVID-19 pathogenesis; however, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown at this time.

General Practitioners/Family Doctors (GPs/FDs) play a vital role in public vaccination in most countries and they also serve as role models. However, they may not always follow national vaccination policies. This study was carried out in order to ascertain the degree of vaccine hesitancy of GPs and GP trainees in Malta vis-à-vis influenza vaccination and a putative novel COVID-19 vaccine. METHODS: A short, anonymous questionnaire was emailed via the Malta College of Family Doctors. RESULTS: There were 123 responses from 288 GPs (33.3%) and 62 trainees (43.5%). Significantly more will take the influenza vaccine, at all ages. Almost two thirds of GPs are likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine but significantly less (a third) of trainees will. Older doctors were likelier to take this vaccine. The likelihood of taking influenza vaccination was significantly associated with that of taking COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of COVID-19 concerns pertained to insufficient knowledge and concern regarding potential long-term side effects. DISCUSSION: The vaccination rates for COVID-19 are somewhat less than those for influenza uptake. Vaccine hesitancy in the young, and here in young doctors, is a seemingly global youth phenomenon, an unwise insouchance when the possibility of long-term viral complications is considered. An information drive should be mounted with regard to COVID-19 vaccination as well as a campaign to heavily promote annual influenza vaccination.","Grech, Victor; Bonnici, Jason; Zammit, Dorothy",Early Hum Dev,92,24

This prospective study was conducted on patients, in whom clinical and radiological symptoms/signs were in favor of COVID-19 while their first PCR test was negative. Later on, a second RT-PCR was performed and serological evaluation was carried out and results were compared with each other. Out of 707 patients who had been referred to the hospital and were clinically and radiologically suspicious of disease, 137 patients with negative RT-PCR tests entered the study. RT-PCR assay became positive for the second time in 45 (32.8%). Anti-COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in 83 (60.6%) and 86 (62.8%) patients, respectively. Finally, it was determined that serological test was diagnostic in 73% of patients and the diagnostic yield of serology was significantly higher after the first week of illness (54.8% in the first week and 88% after that).

The current report summarizes the challenges and solutions of the transition from an in-person (ie, face-to-face) to a videoconference intervention delivery approach in response to the Coronavirus Disease pandemic. METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists' progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications. In a remote setting, the assistance of caregivers seems particularly beneficial to ensure practice safety.

Social restrictions and distancing shaped in a different way our view of social relationships and behaviours. Like many aspects of daily life, also education has undergone radical changes. Nursing care was strongly affected by the outbreak, not only due to the risks in everyday practice, the heavy workload or the impact on nurses' daily lives outside the healthcare settings, but also because nursing is caring profession and it embeds in its roots the close relationship with the patient, the touch, the patients' body proximity as a way to communicate and to deliver an effective nursing care. All these issues, when brought in nursing education are also a learning opportunity for students and a way to develop their professional identity and to focusing on the nursing role. The COVID-19 outbreak heavily hit the clinical learning environments, as they are healthcare settings. The situation affected students' learning opportunities, since clinical placements were suspended, Universities closed and in-person courses moved into online teaching. While lessons and courses rapidly switched into online teaching, in order to safeguard students' education and faculty's activity, it was not possible to manage the pre-clinical activities, such as simulations and labs, in order to support technical and relational competences. Most of all, it was not possible to arrange the clinical placements due to the uncertainty of the healthcare settings and the social and organizational restrictions to limiting unnecessary accesses to the services, as recommended by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2020.Recently, many authors have explored the issues related to the future of nursing education. In detail, an emerging issue is how it will be possible to educating nurses in a society facing isolation and social distance measures, but at the same time, in a society that needs more and more prepared clinical nurses.","Tomietto, Marco; Comparcini, Dania; Simonetti, Valentina; Cicolini, Giancarlo",Prof Inferm,92,6

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of age on the association between diabetes and mortality in patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Mexico. This retrospective cohort study involved patients aged 20 years or older with symptoms of viral respiratory disease who were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection across the System of Epidemiological Surveillance of Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico from January 1 through November 4, 2020. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for 28-day mortality and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 757,210 patients with COVID-19 (outpatients and inpatients), 120,476 (16%) had diabetes and 80,616 died. Among 878,840 patients without COVID-19 (those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection), 88,235 (10.0%) had diabetes and 20,134 died. Among patients with COVID-19, diabetes was associated with a hazard ratio for death of 1.49 (95% CI 1.47-1.52), adjusting for age, sex, smoking habit, obesity, hypertension, immunodeficiency, and cardiovascular, pulmonary, and chronic renal disease. The strength of the association decreased with age (trend test: P = 0.004). For example, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.12 (95% CI 2.86-3.40) for patients 20-39 years of age; in contrast, the adjusted hazard ratio of death for patients 80 years of age or older was 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.16). The adjusted hazard ratios were 1.66 (95% CI 1.58-1.74) in outpatients and 1.14 (95% CI 1.12-1.16) in inpatients. In hospitalized patients 80 years of age or older, no association was observed between diabetes and COVID-19-related mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI 0.98-1.08). Among patients without COVID-19, the adjusted hazard ratio for death was 1.78 (95% CI 1.73-1.84). In conclusion, in adult patients with COVID-19 in Mexico, the risk of death associated with diabetes decreased with age. No association between diabetes and mortality was observed among inpatients 80 years of age or older. Our findings should be verified in other populations.","Woolcott, Orison O; Castilla-Bancayán, Juan P",Sci Rep,92,15

Emerging cluster detection analysis is a precise way of blunting the spread of COVID-19 as quickly as possible and save lives. To track compliable mobility of COVID-19 on a spatial-temporal scale, this research appropriately analyzed the disparities between spatial-temporal clusters, expectation maximization clustering (EM), and hierarchical clustering (HC) analysis on Texas county-level. Then, based on the outcome of clustering analysis, the sensitive counties are Cottle, Stonewall, Bexar, Tarrant, Dallas, Harris, Jim hogg, and Real, corresponding to Southeast Texas analysis in Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling. The sensitive period took place in the last two quarters in 2020 and the first quarter in 2021. We explored PostSQL application to portray tracking Covid-19 trajectory. We captured 14 social, economic, and environmental impact's indices to perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and minimize multicollinearity. By using the PCA, we extracted five factors related to mortality of COVID-19, involved population and hospitalization, adult population, natural supply, economic condition, air quality or medical care. We established the GWR model to seek the sensitive factors. The result shows that adult population, economic condition, air quality, and medical care are the sensitive factors. Those factors also triggered high increase of COVID-19 mortality. This research provides geographical understanding and solution of controlling COVID-19, reference of implementing geographically targeted ways to track virus mobility, and satisfy for the need of emergency operations plan (EOP).","Zhang, Jinting; Wu, Xiu; Chow, T Edwin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),92,5

METHODS: A structured interview was conducted with parents of living or deceased patients with GD2. Retrospective information obtained included disease presentation, progression, medical and surgical history, medications, family history, management, complications, and cause of death, as well as the impact of disease on families. RESULTS: Data from 23 patients were analyzed (20 deceased and 3 living), showing a mean age at death of 19.2 months, ranging from 3 - 55 months. Fourteen patients were treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 2 were treated with substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 3 underwent bone marrow transplantation. Five patients received Ambroxol and one was on N-acetylcysteine, both considered experimental treatments. Fifteen patients had gastrostomy tubes (G-Tube) placed, while 10 underwent tracheostomies. Neurological disease manifestations included choking episodes, myoclonic jerks, autonomic dysfunction, apnea, seizures and diminished blinking, all of which worsened as disease progressed. CONCLUSIONS: Current available therapies appear to prolong life but do not alter neurological manifestations. Despite aggressive therapeutic interventions, GD2 still remains a progressive disorder with a devastating prognosis, that may benefit from new treatment approaches.","Roshan Lal, Tamanna; Seehra, Gurpreet K; Steward, Alta M; Poffenberger, Chelsie; Ryan, Emory; Tayebi, Nahid; Lopez, Grisel; Sidransky, Ellen",Neurology,92,16

Transmission occurs primarily through direct physical head-to-head contact. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, on March 18, 2020, the Argentinean government established mandatory isolation for an indefinite period. This obligatory isolation interrupted regular classes avoiding direct contact between children, thus affecting the dispersal route of individuals and the evolution of head louse populations. In this study, we evaluated through an online survey how confinement affected the prevalence of lice during lockdown compared to the situation prior to confinement. The survey allowed to discriminate the different control strategies, the number of treatments, and the amount of insects recorded by parents. Data of 1118 children obtained from 627 surveys were analyzed. As the main result, it was observed that prevalence of lice decreased significantly from before (69.6%) to during (43.9%) COVID-19 lockdown. Moreover, head lice infestation was more effectively controlled in households with up to 2 children in comparison to households with 3 or more children. This is the first study that analyzed the prevalence of head lice during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this work demonstrated the impact of social distance in the population dynamics of head lice and how it could affect the control strategies in the future.","Galassi, Federico; Ortega-Insaurralde, Isabel; Adjemian, Victor; Gonzalez-Audino, Paola; Picollo, Maria Inés; Toloza, Ariel Ceferino",Parasitol Res,92,24

Since the very high number of disposable masks being used globally on a daily basis to face the Covid19 pandemic is posing new environmental risks, mainly connected to improper disposal, any possible improvements in the management of this waste stream is very important. In this work their potential use as sound porous absorber is discussed. Surgical face masks are mainly made of polypropylene fibers which show good acoustical properties. Their porous structure was studied through the measurement of some non-acoustic properties: bulk density, fiber diameter, porosity, flow resistivity and tortuosity. Moreover, the sound absorption performance of samples, made of scrapped face masks, with different thicknesses was evaluated using an impedance tube according to ISO 10534-2. The results obtained from the sound absorption spectra and two single indexes, Noise Reduction Coefficient and Sound Absorption Average showed a high sound absorption value over a frequency range of interest. Finally, the sound absorption spectra obtained for surgical face masks were compared with those obtained for fibrous materials currently used in building sector, suggesting that this fibrous waste could act as a possible substitute to traditional ones.","Maderuelo-Sanz, Rubén; Acedo-Fuentes, Patricia; García-Cobos, Francisco José; Sánchez-Delgado, Francisco José; Mota-López, María Isabel; Meneses-Rodríguez, Juan Miguel",Sci Total Environ,92,24

To this end, we used COVID-19 data up to 14 December 2020 and US population health data at the county level. We fit quasi-Poisson regression models using influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population as the independent variable and the COVID-19 mortality rate as the outcome variable. We adjusted for an array of potential confounders using different propensity score regression methods. Results show that, on the county level, influenza vaccination coverage in the elderly population is negatively associated with mortality from COVID-19, using different methodologies for confounding adjustment.

The planned roll-out in the UK will involve vaccinating people in high-risk categories with their first dose immediately, and delivering the second dose 12 weeks later. Here, we provide both a further prespecified pooled analysis of trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and exploratory analyses of the impact on immunogenicity and efficacy of extending the interval between priming and booster doses. In addition, we show the immunogenicity and protection afforded by the first dose, before a booster dose has been offered. METHODS: We present data from three single-blind randomised controlled trials-one phase 1/2 study in the UK (COV001), one phase 2/3 study in the UK (COV002), and a phase 3 study in Brazil (COV003)-and one double-blind phase 1/2 study in South Africa (COV005). As previously described, individuals 18 years and older were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (5â×â1010 viral particles) or a control vaccine or saline placebo. In the UK trial, a subset of participants received a lower dose (2·2â×â1010 viral particles) of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 for the first dose. The primary outcome was virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 disease, defined as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)-positive swab combined with at least one qualifying symptom (fever &#8805;37·8°C, cough, shortness of breath, or anosmia or ageusia) more than 14 days after the second dose. Secondary efficacy analyses included cases occuring at least 22 days after the first dose. Antibody responses measured by immunoassay and by pseudovirus neutralisation were exploratory outcomes. All cases of COVID-19 with a NAAT-positive swab were adjudicated for inclusion in the analysis by a masked independent endpoint review committee. The primary analysis included all participants who were SARS-CoV-2 N protein seronegative at baseline, had had at least 14 days of follow-up after the second dose, and had no evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection from NAAT swabs. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose. The four trials are registered at ISRCTN89951424 (COV003) and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04324606 (COV001), NCT04400838 (COV002), and NCT04444674 (COV005). FINDINGS: Between April 23 and Dec 6, 2020, 24â422 participants were recruited and vaccinated across the four studies, of whom 17â178 were included in the primary analysis (8597 receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and 8581 receiving control vaccine). The data cutoff for these analyses was Dec 7, 2020. 332 NAAT-positive infections met the primary endpoint of symptomatic infection more than 14 days after the second dose. Overall vaccine efficacy more than 14 days after the second dose was 66·7% (95% CI 57·4-74·0), with 84 (1·0%) cases in the 8597 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 248 (2·9%) in the 8581 participants in the control group. There were no hospital admissions for COVID-19 in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group after the initial 21-day exclusion period, and 15 in the control group. 108 (0·9%) of 12â282 participants in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 group and 127 (1·1%) of 11â962 participants in the control group had serious adverse events. There were seven deaths considered unrelated to vaccination (two in the ChAdOx1 nCov-19 group and five in the control group), including one COVID-19-related death in one participant in the control group. Exploratory analyses showed that vaccine efficacy after a single standard dose of vaccine from day 22 to day 90 after vaccination was 76·0% (59·3-85·9). Our modelling analysis indicated that protection did not wane during this initial 3-month period. Similarly, antibody levels were maintained during this period with minimal waning by day 90 (geometric mean ratio [GMR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·59-0·74]). In the participants who received two standard doses, after the second dose, efficacy was higher in those with a longer prime-boost interval (vaccine efficacy 81·3% [95% CI 60·3-91·2] at &#8805;12 weeks) than in those with a short interval (vaccine efficacy 55·1% [33·0-69·9] at <6 weeks). These observations are supported by immunogenicity data that showed binding antibody responses more than two-fold higher after an interval of 12 or more weeks compared with an interval of less than 6 weeks in those who were aged 18-55 years (GMR 2·32 [2·01-2·68]). INTERPRETATION: The results of this primary analysis of two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 were consistent with those seen in the interim analysis of the trials and confirm that the vaccine is efficacious, with results varying by dose interval in exploratory analyses. A 3-month dose interval might have advantages over a programme with a short dose interval for roll-out of a pandemic vaccine to protect the largest number of individuals in the population as early as possible when supplies are scarce, while also improving protection after receiving a second dose.

Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a novel population of innate-like lymphocytes involved in inflammatory liver disease, and their potential role in liver failure remains unclear. AIM: To investigate alteration of circulating MAIT cells and assess its prognostic value in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related liver failure. METHODS: We recruited 55 patients with HBV-related liver failure, 48 patients with chronic hepatitis B and 40 healthy controls (HCs) from Nantong Third People's Hospital Affiliated to Nantong University. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and the percentage and number of circulating MAIT cells were detected by flow cytometry. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-7, IL-12p70, IL-18 and interferon-&#945; were measured by Luminex assay. RESULTS: Circulating MAIT cells were significantly decreased in HBV-related liver failure patients (percentage: 2.00 ± 1.22 vs 5.19 ± 1.27%, P < 0.0001; number: 5.47 ± 4.93 vs 84.43 ± 19.59, P < 0.0001) compared with HCs. More importantly, there was a significant reduction of MAIT cells in patients with middle/late-stage compared with early-stage liver failure. Circulating MAIT cells partially recovered after disease improvement, both in percentage (4.01 ± 1.21 vs 2.04 ± 0.95%, P < 0.0001) and in cell count (17.24 ± 8.56 vs 7.41 ± 4.99, P < 0.0001). The proportion (2.29 ± 1.01 vs 1.58 ± 1.38%, P < 0.05) and number (7.30 ± 5.70 vs 2.94 ± 1.47, P < 0.001) of circulating MAIT cells were significantly higher in the survival group than in the dead/liver transplantation group, and the Kaplan-Meier curve showed that lower expression of circulating MAIT cells (both percentage and cell count) predicted poor overall survival (P < 0.01). Also, the levels of IL-12 (20.26 ± 5.42 pg/mL vs 17.76 ± 2.79 pg/mL, P = 0.01) and IL-18 (1470.05 ± 1525.38 pg/mL vs 362.99 ± 109.64 pg/mL, P < 0.0001) were dramatically increased in HBV-related liver failure patients compared with HCs. CONCLUSION: Circulating MAIT cells may play an important role in the process of HBV-related liver failure and can be an important prognostic marker.","Xue, Hong; Li, Han; Ju, Lin-Ling; Han, Xu-Dong; Cheng, Tiao-Chun; Luo, Xi; Chen, Lin; Shao, Jian-Guo; She, Yong-Jun; Bian, Zhao-Lian",World J Gastroenterol,92,16

This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; p = 0.004; 82% vs 61%; p = 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; p = 0.03; 77% vs 54%; p = 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; p = 0.01; 25% vs 6%; p &#8804; 0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; p = 0.01; 35% vs 65%; p = 0.02, respectively). HCWs who reported signs of depression were less likely to altruistically accept the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients, compared to those who did not (57% vs 74%; p = 0.03). This study aimed to detect factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested that altruistic acceptance of COVID-19 risks is higher among HCWs with positive exposure history to COVID-19 and those with less depressive symptomatology.","Msheik El Khoury, Fatima; Talih, Farid; Khatib, Mohamad F El; Abi Younes, Nadine; Siddik, Midhat; Siddik-Sayyid, Sahar",Libyan J Med,92,24

The subsequent necessary lockdown decreed by the Italian Government had an outstanding impact on the daily life of the entire population, including that of Italian surgical residents' activity. Our survey aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the training programme of Italian surgical residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed a 12-item-electronic anonymous questionnaire on SurveyMonkey© web application. The survey was composed of different sections concerning demographic characteristics and impacts of COVID-19 on the concrete participation in clinical, surgical and research activities. Future perspectives of responders after the pandemic were also investigated. RESULTS: Eighty hundred responses were collected, and 756 questionnaires were considered eligible to be included in the study analysis. Almost 35 and 27% of respondents experienced, respectively, complete interruption of surgical and clinical activities. A subgroup analysis, comparing the COVID-19 impact on clinical activities with demographics data, showed a statistically significant difference related to specialties (p = 0.0062) and Italian regions (p < 0.0001). Moreover, 112 residents have been moved to non-surgical units dealing with COVID-19 or, in some case, they voluntarily decided to interrupt their residency programme to support the ongoing emergency. CONCLUSION: Our survey demonstrated that COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the educational programme of Italian surgical residents. Despite many regional differences, this survey highlighted the overall shortage of planning in the re-allocation of resources facing this unexpected health emergency.","Pertile, Davide; Gallo, Gaetano; Barra, Fabio; Pasculli, Alessandro; Batistotti, Paola; Sparavigna, Marco; Vizzielli, Giuseppe; Soriero, Domenico; Graziano, Giusi; Di Saverio, Salomone; Meniconi, Roberto Luca; Guaitoli, Eleonora; Mazzarri, Andrea",Updates Surg,92,16

Hence, the costs for commercial kits and inputs were overrated, stimulating the development of alternative methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical specimens. The availability of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome at the beginning of the pandemic facilitated the development of specific primers and standardized laboratory protocols for Covid-19 molecular diagnostic. High-sensitive and cost-effective molecular biology technique based on the Melting Temperature differences between purine and pyrimidine bases can be used to the detection and genotyping of pathogens in clinical specimens. Here, a RT-qPCR assays with High Resolution Melting (HRM-RTqPCR) was developed for different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (RdRp, E and N) and an internal control (human RNAse P gene). The assays were validated using synthetic sequences from the viral genome and clinical specimens (nasopharyngeal swabs, serum and saliva) of sixty-five patients with severe or moderate COVID-19 from different states in Brazil, in comparison to a commercial TaqMan RT-qPCR assay, as gold standard. The sensitivity of the HRM-RTqPCR assays targeting N, RdRp and E were 94.12, 98.04 and 92.16%, with 100% specificity to the 3 targets, and diagnostic accuracy of 95.38, 98.46 and 93.85%, respectively. Thus, the HRM-RTqPCR emerges as an alternative and low-cost methodology to increase the molecular diagnostic of patients suspicious for Covid-19, especially in restricted-budget laboratories.","Ferreira, Beatriz Iandra da Silva; Gomes, Natalia Lins da Silva; Coelho, Wagner Luis da Costa Nunes Pimentel; Costa, Vanessa Duarte; Carneiro, Vanessa Cristine de Souza; Kader, Rafael Lopes; Amaro, Marisa Pimentel; Villar, Livia Melo; Miyajima, Fabio; Alves-Leon, Soniza Vieira; Paula, Vanessa Salete de; Leon, Luciane Almeida Amado; Moreira, Otacilio C.",,92,5

It is also toxic to human health. In this work, HONO concentrations were measured in Shijiazhuang using a Monitor for AeRosols and Gases in ambient Air (MARGA) from December 15, 2019 to March 15, 2020, which covered the heavy air pollution season, the Chinese New Year (CNY) vocation and the Corona Virus Disease-19 (COVID-19) lockdown period. During & after CNY overlapping COVID-19 lockdown, the air quality was significantly improved because of both the emission reduction and the increase in diffusion ability of air masses. The mean HONO concentration was 2.43 ± 1.08 ppbv before CNY, while it decreased to 1.53 ± 1.16 ppbv during CNY and 0.97 ± 0.76 ppbv after CNY. The lockdown during & after CNY reduced ~31% of ambient HONO along with ~62% of NO and ~36% of NO2 compared with those before CNY after the improvement of diffusion ability had been taken into consideration. Heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on ground surface dominated the nocturnal HONO sources, followed by heterogeneous reaction on aerosol surface, vehicle emission, reaction between NO and OH and emission from soil on pollution days throughout the observation. Except for elevated soil emission, other nighttime HONO sources and sinks decreased significantly during & after CNY. The relative importance of heterogeneous reaction of NO2 on surfaces further increased because of both the decrease in vehicle emission and the increase in the heterogeneous conversion kinetics from NO2 to HONO during & after CNY.","Liu, Yongchun; Ni, Shuangying; Jiang, Tao; Xing, Shubin; Zhang, Yusheng; Bao, Xiaolei; Feng, Zeming; Fan, Xiaolong; Zhang, Liang; Feng, Haibo",Sci Total Environ,92,1

Since food insecurity is associated with poor diet, especially low intake of fruits and vegetables, food-insecure individuals may disproportionately experience negative health impacts related to poor diet during the pandemic. To assess the relationship between food security status and fruit and vegetable intake during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted an online survey of adult residents of the US state of Michigan in June of 2020. Among the 484 survey respondents, 36.2% were classified as food-insecure. Food-insecure respondents consumed fruits and vegetables fewer times per day than food-secure respondents and were more likely to report decreasing their consumption of any type of fruits and vegetables (total, fresh, frozen, and canned) since the pandemic started. For those who reduced their purchase of fresh fruit and vegetable, reasons included poor quality, poor availability, high price, reduced store trips, and concerns of contamination.

Recent works in manipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic concepts.

Risks and outcomes remain poorly understood. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of adult mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to five Johns Hopkins hospitals was conducted between March and August 2020. CAPA was defined using composite clinical criteria. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was used to analyze clinical outcomes and multilevel mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression was used to compare longitudinal disease severity scores. RESULTS: Amongst the cohort of 396 people, 39 met criteria for CAPA. Compared to those without, patients with CAPA were more likely to have underlying pulmonary vascular disease (41% vs 21.6%, p=0.01), liver disease (35.9% vs 18.2%, p=0.02), coagulopathy (51.3% vs 33.1%, p=0.03), solid tumors (25.6% vs 10.9%, p=0.017), multiple myeloma (5.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.027), corticosteroid exposure during index admission (66.7% vs 42.6%, p=0.005), and had a lower BMI (median 26.6 vs 29.9, p=0.04). People with CAPA had worse outcomes as measured by ordinal severity of disease scores, requiring longer time to improvement (adjusted odds ratio (1.08)1.09(1.1), p<0.001), and advancing in severity almost twice as fast (subhazard ratio, sHR (1.3)1.8(2.5), p<0.001). People with CAPA were intubated twice as long as those without (sHR) (0.4)0.5(0.6), p<0.001) and had a longer hospital length of stay [median (IQR) 41.1 (20.5, 72.4) vs 18.5 (10.7, 31.8), p<0.001]. CONCLUSION: CAPA is associated with poor outcomes. Attention towards preventative measures (screening and/or prophylaxis) is warranted in people with high risk of developing CAPA.","Permpalung, Nitipong; Chiang, Teresa Po-Yu; Massie, Allan B; Zhang, Sean X; Avery, Robin K; Nematollahi, Saman; Ostrander, Darin; Segev, Dorry L; Marr, Kieren A",Clin Infect Dis,92,5

A rapid and convenient point-of-care test (POCT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is of great importance for prompt and efficient control of these respiratory epidemics. Herein, a multichannel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform was developed based on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) array for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1). The developed MEIA was constructed with eight channels and allowed rapid detection on a single array. On the SPCE surface, monoclonal antibodies against influenza A(H1N1) hemagglutinin (HA) protein or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were coated to capture the target antigens, which then interacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody to form an immuno-sandwich complex. The results showed that the MEIA exhibited a broader linear range than ELISA and comparable sensitivity for A(H1N1) HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The detection results on 79 clinical samples for A(H1N1) suggested that the proposed MEIA platform showed comparable results with ELISA in sensitivity (with a positive rate of 100% for positive samples) but higher specificity, with a false-positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples versus that of 40.5% with ELISA. Thus, it offers great potential for the on-the-spot differential diagnosis of infected patients, which would significantly benefit the efficient control and prevent the spread of these infectious diseases in communities or resource-limited regions in the future.","Li, Jianyong; Lin, Rui; Yang, Yi; Zhao, Rongtao; Song, Shiping; Zhou, Yi; Shi, Jiye; Wang, Lihua; Song, Hongbin; Hao, Rongzhang",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,92,23

Crowded living conditions and limited resources may render these populations vulnerable to the health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Representative and longitudinal survey data are needed to accurately measure impacts in these populations, but such data are scarce. Using satellite data and spatial sampling to ensure representativeness, we use longitudinal survey data on 1,033 households comprising 3,681 individuals collected pre- and post-pandemic to measure the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic households in six areas of the informal settlement of Kibera, Nairobi. The economic impacts are sizable and long-lasting. Household incomes declined at the start of the pandemic by 59% (95% CI: 50% to 69%) and remained 21% (95% CI: 13% to 28%) below the baseline level after six months. Respondents primarily attributed these declines in income to fewer labor market opportunities or lower demand for services, rather than the direct health impacts of the pandemic. The findings raise serious concerns about the welfare consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for residents of informal settlements.","Tompsett, A.; Baum, A.; Bukachi, V.; Kipkemboi, P.; K'oyoo, A.

Several tools were developed to evaluate the psychological impact of such outbreaks. The present study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the Arabic translated version of Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation scale (FIVE). FIVE is a 35-item tool consisting of four subscales that measure Fears about Contamination and Illness, Fears about Social Distancing, Behaviors Related to Illness and Virus Fears and Impact of Illness and Virus Fears. The tool was translated into Arabic by using a forward–backward translation. The online questionnaire contained the following sections: demographics, FIVE, Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and face validity questions. Non-probability convenient sampling technique was used to recruit participants via a mobile instant messaging application. Reliability, concurrent validity, face validity and factor analysis were examined. The data consisted of 509 adult participants who reside in Saudi Arabia. The internal consistency of the Arabic FIVE subscales was high (0.84–0.91) with strong concurrent validity indicated by positive correlations of FIVE subscales with FCV-19S. Factor analysis suggested slightly different factor structures (Fears of Getting Sick, Fears that Others Get Sick, Fears of the Impact on Social Life and Behaviors Related to Illness and Virus Fears). Our data showed a better fit using the proposed structures. The Arabic version of the FIVE showed robust validity and reliability qualities to assess fear of COVID-19 on Arabic adult population.","Tounsi, Abrar; Alammar, Shahad; Almaflehi, Nassr; Bamashmous, Mohamed; Al Madani, Abdullah; Ibrahim, Maria Salem",Int J Environ Res Public Health,92,1

For example, Zakynthos Island (Greece, Mediterranean) receives around 850,000 visitors each summer, while supporting an important loggerhead sea turtle rookery (~300 individuals/season). The coronavirus (COVID‐19)‐driven absence of tourism in May–June 2020 provided an opportunity to evaluate the distribution dynamics of this population in the absence (2020) vs. presence (2018 and 2019) of visitors using programmed unmanned aerial system (UAS) surveys. Ambient sea temperature transitioned from suboptimal for breeding in May to optimal in late June, with turtle distribution appearing to shift from shallow (to benefit from waters 3–5°C above ambient) to deeper waters in 2018 and 2019, but not 2020. The 2020 data set demonstrated that increased tourism pressure, not temperature, drives turtles offshore. Specifically, >50% of turtles remained within 100 m of shore at densities of 25–50 visitors/km, even when sea temperature rose, with 2018 and 2019 data supporting this trend. Reduced access to warmer, nearshore waters by tourism could delay the onset of nesting and increase the length of the egg maturation period between nesting events (internesting interval) at this site. A coastal refuge zone could be delimited in May–June where touristic infrastructure is minimal, but also where turtles frequently aggregate. In conclusion, sea turtles appear capable of perceiving changes in the level of human pressure at fine spatial and temporal scales and adjusting their distribution accordingly.","Schofield, Gail; Dickson, Liam C.

No recent large studies about their use and perception among internal medicine (IM) residents exist. OBJECTIVE: Characterize the use and perceived helpfulness of educational resources. DESIGN: Nationwide survey from December 2019 to March 2020. PARTICIPANTS: IM residents in the USA. MAIN MEASURES: Residents were surveyed on their use and their perceived helpfulness of resources for both attaining general medical knowledge and for point-of-care (POC) learning. Traditional resources included board review resources, clinical experience, digital clinical resources (e.g., UpToDate), journal articles, pocket references, professional guidelines, textbooks, and residency curricula. Novel resources included Twitter, video streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube), online blogs, podcasts, and Wikipedia. KEY RESULTS: We had 662 respondents from 55 residency programs across 26 states. On average, residents used 9 total resources (7 traditional and 2 novel). Digital clinical resources and clinical experience were used by all residents and found helpful by the highest percentage of residents (96% and 94%, respectively). Journal articles were next (used by 90%), followed by board review resources and residency curricula (both used by 85%). Their perceived helpfulness varied, from 90% for board review resources, to 66% for journal articles and 64% for residency curricula, the lowest perceived helpfulness of any traditional resource. Podcasts and video streaming platforms were used as frequently as textbooks (58–59%), but were rated as helpful more frequently (75% and 82% vs 66%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Digital clinical resources, video streaming platforms, and podcasts were perceived as helpful, underscoring the importance of ensuring their integration into medical education to complement clinical experience and other traditional resources which remain highly valued by residents. IMPORTANCE: Our findings can inform residency programs as they transition to virtual curricula in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Remnant serum samples for routine bloodwork from 2,338 pediatric patients at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh were assessed using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (EuroIGG) assay. Reactive cases with sufficient volume were also tested using 3 additional commercial assays. RESULTS: Eighty-five specimens were reactive according to the EuroIGG, yielding 3.64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.91%-4.48%) seropositivity, of which 73 specimens had sufficient remaining volume for confirmation by orthogonal testing. Overall, 19.18% (95% CI, 10.18%-28.18%) of samples were positive on a second and/or third orthogonal assay. This 80.82% false positivity rate is disproportionate to the expected false positivity rate of 50% given our pediatric population prevalence and assay performance. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric populations, false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology may be more common than assay and prevalence parameters would predict, and further studies are needed to establish the performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology in children.","Geisler, Daniel; Freeman, Megan Culler; Rapsinski, Glenn J; Wheeler, Sarah E",Am J Clin Pathol,92,20

BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel). METHODS: We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18–55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519). FINDINGS: Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10·5–26·1) participants in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13·8–30·5) in the 6 μg with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8·1–22·7) in the 6 μg with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6·9–23·6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 μg with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87·9, 91·9, and 82·8 in the 3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, and 6 μg with Algel groups, respectively. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups. INTERPRETATION: BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted.

It is known to disproportionately impact certain communities due to both biological susceptibility and inequitable exposure. In this study, we investigate the most important health, social, and environmental factors impacting the early phases (before July, 2020) of per capita COVID-19 transmission and per capita all-cause mortality in US counties. We aggregate county-level physical and mental health, environmental pollution, access to health care, demographic characteristics, vulnerable population scores, and other epidemiological data to create a large feature set to analyze per capita COVID-19 outcomes. Because of the high-dimensionality, multicollinearity, and unknown interactions of the data, we use ensemble machine learning and marginal prediction methods to identify the most salient factors associated with several COVID-19 outbreak measure. Our variable importance results show that measures of ethnicity, public transportation and preventable diseases are the strongest predictors for both per capita COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Specifically, the CDC measures for minority populations, CDC measures for limited English, and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county were the most important features for per capita COVID-19 cases within a month after the pandemic started in a county and also at the latest date examined. For per capita all-cause mortality at day 100 and total to date, we find that public transportation use and proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county are the strongest predictors. The methods predict that, keeping all other factors fixed, a 10% increase in public transportation use, all other factors remaining fixed at the observed values, is associated with increases mortality at day 100 of 2012 individuals (95% CI [1972, 2356]) and likewise a 10% increase in the proportion of Black- and/or African-American individuals in a county is associated with increases total deaths at end of study of 2067 (95% CI [1189, 2654]). Using data until the end of study, the same metric suggests ethnicity has double the association as the next most important factors, which are location, disease prevalence, and transit factors. Our findings shed light on societal patterns that have been reported and experienced in the U.S. by using robust methods to understand the features most responsible for transmission and sectors of society most vulnerable to infection and mortality. In particular, our results provide evidence of the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on minority populations. Our results suggest that mitigation measures, including how vaccines are distributed, could have the greatest impact if they are given with priority to the highest risk communities.","McCoy, David; Mgbara, Whitney; Horvitz, Nir; Getz, Wayne M.; Hubbard, Alan",Sci Rep,92,2

Supportive supervision is a functional component of the immunization systems that allows identification of existing gaps, provides an opportunity for onsite training, and document real-time findings for improvement of the program. The control measures of COVID-19 pandemic have also resulted in limitation of operations of the immunization system including supportive supervision. This has limited many aspects of supportive supervision for surveillance and routine immunization monitoring system in the East and Southern African countries. The aim of this study is to identify the effects of COVID-19 on Integrated Supportive Supervision visits for expanded programme on immunization (EPI) and how it influences the immunization and vaccine preventable disease (VPD) surveillance indicators, and its short-term effect towards notification of increase or decrease morbidity and mortality. METHODS: we reviewed the integrated supportive supervision (ISS) data and the routine administrative coverage from 19 countries in the East and Southern Africa (ESA) for the period January to August 2019 to analyze the trends in the number of visits, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD), and routine immunization (RI) indicators using t-test, and compare with the period January to August 2020 during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: thirteen countries out of the 19 considered, had shown a decline in the number of integrated supportive supervision (ISS) visits, with 10 (77%) having more than 59% decrease during the January-August 2020 as compared to the same period 2019. Eleven (57%) of the countries have shown a decrease (p-value < 0.05). Ethiopia and Kenya had the highest drop (p-value < 0.000). Six (32%) had an increase in the number of visits, with Madagascar, Zambia, and Zimbabwe having >100% increase in the number of visits. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of the countries that have decreased in the number of ISS visits have equally witnessed a drop in DPT3 administrative coverage. Countries with a low proportion of outreach sessions conducted in the period of January - August 2020, have all had sessions interruption, with more than 40% of the reasons associated with the lockdown. CONCLUSION: countries have experienced a decrease in the number of supportive supervision visits conducted, during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic and, this has influenced the routine immunization and vaccine-preventable diseases surveillance (VPD) process indicators monitored through the conduct of the visits. Continuous decrease in these performance indicators pose a great threat to the performance sustained and the functionality of the surveillance and immunization system, and consequently on increased surveillance sensitivity to promptly detect outbreaks and aiming to reducing morbidity and mortality in the sub-region.","Bello, Isah Mohammed; Lebo, Emmaculate; Shibeshi, Messeret Eshetu; Akpan, Godwin Ubong; Chakauya, Jethro; Masresha, Balcha Girma; Daniel, Fussum",Pan Afr Med J,92,28

MEASUREMENTS: A cohort study of one-year was conducted with twenty-nine physically active elderly (65.5±5.6y) women. Pre-assessment was took in December 2019 and post (a year later) was performed in January 2021, during the lockdown induced by COVID-19 pandemic. Body mass (kg) was obtained using the digital scale. Handgrip strength (HGS) of the non-dominant hand was determined using an electronic dynamometer. Muscle function loss was assessed using the SARC-F questionnaire. RESULTS: After one year, body weight (p=0.002) and BMI (p=0.001) increased significantly, with an average percentage of change in body mass of +3.0±5.2%. Consequently, there was a change in classification of BMI pre- and post-one year (malnutrition: 17.2% to 17.2%, normal weight: 41.4% to 37.9%, and overweight: 41.4% to 44.9%). Additionally, was found increased muscle function loss (SARC-F≥4) of 13.8% to 27.6% of elderly women. CONCLUSION: In Brazilian physically active elderly women, we found that the physical inactivity imposed by during the lockdown increased the body mass and muscle function loss.","da Rocha, A.

This qualitative paper aims to identify factors influencing uptake among those offered daily testing, and the subsequent impact on behaviour. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 52 participants who had taken part in the feasibility study. Participants were asked about their experiences of daily testing or self-isolating, their reasons for choosing to test or isolate, and their behaviour during the study period. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Results are presented under two main headings: (1) factors influencing acceptance of testing and (2) impact of test results. Participants appeared highly motivated to engage in behaviours that would protect others from the virus. Factors influencing the decision to accept testing included (1) needing to avoid self-isolation, (2) concerns about test sensitivity, and (3) perceived benefits of detecting infection. Participants who were taking tests reported: (1) positive consequences following confirmation of COVID status, (2) engaging in essential activities, (3) uncertainty, and (4) self-isolating whilst testing. Conclusions: This study has identified a range of factors that appear to influence the decision to engage in daily testing or to self-isolate following close contact with a positive case, many of which could be addressed by clear communications. Covid-19 infection rates and government restrictions influenced experiences, and so further research is needed to explore perceptions of daily testing and behaviour following close contact with a positive case among a wider range of individuals, in the context of lower rates of COVID-19, few government restrictions on general population behaviour and more widespread testing.","Denford, Sarah; Martin, Alex F.; Love, Nicola; Ready, Derren; Oliver, Isabel; Amlôt, Richard; Yardley, Lucy; Rubin, G.

METHODS: Research questions were formulated focusing on diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with RMD within the context of the pandemic, including the management of RMD in patients who developed COVID‐19. MEDLINE was searched for eligible studies to address the questions, and the APLAR COVID‐19 task force convened 2 meetings through video conferencing to discuss its findings and integrate best available evidence with expert opinion. Consensus statements were finalized using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: Agreement was obtained around key aspects of screening for or diagnosis of COVID‐19; management of patients with RMD without confirmed COVID‐19; and management of patients with RMD with confirmed COVID‐19. The task force achieved consensus on 25 statements covering the potential risk of acquiring COVID‐19 in RMD patients, advice on RMD medication adjustment and continuation, the roles of telemedicine and vaccination, and the impact of the pandemic on quality of life and on treatment adherence.

The high specificity, sensitivity, simple protocols and potential to deliver results without the use of expensive equipment has made it an attractive alternative to RT-PCR. However, the high cost per reaction, the centralized manufacturing of required reagents and their distribution under cold chain shipping limits RT-LAMP’s applicability in low-income settings. The preparation of assays using homebrew enzymes and buffers has emerged worldwide as a response to these limitations and potential shortages. Here, we describe the production of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) Reverse Transcriptase and BstLF DNA polymerase for the local implementation of RT-LAMP reactions at low cost. These reagents compared favorably to commercial kits and optimum concentrations were defined in order to reduce time to threshold, increase ON/OFF range and minimize enzyme quantities per reaction. As a validation, we tested the performance of these reagents in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from RNA extracted from clinical nasopharyngeal samples, obtaining high agreement between RT-LAMP and RT-PCR clinical results. The in-house preparation of these reactions results in an order of magnitude reduction in costs, and thus we provide protocols and DNA to enable the replication of these tests at other locations. These results contribute to the global effort of developing open and low cost diagnostics that enable technological autonomy and distributed capacities in viral surveillance.","Matute, Tamara; Nuñez, Isaac; Rivera, Maira; Reyes, Javiera; Blázquez-Sánchez, Paula; Arce, Aníbal; Brown, Alexander J.; Gandini, Chiara; Molloy, Jennifer; Ramirez-Sarmiento, César A.; Federici, Fernán",medRxiv,92,1

Speciation of Ni(2+) was done in I = 0.10 M (NaNO(3)) for knowing distribution of Ni(2+) species with solution pH. Experimental data were compared with speciation diagram constructed from the values of hydrolysis constants of Ni(2+) ion. Speciation data showed that hexaaquanickel(II) ions took place in hydrolysis reactions through formation of [Ni(OH(2))(6-n)(OH)(n)](2-n) species with solution pH. According to speciation of Ni(2+) and pH dependent rate constants, rate expression can be written as: d[Ni(TMPyP)(4+)]/dt = (k(1)[Ni(2+)((aq))] + k(2)[Ni(OH)(+)((aq))] + k(3)[Ni(OH)(2)(o)((aq))] + k(4)[Ni(OH)(3)(-)((aq))])[H(2)TMPyP(4+)], where k(1), k(2), k(3) and k(4) were found to be k(1) = (0.62 ± 0.22) × 10(-2); k(2) = (3.60 ± 0.40) × 10(-2); k(3) = (2.09 ± 0.52) × 10(-2), k(4) = (0.53 ± 0.04) × 10(-2) M(-1)s(-1) at 25 ±1 °C, respectively.

Time spent in nature is associated with improved health among youth. This study aimed to assess youth experiences with nature and the self-perceived impact on their mental and physical health among a nationwide sample of US youth. METHODS: In September 2020, five open-ended questions that aimed to assess perceptions regarding nature were posed to 1174 MyVoice youth, aged 14–24 years. Qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis, and data were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the 994 respondents (RR = 84.7%) was 18.9 (2.7) years; 47.4% were female, and 57.4% Non-Hispanic White. Among youth, many felt that spending time in nature positively impacted their mental health, with 51.6% mentioning that it made them “feel calm when I am out in nature”; 22.1% said that it relieved stress or “reduces my anxiety,” and 17.1% felt that being in nature positively impacted their physical health and “makes me feel more active and in shape.” However, 7.0% said it negatively impacted their health, such as “It makes me feel isolated.” Most youth (87.8%) want to spend more time in nature, with 22% mentioning barriers (i.e., busy schedules, built environment, and COVID-19) impeding them from doing so. CONCLUSIONS: Youth in our sample generally report feeling physically and mentally better when spending time in nature and want to spend more time in nature. Public health policies and practices that eliminate barriers and actively support time spent outside may be a feasible and acceptable practice to promote overall well-being among youth.

METHODS: Each CT was recorded, and the validity of the repeated CTs was assessed. RESULTS: The 394 patients underwent a total of 1493 CTs. Of the 394 patients, 260 received at least one non-value-added CT. Both the total number of CTs (median, 4; interquartile range (IQR), 3–5) and non-value-added CTs (median, 1; IQR, 0–1) per patient were strongly related to the disease duration (R2 = 0.566 for total CTs, R2 = 0.432 for non-value-added CTs, p < 0.001). The proportion of non-value-added CTs was potentially higher after 3 weeks from symptom onset (>35%). CONCLUSIONS: There was a high rate of repeat CTs for the COVID-19 patients, and the proportion of non-value-added CTs increased with disease duration.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed and Embase from the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak to October 20, 2020, for studies that discussed the chest CT findings in infants younger than 1 year with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies comprising 70 COVID-19 (58.5% boys) confirmed infants were included. The mean age of the included patients was 4.1 months with a range of 1 day to 12 months. Chest CT scans showed bilateral abnormalities in 34 patients, and unilateral lung involvement in 25 patients. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (71.43%) were found to be the most prevalent chest CT manifestation, followed by peribronchial thickening (60%), linear or band-shaped opacities (32.8%), consolidation (28.57%), nodule (18.57%), effusion (7.14%) and focal lucency (7.14%). CONCLUSIONS: GGO and peribronchial thickening were the most prevalent findings in the infants’ chest CT scans. Linear or band-shaped opacities, consolidation, and pulmonary nodules are more common in infants than in adults. These findings suggest that the disease is more likely to be presented as an atypical pneumonia (peribronchial thickening and linear or band-shaped opacities) in this age group.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included all COVID-19-infected individuals who were obligatorily quarantined at King Abdullah University Hospital, Irbid, Jordan from March 15 to April 20, 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire after 10 days of quarantine. In addition, several questions regarding the patients’ sights with the health-care system, and coping methods were added. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and comorbidities were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: Out of 91 quarantined COVID-19 patients, a total of 66 completed the survey, with a participation rate of 72.5%. The majority were relatively young; the mean ± SD age was 35.8 ± 16.2 years (range 18–79), 59.1% were females and 47% were asymptomatic. A considerable proportion of patients (44%) reported symptoms of depression, with 21% were at high risk of major depressive disorder. Depression symptoms were significantly more common among females than males [PHQ-9 score ≥10: 13 (92.9%) vs 1 (7.1%), respectively; p=0.004]. The majority of patients (71.2%) reported having problems with health-care services. Insufficient involvement in making treatment decisions was the most commonly reported concern (59.1%). Patients who reported problems in maintaining privacy, reaching out to their physicians, or receiving conflicting information from the medical staff, had more symptoms of depression compared with the satisfied ones (p<0.05). On the other hand, those who were receiving sufficient support from the family, friends, or medical staff during quarantine, were less likely to have depression symptoms (p<0.05). Furthermore, symptoms of depression were less in patients who stayed in touch with others using phone calls, texting, or social media (p=0.024). CONCLUSION: Symptoms of depression were common among both symptomatic and asymptomatic quarantined COVID-19 patients.

The etiology and clinical impact of HCoVs in Chinese adults with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) needs to be characterized systematically by molecular detection with excellent sensitivity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we detected 4 non-SARS related HCoV species by real-time RT-PCR in 981 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from March 2009 to February 2011. All specimens were also tested for the presence of other common respiratory viruses and newly identified viruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). 157 of the 981 (16.0%) nasopharyngeal swabs were positive for HCoVs. The species detected were 229E (96 cases, 9.8%), OC43 (42 cases, 4.3%), HKU1 (16 cases, 1.6%) and NL63 (11 cases, 1.1%). HCoV-229E was circulated in 21 of the 24 months of surveillance. The detection rates for both OC43 and NL63 were showed significantly year-to-year variation between 2009/10 and 2010/11, respectively (P<0.001 and P = 0.003), and there was a higher detection frequency of HKU1 in patients aged over 60 years (P = 0.03). 48 of 157(30.57%) HCoV positive patients were co-infected. Undifferentiated human rhinoviruses and influenza (Flu) A were the most common viruses detected (more than 35%) in HCoV co-infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV) and HBoV were detected in very low rate (less than 1%) among adult patients with URTI. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: All 4 non-SARS-associated HCoVs were more frequently detected by real-time RT-PCR assay in adults with URTI in Beijing and HCoV-229E led to the most prevalent infection.

BAG3 protein is the only member of this family containing also the N‐terminally located WW domain. We describe here the identification of adenovirus (Ad) penton base protein as the first BAG3 partner recognising BAG3 WW domain. Ad penton base is the viral capsid constituent responsible for virus internalisation. It contains in the N‐terminal part two conserved PPxY motifs, known ligands of WW domains. In cells producing Ad penton base protein, cytoplasmic endogenous BAG3 interacts with it and co‐migrates to the nucleus. Preincubation of BAG3 with Ad base protein results in only slight modulation of BAG3 co‐chaperone activity, suggesting that this interaction is not related to the classical BAG3 co‐chaperone function. However, depletion of BAG3 impairs the cell entry of the virus and viral progeny production in Ad‐infected cells, suggesting that the interaction between virus penton base protein and cellular co‐chaperone BAG3 positively influences virus life cycle. These results thus demonstrate a novel host–pathogen interaction, which contributes to the successful infectious life cycle of adenoviruses. In addition, these data enrich our knowledge about the multifunctionality of the BAG3 co‐chaperone. J. Cell.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of confirmed COVID-19 patients presented to the emergency between March 07–17, 2020. Clinical & radiological findings were reviewed. Clinical outcomes were classified into critical & non-critical based on severity. Two independent radiologists graded frontal view CXRs into COVID-19 pneumonia category 1 (CoV-P1) with <4 zones and CoV-P2 with ≥4 zones involvement. Interobserver agreement of CoV-P category for the CXR preceding the clinical outcome was assessed using Kendall's τ coefficient. Association between CXR findings and clinical deterioration was calculated along with temporal changes of CXR findings with disease progression. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were evaluated for clinical features. 56 of these (total: 325 CXRs) were evaluated for radiological findings. Common patterns were progression from lower to upper zones, peripheral to diffuse involvement, & from ground glass opacities to consolidation. Consolidations starting peripherally were noted in 76%, 93% and 48% with critical outcomes, respectively. The interobserver agreement of the CoV-P category of CXRs in the critical and non-critical outcome groups were good and excellent, respectively (τ coefficient = 0.6 & 1.0).

Among those with available information, 73% of pediatric patients had symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath compared with 93% of adults aged 18-64 years during the same period; 5.7% of all pediatric patients, or 20% of those for whom hospitalization status was known, were hospitalized, lower than the percentages hospitalized among all adults aged 18-64 years (10%) or those with known hospitalization status (33%). Three deaths were reported among the pediatric cases included in this analysis. These data support previous findings that children with COVID-19 might not have reported fever or cough as often as do adults (4). Whereas most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious COVID-19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group. Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups as patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission (6,7).","Bialek, Stephanie; Gierke, Ryan; Hughes, Michelle; McNamara, Lucy A.; Pilishvili, Tamara; Skoff, Tami",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,92,14

The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3' UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral agents.IMPORTANCEThe highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. Our findings indicate that the s2m element can be targeted by antisense oligonucleotides.

Although it shows a high mortality rate in humans, currently there is no licensed therapeutic. During the recent epidemic in West Africa, it was demonstrated that administration of antimalarial medication containing amodiaquine significantly lowered mortality rate of patients infected with the virus. Here, in order to improve its antiviral activity, a series of amodiaquine derivatives were synthesized and tested for Ebola virus infection. We found that multiple compounds were more potent than amodiaquine. The structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the two independent parts, which are the alkyl chains extending from the aminomethyl group and a halogen bonded to the quinoline ring, were keys for enhancing antiviral potency without increasing toxicity. When these modifications were combined, the antiviral efficacy could be further improved with the selectivity indexes being over 10-times higher than amodiaquine. Mechanistic evaluation demonstrated that the potent derivatives blocked host cell entry of Ebola virus, like the parental amodiaquine. Taken together, our work identified novel potent amodiaquine derivatives, which will aid in further development of effective antiviral therapeutics.","Sakurai, Yasuteru; Sakakibara, Norikazu; Toyama, Masaaki; Baba, Masanori; Davey, Robert A",Antiviral Res,92,22

The same mystery applies to the deadly 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which has puzzled the field for a century. Here we discuss dual potential properties of the 1918 H1N1 pandemic viruses that led to the high fatality rate in the small portion of severe cases, while about 98% infected persons in the United States were self-limited with mild symptoms, or even asymptomatic. These variations now have been postulated to be impacted by polymorphisms of the sialic acid receptors in the general population. Since coronaviruses (CoVs) also recognize sialic acid receptors and cause severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemics and pandemics, similar principles of influenza virus evolution and pandemicity may also apply to CoVs. A potential common principle of pathogen/host co-evolution of influenza and CoVs under selection of host sialic acids in parallel with different epidemic and pandemic influenza and coronaviruses is discussed.","Jiang, Xi; Tan, Ming; Xia, Ming; Huang, Pengwei; Kennedy, Michael A.",Emerging microbes & infections,92,20

Treatment options are scarce, and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide, a thiazolide anti-infective, for treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza. Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial in 74 primary care clinics in the USA between Dec 27, 2010, and April 30, 2011. We enrolled participants aged 12–65 years with fever, at least one respiratory symptom, and one constitutional symptom of influenza within 48 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned participants to receive either nitazoxanide 600 mg, nitazoxanide 300 mg, or placebo twice daily for 5 days, (ratio 1:1:1) and followed them up for 28 days. Randomisation lists were computer generated and done in blocks of three. Sponsor, investigators, study monitors, patients, and laboratory personnel were all masked to treatment allocation in the study. The primary endpoint was the time from first dose to alleviation of symptoms. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat for participants with influenza infection confirmed by RT-PCR or culture at baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227421. Findings Of 650 participants screened, 624 (96%) were enrolled. Of these, 212 were randomly assigned to receive placebo twice a day, 201 to receive nitazoxanide 300 mg twice a day, and 211 to receive nitazoxanide 600 mg a day. The median duration of symptoms for participants receiving placebo was 116·7 h (95% CI 108·1–122·1) compared with 95·5 h (84·0–108·0; p=0·0084) for those receiving 600 mg nitazoxanide and 109·1 h (96·1–129·5, p=0·52) for those receiving 300 mg nitazoxanide. Adverse events were similar between the three groups, the most common being headache reported by 24 (11%) of 212 patients enrolled in placebo group, 12 (6%) of 201 patients in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) of 211 patients in the high-dose group, or diarrhoea, reported by seven (3%) patients in the placebo group, four (2%) patients enrolled in the low-dose group, and 17 (8%) patients in the high-dose group. Interpretation Treatment with nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction of the duration of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings and to assess efficacy of the drug alone or in combination with existing drugs in seriously ill patients and those at risk of influenza complications.

Using a systems biology approach, we investigated molecular changes (mRNA/microRNA) underlying HAOMD and its modulation by phytocannabinoids (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (∆(9)-THC)) in uninfected (n = 5) and SIV-infected rhesus macaques untreated (VEH-untreated/SIV; n = 7) or treated with vehicle (VEH/SIV; n = 3) or ∆(9)-THC (THC/SIV; n = 3). Relative to controls, fewer mRNAs were upregulated in THC/SIV compared to VEH-untreated/SIV macaques. Gene enrichment analysis showed differential enrichment of biological functions involved in anti-viral defense, Type-I interferon, Toll-like receptor, RIG-1 and IL1R signaling in VEH-untreated/SIV macaques. We focused on the anti-ER-stress anterior gradient-2 (AGR2), epithelial barrier protecting and anti-dysbiotic WAP Four-Disulfide Core Domain-2 (WFDC2) and glucocorticoid-induced anti-inflammatory TSC22D3 (TSC22-domain family member-3) that were significantly downregulated in oropharyngeal mucosa (OPM) of VEH-untreated/SIV macaques. All three proteins localized to minor salivary gland acini and secretory ducts and showed enhanced and reduced expression in OPM of THC/SIV and VEH/SIV macaques, respectively. Additionally, inflammation associated miR-21, miR-142-3p and miR-29b showed significantly higher expression in OPM of VEH-untreated/SIV macaques. TSC22D3 was validated as a target of miR-29b.

Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens’ perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens’ viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts’ perspective by incorporating individual host’s specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics. We then provide two proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models: sexually transmitted disease and healthcare acquired infections. This patch dynamics modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a more holistic viewpoint. It is also able to simulate and handle more complicated scenarios across biological scales such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Shi; Owolabi, Yakubu; Li, Ang; Lo, Eugenia; Robinson, Patrick; Janies, Daniel; Lee, Chihoon; Dulin, Michael",PLoS One,92,18

Scientists have made strides in estimating key transmission and epidemiological parameters. In particular, accumulating evidence points to a substantial fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections, which influences our understanding of the transmission potential and severity of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. METHODS: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City together with epidemiological data of Japanese repatriated from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. RESULTS: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China, in 2019–2020 reached values at 3.49 (95% CrI 3.39–3.62) with a mean serial interval of 6.0 days, and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23 in 2020 was associated with a significantly reduced R at 0.84 (95% CrI 0.81–0.88), with the total number of infections (i.e., cumulative infections) estimated at 1,906,634 (95% CrI 1,373,500–2,651,124) in Wuhan City, elevating the overall proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95% CrI 13.5–26.6%). We also estimated the most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time–delay adjusted IFR at 0.04% (95% CrI 0.03–0.06%) and 0.12% (95% CrI 0.08–0.17%), respectively, estimates that are substantially smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.06%. CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during January–February 2020 using an ecological modeling approach that is suitable to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. Our estimate of time–delay adjusted IFR falls in the range of the median IFR estimates based on multiple serological studies conducted in several areas of the world.","Mizumoto, Kenji; Kagaya, Katsushi; Chowell, Gerardo",BMC Med,92,21

RESULTS 783 children participated in the study (median age 3 years and 0 months, range 1 month to 12 years and 11 months). 358 were female (45.7%). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 19 (2.4%). The most common symptoms in children with as well as without detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA were rhinitis, fever, and cough. Known recent exposure to a case of COVID-19 was significantly correlated with testing positive, but symptoms or clinical findings were not.

It can be difficult to identify the severity of injury at the time of presentation, and when diagnosis is delayed outcomes worsen significantly. Anatomic anomalies of the craniovertebral junction may further complicate its detection. When such anomalies are present either singly or in combination, they are known to cause space constraints which may increase the likelihood of spinal cord injury. Given that such anomalies and AOD are rare, few examples of patients with both are reported in the literature. Furthermore, it is not clear in what way patient management may be impacted in this context.

There is paucity of information on how to modify care of leukemia patients in view of the COVID-19 risks and imposed restrictions. We review the available literature on the impact of COVID-19 on different types of leukemia patients and suggest general as well as disease-specific recommendations on care based on available evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 infection impacts leukemia subtypes in variable ways and the standard treatments for leukemia have similarly, varying effects on the course of COVID-19 infection. Useful treatment strategies include deferring treatment when possible, use of less intensive regimens, outpatient targeted oral agents requiring minimal monitoring, and prioritization of curative or life-prolonging strategies. Reducing health care encounters, rational transfusion standards, just resource allocation, and pre-emptive advance care planning will serve the interests of leukemia patients. SUMMARY: Ad hoc modifications based on expert opinions and extrapolations of previous well-designed studies are the way forward to navigate the crisis. This should be supplanted with more rigorous prospective evidence.","Karki, Nabin Raj; Le, Thuy; Cortes, Jorge",Curr Oncol Rep,92,21

This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic.","Roy, Deblina; Tripathy, Sarvodaya; Kar, Sujita Kumar; Sharma, Nivedita; Verma, Sudhir Kumar; Kaushal, Vikas",Asian J Psychiatr,92,10

METHODS: Consecutive intensive care unit-admitted patients were subjected to a stepwise clustering method. RESULTS: Data from 147 patients who were on average 56 ± 16 years old with a Simplified Acute Physiological Score 3 of 72 ± 18, of which 103 (70%) needed mechanical ventilation and 46 (31%) died in the intensive care unit, were analyzed. From the clustering algorithm, two well-defined groups were found based on maximal heart rate [Cluster A: 104 (95%CI 99 - 109) beats per minute versus Cluster B: 159 (95%CI 155 - 163) beats per minute], maximal respiratory rate [Cluster A: 33 (95%CI 31 - 35) breaths per minute versus Cluster B: 50 (95%CI 47 - 53) breaths per minute], and maximal body temperature [Cluster A: 37.4 (95%CI 37.1 - 37.7)°C versus Cluster B: 39.3 (95%CI 39.1 - 39.5)°C] during the intensive care unit stay, as well as the oxygen partial pressure in the blood over the oxygen inspiratory fraction at intensive care unit admission [Cluster A: 116 (95%CI 99 - 133) mmHg versus Cluster B: 78 (95%CI 63 - 93) mmHg]. Subphenotypes were distinct in inflammation profiles, organ dysfunction, organ support, intensive care unit length of stay, and intensive care unit mortality (with a ratio of 4.2 between the groups). CONCLUSION: Our findings, based on common clinical data, revealed two distinct subphenotypes with different disease courses.

We hypothesized that a modified ECMO (right to left atrium [RA-LA] cannulation with TandemHeart cannula and an oxygenator;TandemHeart ECMO) might be superior to conventional veno-venous (VV)-ECMO. Methods: A total of 19 patients with COVID-19 underwent ECMO at Princeton Hospital. We compared in-hospital complications and short-term outcomes between patients with VV ECMO vs. RA-LA ECMO. VV-ECMO was initiated in the cath lab, while RA-LA ECMO was initiated bedside using intracardiac echo guidance. We used Fisher’s exact test for mortality and Student’s t-test for other variables. Results: Between March and September 2020, 19 patients underwent ECMO cannulation. Out of 19 patients, 5 patients had beside TandemHeart ECMO (we performed bedside ICU ECMO procedure in 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females). We placed a 21F LA cannula (TandemHeart, TandemHeart, Pittsburgh, PA) via the right common femoral vein (CFV) and a 25F RA cannula (Edwards, Irvine, CA) through the left CFV. Both the oxygenator and pump were also a TandemHeart system. The median duration of ECMO was 16 days (range 7 to 19 days) for RA-LA ECMO compared to 26 days (range 12-81 days) for conventional VV-ECMO (p<0.02). The mean number of blood transfusions was 10.4±1.6 vs. 21.8±7.1 units, p<0.0001. One patient in the TandemHeart ECMO arm required dialysis, while 8/14 patients on VV-ECMO required dialysis, p=0.1. Intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay was shorter in the RA-LA ECMO group compared to VV ECMO (25.8±7.4 vs. 3.67±14.1 days, p<0.05). A total of 6/14 (42.8%) patients in the VV-ECMO vs. 0/5 (0%) in the RA-LA ECMO died in the hospital. However, this was not statistically significant (p=0.2). No major procedural complications, including tamponade occurred in the RA-LA arm despite using bedside ICE without fluoroscopy. Conclusion: Bedside percutaneous RA-LA cannulation was feasible and safe and was associated with significantly shorter ECMO and ICU days among COVID-19 patients presenting with ARDS. This strategy has the potential benefit of providing complete cardiopulmonary support in patients with ARDS. However, larger studies are needed to confirm its role in COVID-19 infections and potentially other ARDS scenarios.","Sarraf, Mohammad; Alkhouli, Mohamad A.; Neves, Paulo C.; Maisano, Francesco",Cardiovascular Revascularization Medicine,92,1

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional observational study. METHODS: Kaplan–Meier and Cox survival analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with COVID‐19‐related death. A ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the abilities of the three scoring scales to predict the prognosis of COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: Age, low blood oxygen saturation level and decreased lymphocyte count were the high risk factors for COVID‐19‐related mortality. The analysis of the abilities of the three scales to predict the prognosis of COVID‐19 patients: The AUC of 0.641 for the RAPS (p = .065). The MEWS (AUC = 0.705, p = .007), compared with RAPS, the NRI was 0.371(p = .03), and the IDI = 0.092 (p = .046); The REMS (AUC = 0.841, p < .001), compared with MEWS, the NRI was 0.227(p = .12), and the IDI=0.09(p = .047); The Combining Predictor (AUC = 0.878, p < .001), compared with REMS, the NRI was 0.25(p = .113), and the IDI=0.02(p = .598). CONCLUSION: Patients with an old age, low blood oxygen saturation level and decreased lymphocyte count were at a high risk of COVID‐19‐related mortality. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the REMS had a better prognostic ability than the MEWS and RAPS when applied to COVID‐19 patients. Our findings suggest that the REMS can be used as a rapid scoring tool for the early assessment of COVID‐19 severity.","Hu, Hai; Kong, Weili; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru; Yao, Rong",Nurs Open,92,16

The pandemic calls for rapid mobilization of every potential clinical tool, including phototherapy—one of the most effective treatments used to reduce the impact of the 1918 “Spanish influenza” pandemic. This paper cites several studies showing that phototherapy has immense potential to reduce the impact of coronavirus diseases, and offers suggested ways that the healthcare industry can integrate modern light technologies in the fight against COVID-19 and other infections. The evidence shows that violet/blue (400–470 nm) light is antimicrobial against numerous bacteria, and that it accounts for Niels Ryberg Finsen's Nobel-winning treatment of tuberculosis. Further evidence shows that blue light inactivates several viruses, including the common flu coronavirus, and that in experimental animals, red and near infrared light reduce respiratory disorders, similar to those complications associated with coronavirus infection. Moreover, in patients, red light has been shown to alleviate chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchial asthma. These findings call for urgent efforts to further explore the clinical value of light, and not wait for another pandemic to serve as a reminder. The ubiquity of inexpensive light emitting lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), makes it relatively easy to develop safe low-cost light-based devices with the potential to reduce infections, sanitize equipment, hospital facilities, emergency care vehicles, homes, and the general environment as pilot studies have shown.","Enwemeka, Chukuka Samuel; Bumah, Violet Vakunseh; Masson-Meyers, Daniela Santos",J Photochem Photobiol B,92,16

This growth has come through a specific form of corruption, changing from petty theft and speed money to grand theft and access money. The new forms of corruption were made possible through the access to assets like land, mines and State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) after land-, property-, and SOE-reforms that were implemented during the 1990s. The opaque character of these reforms has led to what can only be described as a climate of grand collusion where officials use their access powers to redistribute what was formerly state-owned assets to themselves and crony entrepreneurs. While the character of corruption has changed over the last decade, the problem has not diminished despite continued official “anti-corruption” campaigns.

Our review summarizes the known effects regarding pulmonary bacterial and viral infections. For this, we discuss model systems that allow mechanistic investigation of the interplay between obesity and lung infections. Overall, obesity gives rise to a higher susceptibility to infectious pathogens, but the pathogenetic process is not clearly defined. Whereas, viral infections often show a more severe course in obese patients, the same patients seem to have a survival benefit during bacterial infections. In particular, we summarize the main mechanical impairments in the pulmonary tract caused by obesity. Moreover, we outline the main secretory changes within the expanded adipose tissue mass, resulting in chronic low-grade inflammation. Finally, we connect these altered host factors to the influence of obesity on the development of lung infection by summarizing observations from clinical and experimental data.","Hornung, Franziska; Rogal, Julia; Loskill, Peter; Löffler, Bettina; Deinhardt-Emmer, Stefanie",Int J Mol Sci,92,33

Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted “CellPhoneDB” analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,92,2

For these reasons, external validation (EV) is a necessary practice in the evaluation of medical ML. However, there is still a gap in the literature on how to interpret EV results and hence assess the robustness of ML models. METHODS: We fill this gap by proposing a meta-validation method, to assess the soundness of EV procedures. In doing so, we complement the usual way to assess EV by considering both dataset cardinality, and the similarity of the EV dataset with respect to the training set. We then investigate how the notions of cardinality and similarity can be used to inform on the reliability of a validation procedure, by integrating them into two summative data visualizations. RESULTS: We illustrate our methodology by applying it to the validation of a state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic model on 8 EV sets, collected across 3 different continents. The model performance was moderately impacted by data similarity (Pearson &#961; = 0.38, p< 0.001). In the EV, the validated model reported good AUC (average: 0.84), acceptable calibration (average: 0.17) and utility (average: 0.50). The validation datasets were adequate in terms of dataset cardinality and similarity, thus suggesting the soundness of the results. We also provide a qualitative guideline to evaluate the reliability of validation procedures, and we discuss the importance of proper external validation in light of the obtained results. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we propose a novel, lean methodology to: 1) study how the similarity between training and validation sets impacts the generalizability of a ML model; 2) assess the soundness of EV evaluations along three complementary performance dimensions: discrimination, utility and calibration; 3) draw conclusions on the robustness of the model under validation. We applied this methodology to a state-of-the-art model for the diagnosis of COVID-19 from routine blood tests, and showed how to interpret the results in light of the presented framework.","Cabitza, Federico; Campagner, Andrea; Soares, Felipe; García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Challa, Feyissa; Sulejmani, Adela; Seghezzi, Michela; Carobene, Anna",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,92,12

Biopsies of the olfactory mucosa in patients that complain of dysosmia after viral infection fall into two categories: one in which no olfactory epithelium is seen and another in which the epithelium is disordered and populated mainly by immature neurons. We have used intranasal inoculation with an olfactory bulb line variant of MHV to study the consequences of viral infection on peripheral olfactory structures. MHV OBLV has little direct effect on the olfactory epithelium, but causes extensive spongiotic degeneration and destruction of mitral cells and interneurons in the olfactory bulb such that the axonal projection from the bulb via the lateral olfactory tract is markedly reduced. Moreover, surviving mitral cells apparently remain disconnected from the sensory neuron input to the glomerular layer, judging from retrograde labeling studies using Dil. The damage to the bulb indirectly causes a persistent, long-term increase in the turnover of sensory neurons in the epithelium, i.e. the relative proportion of immature to mature sensory neurons and the rate of basal cell proliferation both increase. The changes that develop after inoculation with MHV OBLV closely resemble the disordering of the olfactory epithelium in some patient biopsies. Thus, damage to the olfactory nerve or bulb may contribute to a form of post-viral olfactory dysfunction and MHV OBLV is a useful model for studying the pathogenesis of this form of dysosmia.","Schwob, James E.; Saha, Sucharita; Youngentob, Steven L.; Jubelt, Burk",Chem Senses,92,21

Its primary objective is to provide situational awareness and inform decisions on control responses. In the event of large-scale sustained emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists need to constantly update their aims and analytics with respect to the rapidly evolving emergence of new questions, data and findings in order to synthesize real-time evidence for policy decisions. In this Perspective, we share our views on the functional aims, rationale, data requirements and challenges of nowcasting at different stages of an epidemic, drawing on the ongoing COVID-19 experience. We highlight how recent advances in the computational and laboratory sciences could be harnessed to complement traditional approaches to enhance the scope, timeliness, reliability and utility of epidemic nowcasting.","Wu, Joseph T; Leung, Kathy; Lam, Tommy T Y; Ni, Michael Y; Wong, Carlos K H; Peiris, J S Malik; Leung, Gabriel M",Nat Med,92,16

Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is the delivery vehicle of choice for mRNA as they prevent its enzymatic degradation by encapsulation. We have recently shown that surface exposition of mannose, incorporated in LNPs as stable cholesterol-amine conjugate, enhances the potency of self-amplifying RNA (SAM) replicon vaccines through augmented uptake by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Here, we generated a new set of LNPs whose surface was modified with mannans of different length (from mono to tetrasaccharide), in order to study the effect on antibody response of model SAM replicon encoding for the respiratory syncytial virus fusion F protein. Furthermore, the impact of the mannosylated liposomal delivery through intradermal as well as intramuscular routes was investigated. The vaccine priming response showed to improve consistently with increase in the chain length of mannoses; however, the booster dose response plateaued above the length of disaccharide. An increase in levels of IgG1 and IgG2a was observed for mannnosylated lipid nanoparticles (MLNPs) as compared to LNPs. This work confirms the potential of mannosylated SAM LNPs for both intramuscular and intradermal delivery, and highlights a disaccharide length as sufficient to ensure improved immunogenicity compared to the un-glycosylated delivery system.","Goswami, Roshan; O’Hagan, Derek T.; Adamo, Roberto; Baudner, Barbara C.",Pharmaceutics,92,20

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at >72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until NICU discharge. RESULTS: During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus). By bivariate analysis, the infants with viral detection were older (41 vs 11 days; P = .007), exposed to individuals with respiratory tract viral symptoms (37% vs 2%; P = .003), tested for respiratory viruses by provider (75% vs 11%; P < .001), and had lower total neutrophil counts (P = .02). In multivariate regression analysis, the best predictor of viral infection was the caregivers' clinical suspicion of viral infection (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: A total of 8% of infants, or 6% of all NICU sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected when evaluated for bacterial sepsis. These findings argue for more respiratory viral testing of infants with suspected sepsis using optimal molecular assays to establish accurate diagnoses, prevent transmission, and inform antibiotic stewardship efforts.","Ronchi, Andrea; Michelow, Ian C.; Chapin, Kimberle C.; Bliss, Joseph M.; Pugni, Lorenza; Mosca, Fabio; Sánchez, Pablo J.",J Pediatr,92,33

Methods: We thus longitudinally evaluated and compared the total and neutralizing immune response of 61 patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection up to eight months after diagnosis by RT–PCR using several commercial assays. Results: Among the 208 samples tested, the percentage of seropositivity was comparable between assays up to four months after diagnosis and then tended to be more heterogeneous between assays (p < 0.05). The percentage of patients with a neutralizing titer decreased from 82% before two months postdiagnosis to 57% after six months. This decrease appeared to be more marked for patients under 65 years old and those not requiring hospitalization. The percentage of serology reversion at 6 months was from 11% with the WANTAI total assay to over 39% with the ABBOTT IgG assay. The neutralizing antibody titers decreased in parallel with the decrease of total antibody titers, with important heterogeneity between assays. Conclusions: In conclusion, serological tests show equivalent sensitivity in the first months after the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but their performance later, postinfection, must be considered when interpreting the results.","Aubry, Aurélien; Demey, Baptiste; François, Catherine; Duverlie, Gilles; Castelain, Sandrine; Helle, François; Brochot, Etienne",J Clin Med,92,1

However, current research on the blood test results of pregnant women with COVID-19 is insufficient. Methods: A case-control study was carried out based on clinical blood test results. Pregnant COVID-19 patients, pregnant COVID-19 patients with diabetes, and pregnant COVID-19 patients with hypertension, were assessed in this study. Also, 120 controls were matched by age, parity, fetus number, and presence of chronic disease. T-tests, Chi-square tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare data from the blood tests and liver function indices among the selected groups. Results: Between January 24 and March 14, 2020, 60 pregnant COVID-19 patients delivered at the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hubei Province. The average maternal age of pregnant COVID-19 patients was 30.97 years and the mean gestational period was 37.87 weeks. 71.67% (43/60) of pregnant COVID-19 patients gave birth by cesarean delivery. In total, 21.67% (13/60) were diagnosed with diabetes and 18.33% (11/60) were diagnosed with hypertension during pregnancy. Compared to controls, pregnant COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower numbers of blood lymphocytes and higher numbers of neutrophils, as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein and total bilirubin. Among the three groups, pregnant COVID-19 patients with diabetes had significantly higher levels of neutrophils and lower levels of total protein. Aspartate transaminase levels were higher in pregnant COVID-19 patients with hypertension than in pregnant COVID-19 patients with no comorbidities and controls with hypertension. Interpretations: Blood and liver function indices indicate that chronic complications, including hypertension and diabetes, could increase the risk of inflammation and liver injury in pregnant COVID-19 patients.","Sun, Guoqiang; Zhang, Yizhi; Liao, Qing; Cheng, Yao",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,92,1

However, little research on the effectiveness of psychological techniques implemented within these mHealth solutions was carried out, and even less with the elderly population where technological barriers might exist. Reliable evidence generated through a comprehensive evaluation of mHealth interventions may accelerate its growth for successful long-term implementation and to help to experience mHealth benefits in an enhanced way in all ages. Objective: this study aimed to review mHealth solutions for diabetes self-management in older adults (adherence to treatments and glycemic control) by analyzing the effectiveness of specific psychological techniques implemented. Methods: a narrative review was conducted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed (Medline) and American Psychological Association (APA) PsycInfo databases were searched for published papers that addressed eHealth solutions’ effectiveness for diabetes self-management. Studies in English, Spanish, and/or German of any design were screened, with no time constraints regarding the year of publication. A qualitative analysis of the selected papers was conducted in several steps. Results: this review found 38 studies setting up and analyzing mHealth solutions for older adults. Most research showed improvements in HbA1c, self-management behaviors, and medication adherence in T2DM patients post intervention. However, different mid-to-long term effects were found across studies, specifically concerning the maintenance and adherence to healthy behaviors. The most employed psychological framework was CBT, including techniques such as self-monitoring of outcome behaviors (mostly targeting glycemia measurements and healthy habits as physical activity and/or diet), tailored motivational feedback from medical staff, and psychoeducation or health coaches. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored feedback messages, interactive communication with healthcare professionals, and multifaceted functions. Conclusions: there is a lack of elaborate and detailed information in the literature regarding the factors considered in the design and development of mHealth solutions used as interventions for T2DM self-management in the elderly. Documentation and inclusion of such vital information will foster a transparent and shared decision-making process that will ultimately lead to the development of useful and user-friendly self-management apps that can enhance the quality of life for diabetes patients. Further research adapting mHealth solutions to older adults’ sensory deficits is necessary.","Vázquez-de Sebastián, Julia; Ciudin, Andreea; Castellano-Tejedor, Carmina",J Clin Med,92,1

This challenge of accelerated demographic transition is coupled by the rural-urban disparity in access to healthcare services among the elderly people in India. An important objective of India’s National Health Policy (2017) is to “progressively achieve universal health coverage” which is posited upon mitigating the sub-national disparity that necessitates identifying the drivers of the disparity for targeted policy intervention. This study, therefore, makes an attempt towards the exploration of the prominent contributory factors behind the rural-urban gap in utilisation of healthcare among the older population in India. METHODS: The analysis has been done by using the unit level data of Social Consumption: Health (Schedule number 25.0) of the 75th round of the National sample Survey conducted during July 2017–June 2018. Two binary logistic models have been proposed to capture the crude and the adjusted association between health seeking behaviour and place of residence (rural/ urban). To compute the group differences (between rural and urban) in the rate of healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India and to decompose these differences into the major contributing factors, Fairlie’s decomposition method has been employed. RESULTS: The logistic regression models established a strong association between place of residence and likelihood of healthcare utilisation among the Indian elderly people. The results of the Fairlie’s decomposition analysis revealed considerable rural-urban inequality disfavouring the rural residents and health care utilisation was found to be 7 percentage points higher among the older population residing in urban India than their rural counterparts. Level of education and economic status, both of which are indicators of a person’s Socio-Economic Status, were the two major determinants of the existing rural-urban differential in healthcare utilisation, together explaining 41% of the existing rural-urban differential. CONCLUSION: Public health care provisions need to be strengthened both in terms of quality and outreach by way of greater public investments in the health sector and by building advanced health infrastructure in the rural areas. Implementation of poverty alleviation programmes and ensuring social-security of the elderly are also indispensable in bringing about equity in healthcare utilisation.","Banerjee, Shreya",BMC Public Health,92,20

Following replication in the nasal mucosa, BHV5 invades the central nervous system (CNS) mainly through the olfactory pathway. The innate immune response triggered by the host face to virus replication through the olfactory route is poorly understood. Recently, an upregulation of conserved pathogen-associated molecular pattern, as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), has been demonstrated in the CNS of BHV5 experimentally infected cows. A new perspective to understand host-pathogen interactions has emerged elucidating microRNAs (miRNAs) network that interact with innate immune response during neurotropic viral infections. In this study, we demonstrated a link between the expression of TLRs 3, 7, and 9 and miR-155 transcription in the olfactory bulbs (OB) of 16 cows suffering from acute BHV5-induced neurological disease. The OBs were analyzed for viral antigens and genome, miR-155 and TLR 3, 7, and 9 expression considering three major regions: olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), glomerular layer (GL), and mitral cell layer (ML). BHV5 antigens and viral genomes, corresponding to glycol-C gene, were detected in all OBs regions by fluorescent antibody assay (FA) and PCR, respectively. TLR 3, 7, and 9 transcripts were upregulated in ORNs and ML, yet only ORN layers revealed a positive correlation between TLR3 and miR-155 transcription. In ML, miR-155 correlated positively with all TLRs studied. Herein, our results evidence miR-155 transcription in BHV5 infected OB tissue associated to TLRs expression specifically ORNs which may be a new window for further studies.","Oliveira, Bruna R. S.

Fibrinogen (FIB) could be one such indicator as coagulation and fibrinolysis abnormalities are common among COVID-19 patients. We examined the role of FIB levels in the prognosis of COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study enrolled 1,643 COVID-19 patients from the Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China. The follow-up was conducted from February 8, 2020 to April 15, 2020. The cohort was divided into three groups according to the FIB level on admission, and associations with mortality and disease severity were determined using Cox and logistic regression analyses, respectively. Further, Kaplan–Meier (K–M) analyses by log-rank tests were used to assess the survival of patients with varying FIB levels. Results: Patients with FIB < 2.2 g/L [hazard ratio (HR): 9.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.91–42.59, P = 0.006] and >4.2 g/L (HR: 4.79, 95% CI: 1.14–20.20, P = 0.033) showed higher mortality risks compared to those with FIB between 2.2 and 4.2 g/L. The survival curves showed similar results in K–M analyses (P < 0.001). Additionally, an elevated FIB level was associated with a greater risk of developing critical disease (odds ratio: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.04–4.46, P = 0.038) than a FIB level within the normal range. Conclusion: Abnormal FIB levels may be associated with mortality risk among COVID-19 patients and could predict critical disease development. Thus, assessment of FIB levels may assist in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.","Long, Wei; Yang, Jie; Li, Zhengwei; Li, Jinpeng; Chen, Sichao; Chen, Danyang; Wang, Shipei; Li, Qianqian; Hu, Di; Huang, Jianglong; Zeng, Wen; Guo, Liang; Wu, Xiaohui",Front Med (Lausanne),92,16

However, the effect of plasma therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of plasma infusions in people with PD. METHODS: A total of 15 people with clinically established PD, at least 1 cognitive complaint, and on stable therapy received 1 unit of young fresh frozen plasma twice a week for 4 weeks. Assessments and adverse effects were performed/reported on and off therapy at baseline, immediately after, and 4 weeks after the infusions ended. Adverse effects were also assessed during infusions. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, and feasibility. Exploratory outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III off medication, neuropsychological battery, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire‐39, inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor‐α, interleukin‐6), uric acid, and quantitative kinematics. RESULTS: Adherence rate was 100% with no serious adverse effects. There was evidence of improvement in phonemic fluency (P = 0.002) and in the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire‐39 stigma subscore (P = 0.013) that were maintained at the delayed evaluation. Elevated baseline tumor necrosis factor‐α levels decreased 4 weeks after the infusions ended. CONCLUSIONS: Young fresh frozen plasma was safe, feasible, and well tolerated in people with PD, without serious adverse effects and with preliminary evidence for improvements in phonemic fluency and stigma. The results of this study warrant further therapeutic investigations in PD and provide safety and feasibility data for plasma therapy in people with PD who may be at higher risk for severe complications of COVID‐19. © 2020 The Authors.

We report a case of femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient following non-severe infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A common femoral artery thrombosis extended in the first third of superficial and profunda femoral arteries associated with tibial posterior and popliteal arteries thrombosis were diagnosed in a 24 year-old man complaining of right lower limb pain for one month. The evolution was good after anticoagulation and antiaggregant treatments and thrombectomy. Etiologic assessment was negative except non-severe COVID-19. DISCUSSION: 2019 coronavirus accesses host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 protein, abundant in the lung, also expressed by endothelial cells and COVID-19 is associated with important inflammatory syndrome and coagulopathy, leading to vascular lesions. Thrombosis prevalence is not fully established, seems to be higher in case of major inflammation and in intensive care unit (ICU). Arterial thromboembolisms are described in many vascular territories, each time in elderly patients or severe infection. We described a femoral arterial thrombosis in a young patient with negative etiological assessment except non-severe COVID-19. Treatment consists in anticoagulation and antiaggregant drugs and thrombectomy. Preventing venous thromboembolism treatment is recommended in case of severe infection or in ICU but there is no clear recommendation for arterial thromboembolism prevention. This case should lead us to be very careful to arterial event risk even if the infection is non-severe and the patient young.","Veyre, Florian; Poulain-Veyre, Corinne; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Monsarrat, Nicolas; Aouifi, Abdellah; Lapeze, Joel; Chatelard, Philippe",Ann Vasc Surg,92,32

(2) Methods: Using information provided by Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network, Our World in Data and the World Bank, a multidimensional analysis was carried out, comprising four types of statistical models: grouping analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) Bravais–Pearson linear correlation and multivariate regression. (3) Results: The results confirm the hypothesis of significant correlations between the frequency of causes of death, quality of health care and quality of public health infrastructure, validated by incidence with socio-economic indicators. The study contributes to the literature by analysing trends in the spatial distribution of causes of death worldwide, detecting regional differentiations and testing how socio-economic factors may limit the incidence of morbidity.","Ursache, Simona-Andreea; Gabor, Vicentiu-Robert; Muntele, Ionel; Maftei, Mihai",Healthcare (Basel),92,5

However, all laboratory tests are imperfect and have estimates of sensitivity and specificity less than 100% - in some cases considerably less than 100%. That error will lead to biased prevalence estimates. If the true prevalence of COVID-19 is low, possibly in the range of 1-5%, then testing error will lead to a constant background of bias that will most likely be larger and possibly much larger than the true prevalence itself. As a result, what is needed is a method for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error. In this paper we outline methods for adjusting prevalence estimates for testing error both prospectively in studies being planned and retrospectively in studies that have been conducted. The methods if employed would also help to harmonize study results within countries and around the world. Adjustment can lead to more accurate prevalence estimates and to better policy decisions.","Sempos, C.; Tian, L.",,92,1

SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an enveloped RNA virus, which contains several structural proteins. Among these proteins, spike (S) protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major antigenic determinant, which induces neutralizing antibody. In order to analyze the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability of SARS-CoV S protein, we expressed the S protein in Escherichia coli using a pET expression vector. After the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction, S protein was expressed in the soluble form and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to homogeneity. The amount of S protein recovered was 0.2–0.3 mg/100 ml bacterial culture. The S protein was recognized by sera from SARS patients by ELISA and Western blot, which indicated that recombinant S protein retained its antigenicity. By biotinylated ELISA and Western blot using biotin-labeled S protein as the probe, we identified 130-kDa and 140-kDa proteins in Vero cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for SARS-CoV infection. Taken together, these results suggested that recombinant S protein exhibited the antigenicity and receptor-binding ability, and it could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and anti-SARS therapy.","Ho, Tin-Yun; Wu, Shih-Lu; Cheng, Shin-Ei; Wei, Yen-Chiao; Huang, Shan-Ping; Hsiang, Chien-Yun",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,92,17

METHODS: 23 hospitalized severe/critical COVID-19 patients received 700mg leronlimab subcutaneously, repeated after seven days in 17/23 patients still hospitalized. 18/23 received other experimental treatments, including convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, and/or tocilizumab. 5/23 received leronlimab after blinded placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir, sarilumab, selinexor, or tocilizumab. Outcomes and results were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.5±14.9 years. 20/23 had significant co-morbidities. At baseline, 22/23 were receiving supplemental oxygen (3/23 high flow, 7/23 mechanical ventilation). Blood showed markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ferritin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and elevated neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. By day 30 after initial dosing, 17/23 were recovered, 2/23 were still hospitalized, and 4/23 had died. Of the 7 intubated at baseline, 4/7 were fully recovered off oxygen, 2/7 were still hospitalized, and 1/7 had died. CONCLUSIONS: Leronlimab appeared safe and well tolerated. The high recovery rate suggested benefit, and those with lower inflammatory markers had better outcomes. Some but not all patients appeared to have dramatic clinical responses, indicating that unknown factors may determine responsiveness to leronlimab. Routine inflammatory and cell prognostic markers did not markedly change immediately after treatment, although IL-6 tended to fall. In some persons C-reactive protein clearly dropped only after the second leronlimab dose, suggesting that a higher loading dose might be more effective. Future controlled trials will be informative.","Yang, Bryant; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Ahn, Jenny; Berro, Marlene; Goodman-Meza, David; Dhody, Kush; Sacha, Jonah B; Naeim, Arash; Yang, Otto O",Clin Infect Dis,92,26

A retrospective study was conducted in a pediatric otolaryngology tertiary care center. Emergency activity during the lockdown period from March 17 to May 11, 2020, was compared to the 2019 and 2018 averages for the same period. Study data included a number of emergency consultations and the number and type of surgical procedures: infection management, endoscopic airway procedure, and post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage. Only 350 children were referred to the pediatric otolaryngology emergencies in our center during the lockdown, compared to 761 on the same period the year before (− 54%); 62 emergency surgeries were performed, compared to 93 (− 33%). The ratio between emergency surgeries and consultations was 18% in 2020, versus 12% previously (p = 0.014). The number of surgical procedures for infectious diseases decreased (− 68%), at 16% of surgical emergencies in 2020 compared to 33% previously (p = 0.017). In 2020, 52 emergency endoscopies were performed, versus 59 previously (− 12%), 27% being performed for suspected tracheobronchial or esophageal foreign bodies, compared to 66% in previous years (p < 0.0001).

Anti-phospholipid (aPL) antibodies have been hypothesized to be involved. Typical COVID-19 dermatological manifestations of livedo reticularis and digital ischemia may resemble cutaneous manifestations of anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS). OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between aPL antibodies and thromboembolic events, COVID-19 severity, mortality, and cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: aPL antibodies [anti-beta2-glycoprotein-1 (B2GP1) and anti-cardiolipin (aCL) antibodies] were titered in frozen serum samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the patients’ clinical records were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: 173 patients were enrolled. aPL antibodies were detected in 34.7% of patients, anti-B2GP1 antibodies in 30.1%, and aCL antibodies in 10.4%. Double positivity was observed in 5.2% of patients. Thromboembolic events occurred in 9.8% of patients, including 11 pulmonary embolisms, 1 case of celiac tripod thrombosis, and six arterial ischemic events affecting the cerebral, celiac, splenic, or femoral-popliteal arteries or the aorta. aPL antibodies were found in 52.9% of patients with vascular events, but thromboembolic events were not correlated to aPL antibodies (adjusted OR = 1.69, p = 0.502). Ten patients (5.8%) had cutaneous signs of vasculopathy: nine livedo reticularis and one acrocyanosis. No significant association was observed between the presence of cutaneous vasculopathy and aPL antibodies (p = 0.692). CONCLUSIONS: Anti-phospholipid antibodies cannot be considered responsible for hypercoagulability and thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 patients, livedo reticularis and acrocyanosis do not appear to be cutaneous manifestations of APS.","Gasparini, Giulia; Canepa, Paola; Verdiani, Simonetta; Carmisciano, Luca; Cozzani, Emanuele; De Grazia, Denise; Andrea, Orsi; Icardi, Giancarlo; Parodi, Aurora",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,92,0

To help GPs deal with suspicious skin lesions, melanoma diagnostic training programmes have been developed. However, it is unclear whether these programmes guarantee the acquisition of skills that will be applied by GPs in their daily clinical practice and maintained over time. OBJECTIVES: This scoping review aimed to examine and compare educational programmes designed to train GPs in melanoma diagnosis using clinical (naked eye) examination alone or dermoscopy±clinical examination, and sought to inform on the long-term sustainability of the GPs’ acquired skills. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies eligible for inclusion evaluated educational programmes for teaching diagnosis of melanoma to GPs. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles from 1995 to May 2020. RESULTS: Forty-five relevant articles were found assessing 31 educational programmes. Most programmes that improved the diagnostic accuracy and long-term performances of the GPs, that is, increase in confidence, decrease in dermatologist referral for benign skin lesions and improvement in the benign/malignant ratio of excised skin lesions, trained the GPs in clinical diagnosis, followed by dermoscopy. To maintain long-term performances, these programmes provided refresher training material. CONCLUSION: This review shows that studies generally report positive outcomes from the training of GPs in melanoma diagnosis. However, refresher training material seemed necessary to maintain the acquired skills.

MATERIAL/METHODS: The medical records of 159 children who were admitted to our hospital from January 23 to March 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Samples from pharyngeal or/and anal swabs were subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 within 12 h of patient admission; a second RT-PCR test was done 24 h after the first test. RESULTS: Of the 159 patients, 151 patients had epidemiological histories, 14 patients had cluster onset, and 8 patients had no epidemiological history but had symptoms similar to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The most common symptom was fever (n=125), followed by respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The effectiveness and usefulness of this therapy have been demonstrated for more than a quarter of a century. However, a documented survival benefit has not yet been demonstrable in a large, multicenter, randomized and controlled trial. Following the findings derived from a large sepsis clinical trial with PMX in North America, a new trial is ongoing to determine if PMX has a long-term survival benefit when administered to septic patients. Another approach to support a survival benefit from intervention with PMX is to utilize a detailed analysis available from a large clinical data base. The endotoxin adsorption capacity of PMX columns in vitro and the effectiveness of PMX columns can be further demonstrable in animal models. The capability of PMX and details of its mechanism of action to intervene in the sepsis cascade and impede organ dysfunction in septic patients is not fully understood. The surface antigen expression in monocytes and neutrophils are improved after PMX therapy. Immunomodulatory effects as a result of endotoxin removal and/or other mechanisms of action have been suggested. These effects and other potential immune effects may explain some of the improved effects upon organ dysfunction of sepsis and septic shock patients. Endotoxemia may be involved in the pathophysiology of other diseases than sepsis.

Among them, the identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its metabolic product angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), and the Mas receptor has been of biological significance since these components form a counterregulatory axis (ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas) that opposes the detrimental actions of Ang II.

Here, we analysed humoral immune responses in 209 asymptomatic, mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 patients over time to probe the nature of antibody responses in disease severity and mortality. We observed a correlation between anti-Spike (S) IgG levels, length of hospitalization and clinical parameters associated with worse clinical progression. While high anti-S IgG levels correlated with worse disease severity, such correlation was time-dependent. Deceased patients did not have higher overall humoral response than live discharged patients. However, they mounted a robust, yet delayed response, measured by anti-S, anti-RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) levels, compared to survivors. Delayed seroconversion kinetics correlated with impaired viral control in deceased patients. Finally, while sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics of NAb production.","Lucas, Carolina; Klein, Jon; Sundaram, Maria; Liu, Feimei; Wong, Patrick; Silva, Julio; Mao, Tianyang; Oh, Ji Eun; Tokuyama, Maria; Lu, Peiwen; Venkataraman, Arvind; Park, Annsea; Israelow, Benjamin; Wyllie, Anne L.; Vogels, Chantal B.

Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking. METHODS: Influenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID. Pearson’s χ(2) tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs. bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic features during mood episodes. RESULTS: Seropositivity for influenza A (p=0.004), B (p<0.0001) and coronaviruses (p<0.0001) were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression. Seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt (p =0.001) and history of psychotic features (p =0.005). LIMITATIONS: The design was cross-sectional Socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and axis II psychopathology were not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with a history of mood disorders, and influenza B with suicidal behavior require replication in larger longitudinal samples. The need for these studies is additionally supported by the high incidence of these viral infections, the high prevalence of mood disorders, and resilience of suicide epidemics.","Okusaga, Olaoluwa; Yolken, Robert H.; Langenberg, Patricia; Lapidus, Manana; Arling, Timothy A.; Dickerson, Faith B.; Scrandis, Debra A.; Severance, Emily; Cabassa, Johanna A.; Balis, Theodora; Postolache, Teodor T.",Journal of Affective Disorders,92,24

The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50) for i) reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect of 0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells, and ii) infectious virus release by plaque assay of 0.019 to 0.031 mg/mL in Vero E6 cells and 0.031 to 0.045 mg/mL in Calu-3 cells. The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also virucidal, reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by >99.9% (>3 log10) within 1 minute of exposure, and up to >99.999% (>5 log10) shown at astodrimer sodium concentrations of 10 to 30 mg/mL in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cell lines. Astodrimer sodium also inhibited infection in a primary human airway epithelial cell line. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral and virucidal activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial attachment of the virus to the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.","Paull, Jeremy R.A.; Heery, Graham P.; Bobardt, Michael D.; Castellarnau, Alex; Luscombe, Carolyn A.; Fairley, Jacinth K.; Gallay, Philippe A.",bioRxiv,92,30

Given the high prevalence of informal caregivers in Europe, a considerable proportion of the population are also former caregivers. The Finnish Expert Caregiver intervention sought to train former caregivers to become volunteers aiming to support current caregivers through mainly peer support. The aims of this mixed method non-controlled exploratory intervention study were to assess the feasibility of the Finnish Expert Caregiver intervention by co-designing and implementing the intervention, and by assessing demand and practicality with special attention to the impact of COVID-19. The findings imply that the intervention was feasible as it resulted in a co-designed training course consisting of 30 h with 25 participants enrolling and 19 of them trying volunteering activities. The participants reported high scores on well-being at all timepoints of study, however, without statistically significant differences. The analysis of the focus group interviews revealed that the Expert Caregivers experienced the intervention as meaningful and offered them a sense of belonging with the other participants. Apart from using their caregiving past as an asset, the participants also took advantage of other personal skills and resources. Risks of adverse effects were related to the participants’ expectations on their own contribution, demanding peer support recipients, poorly functioning peer support groups, and insufficient distance to one’s caregiving past. The participants stressed the need for continuing support from intervention facilitators. Future studies with larger samples should investigate whether the effects differ between subgroups of participants and explore the perspective of the peer support recipients.","Åkerman, Sarah; Nyqvist, Fredrica; Coll-Planas, Laura; Wentjärvi, Annika",Int J Environ Res Public Health,92,17

However the recent explosion of genetic data has revealed the rapid rate of evolution that many populations of infectious agents undergo and has underscored the need to consider both evolutionary and ecological processes on the same time scale. Mathematical epidemiology has applied dynamical models to study infectious epidemics, but these models have tended not to exploit – or take into account – evolutionary changes and their effect on the ecological processes and population dynamics of the infectious agent. On the other hand, statistical phylogenetics has increasingly been applied to the study of infectious agents. This approach is based on phylogenetics, molecular clocks, genealogy-based population genetics and phylogeography. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo and related computational tools have been the primary source of advances in these statistical phylogenetic approaches. Recently the first tentative steps have been taken to reconcile these two theoretical approaches. We survey the Bayesian phylogenetic approach to epidemic modeling of infection diseases and describe the contrasts it provides to mathematical epidemiology as well as emphasize the significance of the future unification of these two fields.","Kühnert, Denise; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Drummond, Alexei J.",Infect Genet Evol,92,16

There are two forms of TTP, congenital and acquired, with the acquired form constituting about 90% of cases. Both forms are associated with a deficiency of ADAMTS-13, a metalloproteinase enzyme responsible for cleaving ultra-large von Willebrand factor (uLvWF), preventing its pathologic accumulation. Within the last year, many of the diverse and serious effects of the COVID-19 virus have come to recognition, with some of the most dire consequences involving devastating vascular and hematologic complications. As with many viruses, it seems that the endothelium and the vasculature are often prime targets. Here, we report a case of a 30 year old male who was diagnosed with TTP approximately one week after a positive COVID-19 test result. He responded appropriately to plasma exchange (PLEX), caplacizumab, and steroids. We believe it is important to investigate a potential link between these two conditions, as TTP has significant morbidity and mortality risk if left unattended.

METHODS: 2 × 2 diagnostic table was extracted from each of the included studies. Data on specificity (SPE), sensitivity (SEN), negative likelihood ratio (LR−), positive likelihood ratio (LR+), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated purposefully. RESULTS: Fifteen COVID-19 related publications met our inclusion criteria and were judged qualified for the meta-analysis. The following were summary estimates for diagnostic parameters of chest CT for COVID-19: SPE, 0.49 (95% CI 46–52%); SEN, 0.94 (95% CI 93–95%); LR−, 0.15 (95% CI 11–20%); LR+, 1.93 (95% CI 145–256%); DOR, 17.14 (95% CI 918–3199%); and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.93. CONCLUSION: Chest CT has high SEN, but the SPE is not ideal. It is highly recommended to use a combination of different diagnostic tools to achieve sufficient SEN and SPE. It should be taken into account as a diagnostic tool for current COVID-19 detection, especially for patients with symptoms.

Its genome encodes about 29 proteins. Most of the viral proteins are non-structural proteins (NSP) except envelop (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins that constitute the viral nucleocapsid, envelop and surface. We have recently cloned all the 29 SARS-CoV-2 genes into vectors for their expressions in mammalian cells except NSP11 that has only 14 amino acids (aa). We are able to express all the 28 cloned SARS-CoV-2 genes in human cells to characterize their subcellular distributions. The proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are mostly cytoplasmic but some are both cytoplasmic and nuclear. Those punctate staining proteins were further investigated by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) using specific antibodies or by co-transfection with an organelle marker-expressing plasmid. As a result, we found that NSP15, ORF6, M and ORF7a are related to Golgi apparatus, and that ORF7b, ORF8 and ORF10 colocalize with endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Interestingly, ORF3a distributes in cell membrane, early endosome, endosome, late endosome and lysosome, which suggests that ORF3a might help the infected virus to usurp endosome and lysosome for viral use. Furthermore, we revealed that NSP13 colocalized with SC35, a protein standing for splicing compartments in the nucleus.

Right-left lung aeration asymmetry and poorly recruitable lungs with increased recruitability with alternating body position between supine and prone have been reported. However, real-time effects of changing body position and PEEP on regional overdistension and collapse, in individual patients, remain largely unknown and not timely monitored. The aim of this study was to individualize PEEP and body positioning in order to reduce the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury: collapse and overdistension. METHODS: We here report a series of five consecutive mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS in which sixteen decremental PEEP titrations were performed in the first days of mechanical ventilation (8 titration pairs: supine position immediately followed by 30° targeted lateral position). The choice of lateral tilt was based on X-Ray. This targeted lateral position strategy was defined by selecting the less aerated lung to be positioned up and the more aerated lung to be positioned down. For each PEEP level, global and regional collapse and overdistension maps and percentages were measured by electrical impedance tomography. Additionally, we present the incidence of lateral asymmetry in a cohort of forty-four patients. RESULTS: The targeted lateral position strategy resulted in significantly smaller amounts of overdistension and collapse when compared with the supine one: less collapse along the PEEP titration was found within the left lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.014); and less overdistension along the PEEP titration was found within the right lung in targeted lateral (P = 0.005). Regarding collapse within the right lung and overdistension within the left lung: no differences were found for position. In the cohort of forty-four patients, ventilation inequality of > 65/35% was observed in 15% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted lateral positioning with bedside personalized PEEP provided a selective attenuation of overdistension and collapse in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS and right-left lung aeration/ventilation asymmetry.

We aimed to examine risk factors for COVID-19 death. METHODS: A total of 80 543 COVID-19 cases reported in China, nationwide, through April 8, 2020 were included. Risk factors for death were investigated by Cox proportional hazards regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS: Overall national case fatality ratio (CFR) was 5.64%. Risk factors for death were older age (≥80: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=12.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]=6.78-23.33), presence of underlying disease (aHR=1.33, CI=1.19-1.49), worse case severity (severe: aHR=3.86, CI=3.15-4.73; critical: aHR=11.34, CI=9.22-13.95), and near-epicenter region (Hubei: aHR=2.64, CI=2.11-3.30; Wuhan: aHR=6.35, CI=5.04-8.00). CFR increased from 0.35% (30-39 years) to 18.21% (≥70 years) without underlying disease. Regardless of age, CFR increased from 2.50% for no underlying disease to 7.72% for 1, 13.99% for 2, and 21.99% for ≥3. CFR increased with worse case severity from 2.80% (mild), to 12.51% (severe) and 48.60% (critical) regardless of region.

METHODS: A case-control study including patients hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain was conducted. Patients reporting headache as a symptom during the acute phase and age- and sex-matched patients without headache during the acute phase participated. Hospitalisation and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview 7 months after hospital discharge. Participants were asked about a list of post-COVID symptoms and were also invited to report any additional symptom they might have. Anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: Overall, 205 patients reporting headache and 410 patients without headache at hospitalisation were assessed 7.3 months (Standard Deviation 0.6) after hospital discharge. Patients with headache at onset presented a higher number of post-COVID symptoms (Incident Rate Ratio: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.03–1.30). Headache at onset was associated with a previous history of migraine (Odd Ratio: 2.90, 95% Confidence Interval: 1.41–5.98) and with the development of persistent tension-type like headache as a new post-COVID symptom (Odd Ratio: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.66–4.24).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed women aged 18 years and older who either had children under 10 years of age or were pregnant at the time of the survey. The outcomes included psychological distress, mothers’ fear of their children contracting COVID-19, change in children’s behaviors during COVID-19 lockdown and pregnant women’s concerns. Multivariable ordinary least squares regression models were employed to examine the adjusted associations between sociodemographic factors and psychological distress, as well as fear of COVID-19. RESULTS: Of 628 women, 11.8% (n = 74) were pregnant at the time of survey. Most of the pregnant women (89.2%, n = 66) had some degree of concerns about their unborn babies getting infected during delivery in the hospital. Among mothers of children under 10 years of age (n = 564), half (n = 282) reported change in their children’s behavior during the lockdown. Most mothers and pregnant women (94.9%, n = 569) had some degree of psychological distress. Mothers and pregnant women with a college degree had significantly lower psychological distress (β = -1.346; p = 0.014) than women with a high school education or less. Similarly, mothers and pregnant women with monthly family income ≥ US$ 1,333 had lower psychological distress than those with < US$ 1,333. Women with pre-existing chronic physical (β = 2.424; p < 0.001) or mental (β = 4.733; p < 0.001) conditions had higher psychological distress than those without these conditions. Having children in the house was a contributory factor for higher psychological distress. For example, mothers with one child (β = 2.602; p = 0.007) had significantly higher psychological distress compared to expectant mothers without children in the house.

Today, he continues his work with the think tank, which moved to the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in 2003 (although it stayed headquartered in Baltimore) and which was recently renamed the UPMC Center for Health Security. As director and chief executive officer for the past four years, Inglesby has expanded the center's focus toward preventing public health crises arising from infectious diseases, pandemics and major natural disasters, in addition to biological, chemical and nuclear accidents or threats. Inglesby spoke with Kevin Jiang about how responses to bioterrorism, pandemics and natural disasters aren't all that different.",,Nat Med,92,5

The purpose of the study was to gain a more thorough understanding of ED patient experience during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used the consensual qualitative approach to analyze open-ended responses from post-ED patient experience surveys from February through July 2020. Comments were included in the analysis if they pertained to care during the pandemic (eg, mentioned “the virus,” “masks,” “PPE”). A total of 242 COVID-specific comments from 192 unique patients were analyzed (median age 49 years; 69% female). Six themes were identified: visually observed changes, experiences of process changes, expressions of understanding or appreciation, sense of security, COVID-19 disease-specific comments, and “classic” satisfaction comments that align with previous literature on patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems across the world in unique and unprecedented ways.

These short branches might be attributed to a rapid radiation among the taxa, the use of genes that are unsuitable for the levels of divergence being examined, or insufficient quantity of data. We added over 1200 nucleotides from four nuclear genes to a dataset derived from three genes to produce a dataset of over 3000 nucleotides per taxon. While the number of well-supported short branches in the phylogeny increased, we still did not obtain strong bootstrap support for every node. Parametric and nonparametric bootstrap simulations projected that an enormous, and likely unobtainable, amount of data would be required to get bootstrap support greater than 50% for every node. However, a marked increase in the number of well-supported nodes was seen when we conducted a Bayesian analysis of a combined dataset generated from morphological characters added to the seven gene dataset. Our results suggest that, in some cases, combining morphological and genetic characters may be the most practical way to increase support for short branches deep in a phylogeny.","Banks, Jonathan C.; Whitfield, James B.",Mol Phylogenet Evol,92,1

To increase confidence in vaccination, the active monitoring of vaccine adverse events is important. For effective active surveillance, we developed and verified a machine learning-based active surveillance system using national claim data. METHODS: We used two databases, one from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, which contains flu vaccination records for the elderly, and another from the National Health Insurance Service, which contains the claim data of vaccinated people. We developed a case-crossover design based machine learning model to predict the health outcome of interest events (anaphylaxis and agranulocytosis) using a random forest. Feature importance values were evaluated to determine candidate associations with each outcome. We investigated the relationship of the features to each event via a literature review, comparison with the Side Effect Resource, and using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation method. RESULTS: The trained model predicted each health outcome of interest with a high accuracy (approximately 70%). We found literature supporting our results, and most of the important drug-related features were listed in the Side Effect Resource database as inducing the health outcome of interest. For anaphylaxis, flu vaccination ranked high in our feature importance analysis and had a positive association in Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. Although the feature importance of vaccination was lower for agranulocytosis, it also had a positive relationship in the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation analysis. CONCLUSION: We developed a machine learning-based active surveillance system for detecting possible factors that can induce adverse events using health claim and vaccination databases. The results of the study demonstrated a potentially useful application of two linked national health record databases. Our model can contribute to the establishment of a system for conducting active surveillance on vaccination.","Kim, Yujeong; Jang, Jong-Hwan; Park, Namgi; Jeong, Na-Young; Lim, Eunsun; Kim, Soyun; Choi, Nam-Kyong; Yoon, Dukyong",J Korean Med Sci,92,1

After the onset of sepsis, serial measurements are necessary to monitor disease progression; therefore, a non-invasive detection method is beneficial for neonatal well-being. While some studies have shown a correlation between serum and salivary CRP levels in septic neonates, the causal link behind this correlation remains unclear. To investigate this relationship, CRP was examined in serum and saliva samples from 18 septic neonates and compared with saliva samples from 22 healthy neonates. While the measured blood and saliva concentrations of the septic neonates varied individually, a correlation of CRP levels between serum and saliva samples was observed over time. To clarify the presence of active transport of CRP across the blood–salivary barrier (BSB), transport studies were performed with CRP using in vitro models of oral mucosa and submandibular salivary gland epithelium. The results showed enhanced transport toward saliva in both models, supporting the clinical relevance for salivary CRP as a biomarker. Furthermore, CRP regulated the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and the addition of soluble RAGE during the transport studies indicated a RAGE-dependent transport process for CRP from blood to saliva.","Lin, Grace C.; Küng, Erik; Smajlhodzic, Merima; Domazet, Sandra; Friedl, Heinz P.; Angerer, Joachim; Wisgrill, Lukas; Berger, Angelika; Bingle, Lynne; Peham, Johannes R.; Neuhaus, Winfried",Pharmaceutics,92,24

Previous studies have shown that NBV can infect and replicate in a wide variety of cell types derived from their natural host (bat), as well as from human, mouse and monkey. Within permissive cells, NBV induced significant cytopathic effects characterised by cell-cell fusion and syncytia formation. To understand the molecular events that underpin NBV infection we examined the host transcriptome and proteome response of two cell types, derived from bat (PaKiT03) and mouse (L929), to characterise differential cellular susceptibility to NBV. RESULTS: Despite significant differences in NBV replication and cytopathic effects in the L929 and PaKiT03 cells, the host response was remarkably similar in these cells. At both the transcriptome and proteome level, the host response was dominated by IFN production and signalling pathways. The majority of proteins up-regulated in L929 and PaKiT03 cells were also up-regulated at the mRNA (gene) level, and included many important IFN stimulated genes. Further functional experimentation demonstrated that stimulating IFN signalling prior to infection, significantly reduced NBV replication in PaKiT03 cells. Moreover, inhibiting IFN signalling (through specific siRNAs) increased NBV replication in L929 cells. In line with the significant cytopathic effects seen in PaKiT03 cells, we also observed a down-regulation of genes involved in cell-cell junctions, which may be related to the fusogenic effects of NBV. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new multi-dimensional insights into the host response of mammalian cells to NBV infection. We show that IFN activity is capable of reducing NBV replication, although it is unlikely that this is solely responsible for the reduced replication of NBV in L929 cells. The molecular events that underpin the fusogenic cytopathic effects described here will prove valuable for identifying potential therapeutic targets against fusogenic orthoreovirus.

While the institutions and practices of democracy during normal times are well established, democratic standards during emergencies have yet to be conceptualized in the literature. This makes it difficult to systematically answer questions like - How do states' responses to Covid-19 violate democratic standards? Do such violations make states' responses more effective? Drawing on international treaties, norms, and academic scholarship, we propose a novel conceptualization of democratic standards for emergency measures. We then identify which government responses to Covid-19 qualify as a violation of democratic standards within the framework of illiberal and authoritarian practices, introducing a dataset covering 144 countries from March 2020 onward. In this article, we provide an overview of the extent to which states violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19 during 2020. We find no relationship between violations of democratic standards and reported Covid-19 mortality. Illiberal and authoritarian practices in response to the Covid-19 pandemic do not correlate with better public health outcomes. Rather, such crisis-driven violations should be carefully observed as they could signal autocratization.","Edgell, Amanda B.; Lachapelle, Jean; Lührmann, Anna; Maerz, Seraphine F.",Soc Sci Med,92,20

We explored the impact of the national stay-at-home orders on alcohol or drug use and screenings among trauma admissions. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study at six Level I trauma centers across four states. Patients admitted during the period after the onset of the COVID-19 restrictions (defined as March 16, 2020-May 31, 2020) were compared with those admitted during the same time period in 2019. We compared 1) rate of urine drug screens and blood alcohol screens; 2) rate of positivity for drugs or alcohol (blood alcohol concentration ≥ 10 mg/dL); 3) characteristics of patients who were positive for drug or alcohol, by period using chi-squared tests or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate. Two-tailed tests with an alpha of p < 0.05 was used on all tests. RESULTS: There were 4762 trauma admissions across the study period; 2602 (55%) in 2019 and 2160 (45%) in 2020. From 2019 to 2020, there were statistically significant increases in alcohol screens (34% vs. 37%, p = 0.03) and drug screens (21% vs. 26%, p < 0.001). Overall, the rate of alcohol positive patients significantly increased from 2019 to 2020 (32% vs. 39%, p = 0.007), while the rate of drug positive patients was unchanged (57% vs. 52%, p = 0.13). Of the 1025 (22%) patients who were positive for alcohol or drugs, there were significant increases in a history of alcoholism (41% vs. 26%, p < 0.001), and substance abuse (11% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) in the 2020 period. No other statistically significant differences were identified among alcohol or drug positive patients during COVID-19 compared to the same period in 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Our first wave of COVID-19 data suggests that trauma centers were admitting significantly more patients who were alcohol positive, as well those with substance use disorders, potentially due to the impact of social restrictions and guidelines. Further longitudinal research is warranted to assess the alcohol and drug positive rates of trauma patients over the COVID-19 pandemic.","McGraw, Constance; Salottolo, Kristin; Carrick, Matthew; Lieser, Mark; Madayag, Robert; Berg, Gina; Banton, Kaysie; Hamilton, David; Bar-Or, David",Inj Epidemiol,92,3

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the antiviral effects of YHPG in H1N1 influenza virus (IFV)-infected mice and its possible mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICR mice were intranasally infected with 10 LD(50) viral dose of IFV and then oral administration of YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) or oseltamivir (positive control) once a day for 2 or 4 consecutive days, six mice in each group. The lung, spleen and thymus indexes of IFV-infected mice, the expression of viral loads and pathological changes in lung tissues were performed to evaluate the antiviral effects of YHPG. Real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot assays were used to determine the expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. RESULTS: LD(50) in mice was 10(−3.5)/0.02 mL. YHPG (6, 12, and 18 g/kg) dose-dependently decreased the lung index and viral load; the inhibition ratio of lung index was 5.31, 18.22, and 34.06%, respectively. Further detection revealed that YHPG (12 and 18 g/kg) significantly attenuated lung pathological changes, and increased the spleen and thymus indexes. Moreover, YHPG significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of Bax and caspase-3 in lung tissues of mice infected with IFV, and up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: YHPG has significant antiviral effects in IFV-infected mice, partially by inhibiting influenza virus replication and regulating the occurrence of apoptosis induced by influenza virus infection, suggesting that YHPG may be a promising antiviral agent with potential clinical application prospects.","Du, Hai-xia; Zhou, Hui-fen; Yang, Jie-hong; Lu, Yi-yu; He, Yu; Wan, Hai-tong",Pharmaceutical biology,92,16

The spike protein (S) of this virus enables binding to the human receptor ACE2, and hence presents a prime target for vaccines preventing viral entry into host cells. The S proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Here we used comparative pangenomic analysis of all sequenced reference Betacoronaviruses, complemented with functional and structural analyses. This analysis reveals that, among all core gene clusters present in these viruses, the envelope protein E shows a variant cluster shared by SARS and SARS-CoV-2 with two completely-conserved key functional features, namely an ion-channel, and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM). These features play a key role in the activation of the inflammasome causing the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the leading cause of death in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together with functional pangenomic analysis, mutation tracking, and previous evidence, on E protein as a determinant of pathogenicity in SARS, we suggest E protein as an alternative therapeutic target to be considered for further studies to reduce complications of SARS-CoV-2 infections in COVID-19.","Alam, Intikhab; Kamau, Allan A.; Kulmanov, Maxat; Jaremko, Łukasz; Arold, Stefan T.; Pain, Arnab; Gojobori, Takashi; Duarte, Carlos M.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,92,1

Stanford’s cue-centered therapy (CCT) was designed to address this gap by offering a flexible, integrative, and insight-oriented treatment approach that is grounded in principles of neuroscience, developmental trauma, client empowerment, and allostasis. This article reviews the CCT rationale, treatment components, evidence base, and training approach. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies demonstrate promising outcomes indicating CCT effectiveness in reducing child and caregiver posttraumatic stress, and in improving child functioning. Further research, however, is needed to identify which clients are best-suited for CCT (versus other available child trauma treatments) and to identify which components of CCT are most critical for addressing complex developmental trauma. SUMMARY: CCT advances the field of child trauma treatment by offering an intervention approach focused on addressing complex developmental trauma. Positive treatment and training outcomes indicate utility of CCT for clients and clinicians. Innovations in research and training approaches are needed to further dissemination and implementation of CCT and other related child trauma interventions for complex developmental trauma.","Kletter, Hilit; Matlow, Ryan; Tanovic, Selma; Carrion, Victor",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,92,1

However, there seems to appear vaccine-taking hesitancy among the general people. Against this backdrop, this current study sets to assess the vaccine-taking intention, ways to overcome the vaccine-taking reluctance among Bangladeshi people and explore their knowledge, perceptions, and attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine. To this end, this study leveraged on a cross-sectional survey, which was consisted of 1377 respondents covering the eight divisions of Bangladesh. The descriptive statistical method and ordinal logistics regression were employed to explore and rationalize our study outlined objectives. Empirical findings revealed that approximately 71% of the respondents had adequate knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 46% of the respondents were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 while the rest of the respondents were hesitant to take the vaccine. However, concern about the potential side effects was one of the core reasons for vaccine-taking hesitancy. Assuring the common people about vaccine safety and efficacy, along with easing the registration procedure, can ameliorate people's confidence to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, about 60% of the respondents believed that a vaccine could help Bangladesh win the battle against COVID-19 and will allow back to normal life. Although the government has taken some pragmatic action steps to promote the vaccination rate, it is recommended that the mass vaccination program should be extended to the grassroots level with proper extension community support and easing the registration process.","Hossain, Emran; Rana, Jaber; Islam, Sayemul; Khan, Akhtaruzzaman; Chakrobortty, Sudipto; Ema, Nishat Sultana; Bekun, Festus Victor",Hum Vaccin Immunother,92,1

Researchers have leveraged the 20-year battle against AIDS into a variety of possible treatments for SARS. Most prominently, based solely on viral genome information, silencers of viral genes, viral-enzyme blockers and viral-entry inhibitors were suggested as potential therapeutic agents for SARS. In particular, inhibitors of viral entry, comprising therapeutic peptides, were based on the recently launched anti-HIV drug enfuvirtide. This could represent one of the most direct routes from genome sequencing to the discovery of antiviral drugs.","Kliger, Yossef; Levanon, Erez Y.; Gerber, Doron",Drug Discov Today,92,30

Recently, a rodent mammarenavirus, Wēnzhōu virus (WENV) and related viruses, have been reported in China, Cambodia, and Thailand. Moreover, in Cambodia, these viruses were suspected to be associated with human disease. In China, Yunnan Province is famous for its abundant animal and plant diversity and is adjacent to several South-eastern Asia countries. Therefore, it is necessary to know whether WENV-related viruses, or other mammarenaviruses, are prevalent in this province. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Small mammals were trapped, euthanized, and sampled. Mammarenavirus RNA was detected using a nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. A total of 1040 small mammals belonging to 13 genera and 26 species were trapped in Yunnan Province. WENV-related mammarenaviruses were detected in 41 rodent liver samples, mainly in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) and oriental house rats (R. tanezumi).Viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in liver sections by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Full-length-genomes were amplified by RT-PCR and used for phylogenetic analysis with the MEGA package. Recombination analysis was performed using the SimPlot and Recombination Detection Program. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: WENV related viruses circulated in small mammals in Yunnan Province. Whole genome sequence analysis of five selected viral strains showed that these viruses are closely related to WENVs discovered in Asia and form an independent branch in the phylogenetic tree in the WENV clade. Paying attention to investigate the influence of these viruses to public health is essential in the epidemic regions.","Wang, Jinxia; Yang, Xinglou; Liu, Haizhou; Wang, Li; Zhou, Jihua; Han, Xi; Zhu, Yan; Yang, Weihong; Pan, Hong; Zhang, Yunzhi; Shi, Zhengli",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,92,6

Method: Frontline health professionals diagnosed with COVID-19 before February 9, 2020 in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China and the same amount of controls in the uninfected group were included in this study. Clinical and laboratory data were collected with standardized forms. Results: A total of 164 subjects were included in this study, 82 cases in the infected group and 82 controls in the uninfected group, with a median age of 37 years, including 63 males and 101 females. Nineteen (23.2%) patients in the infected group were administered oral arbidol, and 48 (58.5%) in the uninfected group (OR = 0.214, 95% CI 0.109–0.420). The cumulative uninfected rate of health professionals in the arbidol group was significantly higher than that of individuals in the non-arbidol group (log-rank test, χ(2) = 98.74; P < 0.001). Forty-eight patients (58.5%) in the infection group were hospitalized, with a median age of 39 (31–49) years, of whom 7 (14.6%) were prophylactically administered arbidol. Thirty-four patients (41.5%) with mild symptoms were treated outside the hospital, among which the median age was 34 (30–39) years, and twelve patients (35.3%) took prophylactic oral arbidol. The hospitalization rate was significantly associated with age (P = 0.024) and oral arbidol administration (OR = 0.313, 95% CI 0.108–0.909). In the age-matched case-control study, the hospitalization rate was not significantly associated with arbidol administration (P = 0.091). Conclusion: Prophylactic oral arbidol was associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection but not hospitalization rate in health professionals, providing a basis for the selection of prophylactic drugs for high-risk populations.","Yang, Chunguang; Ke, Chunjin; Yue, Daoyuan; Li, Wengang; Hu, Zhiquan; Liu, Wei; Hu, Shuhua; Wang, Shaogang; Liu, Jihong",Front Public Health,92,1

He underwent liver transplantation 4 years earlier due to HCV and NASH-related cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. At admission he was in reduced general conditions. Nasopharyngeal smear specimen resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pulmonary low-dose CT-scan revealed bilateral subpleural ground-glass infiltrates. O2 saturation was 93%. A treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine twice daily was started. The patient received also cefepime and remained in isolation. Seven days later imaging showed a progression of the pulmonary infiltrates. Cefepime was replaced by meropenem. During the following 3 days the fever resolved, and the general conditions of the patient significantly improved. Consequently, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was stopped. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia in this immunosuppressed patient was moderate to severe and liver injury was not clinically significant. Despite its limitations, this case report confirm that the liver may be only mildly affected during SARS-CoV-2 infection, also in liver transplanted patients. Further studies are needed to assess whether the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is worse in immunosuppressed patients than in the general population.","Gottardi, Andrea De; Fratila, Corneliu; Bertoli, Raffaela; Cerny, Andreas; Magenta, Lorenzo; Gianella, Pietro; Majno-Hurst, Pietro; Ceschi, Alessandro; Vanini, Gianluca; Bernasconi, Enos",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,92,24

IPF incidences were raising rapidly across the world. FDA approved pirfenidone and nintedanib (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) are being used as a first-line treatment drugs for IPF, however, neither the quality of life nor survival rates have been improved because of patient noncompliance due to multiple side effects. Thus, the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting TGF-β mediated cascade of fibrotic events is urgently needed to improve the survival of the patients suffering from devastating disease. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate and validate the anti-fibrotic properties of Biochanin-A (isoflavone) against TGF-β mediated fibrosis in in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo models and to determine the molecular mechanisms that mediate these anti-fibrotic effects. Methods: The therapeutic activity of BCA was determined in in vitro/ex vivo models. Cells were pre-treated with BCA and incubated in presence or absence of recombinant-TGF-β to stimulate the fibrotic cascade of events. Pulmonary fibrosis was developed by intratracheal administration of bleomycin in rats. BCA treatment was given for 14 days from post bleomycin instillation and then various investigations (collagen content, fibrosis gene/protein expression and histopathological changes) were performed to assess the anti-fibrotic activity of BCA. Results:In vitro/ex vivo (Primary normal, IPF cell line and primary IPF cells/ Precision cut mouse lung slices) experiments revealed that, BCA treatment significantly (p <0.001) reduced the expression of TGF-β modulated fibrotic genes/protein expressions (including their functions) which are involved in the cascade of fibrotic events. BCA treatment significantly (p<0.01) reduced the bleomycin-induced inflammatory cell-infiltration, inflammatory markers expression, collagen deposition and expression of fibrotic markers in lung tissues equivalent or better than pirfenidone treatment. In addition, BCA treatment significantly (p<0.001) attenuated the TGF-β1/BLM-mediated increase of TGF-β/Smad2/3 phosphorylation and resulted in the reduction of pathological abnormalities in lung tissues determined by histopathology observations. Conclusion: Collectively, BCA treatment demonstrated the remarkable therapeutic effects on TGF-β/BLM mediated pulmonary fibrosis using IPF cells and rodent models. This current study may offer a novel treatment approach to halt and may be even rescue the devastating lung scarring of IPF.","Andugulapati, Sai Balaji; Gourishetti, Karthik; Tirunavalli, Satya Krishna; Shaikh, Taslim Babru; Sistla, Ramakrishna",Phytomedicine,92,18

The proposed flexible model for organizing blended and distance learning in higher education involves the creation of an individual learning path through testing students before the start of training. Based on the learning outcomes, the student is credited to the learning path. The training path consists of mandatory and additional modules for training; additional modules can be skipped after successfully passing the test, without studying these modules. The paper examines the composition of intelligent learning systems: student model, learning model and interface model. A student model is described, which contains the level of their knowledge, skills and abilities, the ability to learn, the ability to complete tasks (whether they know how to use the information received or not), personal characteristics (type, orientation) and other factors.

Being a large, multidomain, transmembrane protein, Nsp3 has been the most challenging Nsp to characterize. Encoded within Nsp3 is the papain-like protease PLpro domain that cleaves not only the viral protein but also polyubiquitin and the ubiquitin-like modifier ISG15 from host cells. We here compare the interactors of PLpro and Nsp3 and find a largely overlapping interactome. Intriguingly, we find that near full length Nsp3 is a more active protease compared to the minimal catalytic domain of PLpro. Using a MALDI-TOF based assay, we screen 1971 approved clinical compounds and identify five compounds that inhibit PLpro with IC50s in the low micromolar range but showed cross reactivity with other human deubiquitinases and had no significant antiviral activity in cellular SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. We therefore looked for alternative methods to block PLpro activity and engineered competitive nanobodies that bind to PLpro at the substrate binding site with nanomolar affinity thus inhibiting the enzyme.

This lineage of RRV continues to circulate throughout Australia and both earlier lineages, which lacked the duplicated element, now are extinct. Multiple copies of several other elements also were observed in this region of the nsP3 gene in all lineages of RRV. Multiple copies of one of these, coding for the amino acid sequence P*P*PR, were detected in the C-terminal region of the nsP3 protein of all alphaviruses except those of African origin.

One of the main routes of human exposure to pollutants is through drinking water. Thus, this point of view discusses some major contaminants in drinking water known to be immunotoxic, exploring sources and drinking water routes and emphasizing the known mechanisms of action that could likely compromise the effective immune response of humans, particularly raising concerns regarding people exposed to the COVID-19 virus. Based on a literature review, metals, plastic components, plasticizers, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances may display the potential to exacerbate COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, although epidemiological studies are still required to confirm the synergistic effects between these pollutants and the virus.","Quinete, Natalia; Hauser-Davis, Rachel Ann",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,92,20

It is a member of the IL-1 family and binds to a heterodimer receptor consisting of ST2 and IL-1RAP to induce the production of a wide range of cellular mediators, including the type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. This relationship has led to the hypothesis that the IL-33/ST2 pathway is a driver of allergic disease and inhibition of the IL-33 and ST2 association could have therapeutic benefit. METHODS: In this paper, we describe the selection of a phage antibody through the ability to bind human IL-33 and block IL-33/ST2 interaction. This hit antibody was then affinity matured by site-directed mutagenesis of the antibody complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Further characterization of a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb), torudokimab (LY3375880) included demonstration of human IL-33 neutralization activity in vitro with an NFκB reporter assay and IL-33 induced mast cell cytokine secretion assay, followed by an in vivo IL-33-induced pharmacodynamic inhibition assay in mice that used IL-5 production as the endpoint. RESULTS: Torudokimab is highly specific to IL-33 and does not bind any of the other IL-1 family members. Furthermore, torudokimab binds human and cynomolgus monkey IL-33 with higher affinity than the binding affinity of IL-33 to ST2, but does not bind mouse, rat, or rabbit IL-33.

A model that captures all clinical symptoms of COVID-19 as well as long-haulers disease is needed. We investigated the host responses associated with infection in several major organ systems including the respiratory tract, the heart, and the kidneys after SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters. We found significant increases in inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF) and type II interferons whereas type I interferons were inhibited. Examination of extrapulmonary tissue indicated inflammation in the kidney, liver, and heart which also lacked type I interferon upregulation. Histologically, the heart had evidence of mycarditis and microthrombi while the kidney had tubular inflammation. These results give insight into the multiorgan disease experienced by people with COVID-19 and possibly the prolonged disease in people with post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC).","Francis, Magen E.; Goncin, Una; Kroeker, Andrea; Swan, Cynthia; Ralph, Robyn; Lu, Yao; Etzioni, Athema L.; Falzarano, Darryl; Gerdts, Volker; Machtaler, Steven; Kindrachuk, Jason; Kelvin, Alyson A.",bioRxiv,92,16

Using daily investor attention indices, which are based on global COVD-19-related google search queries, and stock return indices for 14 African stock markets, we show that investor attention is an important determinant of stock returns. Our estimates suggest that an increase in investor attention consistently reduces stock returns in three stock markets, namely Botswana, Nigeria, and Zambia. In contrast, an increase in investor attention may enhance stock returns in Ghana and Tanzania. Our estimates imply that, in uncertain times like the current pandemic, stock markets like those of Ghana and Tanzania may offer potential diversification benefits to investors. We demonstrate that our estimates are broadly robust using a composite measure of investor attention. • We built a direct and unambiguous measure of investor attention or risk attitude related to the COVID-19 pandemic. • In an exponential generalised autoregressive heteroskedasticity of order one (i.e. EGARCH(1,1)) framework, we regressed stock returns on their first lags, investor attention, exchange rate returns, and commodity returns, and controlled for investor attention in the variance equation.","Iyke, Bernard Njindan; Ho, Sin-Yu",MethodsX,92,17

It is showed that the survival time of the virus can be reduced by increasing the receding contact angle or by reducing the initial contact angle of a drop deposited on a solid surface. It has been found that the lifetime of the virus increases almost five times under highly humid conditions as compared to dry conditions. It is further observed that the normalized lifetime does not depend upon thermo-physical properties, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and initial drop volume. A model has been proposed to estimate the shear stress acting on a virus taking into account the effect of a Marangoni flow. The presented model unveils that the magnitude of computed shear stress is not enough to obliterate the virus. The findings of the present model have been discussed in the context of reducing the COVID-19 infection, but the model can also be applied for coughed/sneezed droplets of other infectious diseases. Moreover, this physical understanding of evaporation dynamics on solid surfaces with a stick-slip mode may help in better design of a face mask, PPE kit, and other protective equipment used in public places in order to minimize the chances of infection and tackle the current pandemic. However, the reported model for estimating the survival time of the virus does not consider the effect of the thermo-capillary convection (the Marangoni effect).","Kumar, Sumit",Phys Fluids (1994),92,20

Blood samples were taken approximately 60 d after the outbreak. Antibody levels were quantified as the sample-to-positive ratio (S/P ratio) using a fluorescent microsphere assay. Reproductive traits included total number born (TNB), number born alive (NBA), number stillborn (NSB), number mummified (NBM), and number born dead (NBD). Mortality traits were log transformed for genetic analyses. Data were split into prior, during, and after the disease outbreak phases using visual appraisal of the estimates of farm-year-week effects for each reproductive trait. For NBA, data from all phases were combined into a reaction norm analysis with regression on estimates of farm-year-week effects for NBA. Heritability for S/P ratio was estimated at 0.17 ± 0.05. Heritability estimates for reproduction traits were all low and were lower during the outbreak for NBA but greater for mortality traits. TNB was not greatly affected during the outbreak, as many sows that farrowed during the outbreak were mated prior to the outbreak. Heritability for TNB decreased from 0.13 (prior) to 0.08 (after). Genetic correlation estimates between prior to and during the outbreak were high for TNB (0.86 ± 0.23) and NBA (0.98 ± 0.38) but lower for mortality traits: 0.65 ± 0.43, −0.42 ± 0.55, and 0.29 ± 1.39 for LNSB, LNBM, and LNBD, respectively. TNB prior to and after the outbreak had a lower genetic correlation (0.32 ± 0.33). In general, genetic correlation estimates of S/P ratio with reproductive performance during the outbreak were below 0.20 in absolute value, except for LNSB (−0.73 ± 0.29). Based on the reaction norm model, estimates of genetic correlations between the intercept and slope terms ranged from 0.24 ± 0.50 to 0.54 ± 0.35 depending on the parameterization used, indicating that selection for the intercept may result in indirect selection for steeper slopes, and thus, less resilient animals. In general, estimates of genetic correlations between farm-year-week effect classes based on the reaction norm model resembled estimates of genetic correlations from the multivariate analysis. Overall, compared to previous studies, antibody S/P ratios showed a lower heritability (0.17 ± 0.05) and low genetic correlations with reproductive performance during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome outbreak, except for the LNSB.","Putz, Austin M; Schwab, Clint R; Sewell, Alysta D; Holtkamp, Derald J; Zimmerman, Jeffery J; Baker, Kimberlee; Serão, Nick V L; Dekkers, Jack C M",Journal of Animal Science,92,30

La physiopathologie de cette infection virale est de plus en plus décrite et des facteurs pronostiques sont identifiés. Plusieurs études ont souligné le rôle crucial de la réponse interféron (IFN) dans la clairance virale. Cette réponse, altérée dans les formes sévères et critiques de COVID-19, est associée à une production excessive de cytokines pro-inflammatoires. La lymphopénie est également associée aux formes graves, les patients immunodéprimés sont à risque de forme sévère. L’Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) et le Torque-Teno Virus (TTV) sont associés à des états d’immunodépression. Quelques cas cliniques rapportent leurs réplications au cours de l’infection à SARS-CoV-2, notamment chez les patients en réanimation. Ainsi, il a été suspecté que la réplication de l’EBV et du TTV pouvait être le témoin d’une immunodépression sous-jacente et constituait un facteur pronostique au cours de l’infection à SARS-CoV-2. S’est aussi posée la question de formes particulières de la maladie chez ces patients. Patients et méthodes L’étude porte sur l’ensemble des patients atteints de COVID-19 hospitalisés en service de médecine interne dans un centre hospitalo-universitaire. Les critères d’inclusion comprenaient une PCR SARS-CoV-2 positive et la réalisation d’une PCR EBV sur sang total au cours du séjour. 130 patients ont été inclus consécutivement. 25 patients ont eu une PCR TTV sur sang total. L’ensemble des données cliniques, biologiques et radiologiques ont été collectées. Les données biologiques l’ont été au moment de la PCR EBV sauf pour la valeur maximale de la CRP, le nadir des lymphocytes et leur typage. Résultats La cohorte était composée de 61,53 % d’hommes avec un âge moyen de 63,31 ans. Un total de 38,46 % des patients avaient séjourné en réanimation avec un délai moyen de 2,59jours. Neuf décès étaient dénombrés. 64,62 % des patients avaient été traités par déxaméthasone, 67,69 % par antibiotiques avec 19,23 % de surinfections documentées. 57,69 % des patients avaient une virémie positive pour l’EBV dont 50,67 % présentaient une charge virale (CV) supérieure à 1000UI/ml. L’atteinte pulmonaire scannographique était plus importante chez les patients EBV+ que chez les EBV- (p-value<0,05). 42,67 % des patients EBV+ avaient séjourné en réanimation ou en USC contre 32,73 % des EBV- (p-value=0,28) avec une durée de séjour plus longue (2,96 vs 2,09jours, p-value=0,28). Les patients EBV+ avec une CV>1000UI/ml avaient reçu de façon significative plus de déxaméthasone que les patients avec une CV<1000UI/ml (78,95 % vs 48,65 %, p-value<0,01). Le nadir des lymphocytes chez les patients EBV+ était inférieur à celui des patients EBV- (0,79G/L vs 0,93G/L, p-value=0,051) avec un ratio CD4/CD8 abaissé (2,20 vs 2,85, p-value=0,37). Les enzymes hépatiques étaient plus élevées chez les patients EBV+ (p <0,05), aucune différence n’existait pour les D-Dimères, le fibrinogène ou la CRP. 44,00 % des patients avaient une CV>1000UI/ml pour le TTV, avec une tendance à des formes plus graves (45,45 % de patients hospitalisés en USC ou réanimation vs 28,57 % chez les patients avec une CV<1000UI/ml, p-value=0,43) et une durée de séjour plus longue (2,27 vs 1,21jours, p-value=0,35). Discussion Cette étude sur la réplication de l’EBV et du TTV chez les patients COVID-19 est la plus importante à ce jour. Malgré une hétérogénéité dans la date des prélèvements par rapport au début des symptômes, les patients avec une virémie détectable pour l’EBV présentaient des atteintes pulmonaires plus graves et une lymphopénie plus profonde. Ceci est corroboré par des séries de cas où la prévalence de l’EBV en réanimation était plus importante que celle décrite ici. La CV de l’EBV était aussi associée à des durées de séjour en réanimation plus longues. Le recours à la déxaméthasone plus fréquent chez les patients avec une CV de l’EBV>1000UI/ml suggère une oxygénoréquérance plus grande. La CV de l’EBV pourrait donc constituer un marqueur d’immunodépression sous-jacente et représenter un facteur de mauvais pronostique au cours de l’infection à SARS-CoV-2, avec parfois des tableaux proches de syndromes d’activation lymphohistiocytaire. L’impact de la réplication du TTV est difficile à préciser en raison de l’effectif limité. L’effet de telles co-infections sur la réponse IFN serait intéressant à caractériser compte tenu de la valeur pronostique de celle-ci. Conclusion Ces données suggèrent que les co-infections virales lors d’une infection à SARS-CoV-2 pourraient refléter un état d’immunodépression sous-jacent et être associées à un mauvais pronostique.","Robert, M.; Fort, R.; Destras, G.; Barba, T.; Hot, A.",La Revue de Médecine Interne,92,20

It firstly appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. During the next two months, it moved rapidly throughout China. Most of the infected patients have mild symptoms including fever, fatigue and cough, but in severe cases, patients can progress rapidly and develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. The new coronavirus was reported to spread via droplets, contact and natural aerosols from human to human. Therefore, aerosol-producing procedures such as endotracheal intubation may put the anesthesiologists at high risk of nosocomial infections. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 infection of anesthesiologists after endotracheal intubation for confirmed COVID-19 patients have been reported in hospitals in Wuhan. The expert panel of airway management in Chinese Society of Anaesthesiology has deliberated and drafted this recommendation, by which we hope to guide the performance of endotracheal intubation by frontline anesthesiologists and critical care physicians. During the airway management, enhanced droplet/airborne personal protective equitment (PPE) should be applied to the health care providers. A good airway assessment before airway intervention is of vital importance. For patients with normal airway, awake intubation should be avoided, and modified rapid sequence induction is strongly recommended. Sufficient muscle relaxant should be assured before intubation. For patients with difficult airway, good preparation of airway devices and detailed intubation plans should be made.","Zuo, Mingzhang; Huang, Yuguang; Ma, Wuhua; Xue, Zhanggang; Zhang, Jiaqiang; Gong, Yahong; Che, Lu",Chinese Medical Sciences Journal,92,26

The elucidation of the events associated with the intestinal epithelial response to PEDV infection has been limited by the absence of good in vitro porcine intestinal models that recapitulate the multicellular complexity of the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we generated swine enteroids from the intestinal crypt stem cells of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum and found that the generated enteroids are able to satisfactorily recapitulate the complicated intestinal epithelium in vivo and are susceptible to infection by PEDV. PEDV infected multiple types of cells, including enterocytes, stem cells, and goblet cells, and exhibited segmental infection discrepancies compared with ileal enteroids and colonoids, and this finding was verified in vivo. Moreover, the clinical isolate PEDV-JMS propagated better in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted isolate PEDV-CV777, and PEDV infection suppressed interferon (IFN) production early during the infection course. IFN lambda elicited a potent antiviral response and inhibited PEDV in enteroids more efficiently than IFN alpha (IFN-α). Therefore, swine enteroids provide a novel in vitro model for exploring the pathogenesis of PEDV and for the in vitro study of the interplay between a host and a variety of swine enteric viruses. IMPORTANCE PEDV is a highly contagious enteric coronavirus that causes significant economic losses, and the lack of a good in vitro model system is a major roadblock to an in-depth understanding of PEDV pathogenesis. Here, we generated a porcine intestinal enteroid model for PEDV infection. Utilizing porcine intestinal enteroids, we demonstrated that PEDV infects multiple lineages of the intestinal epithelium and preferably infects ileal enteroids over colonoids and that enteroids prefer to respond to IFN lambda 1 over IFN-α. These events recapitulate the events that occur in vivo. This study constitutes the first use of a primary intestinal enteroid model to investigate the susceptibility of porcine enteroids to PEDV and to determine the antiviral response following infection. Our study provides important insights into the events associated with PEDV infection of the porcine intestine and provides a valuable in vitro model for studying not only PEDV but also other swine enteric viruses.","Li, Liang; Fu, Fang; Guo, Shanshan; Wang, Hongfeng; He, Xijun; Xue, Mei; Yin, Lingdan; Feng, Li; Liu, Pinghuang",Journal of Virology,92,16

Although often used, systemic corticosteroids may increase the risk of mortality and morbidity (e.g. secondary infections) in severe influenza and other viral infections, especially if there is delay or lack of effective antiviral therapy. Non‐randomized studies suggest that convalescent plasma appears useful as add‐on therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza A(H5N1), and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic [A(H1N1)pdm09), but it is limited by its availability. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing hyperimmune globulin prepared from convalescent plasma against normal intravenous gammaglobulin (IVIG) manufactured before 2009 as control in patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection on standard antiviral treatment has shown that the hyperimmune globulin group who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset had a lower viral load and reduced mortality compared with the controls. A number of agents with immunomodulatory effects (e.g. acute use of statins, N‐acetylcysteine, macrolides, PPAR agonists, IVIG, celecoxib, mesalazine) have been proposed for influenza management. However, more animal and detailed human observational studies and preferably RCTs controlling for the effects of antiviral therapy and disease severity are needed for evaluating these agents. The role of plasmapheresis and hemoperfusion as rescue therapy also merits more investigation.","Hui, David S. C.; Lee, Nelson",Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses,92,20

MAIN BODY/TEXT: Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia occurs when specific antibodies bind to platelet factor 4 /heparin complexes. Platelet factor 4 is a naturally occurring chemokine, and under certain conditions, may complex with negatively charged molecules and polyanions, including heparin. The antibody-platelet factor 4/heparin complex may lead to platelet activation, accompanied by other cascading reactions, resulting in cerebral sinus thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, lower limb arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, skin necrosis, and thrombotic stroke. If untreated, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia can be life threatening. In parallel, rare incidents of spontaneous vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia can also occur in some patients administered certain coronavirus vaccines. The role of platelet factor 4 in vaccine-induced thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome further reinforces the importance the platelet factor 4/polyanion immune complexes and the complications that this might pose to susceptible individuals. These findings demonstrate, how auxiliary factors can complicate heparin therapy and drug development. An increasing interest in biomanufacturing heparins from non-animal sources has driven a growing interest in understanding the biology of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and therefore, the development of safe and effective biosynthetic heparins. SHORT CONCLUSION: In conclusion, these findings further reinforce the importance of the binding of platelet factor 4 with known and unknown polyanions, and the complications that these might pose to susceptible patients. In parallel, these findings also demonstrate how auxiliary factors can complicate the heparin drug development.","Datta, Payel; Zhang, Fuming; Dordick, Jonathan S.; Linhardt, Robert J.",Thromb J,92,18

They were recruited online through social media platforms and completed questionnaires on Qualtrics about their family’s social distancing practices and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Women with a Doctorate (mean = 35.37; SD = 4.24) and Master’s (mean = 34.26; SD = 5.70) degree reported higher levels of family social distancing compared to women with some college (mean = 31.11; SD = 8.11) or a college degree (mean = 32.62; SD = 6.91; p’s = .00). Women who identified as Democrat (mean = 35.92; SD = 3.30) or Independent (mean 34.13; SD = 5.63), or indicated not identifying with a political party (mean = 34.19; SD = 5.69), reported higher levels of family social distancing compared to women who identified as Republican (mean = 29.70; SD = 8.12; p’s = .00).

We studied the effects of injectable (subcutaneous) supplementation with copper, zinc, selenium, manganese, and vitamins A and E. Calves were supplemented twice, before weaning and on the day of weaning. We evaluated variables related to the immune status and the immune response to a vaccine containing bovine herpesvirus type 1, as well as body weight and average daily gain. Parenteral supplementation of minerals and vitamins with antioxidant effects in a low-stress weaning system prevented the decrease in variables related to the immune system, improved antibody response, and had positive effects on body weight. ABSTRACT: We aimed to evaluate the effects of injectable mineral and vitamin supplementation on weaning calves subjected to a low-stress (fence-line) weaning system. Seven-month-old Aberdeen Angus female calves (n = 40, 152 ± 11 kg body weight) from a selenium-deficient area of extensive cattle production on natural grass were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 20 each). One group received subcutaneous supplementation with copper, zinc, selenium, manganese and vitamins A and E (SG), and the other was given sterile saline solution (CG). The animals were supplemented twice, seven days before weaning (day −7) and on the day of weaning (day 0), and they were evaluated 30 (+30) and 60 (+60) days after weaning. Total antioxidant status (TAS), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, body weight, and average daily gain (ADG) were evaluated. Additionally, antibody titers were assessed prior to and after each immunization with a vaccine containing bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1). On day +30, body weight (p = 0.03) was higher in SG, whereas TAS (p = 0.02) and GPx (p = 0.0038) activity were lower in CG and remained constant in SG. Antibody titers increased in SG and CG following immunization, being higher in SG on days +30 and +60 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, parenteral supplementation of minerals and vitamins with antioxidant effects in a low-stress weaning system prevented the decrease in TAS and GPx activity, improved antibody response and had positive effects on body weight.","Mattioli, Guillermo Alberto; Rosa, Diana Esther; Turic, Esteban; Picco, Sebastián Julio; Raggio, Santiago José; Minervino, Antonio Humberto Hamad; Fazzio, Luis Emilio",Animals (Basel),92,1

CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a sudden neck swelling and rash likely due to late SARS-CoV-2 in a 64-year-old woman. The patient reported COVID-19 symptoms over the previous three weeks. Computed Tomography (CT) revealed a diffuse soft-tissue swelling and edema of subcutaneous tissue, hypodermis, and muscular and deep fascial planes. All the differential diagnoses were ruled out. Both the anamnestic history of the patient’s husband who had died of COVID-19 with and the collateral findings of pneumonia and esophageal wall edema suggested the association with COVID-19. This was confirmed by nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction. The patient was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and piperacillin/tazobactam for 7 days. The neck swelling resolved in less than 24 h, while the erythema was still present up to two days later. The patient was discharged after seven days in good clinical condition and with a negative swab. CONCLUSION: Sudden neck swelling with rash may be a coincidental presentation, but, in the pandemic context, it is most likely a direct or indirect complication of COVID-19.","Giannitto, Caterina; Bonifacio, Cristiana; Esposito, Susanna; Ammirabile, Angela; Mercante, Giuseppe; De Virgilio, Armando; Spriano, Giuseppe; Heffler, Enrico; Lofino, Ludovica; Politi, Letterio Salvatore; Balzarini, Luca",BMC Infect Dis,92,1

Although GCs provide only symptomatic relief and do not eliminate the cause of the pathology, in the majority of treatments, GCs frequently cannot be replaced by other classes of drugs. Consequently, long-term treatments cause adverse effects that may, in turn, lead to new pathologies that sometimes require the withdrawal of GC therapy. Therefore, thus far, researchers have focused their efforts on molecules that have the same efficacy as that of GCs but cause fewer adverse effects. To this end, some GC-induced proteins, such as glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), have been used as drugs in mouse models of inflammatory pathologies. In this review, we focus on some important but rare autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases for which the biomedical research investment in new therapies is less likely. Additionally, we critically evaluate the possibility of treating such diseases with other drugs, either GC-related or unrelated.","Ronchetti, Simona; Ayroldi, Emira; Ricci, Erika; Gentili, Marco; Migliorati, Graziella; Riccardi, Carlo",Front Immunol,92,9

It is essential to understand where and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted. Methods: Case reports were extracted from the local Municipal Health Commissions of 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) in China, not including Hubei province, between 4 January and 11 February 2020. We identified all outbreaks involving three or more cases and reviewed the major characteristics of the enclosed spaces in which the outbreaks were reported and associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred and eighteen outbreaks with three or more cases were identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases in 120 prefectural cities. We divided the venues in which the outbreaks occurred into six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, and miscellaneous. Among the identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, and only 1.6% involved ten or more cases. Home outbreaks were the dominant category (254 of 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed by transport (108; 34.0%; note that many outbreaks involved more than one venue category). Most home outbreaks involved three to five cases. We identified only a single outbreak in an outdoor environment, which involved two cases. Conclusions: All identified outbreaks of three or more cases occurred in an indoor environment, which confirms that sharing indoor space is a major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.","Qian, Hua; Miao, Te; LIU, Li; Zheng, Xiaohong; Luo, Danting; Li, Yuguo",,92,3

Among other results from these models has been the view that closing schools had little impact on infection rates in several countries1. We took a different approach. Making one assumption, we simply plotted cases, hospitalizations and deaths, on a log2 Y axis and a linear date-based X axis, and analyzed them using segmented regression, a powerful method that has largely been overlooked during this pandemic. Here we show that the data fit straight lines with correlation coefficients ranging from 92% - 99%, and that these lines broke at interesting intervals, revealing that school closings dropped infection rates in half, lockdowns dropped the rates 3 to 4 fold, and other actions (such as closing bars and mandating masks) brought the rates even further down. Hospitalizations and deaths paralleled cases, with lags of three to ten days. The graphs, which are easy to read, reveal changes in infection rates that are not obvious using other graphing methods, and have several implications for modeling and policy development during this and future pandemics. Overall, other than full lockdowns, three interventions had the most impact: closing schools, closing bars and wearing masks: a message easily understood by the public.","Matzinger, P.; Skinner, J.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,92,16

In this study, we examined the clinical outcome of our KTRs with COVID‐19 disease, who were treated with a broad‐spectrum anti‐inflammatory protocol. This protocol is essentially composed of intravenous immunoglobulin +/‐ tocilizumab in KTRs with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. Among 809 KTRs, 64 patients diagnosed with COVID‐19 disease between April 2020 and February 2021, were evaluated. Twenty‐nine patients with pneumonia confirmed by chest computed tomography (CCT) were hospitalized. The treatment protocol included high‐dose intravenous methylprednisolone, favipiravir, enoxaparin, and empirical antibiotics. Patients with pneumonic involvement of more than 25% on CCT with or without respiratory failure were given a total of 2 g/kg intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Nonresponders received tocilizumab, an interleukin‐6 receptor antibody. Of the 29 patients with pneumonia, 6 were treated in other hospitals. These six patients did not receive IVIg and 5 of them deceased. In our center, IVIg treatment was applied to 15 of 23 patients. Seven of them required tocilizumab. Respiratory parameters improved significantly in all but one patient after IVIg ± tocilizumab treatment. The mortality rate was 6.6% in patients who received IVIg therapy and 35.7% in those who did not (p = 0.08). The mortality rate was higher in patients who received treatment in external centers (2.2% vs. 26.3%; p = 0.0073). The treatment of KTRs with severe COVID‐19 pneumonia in organ transplant centers with significant experience yields better results. The administration of broad‐spectrum anti‐inflammatory treatment in this patient group was safe and provided excellent outcomes.","Karatas, Murat; Tatar, Erhan; Simsek, Cenk; Yıldırım, Ali Murat; Ari, Alpay; Zengel, Baha; Uslu, Adam",J Med Virol,92,10

METHODS Longitudinal data on 15,691 outpatient behavioral health treatment facilities were extracted daily from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator between January 20, 2020, and January 20, 2021. Facilities operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs were excluded. Bivariate analyses were used to assess trends in telehealth availability in 2020 and 2021. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine facility- and county-level characteristics associated with telehealth availability in 2021. RESULTS Telehealth availability increased by 77% from 2020 to 2021 for mental health treatment facilities and by 143% for substance use disorder treatment facilities. By January 2021, 68% of outpatient mental health facilities and 57% of substance use disorder treatment facilities in the sample were offering telehealth. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities that did not accept Medicaid as a form of payment were less likely to offer telehealth in 2021, compared with facilities that accepted Medicaid. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities that accepted private insurance were more likely to offer telehealth in 2021, compared with facilities that did not accept private insurance. CONCLUSIONS Although 2020 saw a dramatic increase in telehealth availability at behavioral health treatment facilities, 32% of mental health treatment facilities and 43% of substance use disorder treatment facilities did not offer telehealth in January 2021, nearly 1 year into the pandemic.","Cantor, Jonathan; McBain, Ryan K; Kofner, Aaron; Hanson, Russell; Stein, Bradley D; Yu, Hao",Psychiatric services,92,29

Previous studies highlighted that SEB may bind TCR and CD28 molecules independently of MHC class II, yet the relative contribution of these interactions to the pro-inflammatory function of SEB remained unclear. Here, we show that binding to MHC class II is dispensable for the inflammatory activity of SEB, whereas binding to TCR, CD28 and B7 molecules is pivotal, in both human primary T cells and Jurkat T cell lines. In particular, our finding is that binding of SEB to B7 molecules suffices to trigger both TCR- and CD28-mediated inflammatory signalling. We also provide evidence that, by strengthening the interaction between CD28 and B7, SEB favours the recruitment of the TCR into the immunological synapse, thus inducing lethal inflammatory signalling.","Kunkl, Martina; Amormino, Carola; Caristi, Silvana; Tedeschi, Valentina; Fiorillo, Maria Teresa; Levy, Revital; Popugailo, Andrey; Kaempfer, Raymond; Tuosto, Loretta",Front Immunol,92,1

It is thought that, similar to other RNA viruses, high mutation rates allow NoVs to evolve fast and to undergo rapid immune escape at the population level. However, the rate and spectrum of spontaneous mutations of human NoVs have not been quantified previously. Here, we analyzed the intra-patient diversity of the NoV capsid by carrying out RT-PCR and ultra-deep sequencing with 100,000-fold coverage of 16 stool samples from symptomatic patients. This revealed the presence of low-frequency sequences carrying large numbers of U-to-C or A-to-G base transitions, suggesting a role for hyper-mutation in NoV diversity. To more directly test for hyper-mutation, we performed transfection assays in which the production of mutations was restricted to a single cell infection cycle. This confirmed the presence of sequences with multiple U-to-C/A-to-G transitions, and suggested that hyper-mutation contributed a large fraction of the total NoV spontaneous mutation rate. The type of changes produced and their sequence context are compatible with ADAR-mediated editing of the viral RNA.","Cuevas, José M.; Combe, Marine; Torres-Puente, Manoli; Garijo, Raquel; Guix, Susana; Buesa, Javier; Rodríguez-Díaz, Jesús; Sanjuán, Rafael",Infect Genet Evol,92,21

Systemic inequities and differences in health behaviors may contribute to disparities in COVID-19 health outcomes. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on changes in health behaviors and anxiety in Black and White adults residing in the US. METHODS: Beginning April 2020, the Pennington Biomedical Research Center COVID-19 Health Behaviors Study collected information on changes to employment, income, diet, physical activity, anxiety, and sleep patterns through a global online survey. RESULTS: Of 4542 survey respondents in the US, 7% identified as Black and 93% as White. Prior to the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, a greater proportion of Blacks compared to Whites reported earning < US$50,000 per year (p < 0.0001). A greater proportion of Blacks reported being laid off, working fewer hours, and working from home following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders (p < 0.0001 for all). In the overall sample, eating behaviors improved, physical activity decreased, sleep time prolonged, and anxiety heightened following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders (p < 0.01 for all), which were universal between Black and White respondents (p ≥ 0.315 for all). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the disproportionate changes to employment and income in Blacks, with no differential impact on health behaviors and anxiety compared to Whites due to COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, disproportionate changes to employment and income status may widen among Blacks and Whites, which may influence health behaviors and anxiety.","Sparks, Joshua R.; Kebbe, Maryam; Flanagan, Emily W.; Beyl, Robbie A.; Altazan, Abby D.; Yang, Shengping; Redman, Leanne M.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,92,22

CSF drains from the subarachnoid space by channels that pass through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone to the nasal mucosa and cervical lymph nodes in animals and in humans; antigen presenting cells (APC) migrate along this pathway to lymph nodes. ISF and solutes drain from the brain parenchyma to cervical lymph nodes by a separate route along 100–150 nm wide basement membranes in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries. This pathway is too narrow for the migration of APC so it is unlikely that APC traffic directly from brain parenchyma to lymph nodes by this route. We present a model for the pivotal involvement of regional lymph nodes in immunological reactions of the CNS. The role of regional lymph nodes in immune reactions of the CNS in virus infections, the remote influence of the gut microbiota, multiple sclerosis and stroke are discussed. Evidence is presented for the role of cervical lymph nodes in the induction of tolerance and its influence on neuroimmunological reactions. We look to the future by examining how nanoparticle technology will enhance our understanding of CNS-lymph node connections and by reviewing the implications of lymphatic drainage of the brain for diagnosis and therapy of diseases of the CNS ranging from neuroimmunological disorders to dementias. Finally, we review the challenges and opportunities for progress in CNS-lymph node interactions and their involvement in disease processes.","Laman, Jon D.; Weller, Roy O.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,92,16

The prevalence of these viruses has not been reported from Saudi Arabia. We sought to determine whether hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are responsible for acute respiratory illness and also to determine clinical features and severity of illness in the hospitalized pediatric patient population. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective hospital-based study from July 2007 to November 2008. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nasopharyngeal specimens from children less than 16 years old who were suffering from acute respiratory diseases were tested for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction. Samples were collected from July 2007 to November 2008. RESULTS: Both viruses were found among Saudi children with upper and lower respiratory tract diseases during the autumn and winter of 2007 and 2008, contributing to 11.1% of all viral diagnoses, with individual incidences of 8.3% (hMPV) and 2.8% (HCoV-NL63) among 489 specimens. Initial symptoms included fever, cough, and nasal congestion. Lower respiratory tract disease occurs in immunocompromised individuals and those with underlying conditions. Clinical findings of respiratory failure and culture-negative shock were established in 7 children infected with hMPV and having hematologic malignancies, myelofibrosis, Gaucher disease, and congenital immunodeficiency; 2 of the 7 patients died with acute respiratory failure. All children infected with HCoV-NL63 had underlying conditions; 1 of the 4 patients developed respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: hMPV and HCoV-NL63 are important causes of acute respiratory illness among hospitalized Saudi children. hMPV infection in the lower respiratory tract is associated with morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. HCoV-NL63 may cause severe lower respiratory disease with underlying conditions.","Al Hajjar, Sami; Al Thawadi, Sahar; Al Seraihi, Amal; Al Muhsen, Saleh; Imambaccus, Hala",Ann Saudi Med,92,16

We collected responses from 274 residents at baseline and 221 residents at 3 months follow-up (timepoint 2) from the National Healthcare Group (NHG) residency programs in Singapore. All residents reported lower perceived stress and lower perceived stigma compared to baseline. Use of avoidance coping was associated with all three psychological responses (perceived stress, traumatic stress, and stigma) across the two timepoints. Compared to baseline, specific factors associated with perceived stress and traumatic stress at timepoint 2 were living alone, less problem solving, and seeking social support.

Although the effects of GCs are well characterized, their impact on brain adaptation to hypoxia/ischemia is still understudied. The brain is not only the most susceptible to hypoxic injury, but also vulnerable to GC-induced damage, which makes studying the mechanisms of brain hypoxic tolerance and resistance to stress-related elevation of GCs of great importance. Cross-talk between the molecular mechanisms activated in neuronal cells by hypoxia and GCs provides a platform for developing the most effective and safe means for prevention and treatment of hypoxia-induced brain damage, including hypoxic pre- and post-conditioning. Taking into account that hypoxia- and GC-induced reprogramming significantly affects the development of organisms during embryogenesis, studies of the effects of prenatal and neonatal hypoxia on health in later life are of particular interest. This mini review discusses the accumulated data on the dynamics of the HPA activation in injurious and non-injurious hypoxia, the role of the brain GRs in these processes, interaction of GCs and hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1, as well as cross-talk between GC and hypoxic signaling.

Natural product-derived inhibitors known as “fourth generation inhibitors” constitute more than 60% of anticancer drugs. Furthermore, consensus docking approach has recently been introduced to augment docking accuracy and reduce false positives during a virtual screening. In order to obtain novel small-molecule Met inhibitors, consensus docking approach was performed using Autodock Vina and Autodock 4.2 to virtual screen Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anti-cancer Compound–Activity–Target database against active and inactive conformation of c-Met kinase domain structure. Two hit molecules that were in line with drug-likeness criteria, desired docking score, and binding pose were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate intermolecular contacts in protein–ligand complexes. Analysis of molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area studies showed that ZINC08234189 is a plausible inhibitor for the active state of c-Met, whereas ZINC03871891 may be more effective toward active c-Met kinase domain compared to the inactive form due to higher binding energy. Our analysis showed that both the hit molecules formed hydrogen bonds with key residues of the hinge region (P1158, M1160) in the active form, which is a hallmark of kinase domain inhibitors.

The number of people infected with the novel coronavirus has surpassed 22 million globally, resulting in over 700,000 deaths with more than 15 million people having recovered (https://covid19.who.int). Enormous efforts are underway for rapid vaccine and treatment developments. Amongst the many ways of tackling the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging. SUMMARY: EVs are lipid bilayer-enclosed structures secreted from all types of cells, including those lining the respiratory tract. They have established roles in lung immunity and are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including viral infection. In this review, we point out the roles and possible contribution of EVs in viral infections, as well as ongoing EV-based approaches for the treatment of COVID-19, including clinical trials. KEY MESSAGES: EVs share structural similarities to viruses and recent findings demonstrate that viruses exploit EVs for cellular exit and EVs exploit viral entry mechanisms for cargo delivery. Moreover, EV-virus interplay could be exploited for future antiviral drug and vaccine development. EV-based therapies, especially the mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs, are being intensively studied for the treatment of COVID-19.","Pocsfalvi, Gabriella; Mammadova, Ramila; Ramos Juarez, Ana Paulina; Bokka, Ramesh; Trepiccione, Francesco; Capasso, Giovambattista",Kidney Blood Press Res,92,3

For this reason, cardiotoxicity testing has become essential in drug development and a required step in the approval of any medication for use in humans. Blockade of the hERG K(+) channel and the consequent prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG have been considered the gold standard to predict the arrhythmogenic risk of drugs. In recent years, however, preclinical safety pharmacology has begun to adopt a more integrative approach that incorporates mathematical modeling and considers the effects of drugs on multiple ion channels. Despite these advances, early stage drug screening research only evaluates QT prolongation in experimental and computational models that represent healthy individuals. We suggest here that integrating disease modeling with cardiotoxicity testing can improve drug risk stratification by predicting how disease processes and additional comorbidities may influence the risks posed by specific drugs. In particular, chronic systemic inflammation, a condition associated with many diseases, affects heart function and can exacerbate medications’ cardiotoxic effects. We discuss emerging research implicating the role of inflammation in cardiac electrophysiology, and we offer a perspective on how in silico modeling of inflammation may lead to improved evaluation of the proarrhythmic risk of drugs at their early stage of development.","Campana, Chiara; Dariolli, Rafael; Boutjdir, Mohamed; Sobie, Eric A.",Front Pharmacol,92,16

To identify the drivers of disease emergence, we analyzed infectious disease threat events (IDTEs) detected through epidemic intelligence collected at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) between 2008 and 2013, and compared the observed results with a 2008 ECDC foresight study of projected drivers of future IDTEs in Europe. Among 10 categories of IDTEs, foodborne and waterborne IDTEs were the most common, vaccine‐preventable IDTEs caused the highest number of cases, and airborne IDTEs caused the most deaths. Observed drivers for each IDTE were sorted into three main groups: globalization and environmental drivers contributed to 61% of all IDTEs, public health system drivers contributed to 21%, and social and demographic drivers to 18%. A multiple logistic regression analysis showed that four of the top five drivers for observed IDTEs were in the globalization and environment group. In the observational study, the globalization and environment group was related to all IDTE categories, but only to five of eight categories in the foresight study. Directly targeting these drivers with public health interventions may diminish the chances of IDTE occurrence from the outset.","Semenza, Jan C.; Rocklöv, Joacim; Penttinen, Pasi; Lindgren, Elisabet",Ann N Y Acad Sci,92,16

Limiting the values under consideration to those attributable to the direct effects of infection has the advantage of simplifying the models and the process of decision‐making. However, the consequences of the pandemic extend beyond outcomes directly attributable to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, and include restrictions on educational and work opportunities, access to services, recreational activities, affiliations and relationships with others, freedom of movement (including escaping abusive relationships), and other determinants of human experience. Capability theory gives emphasis to the freedoms that individuals have to express themselves (in doings and beings). Restrictions on freedoms restrict our capabilities. Capability theory has been used to provide a framework for the evaluation and comparison of international development approaches and in the evaluation of public health policy. There is a clustering of disadvantages associated with this pandemic that adds to pre‐existing inequalities. Much of the disadvantage engendered in the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic is left out when public health policy is based on a limited range of metrics. Acknowledging the impact of policy across the range of human freedoms at both a national and international level has the potential to improve policy, facilitate the mitigation of direct and indirect adverse consequences, and improve public confidence and the effectiveness of vaccine deployment strategies.","Millar, Michael R.; Gourtsoyannis, Yannis; Jayakumar, Angelina",Br J Clin Pharmacol,92,30

Our concern is that studies producing ill-performing models may lead to inappropriate clinical decision-making. Thus, our objective is to summarise and characterise performance of prognostic models for COVID-19 on external data. METHODS: We performed a validation of parsimonious prognostic models for patients with COVID-19 from a literature search for published and preprint articles. Ten models meeting inclusion criteria were either (a) externally validated with our data against the model variables and weights or (b) rebuilt using original features if no weights were provided. Nine studies had internally or externally validated models on cohorts of between 18 and 320 inpatients with COVID-19. One model used cross-validation. Our external validation cohort consisted of 4444 patients with COVID-19 hospitalised between 1 March and 27 May 2020. RESULTS: Most models failed validation when applied to our institution’s data. Included studies reported an average validation area under the receiver–operator curve (AUROC) of 0.828. Models applied with reported features averaged an AUROC of 0.66 when validated on our data. Models rebuilt with the same features averaged an AUROC of 0.755 when validated on our data. In both cases, models did not validate against their studies’ reported AUROC values. DISCUSSION: Published and preprint prognostic models for patients infected with COVID-19 performed substantially worse when applied to external data. Further inquiry is required to elucidate mechanisms underlying performance deviations.

The ESSENCE concept began in an internally funded project at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, advanced with funding from the State of Maryland, and broadened in 1999 as a collaboration with the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. Versions of the system have been further developed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in multiple military and civilian programs for the timely detection and tracking of health threats. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe the components and development of a biosurveillance system increasingly coordinating all-hazards health surveillance and infectious disease monitoring among large and small health departments, to list the key features and lessons learned in the growth of this system, and to describe the range of initiatives and accomplishments of local epidemiologists using it. METHODS: The features of ESSENCE include spatial and temporal statistical alerting, custom querying, user-defined alert notifications, geographical mapping, remote data capture, and event communications. To expedite visualization, configurable and interactive modes of data stratification and filtering, graphical and tabular customization, user preference management, and sharing features allow users to query data and view geographic representations, time series and data details pages, and reports. These features allow ESSENCE users to gather and organize the resulting wealth of information into a coherent view of population health status and communicate findings among users. RESULTS: The resulting broad utility, applicability, and adaptability of this system led to the adoption of ESSENCE by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, numerous state and local health departments, and the Department of Defense, both nationally and globally. The open-source version of Suite for Automated Global Electronic bioSurveillance is available for global, resource-limited settings. Resourceful users of the US National Syndromic Surveillance Program ESSENCE have applied it to the surveillance of infectious diseases, severe weather and natural disaster events, mass gatherings, chronic diseases and mental health, and injury and substance abuse. CONCLUSIONS: With emerging high-consequence communicable diseases and other health conditions, the continued user requirement–driven enhancements of ESSENCE demonstrate an adaptable disease surveillance capability focused on the everyday needs of public health. The challenge of a live system for widely distributed users with multiple different data sources and high throughput requirements has driven a novel, evolving architecture design.","Burkom, Howard; Loschen, Wayne; Wojcik, Richard; Holtry, Rekha; Punjabi, Monika; Siwek, Martina; Lewis, Sheri",JMIR Public Health Surveill,92,20

In past years, it has become evident that in addition MCs may eliminate invading pathogens by ejection of web-like structures of DNA strands embedded with proteins known together as extracellular traps (ETs). Upon stimulation of resting MCs with various microorganisms, their products (including superantigens and toxins), or synthetic chemicals, MCs become activated and enter into a multistage process that includes disintegration of the nuclear membrane, release of chromatin into the cytoplasm, adhesion of cytoplasmic granules on the emerging DNA web, and ejection of the complex into the extracellular space. This so-called ETosis is often associated with cell death of the producing MC, and the type of stimulus potentially determines the ratio of surviving vs. killed MCs. Comparison of different microorganisms with specific elimination characteristics such as S pyogenes (eliminated by MCs only through extracellular mechanisms), S aureus (removed by phagocytosis), fungi, and parasites has revealed important aspects of MC extracellular trap (MCET) biology. Molecular studies identified that the formation of MCET depends on NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this review, we summarize the present state-of-the-art on the biological relevance of MCETosis, and its underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. We also provide an overview over the techniques used to study the structure and function of MCETs, including electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy using specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to detect MCET-associated proteins such as tryptase and histones, and cell-impermeant DNA dyes for labeling of extracellular DNA. Comparing the type and biofunction of further MCET decorating proteins with ETs produced by other immune cells may help provide a better insight into MCET biology in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders as well as microbial defense.","Elieh Ali Komi, Daniel; Kuebler, Wolfgang M.",Clin Rev Allergy Immunol,92,3

Daily deaths are modeled as a spike-and-slab regression on lagged cases. Our Bayesian estimation reveals that social distancing and testing have significant effects on the parameters. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in the positive test rate is associated with a 2 percentage point increase in the death rate among reported cases. The model forecasts perform well, even relative to models from epidemiology and statistics.","Ho, Paul; Lubik, Thomas A.; Matthes, Christian",J Econom,92,20

In the present study, we identified 11 potent bioactive compounds from ethanolic leaf extract of Ipomoea obscura (L.) by using GC‐MS analysis. These potential bioactive compounds were considered for molecular docking studies against ACE2 and M(Pro) target proteins to determine the antiviral effects against SARS‐COV. Results exhibits that among 11 compounds from I. obscura (L.), urso‐deoxycholic acid, demeclocycline, tetracycline, chlorotetracycline, and ethyl iso‐allocholate had potential viral inhibitory activity. Hence, the present findings suggested that chemical constitution present in I. obscura (L.) will address inhibition of corona viral replication in host cells.","Poochi, Saravana Prabha; Easwaran, Murugesh; Balasubramanian, Balamuralikrishnan; Anbuselvam, Mohan; Meyyazhagan, Arun; Park, Sungkwon; Bhotla, Haripriya Kuchi; Anbuselvam, Jeeva; Arumugam, Vijaya Anand; Keshavarao, Sasikala; Kanniyappan, Gopalakrishnan Velliyur; Pappusamy, Manikantan; Kaul, Tanushri",Food Front,92,16

The early diagnosis of infected patients is needed to discontinue this outbreak. The diagnosis of coronavirus infection from radiography images is the fastest method. In this paper, two different ensemble deep transfer learning models have been designed for COVID-19 diagnosis utilizing the chest X-rays. Both models have utilized pre-trained models for better performance. They are able to differentiate COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia. Both models have been developed to improve the generalization capability of the classifier for binary and multi-class problems. The proposed models have been tested on two well-known datasets. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms the existing techniques in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.","Gianchandani, Neha; Jaiswal, Aayush; Singh, Dilbag; Kumar, Vijay; Kaur, Manjit",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,92,28

METHODS: Based on a literature review and expert opinion, a Delphi process was used to define the essential topics including protection of patients and staff. RESULTS: Key recommendations include: (1) prepare infection control and occupational health policies for clinical risks relating to potential disease transmission; (2) decrease clinical risks and provide adequate facilities through advanced planning to maximise capacity by increasing essential equipment, drugs, supplies and encouraging staff availability; (3) create robust systems to maintain staff confidence and safety by minimising non-clinical risks and maintaining or escalating essential services; (4) prepare formal reassurance plans for legal protection; (5) provide assistance to staff working outside their normal domains. CONCLUSIONS: Judicious planning and adoption of protocols for protection of patients and staff are necessary to optimise outcomes during a pandemic.","Taylor, Bruce L.; Montgomery, Hugh E.; Rhodes, Andrew; Sprung, Charles L.",Intensive Care Med,92,13
