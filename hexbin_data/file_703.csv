STUDY DESIGN: OPTIMUM-BP was an unmasked randomised controlled clinical trial. 154 women with pregnancy hypertension from four maternity units in England were recruited and randomised to SMBP or usual care. This secondary analysis included 91 women randomised to self-monitoring who provided BP readings. Trial instructions were for daily SMBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was calculated as proportion of days on which SMBP readings were taken. Proportion of weeks in which at least 4 and at least 2 SMBP readings were taken was also calculated. Mean differences between clinic and SMBP measurements were calculated. RESULTS: Self-monitored BP data were available for 49 women with chronic hypertension and 42 women with gestational hypertension. Median percentage of days with SMBP readings was 77% (IQR 51, 89) in the chronic hypertension group and 85% (IQR 52, 95) in the gestational hypertension group. Adherence did not vary by different socio-demographic groups. Mean difference (95% CI) between clinic and SMBP for systolic BP was 0.99 mmHg (−1.44, 3.41; chronic hypertension) and 3.76 mmHg (0.75, 6.78; gestational hypertension) and for diastolic BP was 3.03 mmHg (0.93, 5.12; chronic hypertension) and 3.27 mmHg (0.56, 5.98; gestational hypertension). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to self-monitoring was good and differences between SMBP and clinic readings were small. These findings offer reassurance about the use of self-monitoring at a time when it is being increasingly implemented in maternity settings.","Bowen, Liza; Pealing, Louise; Tucker, Katherine; McManus, Richard J.; Chappell, Lucy C.",Pregnancy Hypertens,703,1

Different factors, whether non‐cognitive (e.g., traumatic dental events) or cognitive (e.g., the patient's subjective perceptions), may cause dental anxiety. However, previous studies have assessed these factors as independent predictors of dental anxiety, without providing any exploration of potential mediational pathways. The current study assessed the role of certain cognitive dimensions (i.e., the dentist's perceived professionalism and communicational attitudes, and the patient's perceived lack of control) as mediators between traumatic dental events and dental anxiety. The sample comprised 253 patients who had accessed a public university hospital dental surgery. The mediation analysis used a structural equation modeling. Traumatic dental events were positively associated with dental anxiety but, among the cognitive factors, only lack of control was. Furthermore, lack of control mediated the relationship between traumatic dental events and dental anxiety, although this mediation was only partial. This study sheds light on the mechanisms through which non‐cognitive and cognitive factors may affect dental anxiety. The clinical implications for dental practice, in terms of improving the psychological well‐being of patients, are discussed.","Scandurra, Cristiano; Gasparro, Roberta; Dolce, Pasquale; Bochicchio, Vincenzo; Muzii, Benedetta; Sammartino, Gilberto; Marenzi, Gaetano; Maldonato, Nelson Mauro",Eur J Oral Sci,703,5

In this study, we report the oncologic safety results of EABS compared with CBS. METHODS Patients underwent EABS for breast cancer during the period June 2010 to March 2020 were collected from the EABS database from single institute, and another cohort of patients, who received CBS, were identified to determine the effectiveness and oncologic safety of EABS. A case-control study was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM) to prevent bias from cases selection. RESULTS A total of 3426 patients were enrolled in the current study, including 405 patients receiving EABS and 3021 underwent CBS. Before PSM, patients selected for EABS tend to be smaller in tumor size, node negative, early stage, low histologic grade, and HER-2 negative. After PSM, 343 patients underwent EABS were compared with another 343 patients received CBS. The margin involved rate in EABS group is 2.6%, and 5.6% in CBS group (p = 0.054) after PSM. In breast conserving cases, the margin involved rates were 2% in EABS group, and 7.2% in CBS group (p = 0.04). In Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis, there was no difference in local regional recurrence (p = 0.89), distant metastasis (p = 0.08), and overall survival (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION The preliminary oncologic safety analysis from current study showed EABS is a safe procedure and results in low margin involved rate, and no increase of locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis or mortality compared with CBS.","Lai, Hung-Wen; Chen, Shou-Tung; Liao, Chiung-Ying; Mok, Chi Wei; Lin, Ying-Jen; Chen, Dar-Ren; Kuo, Shou-Jen",Annals of surgical oncology,703,19

Three hundred and eighty-five Hong Kong Chinese, aged 18-86 years, rated the extent that they experienced 'shock', 'sadness', 'anger' and 'fear' in the face of SARS. They also completed selected items from Brief COPE (Carver, 1997). The results showed that older adults consistently experienced less anger than did their younger counterparts. Younger adults used more emotion-focused coping than did middle-aged and older adults at the peak of SARS; yet they exhibited the lowest increase in this form of coping throughout the outbreak, such that the age differences had reversed by the end of the outbreak. Findings of this study suggest that older adults may be better at emotional regulation than are their younger counterparts, they react to a crisis with less anger and are better able to adapt their coping strategies to the changing environment.","Yeung, Dannii Yuen-Lan; Fung, Helene H",Aging & mental health,703,11

The NOTES provide possibility of operation through the natural orifice and decreases the intentional puncture of the systemic organ and subsequent complications. Totally transanal laparo-endoscopic single-site proctoColectomy-Ileoanal J-Pouch (TLPC-J) is a novel method in minimally invasive surgery for total colectomy. The main goal of this study is to perform this new method on an animal model, to assess probable complication and to resolve probable issues by using patients that are candidate for total colectomy. METHOD Five dogs were prepared in lithotomy position. The TLPC-I procedure consists of endorectal technique with full thickness rectal dissection starting 1 cm orally from the dentate line above the peritoneal reflection and the proximal bowel was replaced into the abdominal cavity. Afterwards, the TriPort system was inserted in the anal canal and mesentrial resection of the total colon, mobilization of a distal ileal segment and intracorporeal suture of an ileal J-loop was accomplished by this system. An incision in the J-loop was conducted transanally. The J-pouch was created with an Endo-GIA® and sutured to the rectal wall. RESULTS All animals survived and passed stool with clear post operation situation. There was no infection in site of anastomosis. CONCLUSION The TLPC-I provides the possibility of surgery without abdominal wall incision and decreases post operation complication such as pain, abdominal wound infection and wound dehiscence. This technique increases the quality of life and surgeons can discharge the patients early.","Vahdad, Mohammad Reza; Rahmanian, Ehsan; Moslemi, Sam; Najafi, Sultan Mohsen; Foroutan, Hamid Reza",Iranian journal of medical sciences,703,1

Aim of this study was to determine whether motor unit synchronization induced by vibration has an effect on isometric muscle strength. METHODS Thirty-six healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups: the vibration and the control (sham vibration) groups. Two sets of test measurements and vibration resistance training between the two sets were applied to the right wrist flexors. The maximal voluntary isometric contraction force, and flexor carpi radialis EMG activity were recorded in the first (without vibratory stimulation) and the second (with vibratory stimulation) set. RESULTS There was no difference in the normalized peak force between the first and the second set in the vibration group (p=0.554). Motor units fired with maximal voluntary isometric contraction synchronized at the vibration frequency (25 Hz) during vibration in all participants of the vibration group. CONCLUSION The present study indicates that vibration-induced motor unit synchronization does not have a significant effect on the maximal voluntary isometric contraction force.​.","Kara, Seher; Karacan, Ilhan; Cidem, Muharrem; Gokmen, Emel Saglam; Karamehmetoğlu, Safak S",Journal of musculoskeletal & neuronal interactions,703,16

At 5 days following challenge with IBV, we found a good correlation among clinical signs, ciliostasis in the trachea, challenge virus detection, and microscopic lesions in the trachea, with all four criteria being negative in fully protected birds and positive in fully susceptible birds. In partially protected birds we observed clinical signs and detected challenge virus; however, the ciliated epithelium was intact. In a second experiment, we challenged fully protected, partially protected, and fully susceptible birds with IBV, and then at 5 days postchallenge we gave the birds an opportunistic bacterium intranasally. Twenty Bordetella avium colonies were recovered from one of five fully protected birds, and only five colonies were isolated from two of five partially protected birds without ciliostasis, whereas in birds with ciliostasis, numerous colonies were isolated. Obviously, decreasing IBV infection and replication in the upper respiratory tract will decrease transmission and mutations, leading to variant viruses, and herein we demonstrate that protection of the cilia will decrease secondary bacterial infections, which have been shown to lead to condemnations and increased mortality. Thus, it appears that examining both criteria would be important when evaluating IBV vaccine efficacy.","Jackwood, Mark W; Jordan, Brian J; Roh, Ha-Jung; Hilt, Deborah A; Williams, Susan M",Avian diseases,703,1

During stent placement, upper tract access confirmed using ultrasound with or without retrograde injection of ultrasound contrast prior to double-J stent insertion. A post-procedural abdominal x-ray was obtained for stent position confirmation. RESULTS: Eight patients (4 men, 4 women) were offered bedside ultrasound-guided ureteral stent placement, and all 8 consented to proceed. Stents were successfully placed in 7 of 8 patients. One patient had an impacted ureterovesical junction stone and stricture requiring ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy in the operating room. All patients tolerated procedures without immediate complications. CONCLUSION: Live renal ultrasonography can facilitate a high success rate for bedside ureteral stent placement outside the operating room. This approach is an attractive alternative to fluoroscopy-guided stent placement in the operating room and is of particular value in the COVID-19 era when judicious use of these resources is salient.","Yang, Heiko; Chappidi, Meera; Overland, Maya; Ahn, Justin; Bayne, David; Chi, Thomas",J. endourol,703,16

Little is known about the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients undergoing surgery. PRESENTATION OF CASE: Here we report the first confirmed case of early postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient recovering after Hartmann's procedure for acute diverticulitis. After an otherwise unevenful postoperative course, on post-operative day 8, the patient suddenly presented hyperpyrexia and cough, rapidly evolving to respiratory failure and death 36 h after symptoms onset. CT-scan identified bilateral, diffuse, interstitial pneumonitis and oropharyngeal swab test confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2. A previous contact with the partner, developing the same symptoms, remained unrecognized until ICU admission. DISCUSSION: During a pandemic outbreak, the early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection of an inside patient initially considered to be infection-free has a pivotal importance not only for the prompt patient's management, but also to avoid infection spreading to other patients and hospital personnel.In the reported case, a more precise information to the patient regarding the imperative necessity to inform the medical personnel of any person of his entourage presenting, at any time, any tell-tale sign, symptom or examination which may be attributed to COVID-19, may have had allowed to anticipate patient's isolation and examinations and procedures aimed at identifying such an infection. CONCLUSION: Persistent hyperleucocytosis and increased CRP serum level in spite of uneventful postoperative course were the only, aspecific markers of an ongoing SARS-CoV-2 infection before symptoms' onset, and should be considered in future clinical practice in order to adopt the prompt and appropriate patient management and limit COVID-19 contagion in surgical units.","Montali, Filippo; Palmieri, Gerardo; Casali, Lorenzo; Pagliai, Lorenzo; Costi, Renato",Int J Surg Case Rep,703,5

Additionally, the transition model eliminates several limitations of the deterministic continuous time epidemiological models which are pointed out in the paper.

It is officially named the new corona virus (2019-nCov) by the World Health Organization on 12 January 2020. WHO officially named it COVID-19 on 11 February. COVID-19 is a highly transmitted and pathogenic viral infection that has been developed and spread across the world in Wuhan, China, caused by extreme acute respiratory syndrome corona-virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Genomic analysis showed that bats may also be a primary reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetically associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome-like viruses (SARS). However, the rapid human to human transition has been generally reported. Intermediate source of origin and human transition is unknown. Clinically approved COVID-19 antiviral medication or vaccine is not available. In clinical trials, however, few broad-based COVID-19 antiviral medicinal drugs were tested, resulting in clinical recovery. This analysis summarizes the pathogenicity of COVID-19 and aims to raise awareness of COVID-19 among the population and to continually boost the detection, monitoring, diagnosis and care level. Over 50 COVID-19 scientific publications were included in this systematic analysis. We found that fever (87.0%), cough (65.9%) and malaise/tiredness (35%) were the most common symptoms of COvida-19. However, COVID-19 clinical signs and symptoms were not necessarily obvious. The transmission of COVID-19 in comparison to SARS was more specific. The rate of death of COVID-19 was 2,7% and the pathological characteristics of COVID-19 are very similar to ARDS. There are also discussions on the latest epidemiological changes, clinical manifestations, auxiliary examination and COVID-19 pathological characteristics.","Parthasarathy, P; Vivekanandan, S",J Infect Public Health,703,16

Famotidine is a histamine-2 (H2) receptor antagonist which blocks the H2 receptors in the parietal cells, decreasing gastric acid secretion. Our review aims to study all the available scientific evidence on famotidine research outcomes systematically to introspect its clinical efficacy and probable mechanisms and clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: An electronic search of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar was performed using MeSH terms ""SARS CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"" AND""FAMOTIDINE"". Relevant informationwas extracted from studies reporting the efficacy of famotidine in COVID-19. RESULTS: We found a total of 32 studies, out of which only 14 were relevant and were included in our review.Molecular computational studies showed that famotidine selectively acts on viral replication proteases papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro). Additionally, it acts via inverse-agonism on the H2 receptors present in neutrophils and eosinophils which leads to inhibition of cytokine release. Clinical study findings have pointed toward significant improvements in COVID-19 patient-reported symptoms in non-hospitalized patients and reduction in intubation or death in critically ill patients associated with the usage of famotidine. However,in one of the studies,famotidine has failed to show any significant benefit in reducing mortality due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Famotidine has the potential to answer the ongoing global challenge owing to its selective action on viral replication. Additionally, clinical findings in COVID-19 patients support its efficacy to reduce clinical symptoms of COVID-19.We suggest that further optimally powered randomized clinical trials should be carried out to come up with definitive conclusions.","Chenchula, Santenna; Ray, Avik; Sadasivam, Balakrishnan","Drug res.

As a result, several antithrombotic modalities have been implicated in the treatment of this disease. This study aimed to identify if therapeutic anticoagulation or concurrent use of antiplatelet and anticoagulants was associated with an improved outcome in this patient population. MethodsA retrospective observational cohort study of adult patients admitted to a single university hospital for COVID-19 infection was performed. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcomes were each of the components of the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or the need for mechanical ventilation. Results242 patients were included in the study and divided into 4 subgroups: therapeutic anticoagulation (TAC), prophylactic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (PACAP), therapeutic anticoagulation + antiplatelet (TACAP), and prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) which was the reference for comparison. Multivariable cox regression analysis and propensity matching were done and showed when compared to PAC, TACAP and TAC were associated with less in-hospital all cause mortality with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.113 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.028-0.449) and 0.126 (95% CI, 0.028-0.528) respectively. The number needed to treat (NNT) in both subgroups was 11. Furthermore, PACAP was associated with a reduced risk of invasive mechanical ventilation with an aHR of 0.07 (95% CI, 0.014-0.351). However, the was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of major or minor bleeds, ICU admission, or the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality, ICU admission or the need for mechanical ventilation. ConclusionThe use of combined anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents or therapeutic anticoagulation alone in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was associated with a better outcome in comparison to prophylactic anticoagulation alone without an increase in the risk of major and minor bleeds. Sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulants agents or using therapeutic anticoagulation in the management of patients with COVID-19 infection. What is already known about this subject ?Covid-19 infection is associated with several complex coagulation disorders resulting in thrombotic, microthrombotic and thromboembolic events. Currently, prophylactic dose anticoagulation is considered the standard of care antithrombotic regimen in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, high-quality data about the subject is unavailable. What does this study add?This is the first adequately sized study in the literature to dwell on the antithrombotic strategy consisting of combination anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 induced hypercoagulable state. Furthermore, it also challenges the currently recommended prophylactic dosing of anticoagulation used in the treatment of those patients. How might this impact on clinical practice?Our data suggests for the first time that concurrent use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy is associated with a superior clinical outcome as compared to prophylactic anticoagulation used alone. Furthermore, it solidifies the emerging evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation is linked to better clinical results than prophylactic anticoagulation.","Matli, Kamal; Chamoun, Nibal; Fares, Aya; Zibara, Victor; Al-Osta, Soad; Nasrallah, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Mokhbat, Jacques; Ghanem, Georges",,703,16

METHODS AND RESULTS: Histopathologic findings in post-mortem lung tissue from eight patients who died from COVID-19 pneumonia were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were performed to detect virus. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was seen in all cases with a spectrum of acute phase and/or organising phase. IHC with monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleoprotein and spike protein detected virus in areas of acute but not organising DAD, with intracellular viral antigen and RNA expression seen predominantly in patients with duration of illness less than 10 days. Major vascular findings included thrombi in medium- and large-calibre vessels, platelet microthrombi detected by CD61 IHC and fibrin microthrombi. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by NGS early in the disease course and expression of viral antigen by IHC exclusively in the acute, but not in the organising phase of DAD, suggests that the virus may play a major role in initiating the acute lung injury of DAD, but when DAD progresses to the organising phase the virus may have been cleared from the lung by the patient's immune response. These findings suggest the possibility of a major change during the disease course of COVID-19 pneumonia that may have therapeutic implications. Frequent thrombi and microthrombi may also present potential targets for therapeutic intervention.","Sauter, Jennifer L; Baine, Marina K; Butnor, Kelly J; Buonocore, Darren J; Chang, Jason C; Jungbluth, Achim A; Szabolcs, Matthias J; Morjaria, Sejal; Mount, Sharon L; Rekhtman, Natasha; Selbs, Elena; Sheng, Zong-Mei; Xiao, Yongli; Kleiner, David E; Pittaluga, Stefania; Taubenberger, Jeffery K; Rapkiewicz, Amy V; Travis, William D",Histopathology,703,16

It was first observed in children, however few cases of adults with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-A) were published in the US and the UK. We present two cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in adults which occurred in Germany. HISTORY: #1: A 27-year-old male presented with fever (40â°C), right lower abdominal pain, diarrhea and peritonism. #2: A 21-year-old female presented with fever (40â°C) occipital headaches, neck stiffness, and somnolence. FINDINGS: #1: Increased inflammation parameters and elevated Nt-proBNP were found. Abdominal CT showed signs of ileitis terminalis and colitis. Crohn's disease was excluded endoscopically. Echocardiography showed minor pericardial effusion. A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. #2: Increased inflammation parameters and an increased Nt-proBNP were found. Cranial CT showed pathology. Meningitis was excluded via lumbar puncture. Thoracic CT and abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of infection. Echocardiography showed reduced LVEF (50â%). A SARS-CoV-2 antibody test was positive. THERAPY AND COURSE: #1: Antibiotic therapy as well as oral prednisolone didn't improve the clinical course. High-dose vasopressor therapy was necessary. The clinical condition improved only after adding hydrocortisone therapy. #2 Despite antibiotic therapy the clinical condition deteriorated. Because of insufficient effect of hydrocortisone, high-dose immunoglobulins were administered. Consequently, symptoms improved and LVEF normalized. CONCLUSIONS: Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome presents as a chameleon of symptoms. In the context of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, rising numbers of cases in adults can be expected. In patients with fever, increased inflammation parameters and lack of other explanations, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome must be considered. Due to the potential severity of clinical courses and possible cardiac involvement, a therapy with hydrocortisone, ASS and immunoglobulins should be considered early.","Rieper, Karl; Sturm, Andreas",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,703,20

Anecdotal reports suggest that guidelines may disproportionately allocate resources away from patients with cancer, but no comprehensive evaluation has been performed. Objective: To examine the implications of US state CSC guidelines for patients with cancer, including allocation methods, cancer-related categorical exclusions and deprioritizations, and provisions for blood products and palliative care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional population-based analysis examined state-endorsed CSC guidelines published before May 20, 2020, that included health care resource allocation recommendations. Main Outcomes and Measures: Guideline publication before or within 120 days after the first documented US case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), inclusion of cancer-related categorical exclusions and/or deprioritizations, provisions for blood products and/or palliative care, and associations between these outcomes and state-based cancer demographics. Results: Thirty-one states had health care resource allocation guidelines that met inclusion criteria, of which 17 had been published or updated since the first US case of COVID-19. States whose available hospital bed capacity was predicted to exceed 100% at 6 months (&#967;2 = 3.82; P = .05) or that had a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC; &#967;2 = 6.21; P = .01) were more likely to have publicly available guidelines. The most frequent primary methods of prioritization were the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (27 states [87%]) and deprioritizing persons with worse long-term prognoses (22 states [71%]). Seventeen states' (55%) allocation methods included cancer-related deprioritizations, and 8 states (26%) included cancer-related categorical exclusions. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with lower likelihood of cancer-related categorical exclusions (multivariable odds ratio, 0.06 [95% CI, 0.004-0.87]). Guidelines with disability rights statements were associated with specific provisions to allocate blood products (multivariable odds ratio, 7.44 [95% CI, 1.28-43.24). Both the presence of an in-state CCC and having an oncologist and/or palliative care specialist on the state CSC task force were associated with the inclusion of palliative care provisions. Conclusions and Relevance: Among states with CSC guidelines, most deprioritized some patients with cancer during resource allocation, and one-fourth categorically excluded them. The presence of an in-state CCC was associated with guideline availability, palliative care provisions, and lower odds of cancer-related exclusions. These data suggest that equitable state-level CSC considerations for patients with cancer benefit from the input of oncology stakeholders.","Hantel, Andrew; Marron, Jonathan M; Casey, Michael; Kurtz, Sharyn; Magnavita, Emily; Abel, Gregory A",JAMA oncol.

The elements of PC are applicable in the epidemic preparation, case finding and management, follow-up and post-epidemic phases of responding to this pandemic. This also presents opportunities and lessons for strengthening PHC as well as for reflections on missed opportunities.

Objective: To explore the practices of management of spinal induced hypotension with respect to fluid and vasopressor administration among anesthesiologists from a developing country. Methods: After approval from institutional ethics committee, an online questionnaire was sent to anesthesiologists registered with Pakistan Society of Anesthesiologists between July and August 2018 to determine management strategies for prevention and treatment of spinal-induced hypotension. Results: The response rate was 36% (156/433), majority from academic institution (62.8%) with equal representation from attending and trainee anesthesiologist. For prophylaxis 39.1% respondents did not use vasopressors, 32.7% used fluid preloading with crystalloids (54.7%) as fluid of choice followed by combination of co-loading and vasopressor(22.4%). Phenylephrine was the vasopressor of choice for both prophylaxis (33.1%) and treatment (57%). Attending anesthesiologist used a combination of fluid co-loading and vasopressors for prophylaxis as compared to trainee anesthesiologists (37.2% vs. 17.9%; P=0.035) and selected vasopressors according to patient's heart rate (33.3% vs. 19.5%; p=0.05). Prophylactic phenylephrine was used more by respondents from the academic institution (p=0.023). Fluid co-loading was used more by respondents with <30 % compared to those with > 30% of clinical responsibility to obstetric anesthesia (P<0.05). Conclusion: Phenylephrine as the vasopressor of choice indicates growing awareness of management strategies among anesthesiologists from developing countries but there is a need to increase its use for prophylaxis. Some variation in practice according to the level of anesthesiologist, practice type and responsibilities to obstetric anesthesia are evident.","Ismail, Samina; Sohaib, Muhammad; Farrukh, Fatima",Afr Health Sci,703,24

Branched structures are ubiquitous in both the physical and the biological realms. Fractility has therefore been termed nature's design. The fractal properties of the bronchial (airway) system, the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein of the human lung generates large respiratory surface area that is crammed in the lung. Also, it permits the inhaled air to intimately approximate the pulmonary capillary blood across a very thin blood-gas barrier through which gas exchange to occur by diffusion. Here, the bronchial (airway) and vascular systems were simultaneously cast with latex rubber. After corrosion, the bronchial and vascular system casts were physically separated and cleared to expose the branches. The morphogenetic (Weibel's) ordering method was used to categorize the branches on which the diameters and the lengths, as well as the angles of bifurcation, were measured. The fractal dimensions (DF) were determined by plotting the total branch measurements against the mean branch diameters on double logarithmic coordinates (axes). The diameter-determined DF values were 2.714 for the bronchial system, 2.882 for the pulmonary artery and 2.334 for the pulmonary vein while the respective values from lengths were 3.098, 3.916 and 4.041. The diameters yielded DF values that were consistent with the properties of fractal structures (i.e. self-similarity and space-filling). The data obtained here compellingly suggest that the design of the bronchial system, the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein of the human lung functionally comply with the Hess-Murray law or 'the principle of minimum work'.","Essay, Montana; Maina, John N",Open Biol,703,24

METHODS: CTPAs from outpatients presenting with chest pain to Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust 1st March to 31 May 2020 (n = 146) and 2019 (n = 85) were compared. Regions of focal ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and/or atelectasis (parenchymal changes) were determined, and all scans were scored using British Society for Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) criteria for COVID-19, and the 2020 cohort was offered SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and clinical data were similar between groups with absence of fever, normal lymphocytes and marginally elevated CRP and D-Dimer values.

According to observational studies, abnormal liver and kidney functions and blood cell traits were associated with severe COVID-19, yet the causal risk factors for COVID-19 severity and the underlying mechanism remained elusive. We performed Mendelian randomization analyses to assess the potential causal role of eight liver function biomarkers, one kidney function biomarker, and 14 hematological traits on COVID-19 severity using genetic association summary statistics from Europeans. Our findings showed that albumin, direct bilirubin, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin are casually associated with the risk of severe COVID-19. Notably, lymphocyte count and mean corpuscular hemoglobin had an independent effect on severe COVID-19 risk. These causal evidences provide insights into directions for the risk stratification of individuals with abnormal liver function or blood cell indices and motivate more studies to unveil the roles of these abnormalities in COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Wang, K.; Qu, M.; Ding, L.; Shi, X.; Wang, C.; Cheng, S.; Hao, X.",Frontiers in Genetics,703,30

DESIGN: Prospective multicentre cohort study. SUBJECTS: In total, 304 patients with first-ever stroke (male sex 59%, mean age 68.7 years) participated from Norway (n = 170) and Denmark (n = 134). METHODS: The Quality of Life after Brain Injury-Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS) was administered twice to measure change in satisfaction with function and wellbeing. RESULTS: QOLIBRI-OS scores showed a small statistically significant difference in favour of Norway at 12 months post-stroke (p = 0.02; Cohen's d = 0.26). Using a calculated minimal clinically important difference score of 12, 20% reported worse, 54% unchanged and 26% better QOLIBRI-OS scores between 3 and 12 months. Age below 65 years predicted a negative change (odds ratio (OR) 0.4, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In this population with mild and moderate stroke, QOLIBRI-OS scores were slightly higher in the Norwegian region.

Transmission parameters between compartments are typically estimated through stochastic parameterization processes that depends on detailed statistics of transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wise expensive to collect. OBJECTIVE: We aim to apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the US coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and projecting its further development. METHODS: We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model's transmission parameters. We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. Epidemics are considered suppressed when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than 1. RESULTS: The deep learning-enhanced compartmental model predicts that R0 will fall to <1 around August 17-19, 2020, at which point the epidemic will effectively start to die out, and that the US ""infected"" population will peak around August 16-18, 2020, at 3,228,574 to 3,308,911 individual cases. The model also predicted that the number of accumulative confirmed cases will cross the 5 million mark around August 7, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters. These models' effectiveness depends upon detailed statistics on transmission characteristics. As an alternative, deep learning techniques are effective in estimating these stochastic parameters with greatly reduced dependency on data particularity.","Deng, Qi",J Med Internet Res,703,16

To reveal the hepatic injury related to this disease and its clinical significance, we conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study that included 5,771 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Hubei Province. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk. Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death. Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). AST elevated first, followed by ALT, in severe patients. ALP modestly increased during hospitalization and largely remained in the normal range. The fluctuation in TBIL levels was mild in the non-severe and the severe groups. AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared with the other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization. Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender. CONCLUSION: The dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID-19-associated liver injury. Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.","Lei, Fang; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhou, Feng; Qin, Juan-Juan; Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Lihua; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Cai, Jingjing; Lin, Lijin; Ouyang, Shan; Wang, Xiaoming; Yang, Chengzhang; Cheng, Xu; Liu, Weifang; Li, Haomiao; Xie, Jing; Wu, Bin; Luo, Huiming; Xiao, Fei; Chen, Jing; Tao, Liang; Cheng, Gang; She, Zhi-Gang; Zhou, Jianghua; Wang, Haitao; Lin, Jun; Luo, Pengcheng; Fu, Shouzhi; Zhou, Jihui; Ye, Ping; Xiao, Bing; Mao, Weiming; Liu, Liming; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Ling; Chen, Guohua; Li, Hongliang; Huang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Yuan, Yufeng",Hepatology,703,20

Purpose: to assess the level of compliance of midwives in Indonesia with personal protective equipment (PPE) usage and hand washing. Methods: in June 2020 an online cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1520 midwives in Indonesia during the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using statistical package for the social sciences version 26. Association between demographic variables and compliance with standard precautions was measured using chi-square test. Results: approximately 74% of midwives used PPE and masks when outside while more than 40% of them did not always wash their hands after they touch an object outside home. A significant association was found between level of education (p =.001) region (p =.000) and mask usage. However, association between ethnicity and mask usage;region and handwashing were not significant. Conclusion: majority of the midwives in Indonesia complied with PPE usage but majority did not adhere to hand washing.

With limited access to vaccine or strong antiviral treatment for the novel coronavirus, actions in terms of prevention and containment of the virus transmission rely mostly on social distancing among susceptible and high-risk populations. Aside from the direct challenges posed by the novel coronavirus pandemic, there are serious and growing secondary consequences caused by the physical distancing and isolation guidelines, among vulnerable populations. Moreover, the healthcare system's resources and capacity have been focused on addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, causing less urgent care, such as physical neurorehabilitation and assessment, to be paused, canceled, or delayed. Overall, this has left elderly adults, in particular those with neuromusculoskeletal (NMSK) conditions, without the required service support. However, in many cases, such as stroke, the available time window of recovery through rehabilitation is limited since neural plasticity decays quickly with time. Given that future waves of the outbreak are expected in the coming months worldwide, it is important to discuss the possibility of using available technologies to address this issue, as societies have a duty to protect the most vulnerable populations. In this perspective review article, we argue that intelligent robotics and wearable technologies can help with remote delivery of assessment, assistance, and rehabilitation services while physical distancing and isolation measures are in place to curtail the spread of the virus. By supporting patients and medical professionals during this pandemic, robots, and smart digital mechatronic systems can reduce the non-COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems. Digital health and cloud telehealth solutions that can complement remote delivery of assessment and physical rehabilitation services will be the subject of discussion in this article due to their potential in enabling more effective and safer NMSDK rehabilitation, assistance, and assessment service delivery.

OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the Covid-19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of health care has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of spinal tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons, and radiation oncologists was formed to analyze the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during Covid-19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture, and/or neurological symptoms. Primary spine tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like en bloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like chordoma or chondrosarcomas, if intensive care unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteogenic sarcoma must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. In immunocompromised patients, (treated by chemotherapy), it is necessary to avoid contact with affected or exposed people. CONCLUSION: Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy.

We aimed to explore the role of socioeconomic status and religion, sexual double standards, erotophobia-erotophilia, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and relationship satisfaction to explain sexual function and satisfaction in Ecuador. METHOD: 599 participants (431 women and 159 men) completed an online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Female sexual function was predicted by sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and sexual double standards, while the male sexual function was predicted solely by sexual satisfaction. Additionally, female sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function, relationship satisfaction, and sexual dysfunctional beliefs, while male sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function, Brief Sexual Opinion Survey, Sexual Double Standards Scale, Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, New Sexual Satisfaction Scale, and Couple Satisfaction Index. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel information on the determinants of sexual function and satisfaction within a culture in which conservative religious beliefs still prevail. Results should be interpreted with caution given the unequal distribution of men and women, social desirability and volunteer biases, and the specific COVID-19 pandemic context during which the survey took place. Markers of sexual conservatism were inversely related to sexual function and satisfaction, mainly in women, and may, therefore, be important targets of treatment. Female sexuality seemed more context-dependent than male sexuality, although enhancing the general climate of the relationship may benefit feeling sexually satisfied in both men and women.

Underlying cardiovascular disease predisposes to greater disease susceptibility and more complications including mortality. Such data is unverified in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD). The aim of the study is to report the Tehran experience with respect to preventative self-care measures, disease exposure, susceptibility and outcomes after COVD-19 infection in ACHD patients. METHODS: A telephone-based survey was conducted in ACHD patients, focusing on new onset symptoms that might indicate COVID-19 infection, prevention measures, confirmed infection rates, and outcomes. RESULTS: 309 ACHD patients, mean age 29.13 years (14-72 years, SD=10.64), 170 (55%) women, were assessed. The majority (86.7%) had moderate or complex ACHD. Two-thirds (67.3%) of patients practiced high level preventative self-care measures. After community exposure, 33.3% developed COVID-19, and after household exposure 43.7% developed COVID-19. There was only 1 mortality in a post-operative patient. Thirty-seven patients (12%) reported new symptoms including cough (10%), fatigue (8%), fever (7%) and new dyspnea (6.5%). Among 18 (6%) with confirmed COVID-19 there was only 1 mortality in a postoperative patient.

CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risk associated with COVID-19 infection in ACHD patients with moderate or severe disease appears to be relatively low, similar to the general population. Such risk appears to act through conventional risk factors, and in this cohort, we demonstrated age as a significant risk factor in addition to exposure to the development of COVID-19 infection. Preventative self-care measures are a potentially significant and impactful intervention target for intervention and for improving outcomes.Self-care measures, disease exposure and susceptibility, and symptoms related to COVID-19 were assessed in a survey of 309 ACHD patients in Tehran.

There is an urgent need for strategies to improve opioid use disorder treatment quality (e.g., 6-month retention). Substance use disorder treatment programs are challenged by limited resources and a workforce that does not have the requisite experience or education in quality improvement methods. The purpose of this study is to test a multicomponent clinic-level intervention designed to aid substance use disorder treatment clinics in implementing quality improvement processes to improve high-priority indicators of treatment quality for opioid use disorder. METHODS: A stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial with 30 outpatient treatment clinics serving approximately 2000 clients with opioid use disorder each year will test whether a clinic-level measurement-driven, quality improvement intervention, called Coaching for Addiction Recovery Enhancement (CARE), improves (a) treatment process quality measures (use of medications for opioid use disorder, in-treatment symptom and therapeutic progress, treatment retention) and (b) recovery outcomes (substance use, health, and healthcare utilization). The CARE intervention will have the following components: (1) staff clinical training and tools, (2) quality improvement and change management training, (3) external facilitation to support implementation and sustainability of quality improvement processes, and (4) an electronic client-reported treatment progress tool to support data-driven decision making and clinic-level quality measurement. The study will utilize multiple sources of data to test study aims, including state administrative data, client-reported survey and treatment progress data, and staff interview and survey data. DISCUSSION: This study will provide the field with a strong test of a multicomponent intervention to improve providers' capacity to make systematic changes tied to quality metrics. The study will also result in training and materials that can be shared widely to increase quality improvement implementation and enhance clinical practice in the substance use disorder treatment system.

However, the correlations of TPPP3 between prognosis and immune infiltrates in different tumors are still unclear. The analysis of TPPP3 expression was performed via Oncomine and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) website. We also used GEPIA to assess the impact of TPPPT3 on clinical outcomes. The related pathways involved in TPPP3 were analyzed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and the correlation between TPPP3 and immune infiltration was studied by Tumor Immune Estimation Resource2.0 (TIMER 2.0). The TPPP3 expression was significantly reduced in head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) compared to adjacent tissues. In addition, the low expression of TPPP3 in HNSC was significantly associated with prognosis. The pathways closely related to the low expression of TPPP3 are ""Antigen Processing and Presentation,"" ""Primary Immunodeficiency,"" and so on. The TPPP3 expression was negatively correlated with the level of CD8+ T cell, B cell, and myeloid dendritic cell infiltration in HNSC. The TPPP3 expression is closely related to multiple immunomarkers in CD8+ T cell and Myeloid dendritic cells. These data indicate that TPPP3 is associated with multiple cancers and involves multiple immune-related pathways, and TPPP3 is associated with immune infiltration levels. Besides, the TPPP3 expression may help regulate tumor-associated CD8 + T cells, DC cells in HNSC. We conclude TPPP3 can be considered as a biomarker for predicting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma prognosis and immune infiltration.","Yang, Zheng; Li, Xiaohong; Li, Jingyu; Su, Qisheng; Qiu, Yuling; Zhang, Zunni; Zhang, Liqian; Mo, Wuning",Biomed Res Int,703,21

Comprehensive evaluation of the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among HCWs in a large healthcare system could help to identify the impact of epidemiological factors and the presence of symptoms on the immune response to the infection over time. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies among HCWs, identify associated epidemiological factors and study antibody kinetics. METHODS: A longitudinal evaluation of the seroprevalence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies was undertaken in approximately 30,000 HCWs in the largest healthcare system in Connecticut, USA. FINDINGS: At baseline, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among 6863 HCWs was 6.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.7-6.9%], and was highest among patient care support (16.7%), medical assistants (9.1%) and nurses (8.2%), and lower for physicians (3.8%) and advanced practice providers (4.5%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among African Americans [odds ratio (OR) 3.26 compared with Caucasians, 95% CI 1.77-5.99], in participants with at least one symptom of COVID-19 (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.92-4.68), and in those reporting prior quarantine (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.57-5.70). No symptoms were reported in 24% of seropositive participants. Among the 47% of participants who returned for a follow-up serological test, the seroreversion rate was 39.5% and the seroconversion rate was 2.2%.

As a prerequisite, the successful collection of a sufficient number of viable peripheral blood hematopoietic CD34+ cells is critical. A common standard protocol for mobilization is currently not defined and critically discussed especially in German-speaking Europe. In times of the Covid-19 pandemic, safe and effective strategies have to be chosen to minimize hospitalization times and severe courses. In this single-center retrospective analysis, safety and efficacy of cyclophosphamide plus etoposide (CE) and growth-factor support (n = 33) was compared to cyclophosphamide mono treatment and growth-factor support (n = 49) in 82 patients with multiple myeloma at first diagnosis. CE was superior to cyclophosphamide mono with a significantly higher number of collected CD34+ cells (15.46 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg vs. 9.92 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg), significantly faster engraftment of granulocytes after stem cell transplantation (day 10.5 vs. day 11.6), shorter duration of the inpatient stay (17.47 days vs. 19.16 days) and significantly less transfusions (8.82 % vs. 30.61 % patients receiving transfusions). The safety profile was comparable in both groups and in line with published data. We conclude that CE is a safe and highly effective mobilization protocol in patients with multiple myeloma at first diagnosis and appears to be superior to the commonly used cyclophosphamide mono regimen.","Heider, Michael; Grass, Sandra; Dill, Veronika; Rämisch, Stephanie; Winter, Christof; Verbeek, Mareike; Götze, Katharina S; Bassermann, Florian; Jilg, Stefanie",Transfus Apher Sci,703,16

The research method is qualitative, followed by gender perspective, to affirm the narrative based on women’s experiences and gender analysis. On one side, economic recession due to the Pandemic of COVID-19 has increased the vulnerability of women in the informal sector because their income depends on daily economic activity. On the other side, the implementation of social distancing has increased women’s workload at home. However, culturally, women’s works in private sectors such as care works, and mothering tend to be normalized. Economic activity is associated with men’s jobs as breadwinners, and it is limited on public space. Therefore, women seem not productive economically even though they have endless works (at home). This article does not only explore one single aspect of women’s double burdens. But it is also to discuss how women’s identical activity with care works has been dis­connected from the economic cycle chain itself. Meanwhile, living in the time of pandemic COVID-19 shows that women’s works become the vital pillar of resilience in handling crisis, whether in health and economy.","Asriani, Desintha Dwi; Fatimah, Dati; Mardhiyyah, Mida; Zubaedah, Aminatun; en,",Sawwa: Jurnal Studi Gender,703,16

There has been concern that trainees may not achieve the procedural numbers required to graduate as independent electrophysiologists within the usual timeline. We sought to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the percentage of clinical cardiac EP (CCEP) fellows in jeopardy of not meeting procedural volume requirements and overall sentiments regarding preparedness of fellows for independent practice. METHODS: We surveyed CCEP fellows and program directors about baseline procedural volumes, curriculum changes due to the pandemic, and attitudes about preparedness for board examinations and independent practice. RESULTS: Ninety-nine fellows and 27 program directors responded to the survey. Ninety-eight percent of responding fellows reported a decrease in procedural volume as a result of the pandemic. Program directors reported an overall decrease in annual number of ablations and device procedures performed by each fellow during the 2019-2020 academic year compared to the preceding year. Despite this, a minority of fellows and program directors reported concerns about meeting Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education procedural requirements for devices (9% and 4%, respectively) and ablation (19% and 9%) or preparedness for independent practice after a 2-year fellowship. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a decrease in procedural volume for CCEP trainees, but the majority of fellows and program directors do not anticipate major barriers to timely graduation. This may change with COVID-19 resurgence and further interruptions in training.","Singla, Virginia K; Jain, Shashank; Ganeshan, Raj; Rosenfeld, Lynda E; Enriquez, Alan D",J. cardiovasc. electrophysiol,703,1

China has experienced the unprecedented epidemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in an era when social media has fundamentally transformed information production and consumption patterns. OBJECTIVE: This study examined public engagement and government responsiveness in the communications about COVID-19 during the early epidemic stage based on an analysis of data from Sina Weibo, a major social media platform in China. METHODS: Weibo data relevant to COVID-19 from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2020, were retrieved. Engagement data (likes, comments, shares, and followers) of posts from government agency accounts were extracted to evaluate public engagement with government posts online. Content analyses were conducted for a random subset of 644 posts from personal accounts of individuals, and 273 posts from 10 relatively more active government agency accounts and the National Health Commission of China to identify major thematic contents in online discussions. Latent class analysis further explored main content patterns, and chi-square for trend examined how proportions of main content patterns changed by time within the study time frame. RESULTS: The public response to COVID-19 seemed to follow the spread of the disease and government actions but was earlier for Weibo than the government. Online users generally had low engagement with posts relevant to COVID-19 from government agency accounts. The common content patterns identified in personal and government posts included sharing epidemic situations; general knowledge of the new disease; and policies, guidelines, and official actions. However, personal posts were more likely to show empathy to affected people (&#967;21=13.3, P<.001), attribute blame to other individuals or government (&#967;21=28.9, P<.001), and express worry about the epidemic (&#967;21=32.1, P<.001), while government posts were more likely to share instrumental support (&#967;21=32.5, P<.001) and praise people or organizations (&#967;21=8.7, P=.003). As the epidemic evolved, sharing situation updates (for trend, &#967;21=19.7, P<.001) and policies, guidelines, and official actions (for trend, &#967;21=15.3, P<.001) became less frequent in personal posts but remained stable or increased significantly in government posts. Moreover, as the epidemic evolved, showing empathy and attributing blame (for trend, &#967;21=25.3, P<.001) became more frequent in personal posts, corresponding to a slight increase in sharing instrumental support, praising, and empathizing in government posts (for trend, &#967;21=9.0, P=.003). CONCLUSIONS: The government should closely monitor social media data to improve the timing of communications about an epidemic. As the epidemic evolves, merely sharing situation updates and policies may be insufficient to capture public interest in the messages. The government may adopt a more empathic communication style as more people are affected by the disease to address public concerns.","Liao, Qiuyan; Yuan, Jiehu; Dong, Meihong; Yang, Lin; Fielding, Richard; Lam, Wendy Wing Tak",J Med Internet Res,703,1

Digital tools can support the data consolidation needed for meeting preparation and data sharing during complex case reviews. In this paper, we assessed the value of a clinical decision support tool on workflow efficiency and conducting a complex case review of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) tumor. Methods: Case presentation was performed by each unique clinical specialty that had relevant information about the patient;an oncologist, a pathologist, and a radiologist. Virtual discussion was completed online with case presentation and documentation with NAVIFY Tumor Board. Workflow efficiency assessment was done through interviews and observation of the # of steps across different team members involved in preparing and conducting cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings before and after the implementation of the NAVIFY Tumor Board solution. Results: Case review consisted of surgical and therapeutic intervention history, distinct histological and sequencing patterns representative of DFSP, with radiological review to determine areas for surgical intervention. Consolidation of clinical input led to a recommendation of a formal external hemipelvectomy with potential chemotherapy. Workflow assessment demonstrated a 46% total reduction in the # of steps for meeting preparation (from 69 to 37), with specific changes based on role: data manager (33 to 15), pathologist (26 to 13), radiologist (no change), and logistics (5 to 4). There was a 31% total reduction in the # of steps for conducting the meeting (from 51 to 35). Conclusion: Utilizing a digital clinical decision support tool helped to consolidate patient data and improved case presentation through workflow efficiency. This allowed for improved interdisciplinary discussion on a complex DFSP case and supported the determination of a clinical decision.","Soo, K. C.; Al Jajeh, I.; Quah, R.; Seah, H. K.

The primary aim of this study was to identify risks for breastfeeding/pumping cessation with neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants' mothers who smoke or live with individuals who smoke, using a novel survival-analytic approach. METHODS/DESIGN: Mothers (N = 360) were recruited for a secondhand smoke prevention intervention during infants' NICU hospitalizations and followed for ~6 months after infant discharge. Data were obtained from medical records and participant self-report/interviews. RESULTS: The sample was predominantly ethnic/racial minorities; mean age was 26.8 (SD = 5.9) years. One-fifth never initiated breastfeeding/pumping (n = 67; 18.9%) and mean time-to-breastfeeding cessation was 48.1 days (SD = 57.2; median = 30.4 [interquartile range: 6.0-60.9]). Education, length of stay, employment, race/ethnicity, number of household members who smoke, and readiness-to-protect infants from tobacco smoke were significantly associated with breastfeeding cessation. Further, infants fed breast milk for &#8805;4 months had 42.7% more well-child visits (p < 0.001) and 50.0% fewer respiratory-related clinic visits (p < 0.05). DISCUSSION: One-quarter of infants admitted to NICUs will be discharged to households where individuals who smoke live; we demonstrated that smoking-related factors were associated with mothers' breastfeeding practices. Infants who received breast milk longer had fewer respiratory-related visits. IMPACT: One-quarter of NICU infants will be discharged to households where smokers live.Initiating/sustaining breastfeeding can be difficult for mothers of preterm NICU infants, especially mothers who smoke or live with others who smoke.Education, employment, race/ethnicity, length of stay, household member smoking, and readiness-to-protect infants from tobacco smoke were significantly associated with time-to-breastfeeding cessation.Infants fed breast milk for &#8805;4 months had 42.7% more well-child visits and 50.0% fewer respiratory-related clinic visits, compared to infants fed breast milk <4 months.Data support intervention refinements for mothers from smoking households and making NICU-based healthcare workers aware of risk factors for early breastfeeding cessation.Fig. 1Kaplan-Meier survival curve (with 95% confidence bands depicted in dashed lines) for the number of days to breastfeeding or pumping cessation.","Northrup, Thomas F; Suchting, Robert; Green, Charles; Khan, Amir; Klawans, Michelle R; Stotts, Angela L",Pediatr. res,703,29

The primary aim of the study was to evaluate weight and food habit changes during COVID-19 outbreak. The secondary endpoint was to explore the psychological factors, arising during the pandemic, influencing weight and dietary variations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey composed of four different items was conducted by telephone interview: (1) anthropometric data and type of procedure, (2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (3) maladaptive eating behaviors, and (4) personal feelings moved by the COVID-19 spread and lockdown. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients were enrolled. No significant changes in weight, BMI, and maladaptive eating habits were observed. A significant reduction in the anxiety index score was observed. In 17.8% of cases, a change in obesity class was reported, and among these patients, a substantial modification in bariatric procedures was planned (60%). CONCLUSION: This study showed no effect on weight and BMI nor on rates of maladaptive eating habits associated with quarantine/social isolation among severely obese individuals waiting for the bariatric surgery. At the end of lockdown, a considerable proportion of patients modified their initial obesity class, and in selected cases, it could represent a criteria for rearrangement of the planned bariatric procedure. In obese patients, the lockdown and social distancing generated a reduction of fear of confronting and being negatively judged by others. This psychological aspect was assessed with the reduction of the HADS score.","Albert, Umberto; Losurdo, Pasquale; Leschiutta, Alessia; Macchi, Serena; Samardzic, Natasa; Casaganda, Biagio; de Manzini, Nicolò; Palmisano, Silvia",Obes Surg,703,1

Since then more than 9400 positive cases and 33 deaths have been reported. Recently studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a poor prognosis and a higher mortality rate when compared to the non-diabetic patients. Poorly controlled diabetic patients had a higher incidence of complications like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) which might have been precipitated by COVID-19. DKA and HHS are potentially lethal but preventable conditions. During this pandemic, although cases of uncontrolled diabetes are frequently reported, there is scarcity in reporting of cases with diabetic emergencies. CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 53-year old Asian male, admitted on Day 10th of illness with DKA with acute kidney injury, and Moderate COVID-19. Case 2 was a 72-year old Asian male, admitted with mild COVID-19 who developed HHS with acute kidney injury on day 9 of illness. Both patients were managed conservatively in intensive care unit, with intravenous fluids and insulin. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should focus on close monitoring of diabetic patients with COVID-19, to prevent diabetic emergencies like DKA and HHS. It is important to aggressively manage these conditions for a favorable outcome.","Dey, Rajib Kumar; Hilmy, Abdullah Isneen; Imad, Hisham Ahmed; Yoosuf, Abdul Azeez; Latheef, Ali Abdulla",J Med Case Rep,703,24

Individuals whose samples belong to pools that test negative are declared healthy, while each pool that tests positive is divided into smaller, equally sized pools which are tested in the next stage. In the $(k+1)$-th stage all remaining samples are tested. If $p<1-3^{-1/3}$, we minimize the expected number of tests per individual as a function of the number $k+1$ of stages, and of the pool sizes in the first $k$ stages.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene IFITM3 have been associated with susceptibility and severity of influenza or other viral infections. We aimed to analyze the role of SNPs in the gene IFITM3 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed genotyping of the SNPs rs12252 and rs34481144 in the gene IFITM3 in 239 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 253 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics. Neither IFITM3 rs12252 nor rs34481144 polymorphisms were related to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or severity of COVID-19. Interestingly, we observed the putative deleterious rs12252 CC genotype only in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (N = 2). Also, we found a non-significant higher frequency of rs34481144 A-allele carriers in the patients with 'serious' COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we could not confirm the recently reported influence of polymorphisms in the gene IFITM3 on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk or severity of COVID-19 in a German cohort. Additional studies are needed to clarify the influence of the rs12252 CC genotype on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and the rs34481144 A-allele on course of COVID-19.","Schönfelder, Kristina; Breuckmann, Katharina; Elsner, Carina; Dittmer, Ulf; Fistera, David; Herbstreit, Frank; Risse, Joachim; Schmidt, Karsten; Sutharsan, Sivagurunathan; Taube, Christian; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz; Siffert, Winfried; Kribben, Andreas; Möhlendick, Birte",Cytokine,703,1

In this review, we report literature results on the possible link between outdoor PM and health outcomes with a focus on pulmonary infections and the mechanisms responsible for observed negative effects. PM physical and chemical properties, such as size and chemical composition, as well as major emission sources are described for a more comprehensive view about the role played by atmospheric PM in the observed adverse health effects; to this aim, major processes leading to the deposition of PM in the respiratory tract and how this can pave the way to the onset of pathologies are also presented. From the literature works here reviewed, two ways in which PM can threaten human health promoting respiratory infectious diseases are mostly taken into account. The first pathway is related to an enhanced susceptibility and here we will also report on molecular mechanisms in the lung immune system responsible for the augmented susceptibility to pathogens, such as the damage of mechanical defensive barriers, the alteration of the innate immune response, and the generation of oxidative stress. The second one deals with the relationship between infectious agents and PM; here we recall that viruses and bacteria (BioPM) are themselves part of atmospheric PM and are collected during sampling together with particles of different origin; so, data should be analysed with caution in order to avoid any false cause-effect relation. To face these issues a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory as also evident from the ongoing research about the mechanisms hypothesized for the SARS-CoV-2 airborne spreading, which is still controversial and claims for further investigation.

There is a critical need to develop safe and effective drugs, especially broad-spectrum antiviral and organ protection agents in order to treat and prevent this dangerous disease. It is possible that Chinese herbal medicine may play an essential role in the treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. AIM OF THE REVIEW: We aim to review the use of Chinese herbal medicine in the treatment of COVID-19 both in vitro and in clinical practice. Our goal was to provide a better understanding of the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicine and to establish a ""Chinese protocol"" for the treatment of COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically reviewed published research relating to traditional Chinese herbal medicines and the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 from inception to the 6th January 2021 by screening a range of digital databases (Web of Science, bioRxiv, medRxiv, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, X-MOL, Wanfang Data, Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, and other resources) and public platforms relating to the management of clinical trials. We included the active ingredients of Chinese herbal medicines, monomer preparations, crude extracts, and formulas for the treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: In mainland China, a range of Chinese herbal medicines have been recognized as very promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, including active ingredients (quercetagetin, osajin, tetrandrine, proscillaridin A, and dihydromyricetin), monomer preparations (xiyanping injection, matrine-sodium chloride injection, diammonium glycyrrhizinate enteric-coated capsules, and sodium aescinate injection), crude extracts (Scutellariae Radix extract and garlic essential oil), and formulas (Qingfei Paidu decoction, Lianhuaqingwen capsules, and Pudilan Xiaoyan oral liquid). All these agents have potential activity against SARS-CoV-2 and have attracted significant attention due to their activities both in vitro and in clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: As a key component of the COVID-19 treatment regimen, Chinese herbal medicines have played an irreplaceable role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ""Chinese protocol"" has already demonstrated clear clinical importance. The use of Chinese herbal medicines that are capable of inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 infection may help to address this immediate unmet clinical need and may be attractive to other countries that are also seeking new options for effective COVID-19 treatment. Our analyses suggest that countries outside of China should also consider protocols involving Chinese herbal medicines combat this fast-spreading viral infection.","Wang, Zhonglei; Yang, Liyan",J Ethnopharmacol,703,22

Patient and methods: A 52-year-old male with type II diabetes on empagliflozin and no history of DKA presented with symptoms of COVID-19 as well as laboratory findings consistent with euglycaemic DKA. His hospital course was complicated by recurrent episodes of euglycaemic DKA as well as hyperglycaemic DKA. Conclusion: SGLT2 inhibitors should be held as early as possible in COVID-19 cases due to the risk of euglycaemic DKA. These patients should also have more intense glucose monitoring. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 can precipitate euglycaemic DKA in diabetic patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.Clinicians should be cognizant that the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors can persist for more than 72 hours after the last dose.Diabetic patients with COVID-19 require closer strict glucose monitoring to reduce the risk of DKA.,"Fang, Jiali; Genco, Matthew; Caskey, Rachel N",Eur J Case Rep Intern Med,703,1

Scientific air distribution design and operation management are crucial to ensure the environmental safety of medical staff. This paper proposes the application of adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation and evaluates this air supply mode based on contaminants dispersion, removal efficiency, thermal comfort, and operating expense. Adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation provides a direct supply of fresh air to the occupied zone. In comparison with a ceiling air supply or upper sidewall air supply, adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation results in a 15%-47% lower average concentration of contaminants, for a continual release of contaminants at the same air changes per hour (ACH; 10 h-1). The contaminant removal efficiency of complete mixing ventilation cannot exceed 1.0. For adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation, the contaminant removal efficiency is an exponential function of the ACH. Compared with the ceiling air supply mode or upper sidewall air supply mode, adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation achieves a similar thermal comfort level (predicted mean vote (PMV) of -0.1-0.4; draught rate of 2.5%-6.7%) and a similar performance in removing contaminants, but has a lower ACH and uses less energy.","Zhang, Ying; Han, Ou; Li, Angui; Hou, Li039; an,; Olofsson, Thomas; Zhang, Linhua; Lei, Wenjun",,703,16

LOCAL PROBLEM: No standard method exists for measuring perceived HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic in participants as they attempt to improve their self-determined wellness goals. An implementation plan that considers the social distancing limitations imposed can be used to predict an individual's likelihood of long-term success. METHODS: During the four, 2-week plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, the Social Cognitive Theory model informed the implementation of the four core interventions. To guide iterative changes, the data was analyzed through Excel and run charts. INTERVENTIONS: The four core interventions were the shared decision-making tool (SDMT), health mobile app tool (HMAT), wellness tracker tool (WTT), and the team engagement plan. RESULTS: Among 28 participants, perceived quality of life increased by 70%, engagement in shared decision-making increased to 82%, app use and confidence increased to 85%, and goal attainment reached 81%. CONCLUSIONS: The SDMT, health app, and wellness tracker created a methodical plan of accountability for increasing participant wellness.

METHODS: This was an analytical, observational, retrospective study based on secondary data that were obtained from public Brazilian databases and covered the period from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 10-44). Data on weekly COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths due COVID-19, sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and social isolation indices were obtained. Associations between the variables were tested using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In all regions of Santa Catarina, there were almost simultaneous peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in weeks 28-31, followed by a sudden decrease. Social isolation indices were not associated with the outcomes; sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were significant predictors of all outcomes (p < 0.001). COVID-19 prevalence was significantly different across the state regions when COVID-19 cases started to decline (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Collective immunity and social isolation may not have been the only causes for the reduction of the COVID-19 pandemic observed in Santa Catarina. The results of this study were compatible with the hypothesis that early treatment of COVID-19 cases with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may contribute to reducing the transmissibility of COVID-19 in the population. This hypothesis needs to be further tested in future studies.","Neves, Fabricio Souza",Travel Med Infect Dis,703,10

Since the onset of infections, several full-length sequences of viral genome have been made available which have been used to gain insights into viral dynamics. We utilised a meta-data driven comparative analysis tool for sequences (Meta-CATS) algorithm to identify mutations in 829 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world. The algorithm predicted sixty-one mutations among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We observed that most of the mutations were concentrated around three protein coding genes viz nsp3 (non-structural protein 3), RdRp (RNA-directed RNA polymerase) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We used various computational tools including normal mode analysis (NMA), C-&#945; discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) and all-atom molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to study the effect of mutations on functionality, stability and flexibility of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins including envelope (E), N and spike (S) proteins. PredictSNP predictor suggested that four mutations (L37H in E, R203K and P344S in N and D614G in S) out of seven were predicted to be neutral whilst the remaining ones (P13L, S197L and G204R in N) were predicted to be deleterious in nature thereby impacting protein functionality. NMA, C-&#945; DMD and all-atom MD suggested some mutations to have stabilizing roles (P13L, S197L and R203K in N protein) where remaining ones were predicted to destabilize mutant protein. In summary, we identified significant mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes as well as used computational approaches to further characterize the possible effect of highly significant mutations on SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We found data on Flaviviridae (n = 10), Retroviridae (n = 3), Coronaviridae (n = 2), Reoviridae (n = 2) and Caliciviridae (n = 1). Most published trials were at high risk of bias. The findings were heterogeneous across and within viral families regarding virological, immunological and biological response, with no clear conclusion. Some weak but positive results were reported about decrease of symptom severity and duration, or reduction in viral loads. Despite high tolerability, the effects of LF as oral supplement are still inconsistent, both in preventing and managing viral infections. Small sample sizes, variety in recruitment and treatment protocols, and low study quality may have contributed to such heterogeneity.

Clinical information on patients who contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the perioperative period is limited. Here, we report seven cases with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the perioperative period of lung resection. Retrospective analysis suggested that one patient had been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery and the other six patients contracted the infection after the lung resection. Fever, lymphopenia, and ground-glass opacities revealed on computed tomography are the most common clinical manifestations of the patients who contracted COVID-19 after the lung resection. Pathologic studies of the specimens of these seven patients were performed. Pathologic examination of patient 1, who was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 infection before the surgery, revealed that apart from the tumor, there was a wide range of interstitial inflammation with plasma cell and macrophage infiltration. High density of macrophages and foam cells in the alveolar cavities, but no obvious proliferation of pneumocyte, was found. Three of seven patients died from COVID-19 pneumonia, suggesting lung resection surgery might be a risk factor for death in patients with COVID-19 in the perioperative period.","Cai, Yixin; Hao, Zhipeng; Gao, Yi; Ping, Wei; Wang, Qi; Peng, Shu; Zhao, Bo; Sun, Wei; Zhu, Min; Li, Kaiyan; Han, Ying; Kuang, Dong; Chu, Qian; Fu, Xiangning; Zhang, Ni",J Thorac Oncol,703,1

Half the drawings were created in March 2020 one week before school closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the remainder in November 2020 when schools reopened. Compared to pre-pandemic drawings, images created during the pandemic revealed more informed understandings of scientists and their work and fewer drawings were classed as ‘uncategorised’. However, drawings made during the pandemic revealed more stereotypical perceptions of scientists and their work as indicated by the larger number of stereotypical indicators incorporated into drawings. These increases were statistically significant for younger children. A welcome finding was broader conceptions of the nature of a scientists’ work, a shift that appeared to be motivated by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some of these are community-acquired co-infections. OBJECTIVE: To review recent data that indicate the occurrence of hospital-onset bacterial infections, including with antibiotic-resistant isolates, in COVID-19 patients. SOURCES: Using PubMed, the literature was searched using terms including: 'COVID-19'; 'SARS-CoV-2'; 'bacterial infection'; 'healthcare-associated infection'; 'antibiotic resistance'; 'antimicrobial resistance'; 'multi-drug resistance'; 'Streptococcus'; 'Staphylococcus'; 'Pseudomonas'; 'Escherichia'; 'Klebsiella'; 'Enterococcus'; 'Acinetobacter'; 'Haemophilus'; 'MRSA'; 'VRE'; 'ESBL'; 'NDM-CRE'; 'CR-Ab'; 'VRSA'; 'MDR'. CONTENT: There is a growing number of reports of bacterial infections acquired by patients with severe COVID-19 after hospital admission. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens found to cause healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in COVID-19 patients include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum ß-lactamase Klebsiella pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. COVID-19 has impacted bacterial HAIs in a number of ways with an increase in the incidence of New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii reported at some hospital sites compared with before the pandemic. Recommended guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship in COVID-19 patient treatment are discussed regarding minimization of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic use. Other studies have reported a decrease in methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci cases, which has been attributed to enhanced infection prevention and control practices introduced to minimize intra-hospital spread of COVID-19. IMPLICATIONS: Poorer outcomes have been observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with an antibiotic-resistant infection. Although heightened IPC measures have been accompanied by a reduction in some HAIs at specific sites, in other situations, COVID-19 has been associated with an increase in bacterial HAI incidence. Further research is needed to define the cost-benefit relationship of maintaining COVID-19-related infection prevention and control protocols beyond the pandemic to reduce the burden of HAIs. In addition, the longer-term impact of high usage of certain broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic requires evaluation.","O039,; Toole, Ronan F",Clin. microbiol. infect,703,16

Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection development and progression was investigated in subjects undergoing mandatory quarantine on airport arrival. METHODS: 2714 subjects were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and all were quarantined for 2 weeks. Viral retesting was undertaken on symptom development and routinely at 14 days if asymptomatic. Asymptomatic, positive patients underwent viral testing every 2 days to determine viral clearance. RESULTS: 188/2714 (6.9%) patients became SARS-CoV-2 positive. On arrival, 136/188 tested positive, with 44/188 (23.4%) symptomatic and 92/188 (48.9%) asymptomatic. All 92 patients remained asymptomatic and were retested every 2 days until viral clearance. 2526 quarantined subjects remained virus free at 14 days. Viral clearance did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (12.6 ± 1.0 days and 12.1 ± 0.4 days, respectively). Of the 52/188 (27.7%) testing negative on arrival, 27/52 subsequently became positive and developed symptoms 2-13 days after arrival. 25/188 (13.3%) remained asymptomatic and tested positive at day 14, with viral testing undertaken every 2 days in these subjects; of these, 24 remained asymptomatic, with viral clearance at 9.4 ± 0.7 days - less than for those who were asymptomatic on arrival (p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 were more prevalent than those exhibiting symptoms, and are an infection reservoir.","Al-Qahtani, Manaf; AlAli, Salman; AbdulRahman, AbdulKarim; Salman Alsayyad, Adel; Otoom, Sameer; Atkin, Stephen L",Int J Infect Dis,703,16

METHODS: This study is a longitudinal single-arm cohort study conducted in China between May 1 and July 31, 2020. Seventy-two pregnant patients with Covid-19 participated in follow-up surveys until 3 months after giving birth (57 cases) or having abortion (15 cases). We collected data from medical records regarding Covid-19, delivery or abortion, testing results of maternal and neonatal specimens, and questionnaires of quarantine, mother-baby separation, feeding, and measuring of mothers' mental disorders and infants' neurobehavioral disorders. RESULTS: All cases infected in the first trimester and 1/3 of cases infected in the second trimester had an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. 22.2% of pregnant patients were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression at 3 months after delivery or induced abortion. Among 57 live births, only one neonate was positive of nucleic acid testing for throat swab, but negative in repeated tests subsequently. The median duration of mother-baby separation was 35 days (interquartile range 16 to 52 days). After the termination of maternal quarantine, 49.1% of mothers chose to prolong the mother-baby separation (median 8 days; IQR 5 to 23 days). The breastfeeding rate was 8.8% at 1 week after birth, 19.3% at the age of 1 month, and 36.8% at the age of 3 months, respectively. The proportion of ""monitoring"" and ""risk"" in the social-emotional developmental domain at the age of 3 months was 22.7% and 63.6%, respectively. After the adjustment of preterm, neonatal sex, admitted to NICU, and the mother's Covid-19 condition, the negative associations were significantly identified (p < 0.05) between mother-baby separation days and three developmental domains: communication, gross motor, and personal-social. CONCLUSIONS: There is no definite evidence on vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to control infection risk, researchers and healthcare providers should pay more attention to maternal mental health and infant's feeding, closeness with parents, and early development.","Wang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Lian; Wu, Tianchen; Shi, Huifeng; Li, Qin; Jiang, Hai; Zheng, Danni; Wang, Xiaoli; Wei, Yuan; Zhao, Yangyu; Qiao, Jie",BMC Med,703,1

RAB14 acts as molecular switches that shift between a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state and regulates circulation of vesicles between the Golgi and endosomal compartments. In present study, we investigated the roles of RAB14 during oocyte meiotic maturation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microinjection with siRNA and exogenous mRNA for knock down and rescue, and immunofluorescence staining, Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were utilized for the study. RESULTS: Our results showed that RAB14 localized in the cytoplasm and accumulated at the cortex during mouse oocyte maturation, and it was also enriched at the spindle periphery. Depletion of RAB14 did not affect polar body extrusion but caused large polar bodies, indicating the failure of asymmetric division. We found that absence of RAB14 did not affect spindle organization but caused the spindle migration defects, and this might be due to the regulation on cytoplasmic actin assembly via the ROCK-cofilin signalling pathway. We also found that RAB14 depletion led to aberrant Golgi apparatus distribution. Exogenous Myc-Rab14 mRNA supplement could significantly rescue these defects caused by Rab14 siRNA injection. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that RAB14 affects ROCK-cofilin pathway for actin-based spindle migration and Golgi apparatus distribution during mouse oocyte meiotic maturation.","Zou, Yuan-Jing; Shan, Meng-Meng; Wang, Hong-Hui; Pan, Zhen-Nan; Pan, Meng-Hao; Xu, Yi; Ju, Jia-Qian; Sun, Shao-Chen",Cell Prolif,703,20

Patients in the placebo arm were given identical looking placebo tablets. Rest of the treatment was continued as per the existing protocol and the clinical judgment of the treating teams. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was a negative RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on day 6 of admission. The secondary outcome measures were symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 115 patients were enrolled for the study of which 112 were included in the final analysis. Of them, 55 were randomised to the intervention arm while 57 were randomised to the placebo arm. There was no significant difference in the baseline characteristics of the two arms. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome, i.e. negative RT-PCR status on day 6 between the two groups. Similarly, there was no significant difference between the two groups in most of the secondary outcome measures, viz. symptom status on day 6, discharge status on day 10, admission to ICU, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, while there was no in-hospital mortality in the intervention arm, there were 4 deaths in the placebo arm. As a result, all patients in the intervention arm (n=56) were successfully discharged as compared to 93.1% (n=54/58) in the placebo arm (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2, p=0.019).

The data was collected from international tourists who were in Pakistan or who had visited Pakistan. The findings revealed that perceived risks and perceived constraints negatively impact destination image and behavioral intention. On the other hand, destination image has a positive impact on behavior. Moreover, the study also proved the mediating effect of destination image among the relations of perceived risks, perceived constraints, and behavioral intention. These findings indicate that sometimes it is difficult for destinations to overcome constraints, so destination managers should provide value-added services for substitutes. A positive destination image can overcome risks and constraints, so destination managers should also promote destinations besides mitigating risks. Literature has discussed the mediating effect of destination image in different contexts.

In mammals, multiple subtypes of interferon-α (IFN-α) exist, most of which possess antiviral activity. Little is known about giant panda IFN-α genes and the role they may play in giant panda immunological responses to viruses. We have cloned genes encoding 12 giant panda IFN-α (AmIFN-α or AmIFNA) subtypes that share from 90 to 99% amino acid sequence identity. AmIFN-α12 has one additional amino acid at position 57, which is not present in other subtypes. Sequence identity of the AmIFN-α proteins encoded by the 12 genes compared to human IFN-α2 is approximately 58%. Unlike most of the human subtypes, each of the 12 giant panda IFN sequences has an N-glycosylation recognition site. Expression of all 12 AmIFN-α subtypes in 293 cells was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. The antiviral activity and antiproliferative activity of each AmIFN-α subtype produced in transiently transfected 293 cell cultures were tested in vitro. All AmIFN-α subtypes were found to be stable at pH 2 or 65 °C and to exhibit antiviral activity. Some IFN subtypes (AmIFN-α8 and AmIFN-α4) showed higher biological activity levels than others, whereas AmIFN-α11 exhibited lower activity. AmIFN-α had various antiproliferative activities to different target cells. To B16 cells, AmIFN-α3, AmIFN-α4, AmIFN-α8 had the highest activities, while to K562 cells, AmIFN-α3, AmIFN-α7, AmIFN-α10 had the highest activities.

This is a novel approach, as previous research has used mainly questionnaire-based measures of reasoning. We also tested two interventions to counteract the misinformation, contrasting a tentative refutation based on materials used by health authorities with an enhanced refutation based on best-practice recommendations. We found prior exposure to misinformation increased misinformation promotion (by 18%). Both tentative and enhanced refutations reduced demand (by 18% and 25%, respectively) as well as misinformation promotion (by 29% and 55%).

This study used the Agent-based Modeling (ABM) method to analyze the transmission rate of COVID-19 in different sporting models, sporting spaces per capita, and situations of gathering, which contributes to understanding how COVID-19 transmits in sports facilities. The simulation results show that the transmission rate of COVID-19 was higher under the Fixed Movement Route (FMR) than under the Unfixed Movement Route (UMR) in 10 different sporting spaces per capita (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 m(2)) (p = 0.000). For both FMR and UMR, the larger the sporting space per capita, the lower the virus transmission rate. Additionally, when the sporting space per capita increases from 4 m(2) to 5 m(2), the virus transmission rate decreases most significantly (p = 0.000). In the FMR model with a per capita sporting space of 5 m(2), minimizing gathering (no more than three people) could significantly slow down the transmission rate of the COVID-19 virus (p < 0.05). This study concluded that: (1) The UMR model is suggested in training facilities or playing grounds; (2) The sporting space should be non-overcrowding, and it is recommended that the sporting space per capita in the sporting grounds should not be less than 5 m(2); (3) It is important to maintain safe social distancing and minimize gathering (no more than three people) when exercising.","Qi, Bote; Tan, Jingwang; Zhang, Qingwen; Cao, Meng; Wang, Xingxiong; Zou, Yu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,703,17

The close social relationships that they can experience can have positive effects on their well-being. The objective of this paper is to estimate the effect of perceived social support on the changes of the hedonic and eudaimonic well-being of Chilean university students during the transition from the first to the second academic year. Overall, 205 students participated (63.90% men and 36.09% women) with an average age of 19.14 years (SD = 1.73), evaluated during their first academic year (2017) and the succeeding one (2018). For the evaluation of perceived social support, the Spanish version of the Perceived Social Support Questionnaire “MSPSS” was used, and PERMA-profiler was used to measure hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. Changes through the time of hedonic well-being and social support and the correlations between the variables were analyzed. Changes in the perception of social support were analyzed according to four categories of hedonic well-being. The prediction of social support for eudaimonic well-being was evaluated. Results indicated that the perception of students’ social support did not change over time. Statistically significant differences were found in hedonic well-being scores in the two measurements, being significantly higher in the first measurement than in the second one. More than 50% of the participants presented a positive balance of affections. The perception of social support is associated with the two types of well-being. Students who had a high balance of affections had a greater perception of general social support than the groups of positive evolution of affections and a low balance of affections. In the case of the friends and family support dimensions, the perception in the high-balance group of affections concerning the low-scale group is greater. Improving the perception of social support increases the eudaimonic well-being of university students. The perception of support that students had during the beginning of their university life benefits their general well-being, which contributes to their mental health.","Cobo-Rendón, Rubia; López-Angulo, Yaranay; Pérez-Villalobos, María Victoria; Díaz-Mujica, Alejandro",Front Psychol,703,24

The model presented here describes with reasonable agreement the number of COVID-19 cases registered in Brazil between February 26 and April 25, 2020 based on the hypothesis that there a large number no notified cases (11 to 1) and variation in contagion rate according to social isolation measures and greater or lesser exposure to the virus (highest rate in beginning from epidemic). To this end, we introduced an exposure factor, called {beta}1/{beta}2, which allows us to describe the influence of factors such as social isolation on dispersal from disease. The results also corroborate a phenomenon observed in countries that registered a high growth in cases in short period of time, to example of Italy, Spain and USA: if isolation measures are imposed late, the total number of cases explodes when the epidemic is approaching from peak, which implies a higher exposure rate in the first days of case registration.

Because of the complex pathophysiology of sepsis, multiple biomarkers must be analyzed to compensate for the low sensitivity and specificity of single biomarker targets. Conventional LFAs, such as gold nanoparticle dyed assays, are limited to approximately five targets—the maximum number of test lines on an assay. To increase the information obtainable from each test line, we combined green and red emitting quantum dots (QDs) as labels for C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibodies in an optical duplex immunoassay. CdSe-QDs with sharp and tunable emission bands were used to simultaneously quantify CRP and IL-6 in a single test line, by using a single UV-light source and two suitable emission filters for readout through a widely available BioImager device. For image and data processing, a customized software tool, the MultiFlow-Shiny app was used to accelerate and simplify the readout process. The app software provides advanced tools for image processing, including assisted extraction of line intensities, advanced background correction and an easy workflow for creation and handling of experimental data in quantitative LFAs. The results generated with our MultiFlow-Shiny app were superior to those generated with the popular software ImageJ and resulted in lower detection limits. Our assay is applicable for detecting clinically relevant ranges of both target proteins and therefore may serve as a powerful tool for POC diagnosis of inflammation and infectious events.

With the need to limit COVID-19 exposures, telemedicine has become an increasingly important format for clinical care. Compared with other fields, neuro-ophthalmology faces unique challenges, given its dependence on physical examination signs that are difficult to elicit outside the office setting. As such, it is imperative to understand both patient and provider experiences to continue to adapt the technology and tailor its application. The purpose of this study is to analyze both neuro-ophthalmology physician and patient satisfaction with virtual health visits during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Across three institutions (NYU Langone Health, Indiana University Health, and Columbia University Medical Center), telemedicine surveys were administered to 159 patients. Neuro-ophthalmologists completed 157 surveys; each of these were linked to a single patient visit. Patient surveys consisted of 5 questions regarding visit preparation, satisfaction, challenges, and comfort. The physician survey included 4 questions that focused on ability to gather specific clinical information by history and examination. RESULTS: Among 159 patients, 104 (65.4%) reported that they were satisfied with the visit, and 149 (93.7%) indicated that they were comfortable asking questions. Sixty-eight (73.9%) patients found the instructions provided before the visit easy to understand. Potential areas for improvement noted by patients included more detailed preparation instructions and better technology (phone positioning, Internet connection, and software). More than 87% (137/157) of neuro-ophthalmologists surveyed reported having performed an examination that provided enough information for medical decision-making. Some areas of the neuro-ophthalmologic examination were reported to be easy to conduct (range of eye movements, visual acuity, Amsler grids, Ishihara color plates, and pupillary examination). Other components were more difficult (saccades, red desaturation, visual fields, convergence, oscillations, ocular alignment, and smooth pursuit); some were especially challenging (vestibulo-ocular reflex [VOR], VOR suppression, and optokinetic nystagmus). Clinicians noted that virtual health visits were limited by patient preparation, inability to perform certain parts of the examination (funduscopy and pupils), and technological issues. CONCLUSIONS: Among virtual neuro-ophthalmology visits evaluated, most offer patients with appointments that satisfy their needs. Most physicians in this cohort obtained adequate clinical information for decision-making. Even better technology and instructions may help improve aspects of virtual health visits.","Conway, Jenna; Krieger, Penina; Hasanaj, Lisena; Sun, Linus; Scharf, Jackson M; Odel, Jeffrey G; Dinkin, Marc J; Oliveira, Cristiano; Mackay, Devin D; Rasool, Nailyn; Ko, Melissa; Rucker, Janet C; Galetta, Steven L; Balcer, Laura J",J Neuroophthalmol,703,25

METHODS: This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. RESULTS: Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised β = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001).

With an urgent need to slow viral transmission, lessen disease severity, and reduce mortality, biopharmaceutical companies rapidly began investigating potential COVID-19 vaccinations. While typical vaccine development can take upwards of 10–15 years, COVID-19 vaccines were developed in less than a year after the identification of COVID-19. To accomplish this feat, clinical development, manufacturing scale-up and distribution are occurring in parallel for the four COVID-19 vaccine front-runners. This remarkable opportunity will forever change the drug development process and would not be possible without tremendous dedication from the public and private sectors, researchers, and clinical trial volunteers. However, many challenges still lie ahead. Comprehensive plans for equitable vaccine education, distribution, administration and post-marketing surveillance must be implemented successfully to overcome vaccine hesitancy, supply-chain obstacles and healthcare provider shortages in an already overburdened healthcare system. We are moving forward at a remarkable pace but worldwide immunity through vaccination will take time to achieve. Thus, current prevention efforts of masking, hand hygiene and social distancing must remain in effect for the foreseeable future. We must remain diligent and not fatigue in our efforts.

Here, we developed a high-content screening for the antiviral candidates using fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in Vero E6 cells coupled with plaque reduction assay. Among 122 Thai natural products, we found that Boesenbergia rotunda extract and its phytochemical compound, panduratin A, exhibited the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Treatment with B. rotunda extract and panduratin A after viral infection drastically suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 cells with IC(50) of 3.62 μg/mL (CC(50) = 28.06 µg/mL) and 0.81 μΜ (CC(50) = 14.71 µM), respectively. Also, the treatment of panduratin A at the pre-entry phase inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC(50) of 5.30 µM (CC(50) = 43.47 µM). Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that panduratin A exerts the inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection at both pre-entry and post-infection phases. Apart from Vero E6 cells, treatment with this compound was able to suppress viral infectivity in human airway epithelial cells. This result confirmed the potential of panduratin A as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in the major target cells in human.

AIMS: The aim of the present work was to understand the underlying disease profile and dynamics that could provide relevant inputs and insight into pathophysiology and prevent further spread and evolve management strategies of COVID-19 patients from data-driven techniques. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A retrospective observational descriptive study was conducted on 29 COVID-19 patients admitted at a premier medical institution of North India in the months of February and March 2020. METHODS: The patients were diagnosed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. RESULTS: The mean age of population was 38.8 years with male preponderance, of which two patients were residents of Italy, and others hailed from semi-arid and Western sandy arid regions of Rajasthan (urban population). The major presenting symptom complex of said COVID-19 sample population included fever (48%), cough (31%), and shortness of breath (17%). Most of the patients (83%) had no comorbidity. No clinical correlation (r) could be appreciated between the duration of test positivity and age of afflicted COVID-19 patients (r = −0.0976).

Insulin resistance (IR) may develop in different tissues, but the severity of IR may differ in key metabolic organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that these distinct tissue-specific IR phenotypes may also respond differentially to dietary macronutrient composition with respect to improvements in glucose metabolism. Objective: The main objective of the PERSON study is to investigate the effects of an optimal vs. suboptimal dietary macronutrient intervention according to tissue-specific IR phenotype on glucose metabolism and other health outcomes. Methods: In total, 240 overweight/obese (BMI 25 – 40 kg/m(2)) men and women (age 40 – 75 years) with either skeletal muscle insulin resistance (MIR) or liver insulin resistance (LIR) will participate in a two-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel, 12-week dietary intervention study. At screening, participants undergo a 7-point oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine the hepatic insulin resistance index (HIRI) and muscle insulin sensitivity index (MISI), classifying each participant as either “No MIR/LIR,” “MIR,” “LIR,” or “combined MIR/LIR.” Individuals with MIR or LIR are randomized to follow one of two isocaloric diets varying in macronutrient content and quality, that is hypothesized to be either an optimal or suboptimal diet, depending on their tissue-specific IR phenotype (MIR/LIR). Extensive measurements in a controlled laboratory setting as well as phenotyping in daily life are performed before and after the intervention. The primary study outcome is the difference in change in disposition index, which is the product of insulin sensitivity and first-phase insulin secretion, between participants who received their hypothesized optimal or suboptimal diet. Discussion: The PERSON study is one of the first randomized clinical trials in the field of precision nutrition to test effects of a more personalized dietary intervention based on IR phenotype. The results of the PERSON study will contribute knowledge on the effectiveness of targeted nutritional strategies to the emerging field of precision nutrition, and improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of whole body and tissue-specific IR.

Infection usually leads to an acute, often lethal diarrhea in piglets. Despite the impact of the disease, no system is yet available to manipulate the viral genome which has severely hampered research on this virus until today. We have established a reverse genetics system for PEDV based on targeted RNA recombination that allows the modification of the 3′-end of the viral genome, which encodes the structural proteins and the ORF3 protein. Using this system, we deleted the ORF3 gene entirely from the viral genome and showed that the ORF3 protein is not essential for replication of the virus in vitro. In addition, we inserted heterologous genes (i.e. the GFP and Renilla luciferase genes) at two positions in the viral genome, either as an extra expression cassette or as a replacement for the ORF3 gene. We demonstrated the expression of both GFP and Renilla luciferase as well as the application of these viruses by establishing a convenient and rapid virus neutralization assay. The new PEDV reverse genetics system will enable functional studies of the structural proteins and the accessory ORF3 protein and will allow the rational design and development of next generation PEDV vaccines.","Li, Chunhua; Li, Zhen; Zou, Yong; Wicht, Oliver; van Kuppeveld, Frank J.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study using the National Emergency Department Information System (NEDIS) database in Korea. The study population was defined as patients who visited all 402 EDs with medical conditions other than injuries between January 27 and May 31, 2020 (after-COVID) and for the corresponding time period in 2019 (before-COVID). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The main exposure was the COVID-19 outbreak, and the interaction variable was county per capita income tax. We calculated the risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality rates by COVID-19 outbreak, as well as the difference-in-difference of risk-adjusted rates between the before-COVID and after-COVID groups according to the county income tax using a multilevel linear regression model with the interaction term. RESULTS: A total of 11,662,167 patients (6,765,717 in before-COVID and 4,896,450 in after-COVID) were included in the study with a 1.6% crude in-hospital mortality rate. The risk-adjusted mortality rate in the after-COVID group was higher than that in the before-COVID group (1.82% vs. 1.50%, difference: 0.31% [0.30 to 0.33]; adjusted odds ratio: 1.22 [1.18 to 1.25]). The excess in-hospital mortality rate of the after-COVID in the lowest quartile group of county income tax was significantly higher than that in the highest quartile group (difference-in-difference: 0.18% (0.14 to 0.23); P-for-interaction: < 0.01). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was excess in-hospital mortality among patients who visited EDs, and there were disparities in excess mortality depending on community socioeconomic positions.","Jung, Eujene; Ro, Young Sun; Ryu, Hyun Ho; Shin, Sang Do; Moon, Sungwoo",J Korean Med Sci,703,16

However, empirical investigations of resilience in healthcare (RiH) remain uncommon, particularly those that examine how government actions contribute to the capacity for resilient performance in the healthcare setting. We sought to investigate how governmental actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic related to the concept of resilience, how these actions contributed to the potential for resilient performance in healthcare, and what opportunities exist for governments to foster resilience within healthcare systems. METHODS We conducted case studies of government actions pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada. Using media releases issued by each government between December 2019 and August 2020, we performed qualitative content analysis to identify themes relevant to the resilience potentials (anticipate, monitor, respond, learn) and RiH. RESULTS Direct references to the term 'resilience' appeared in the media releases of both governments. However, these references focused on the reactive aspects of resilience. While actions that constitute the resilience potentials were evident, the media releases also revealed opportunities to enhance learning (eg, a need to capitalize on opportunities for double-loop learning and identify strategies appropriate for complex systems) and anticipating (eg, incorporating the concept of hedging into frameworks of RiH). CONCLUSION Though fostering RiH through government action remains a challenge, this study suggests opportunities to realize this goal. Articulating a proactive vision of resilience and recognizing the complex nature of current systems could enhance governments' ability to coordinate resilient performance in healthcare. Reflection on how anticipation relates to resilience appears necessary at both the practical and conceptual levels to further develop the capacity for RiH.","Smaggus, Andrew; Long, Janet C; Ellis, Louise A; Clay-Williams, Robyn; Braithwaite, Jeffrey",International journal of health policy and management,703,20

OA and T2D have common epidemiologic traits, are considered heterogenic multifactorial pathologies that develop through the interaction of genetic and environmental factors, and have common risk factors. In addition, both of these diseases often manifest in a single patient. Despite differences in clinical manifestations, both diseases are characterized by disturbances in cellular metabolism and by an insulin-resistant state primarily associated with the production and utilization of energy. However, currently, the primary cause of OA development and progression is not clear. In addition, although OA is manifested as a joint disease, evidence has accumulated that it affects the whole body. As pathological insulin resistance is viewed as a driving force of T2D development, now, we present evidence that the molecular and cellular metabolic disturbances associated with OA are linked to an insulin-resistant state similar to T2D. Moreover, the alterations in cellular energy requirements associated with insulin resistance could affect many metabolic changes in the body that eventually result in pathology and could serve as a unified mechanism that also functions in many metabolic diseases. However, these issues have not been comprehensively described. Therefore, here, we discuss the basic molecular mechanisms underlying the pathological processes associated with the development of insulin resistance; the major inducers, regulators, and metabolic consequences of insulin resistance; and instruments for controlling insulin resistance as a new approach to therapy.","Tchetina, Elena V; Markova, Galina A; Sharapova, Eugeniya P",J Nutr Metab,703,29

We also administered some items related to feelings and behaviors during lockdown. The results showed that sex and age are variables to be taken into account. In fact, women tended to show greater stress, a more pessimistic attitude, and lower self-esteem. However, older people adapted better to lockdown although they were also more worried. Married people also adapted better although they too were more worried. The results also showed that more resilient people, with higher subjective happiness and life satisfaction, develop strategies for adapting positively to adversity, and tend to adapt better to lockdown, with more positive attitudes and behaviors. In terms of personality traits, higher neuroticism and lower extraversion were related to worse adaptation to lockdown.

Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV), transmitted by WBPH, has become a great threat to rice production in East Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: By de novo transcriptome assembling and massive parallel pyrosequencing, we constructed two transcriptomes of WBPH and profiled the alternation of gene expression in response to SRBSDV infection in transcriptional level. Over 25 million reads of high-quality DNA sequences and 81388 different unigenes were generated using Illumina technology from both viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH. WBPH has a very similar gene ontological distribution to other two closely related rice planthoppers, Nilaparvata lugens and Laodelphax striatellus. 7291 microsatellite loci were also predicted which could be useful for further evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes generated from viruliferous and non-viruliferous WBPH provided a list of candidate transcripts that potentially were elicited as a response to viral infection. Pathway analyses of a subset of these transcripts indicated that SRBSDV infection may perturb primary metabolism and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways. In addition, 5.5% (181 out of 3315) of the genes in cell cytoskeleton organization pathway showed obvious changes. Our data also demonstrated that SRBSDV infection activated the immunity regulatory systems of WBPH, such as RNA interference, autophagy and antimicrobial peptide production. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We employed massively parallel pyrosequencing to collect ESTs from viruliferous and non-viruliferous samples of WBPH. 81388 different unigenes have been obtained.

The scale and determinants of antibiotic use in the early phase of the pandemic, and whether antibiotic prescribing is beneficial to treatment effectiveness in COVID-19 patients, are still unknown. Unwarranted treatment of this viral infection with antibiotics may exacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance, while antibiotic resistance may render presumptive treatment of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients ineffective. Methods: This rapid review was undertaken to identify studies reporting antimicrobial use in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The review was conducted to comply with PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews (http://www.prisma-statement.org/Extensions/ScopingReviews) and the protocol was registered with the Open Science Framework (OSF): http://osf.io/vp6t5. The following databases: Web of Science, EMBASE, PubMed, CNKI & VIP were searched to identify the relevant studies from 1 Dec 2019 up to 15 June 2020; no limits were set on the language or the country where studies were conducted. The search terms used were: ((Covid-19 or SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus disease 2019 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) and ((antibiotic prescribing or antibiotic use or antibiotic*) or antimicrobial* or antimicrobial therapy or antimicrobial resistance or antimicrobial stewardship)). A total of 1216 records were identified through database searching and 118 clinical studies met the inclusion criteria and were taken into data extraction. A bespoke data extraction form was developed and validated through two independent, duplicate extraction of data from five Records. As all the included studies were descriptive in nature, we conducted descriptive synthesis of data and reported pooled estimates such as mean, percentage and frequency. We created a series of scenarios to capture the range of rationales for antibiotic prescribing presented in the included studies. Results: Our results show that during the early phase of the pandemic, 8501 out of 10 329 COVID-19 patients (82.3%) were prescribed antibiotics; antibiotics were prescribed for COVID-19 patients regardless of reported severity, with a similar mean antibiotic prescribing rate between patients with severe or critical illness (75.4%) and patients with mild or moderate illness (75.1%). The top five frequently prescribed antibiotics for hospitalised COVID-19 patients were azithromycin (28.0 % of studies), ceftriaxone (17.8%), moxifloxacin (14.4%), meropenem (14.4%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.7%). The proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics without clinical justification was 51.5% vs 41.9 % for patients with mild or moderate illness and those with severe or critical illness respectively. Comparison of patients who were provided antibiotics with a clinical justification with those who were given antibiotics without clinical justification showed lower mortality rates (9.5% vs 13.1%), higher discharge rates (80.9% vs 69.3%) and shorter length of hospital of stay (9.3 days vs 12.2 days). Only 9.7% of patients in our included studies were reported to have secondary infections. Conclusions: Antibiotics were prescribed indiscriminately for hospitalised COVID-19 patients regardless of severity of illness during the early phase of the pandemic. COVID-19 related concerns and lack of knowledge drove a large proportion of antibiotic use without specific clinical justification. Although we are still in the midst of the pandemic, the goals of antimicrobial stewardship should remain unchanged for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Cong, W.; Poudel, N.; Alhusein, N.; Wang, H.; Yao, G.; Lambert, H.",,703,17

We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics of these recurrent-positive patients. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 15 recurrent-positive patients and 107 control patients with non-recurrent, moderate COVID-19 treated in Wuhan, China. Clinical data and laboratory results were comparatively analyzed. We found that recurrent-positive patients had moderate disease. The rate of recurrent-positive disease in our hospital was 1.87%. Recurrent-positive patients were significantly younger (43(35-54) years) than control patients (60(43-69) years) (P=0.011). The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (36(34-45) days) than in control patients (15(7-30) days) (P =0.001). The time required for the first conversion of RT-PCR results from positive to negative was significantly longer in recurrent-positive patients (14(10-17) days) than in control patients (6(3-9) days) (P =0.011). Serum COVID-19 antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive patients than in control patients (IgM: 13.69 {+/-} 4.38 vs. 68.10 {+/-} 20.85 AU/mL, P = 0.015; IgG: 78.53 {+/-} 9.30 vs. 147.85 {+/-} 13.33 AU/mL, P < 0.0001). Recurrent-positive patients were younger than control patients. The early LOS (length of stay in hospital before recurrence) was significantly longer in recurrent-positive group than that in control group. COVID-19 IgM/IgG antibody levels were significantly lower in recurrent-positive group than those in control group, which might explain why the virus RNA RT-PCR was positive after the initial clinical cure(with three times of virus RNA RT-PCR negative). The virus might not be fully eliminated because of the lower IgG level and their later replicating might result in recurrent-positive virus RNA RT-PCR.","Chen, L.; Zhang, Z.-Y.; Zhang, X.-B.; Zhang, S.-Z.; Han, Q.-Y.; Feng, Z.-P.; Fu, J.-G.; Xiao, X.; Chen, H.-M.; Liu, L.-L.; Chen, X.-L.; Lan, Y.-P.; Zhong, D.-J.; Hu, L.; Wang, J.-H.; Yin, Z.-Y.",,703,19

This prospective study included 75 patients who completed a patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among these, 46 patients completed an olfactory evaluation based on the duration of anosmia and dysgeusia. The olfactory evaluation revealed that 24% (N=18) of patients had mild hyposmia, 13% (N=10) had moderate hyposmia, 30% (N=23) had severe hyposmia, 32% (N=24) had anosmia, and 100% had dysgeusia (N=75). The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 17 days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. The purpose of this study was to understand whether patients with COVID-19 can recover olfactory and gustatory function, in contrast to patients with other rhinoviruses and inflammatory diseases such as rhinosinusitis chronic and rhinosinusitis with polyps. These preliminary clinical findings indicate that the relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients. The present study suggests that coronavirus can induce olfactory dysfunction but not permanent damage. Olfactory and gustatory functional impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of COVID-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. Our study supports the need to add anosmia and dysgeusia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection.","Paolo, Gamba",Med Hypotheses,703,26

The aim of this paper is to describe the development of a state-based self-harm monitoring system in Victoria, Australia. In this system, data on all self-harm presentations are collected from eight hospital emergency departments in Victoria. A natural language processing classifier that uses machine learning to identify episodes of self-harm is currently being developed. This uses the free-text triage case notes, together with certain structured data fields, contained within the metadata of the incoming records. Post-processing is undertaken to identify primary mechanism of injury, substances consumed (including alcohol, illicit drugs and pharmaceutical preparations) and presence of psychiatric disorders. This system will ultimately leverage routinely collected data in combination with advanced artificial intelligence methods to support robust community-wide monitoring of self-harm. Once fully operational, this system will provide accurate and timely information on all presentations to participating emergency departments for self-harm, thereby providing a useful indicator for Australia’s suicide prevention efforts.","Robinson, Jo; Witt, Katrina; Lamblin, Michelle; Spittal, Matthew J.; Carter, Greg; Verspoor, Karin; Page, Andrew; Rajaram, Gowri; Rozova, Vlada; Hill, Nicole T.

In this Personal View, we review data supporting the importance of the viral inoculum (the dose of viral particles from an infected source over time) in increasing the probability of infection in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted viral infections in humans. We also review the available evidence linking the relationship of the viral inoculum to disease severity. Non-pharmaceutical interventions might reduce the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing the viral inoculum when there is exposure to an infectious source. Data from physical sciences research suggest that masks protect the wearer by filtering virus from external sources, and others by reducing expulsion of virus by the wearer. Social distancing, handwashing, and improved ventilation also reduce the exposure amount of viral particles from an infectious source. Maintaining and increasing non-pharmaceutical interventions can help to quell SARS-CoV-2 as we enter the second year of the pandemic. Finally, we argue that even as safe and effective vaccines are being rolled out, non-pharmaceutical interventions will continue to play an essential role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission until equitable and widespread vaccine administration has been completed.","Spinelli, Matthew A; Glidden, David V; Gennatas, Efstathios D; Bielecki, Michel; Beyrer, Chris; Rutherford, George; Chambers, Henry; Goosby, Eric; Gandhi, Monica",Lancet Infect Dis,703,16

Domestic dogs are a major reservoir for rabies, and although considerable advances have been made towards the elimination and control of canine rabies in many parts of the world, the disease continues to kill tens of thousands of people every year in Africa and Asia. Policy efforts are now being directed towards a global target of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030 and the global elimination of canine rabies. Here we demonstrate how research provides a cause for optimism as to the feasibility of these goals through strategies based around mass dog vaccination. We summarize some of the pragmatic insights generated from rabies epidemiology and dog ecology research that can improve the design of dog vaccination strategies in low- and middle-income countries and which should encourage implementation without further delay. We also highlight the need for realism in reaching the feasible, although technically more difficult and longer-term goal of global elimination of canine rabies. Finally, we discuss how research on rabies has broader relevance to the control and elimination of a suite of diseases of current concern to human and animal health, providing an exemplar of the value of a ‘One Health’ approach.","Cleaveland, Sarah; Hampson, Katie",Proc Biol Sci,703,30

A potential mechanism to protect this population could be provided by passive immunity through the milk of a previously infected mother. We and others have reported on the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in human milk (2-5). We now report the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgA in the milk of 75 COVID-19-recovered participants, and find that 88% of samples are positive for Spike-specific IgA. In a subset of these samples, 95% exhibited robust IgA activity as determined by endpoint binding titer, with 50% considered high-titer. These IgA positive specimens were also positive for Spike-specific antibodies bearing the secretory component. Levels of IgA antibodies and antibodies bearing secretory component were shown to be strongly positively correlated. The secretory IgA response was dominant among the milk samples tested compared to the IgG response, which was present in 75% of samples and found to be of high-titer in only 13% of cases. Our IgA durability analysis using 28 paired samples, obtained 4-6 weeks and 4-10 months after infection, found that all samples exhibited persistently significant Spike-specific IgA, with 43% of donors exhibiting increasing IgA titers over time. Finally, COVID-19 and pre-pandemic control milk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies; 6 of 8 COVID-19 samples exhibited neutralization of Spike-pseudotyped VSV (IC50 range, 2.39-89.4ug/mL) compared to 1 of 8 controls. IgA binding and neutralization capacities were found to be strongly positively correlated.

This came to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which there were numerous efforts to predict the number of new infections. Various classes of models were employed for forecasting including compartmental models and curve-fitting approaches. Curve fitting models often have accurate short term forecasts. Their parameters, however, can be difficult to associate with actual disease dynamics. Compartmental models take these dynamics into account, allowing for more flexible and interpretable models that facilitate qualitative comparison of scenarios. This paper proposes a method of strengthening the forecasts from compartmental models by using short term pre-dictions from a curve fitting approach as synthetic data. We discuss the method of fitting this hybrid model in a generalized manner without reliance on region specific data, making this approach easy to adapt. The model is compared to a standard approach; differences in performance are analyzed for a diverse set of COVID-19 case counts.","Bannur, N.; Shah, V.; Raval, A.; White, J.",,703,18

We assessed the risks associated with cardiometabolic factors for severe COVID-19 when accounting for socioeconomic factors and in subgroups by age, sex and region of birth. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this nationwide case–control study, 1.086 patients admitted to intensive care with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (cases), and 10.860 population-based controls matched for age, sex and district of residency were included from mandatory national registries. ORs with 95% CIs for associations between severe COVID-19 and exposures with adjustment for confounders were estimated using logistic regression. The median age was 62 years (IQR 52–70), and 3003 (24.9%) were women. Type 2 diabetes (OR, 2.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.7)), hypertension (OR, 1.7 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0)), obesity (OR, 3.1 (95% CI 2.4 to 4.0)) and chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 3.7)) were all associated with severe COVID-19. In the younger subgroup (below 57 years), ORs were significantly higher for all cardiometabolic risk factors. The risk associated with type 2 diabetes was higher in women (p=0.001) and in patients with a region of birth outside European Union(EU) (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Diabetes, obesity and hypertension were all independently associated with severe COVID-19 with stronger associations in the younger population.

The high resistance in the pulmonary circulation, as a result of small vessel thrombosis and hypoxemia, is the major cause of right heart failure associated with a particularly high mortality in severe COVID-19. Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival. Since it was confirmed that the right-sided heart is particularly involved in the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction plays a key role for patient outcome, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) received increasing attention. Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made. The increased use of bedside TTE focused on the right heart could facilitate more personalized management and treatment of hospitalized patients and can contribute towards reducing the high mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Dandel, Michael",Heart Fail Rev,703,29

As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made.

Out of the 28 identified cases, there were three suicide attempts, one homicide‐suicide/pact‐suicide, and 24 suicides spanning 10 countries. Durkheim explained the social causation of suicide and provided a four‐fold suicide typology. The cases were analysed according to their appropriate typology, and classified as egoistic (9), altruistic (3), anomic (8), and fatalistic (8). Durkheim suggests that the rise and fall of suicide rates will depend on the nature of social change. As society is undergoing massive social disruption resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic, suicide rates may increase unless suicide prevention measures align with the current social reconstruction process.","Khan, Anisur Rahman; Shimul, S.M.

The most widely used test for confirmation of COVID-19 is real-time PCR (RT-PCR). This technique uses plastic supplies in its procedures, which are 100% disposable to avoid cross-contamination and biological risks. The scientific community has become increasingly worried because of the environmental impacts associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, such as medical plastic residues. We classified and estimated the amount of plastic residues generated as a consequence of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and analyzed the relationships of the plastics generated with number of confirmed cases, population size, and gross domestic product in each country. We evidenced that the RT-PCR generates 37.27 g of plastic residues per sample. All patients COVID-19 tested with RT-PCR have generated 15,439.59 tons of plastic residue worldwide, until August 2020. The plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests have no relation with size population or gross domestic product of the countries. There is also no relationship between the plastic residues generated by the COVID-19 tests and the confirmed cases. About 97% of the plastic residues from diagnostic tests for coronavirus are incinerated due to their hazardous nature to humans, but toxic chemicals are released into the environment during the process. In the short term, there is a need to reduce plastic waste and improve controls of gas emissions from incineration plants in countries where there is a deficit. In the long term, biodegradable biomedical manufacturing that are free of releasing toxic chemicals when they are incinerated, must be considered.","Celis, José E.; Espejo, Winfred; Paredes-Osses, Esteban; Contreras, Sonia A.; Chiang, Gustavo; Bahamonde, Paulina",Sci Total Environ,703,20

The US recently passed a new sad milestone of 500,000 deaths due to COVID-19, the highest rate anywhere in the world. In response, we have created a rapid-acting, self-sterilizing PPE configurations capable of killing SARS-CoV-2 and other microbes in seconds. The highly active material destroys pathogens faster than any conventional copper configuration. The material maintains its antimicrobial efficacy over sustained use and is shelf stable. We have performed rigorous testing in accordance with guidelines from U.S. governing authorities and believe that the material could offer broad spectrum, non-selective defense against most microbes via integration into masks and other protective equipment. Summary A novel configuration of copper offering continued fast-acting protection against viruses and bacteria, including SARS-CoV-2.","Zinn, Alfred A.; Izadjoo, Mina; Kim, Hosan; Kehn-Hall, Kylene; Woodson, Caitlin; Brody, Rachel L.; Roth, Robert R.; Vega, Agustin; Nguyen, Khanh K.; Ngo, Nhi T.; Zinn, Hannah T.; Panny, Lauren; Flor, Rafaela; Antonopoulos, Nicholas; Stoltenberg, Randall M.",bioRxiv,703,16
