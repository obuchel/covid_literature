1489,1489,1489,Core Self-Evaluations Mediate the Associations of Dispositional Optimism and Life Satisfaction,18.632778,4.072025,2014-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Positive traits, such as life satisfaction, optimism, and core self-evaluation (CSE), have garnered increasing attention from researchers and professionals. However, the trilateral relationship among them remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction and primarily verified the mediator role of CSEs. METHODS: Six hundred thirty college students from two general universities completed a questionnaire packet containing life orientation test–revised (LOT–R), core self-evaluations, and satisfaction with life scale. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the dimension of LOT–R. Bootstrap was used in structural equation modeling to analyze mediation effect. RESULTS: Results revealed that dispositional optimism and core self-evaluations were significantly correlated with life satisfaction. CFA identified the bidimensional structure of dispositional optimism. SEM indicated that core self-evaluations partially mediated the effect of dispositional optimism on life satisfaction. The final model also revealed significant paths from optimism and pessimism to life satisfaction through core-self evaluations. CONCLUSION: The findings extended prior studies and shed light on how dispositional optimism influences life satisfaction. This study provides valuable evidence on how to promote the life satisfaction of human beings in positive psychology. A further study can fully explore the relationship among them in multi-cultural follow-up studies.","Jiang, Wensheng; Li, Fei; Jiang, Haipeng; Yu, Lili; Liu, Wenbo; Li, Qiang; Zuo, Luning",PLoS One,300,1

OBJECTIVE: This review offers a practical framework for practicing intensivists and those following patients after their ICU stay for the identification of cognitive impairment in ICU survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of cognitive impairment in critically ill patients is an important and achievable goal, but overt cognitive impairment remains unrecognized in most cases. However, it can be identified by objective (test scores) or subjective evidence (clinical judgment, patient observation, family interaction).","Gordon, Sharon M.; Jackson, James C.; Ely, E.

Previous neuroimaging studies suggest that aberrant connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and default mode network (DMN) may play a key role in the pathophysiology of TRS. Thus, we aimed to examine the connectivity between the ACC and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of the DMN, computing isolated effective coherence (iCoh), which represents causal effective connectivity. Methods: Resting-state electroencephalogram with 19 channels was acquired from seventeen patients with TRS and thirty patients with non-TRS (nTRS). The iCoh values between the PCC and ACC were calculated using sLORETA software. We conducted four-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for iCoh values with group as a between-subject factor and frequency, directionality, and laterality as within-subject factors and post-hoc independent t-tests. Results: The ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests for the iCoh ratio of directionality from PCC to ACC showed significant findings in delta (t(45) = 7.659, p = 0.008) and theta (t(45) = 8.066, p = 0.007) bands in the left side (TRS < nTRS). Conclusion: Left delta and theta PCC and ACC iCoh ratio may represent a neurophysiological basis of TRS. Given the preliminary nature of this study, these results warrant further study to confirm the importance of iCoh as a clinical indicator for treatment-resistance.","Wada, Masataka; Nakajima, Shinichiro; Tarumi, Ryosuke; Masuda, Fumi; Miyazaki, Takahiro; Tsugawa, Sakiko; Ogyu, Kamiyu; Honda, Shiori; Matsushita, Karin; Kikuchi, Yudai; Fujii, Shinya; Blumberger, Daniel M.; Daskalakis, Zafiris J.; Mimura, Masaru; Noda, Yoshihiro",J Pers Med,300,13

Consequently, IFNλs are important for innate pathogen defense in the lung and intestine. IFNλs also determine the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, with IFNλ4 inhibiting spontaneous clearance of HCV. Because viral clearance is dependent on T cells, we explored if IFNλs can directly bind to and regulate human T cells. We found that human B cells and CD8(+) T cells express the IFNλ receptor and respond to IFNλs, including IFNλ4. IFNλs were not inhibitors but weak stimulators of B- and T-cell responses. Furthermore, IFNλ4 showed neither synergistic nor antagonistic effects in co-stimulatory experiments with IFNλ1 or IFNα. Multidimensional flow cytometry of cells from liver biopsies of hepatitis patients from IFNλ4-producers showed accumulation of activated CD8(+) T cells with a central memory-like phenotype. In contrast, CD8(+) T cells with a senescent/exhausted phenotype were more abundant in IFNλ4–non-producers. It remains to be elucidated how IFNλ4 promotes CD8 T-cell responses and inhibits the host immunity to HCV infections.","Coto-Llerena, Mairene; Lepore, Marco; Spagnuolo, Julian; Di Blasi, Daniela; Calabrese, Diego; Suslov, Aleksei; Bantug, Glenn; Duong, Francois HT; Terracciano, Luigi M; De Libero, Gennaro; Heim, Markus H",Life Sci Alliance,300,1

Often, these treatments need to be taken in social environments like school. Respiratory treatments can foster a feeling of difference and stigmatisation, which negatively impact on the quality of life and adherence to treatment. Such perceptions can lead to a less than optimal disease control, a vicious cycle leading to further social exclusion and stigma. This aspect of “burden of treatment” is poorly recognised by clinicians. Recognition of how treatments and clinical practice can contribute to stigma, can help address this burden of care. EDUCATIONAL AIMS: To understand the meaning of the term “stigma” within the context of respiratory health conditions and how medication or treatments can contribute to stigma in children and young people. To understand the potential impact of stigma on adherence, disease control and quality of life. To consider strategies to manage the stigma associated with health treatments across spheres of influence.","Kansra, Sonal; Calvert, Rachel; Jones, Steve",Breathe (Sheff),300,1

We sought to evaluate the electrolyte profile and clinical outcomes associated with a unit-wide transition from saline to balanced fluids for resuscitation and maintenance fluids in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). METHODS: A before and after analysis of all patients admitted to the PICU in a large, urban, academic hospital between August 2018 and March 2020. The transition from the use of saline to the use of balanced fluids for both resuscitation and maintenance fluid as standard care occurred in June 2019. The primary outcome was day 3 acute kidney injury (AKI). The secondary outcomes included mortality, ventilator-free days (VFDs), need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), hospital length of stay (LOS), and electrolyte abnormalities. RESULTS: Overall, 2863 patients (47% female) with a day 3 AKI rate of 12.9% (n = 130) and a mortality rate of 2.8% (n = 79) were included. After adjusting for confounders (age, PRISM III, mechanical ventilation, and immunocompromised state, septic shock), there were no significant differences in the odds of day 3 AKI (pre 13%, post 12.5%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.96, 95%CI 0.65–1.42). There were no differences in the secondary outcomes. The post-intervention period had fewer patients with hyperchloremia (pre 15.5% vs. post 10.4%, p = < 0.0001) and hyperkalemia (pre 3.2% vs. post 1.4%, p = 0.02) and more patients with hypochloremia (pre 9.5% vs. post 14.4%, p = < 0.0001) and hypokalemia (pre 38.2% vs. post 47.2%, p = < 0.0001). In reference to the normochloremic cohort, the hypochloremic cohort had an increase in day 3 AKI, need for RRT, hyperchloremia, and hyperkalemia, and a decrease in hypokalemia; and the hyperchloremic cohort had an increase in VFD and a decrease in hospital LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Following a unit-wide implementation of balanced fluids as standard care, there were no differences in rates of day 3 AKI or other clinical outcomes. However, there were lower rates of hyperkalemia and hyperchloremia and higher rates of hypokalemia and hypochloremia. Further evaluation of the effect of balanced fluids and the clinical significance of electrolyte abnormalities in critically ill children is needed.

Phosphorylation at various sites on NLRP3 differentially regulates inflammasome activation. The Ser725 phosphorylation site on NLRP3 is depicted in multiple inflammasome activation scenarios, but the importance and regulation of this site has not been clarified. The present study revealed that the phosphorylation of Ser725 was an essential step for the priming of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. We also showed that Ser725 was directly phosphorylated by misshapen (Msn)/NIK-related kinase 1 (MINK1), depending on the direct interaction between MINK1 and the NLRP3 LRR domain. MINK1 deficiency reduced NLRP3 activation and suppressed inflammatory responses in mouse models of acute sepsis and peritonitis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) upregulated the kinase activity of MINK1 and subsequently promoted inflammasome priming via NLRP3 Ser725 phosphorylation. Eliminating ROS suppressed NLRP3 activation and reduced sepsis and peritonitis symptoms in a MINK1-dependent manner. Altogether, our study reveals a direct regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Msn family kinase MINK1 and suggests that modulation of MINK1 activity is a potential intervention strategy for inflammasome-related diseases.","Zhu, Kaixiang; Jin, Xuexiao; Chi, Zhexu; Chen, Sheng; Wu, Songquan; Sloan, Richard D.; Lin, Xuai; Neculai, Dante; Wang, Di; Hu, Hu; Lu, Linrong",Cell Mol Immunol,300,22

NASA’s reference mission to Mars is expected to comprise 1100 days. Deep space exploratory class missions could even span decades. They will be the most challenging and dangerous expeditions in the history of human spaceflight and will expose crew members to unprecedented health and performance risks. The development of adverse cognitive or behavioral conditions and psychiatric disorders during those missions is considered a critical and unmitigated risk factor. Here, we argue that spatial cognition, i.e., the ability to encode representations about self-to-object relations and integrate this information into a spatial map of the environment, and their neural bases will be highly vulnerable during those expeditions. Empirical evidence from animal studies shows that social isolation, immobilization, and altered gravity can have profound effects on brain plasticity associated with spatial navigation. We provide examples from historic spaceflight missions, spaceflight analogs, and extreme environments suggesting that spatial cognition and its neural circuitry could be impaired during long-duration spaceflight, and identify recommendations and future steps to mitigate these risks.","Stahn, Alexander C.; Kühn, Simone",Cogn Process,300,1

Moreover, the greater incidences of cross contamination and overuse of drugs has contributed towards the development of drug resistant microbial strains making conditions even worse. Hospital acquired infections pose one of the leading complications associated with implantation of any biomaterial after surgery and critical care. In this regard, developing non-conventional antimicrobial agents which would prevent the aforementioned causes is under the quest. The rapid development in nanoscience and nanotechnology has shown promising potential for developing novel biocidal agents that would integrate with a biomaterial to prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. Metals with inherent antimicrobial properties such as silver, copper, zinc at nano scale constitute a special class of antimicrobials which have broad spectrum antimicrobial nature and pose minimum toxicity to humans. Hence, novel biomaterials that inhibit microbial growth would be of great significance to eliminate medical device/instruments associated infections. This chapter comprises the state-of-art advancements in the development of nano-antimicrobial biomaterials for biomedical applications. Several strategies have been targeted to satisfy few important concern such as enhanced long term antimicrobial activity and stability, minimize leaching of antimicrobial material and promote reuse. The proposed strategies to develop new hybrid antimicrobial biomaterials would offer a potent antibacterial solution in healthcare sector such as wound healing applications, tissue scaffolds, medical implants, surgical devices and instruments.","Agnihotri, Shekhar; Dhiman, Navneet Kaur",Advances in Biomaterials for Biomedical Applications,300,1

This work has strong implications for economic analysis of law, cost–benefit analysis, and regulatory policy. In light of behavioral findings, regulators should adopt a working presumption in favor of respect for people’s self-regarding choices, but only if those choices are adequately informed and sufficiently free from behavioral biases. The working presumption should itself be rebuttable on welfare grounds, with an understanding that the ends that people choose might make their lives go less well. For example, people might die prematurely or suffer from serious illness, and what they receive in return might not (on any plausible account of welfare) be nearly enough. The underlying reason might involve a lack of information or a behavioral bias, identifiable or not, in which case intervention can fit with the working presumption, but the real problem might involve philosophical questions about the proper understanding of welfare, and about what it means for people to have a good life.","Sunstein, Cass R.",,300,24

The measure is based on the analysis of the image by using gradient methods. The number of isolated peaks in the examined image, as a function of the threshold value, is the basis of the assessment of the image quality. It turns out that for higher quality images the curvature of the graph of the said function has a higher value for lower threshold values. On the basis of the observed property, a new method of no-reference image quality assessment has been created. The experimental verification confirmed the method efficiency. The correlation between the arrangement depending on the image quality done by an expert and by using the proposed method is equal to 0.74. This means that the proposed method gives a correlation of higher than the best methods described in the literature. The proposed measure is useful to maximize the image quality while minimizing the time of medical examination.","Bielecka, Marzena; Bielecki, Andrzej; Obuchowicz, Rafał; Piórkowski, Adam",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,300,24

This focus often presents footballers in an unflattering light. However, the purpose of this article is to demonstrate that the issues regarding athlete image rights are generally not due to overly sophisticated or overt actions by footballers and/or their agents but are the consequence of a convoluted system of taxation. Ultimately, HMRC guidance allows athletes to exploit an ‘image right’ to make tax savings. This ‘image right’ does not exist in law. Thus, this article will show that the current controversy surrounding footballers and their tax affairs is not a novel concept and that in the context of image rights athletes, clubs and agents have been forced to navigate a system of tax which is confusing, at best. In short, the issues surrounding footballers and image rights are due to the fact that ‘image rights’ are protected in one area of law yet do not exist in another.","Carrick, Sarah",Int Sports Law J,300,17

To address the COVID-19 pandemic, we supplemented the existing interview about everyday cognition with several questions about the dyadic experience during the pandemic. To date, we have conducted 5 qualitative interviews with dyads. Preliminary results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has created additional everyday challenges and cognitive burden for care partners of people diagnosed with aMCI. Some of these challenges include the need to manage pandemic precautionary behaviors, such as mask wearing and maintaining social distancing, for both themselves and the care recipient. In contrast, some aspects of everyday remembering among these dyads have improved (e.g. more advance planning of things like grocery shopping and outings). The results of these interviews will provide additional unique insights into the everyday cognitive challenges of the pandemic on caregivers and persons with aMCI.","Lustig, Emily; Naran, Alysha; Pearman, Ann; Hertzog, Christopher",Innov Aging,300,10

The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of the COVID-19 on dementia caregivers. Study participants were recruited from parent study, the Healthy Patterns Clinical Trial (Hodgson; R01NR015226). Data were collected from June 13th to August 28th, 2020 via semi-structured telephone interviews. Thirty-four dementia caregivers participated in this study. Mean caregiver age was 59.2±12.7.

This represents a defining empirical trend: a rewealthization (from the French repatrimonialisation)—or the comeback of (inherited) wealth primacy since the mid-1990s. For the sociology of social stratification, “occupational classes” based on jobs worked must now be understood within a context of wealth-based domination. This paper first illustrates important empirical features of an era of rising WIR. We then outline the theory of rewealthization as a major factor of class transformations in relation to regimes stabilized in the post-WWII industrial area. Compared to the period where wealth became secondary to education and earnings for middle-class lifestyles, rewealthization steepens society's vertical structure; the ""olive-shaped"" Western society is replaced by a new one where wealth ""abundance"" at the top masks social reproduction and frustrations below.

It highlights the regulating and controlling function of the app, whose algorithm calculates the most convenient matching of drivers, restaurants and consumers. The app increases the distance between workers and employers, thus further limiting the ways in which drivers can access their employers. This restricts the possibilities of individual or collective negotiation of working conditions. Drivers do however develop local practices of withdrawal from constant control through the app, for example, by establishing independent forms of communication or by campaigning for workers’ councils.","Plöger, Jörg; Keuneke, Florin",Standort,300,1

It can also be applied to examine how everyday challenges and problems are dealt with, for example in the educational and university context. This raises the question of whether resilience and academic success are correlated. Using German longitudinal data including university and university of applied sciences students in their first four years (2010–2015) we investigate how resilience and various measurements of success (satisfaction, intention to drop out, grades) are correlated using multilevel growth-curve models. We demonstrate that resilient individuals have consistently more positive academic trajectories, have lower dropout intentions, report better grades and are more satisfied with their lives. The effects are exceptionally stable over time, statistically highly significant and of considerable magnitude. This demonstrates that resilience is associated with better outcomes in university students under control of a large number of potential confounding factors and influences.","Bittmann, Felix",SN Soc Sci,300,1

This includes updates on initiation of feeding, immunonutrition, and metabolic substrates including ketogenic diet, cerebral microdialysis (CMD) monitoring, and the microbiome. RECENT FINDINGS: Little evidence exists to support differences in feeding practices among the neurocritical care population. New areas of interest with limited data include use of immunonutrition, pre/probiotics for microbiome manipulation, ketogenic diet, and use of CMD catheters for substrate utilization monitoring. SUMMARY: Acute neurologic injury incites a cascade of adrenergic and neuroendocrine events resulting in a pro-inflammatory and hypercatabolic state, which is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Nutritional support provides substrates to mitigate the damaging effects of hypermetabolism. Despite this practice, studies on feeding delivery outcomes remain inconsistent. Guidelines suggest use of early enteral nutrition using standard polymeric formulas. Population heterogeneity, variability in interventions, complexities of the metabolic and inflammatory responses, and paucity of nutrition research in patients requiring neurocritical care have led to controversies in the field. It is imperative that more pragmatic and reproducible research be conducted to better understand underlying pathophysiology and develop interventions that may improve outcomes.","Tavarez, Tachira; Roehl, Kelly; Koffman, Lauren",Curr Treat Options Neurol,300,33

Today’s online platforms enable animal activism on a networked scale, with unprecedented reach and immediacy of impact, but also with risks and challenges. This article presents findings from a critical case study of the radical recordkeeping of Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), a US-based animal liberation group. The case study explores the performative role recordkeeping plays in the group’s animal activism and advocacy, and the challenge of ensuring the longevity of an archival record of its activities and their impact. It is framed by Records Continuum Theory and illustrates the benefits of applying a Records Continuum lens to researching radical recordkeeping contexts. The paper reports on the research findings of the case study, including the vital role recordkeeping plays as a form of “strategic witnessing” for the activities of DxE, as well as in developing the DxE community and communicating its mission to the public. It discusses the challenges faced by DxE in preserving their archives into the future through integrating archiving into their current radical recordkeeping processes, Continuum-style, and addressing the risks associated with using online collaborative platforms for recordkeeping and archiving. Overcoming these challenges will ensure that current recordkeeping plays its part in DxE’s animal activism, and that in the future records of continuing value take their place among the multiple narratives of society in the archival multiverse.","Jarvie, Katherine; Evans, Joanne; McKemmish, Sue",Arch Sci,300,1

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which mainly targets toll-like receptor-7 (TLR-7) and TLR-9, is associated with a lower risk of incident CKD. Taking into account that TLR-9 is involved in the development of renal fibrosis and serves as a potential therapy target for CKD, we investigated whether HCQ could attenuate CKD via TLR-9 signal pathway. The effects of HCQ on renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis were further explored using a mouse model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated to explore the effects of HCQ in vitro. Judicious use of HCQ efficiently inhibited the activation of macrophages and MAPK signaling pathways, thereby attenuating renal fibrosis in vivo. In an in vitro model, results showed that HCQ promoted apoptosis of macrophages and inhibited activation of macrophages, especially M2 macrophages, in a dose-dependent manner. Because TLR-7 is not involved in the development of CKD post-injury, a TLR-9 knockout mouse was used to explore the mechanisms of HCQ. The effects of HCQ on renal fibrosis and macrophages decreased after depletion of TLR-9 in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, this study indicated that proper use of HCQ could be a new strategy for anti-fibrotic therapy and that TLR-9 could be a potential therapeutic target for CKD following acute kidney injury.","Zheng, Haofeng; Zhang, Yannan; He, Jiannan; Yang, Zhe; Zhang, Rui; Li, Lei; Luo, Zihuan; Ye, Yongrong; Sun, Qiquan",Front Immunol,300,1

Large-scale deployment of DAC requires serious government, private, and corporate support and investment particularly to offset the capital cost as well as operational costs. Further optimizations to the costs can be found in choice of energy source as well as advances in CO(2) capture technology such as high capacity and selectivity materials, faster reaction kinetics, and ease of reusability. ABSTRACT: Direct air capture (DAC) technologies are receiving increasing attention from the scientific community, commercial enterprises, policymakers and governments. While deep decarbonization of all sectors is required to meet the Paris Agreement target, DAC can help deal with difficult to avoid emissions (aviation, ocean-shipping, iron-steel, cement, mining, plastics, fertilizers, pulp and paper). While large-scale deployment of DAC discussions continues, a closer look to the capital and operational costs, different capture technologies, the choice of energy source, land and water requirements, and other environmental impacts of DAC are reviewed and examined. Cost per ton of CO(2) captured discussions of leading industrial DAC developers with their carbon capture technologies are presented, and their detailed cost comparisons are evaluated based on the choice of energy operation together with process energy requirements. Validation of two active plants’ net negative emission contributions after reducing their own carbon footprint is presented. Future directions and recommendations to lower the current capital and operational costs of DAC are given. In view of large-scale deployment of DAC, and the considerations of high capital costs, private investments, government initiatives, net zero commitments of corporations, and support from the oil companies combined will help increase carbon capture capacity by building more DAC plants worldwide.

In this study we analyse the propensity to stop travelling by public transport during COVID-19 for the holders of 1.8 million smart cards in Stockholm, Sweden, for the spring and autumn of 2020. We suggest two binomial logit models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop travelling. MODELLED VARIABLES: The first model investigates the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age; income; education level; gender; housing type; population density; country of origin; and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to all these factors. The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data, showing the impacts for different socioeconomic groups. During the autumn the differences between the groups diminished, and especially Cluster 1 (with the lowest education levels, lowest income and highest share of immigrants) reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the more affluent clusters. RESULTS: The results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens’ socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.

We hypothesized that the concavity of the inspiratory flow-time waveform could be useful to estimate patient’s inspiratory effort. The purpose of this study was to assess whether the shape of the inspiratory flow, as quantified by a numeric indicator, could be associated with inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation. METHODS: Twenty-four patients in pressure support ventilation were enrolled. A mathematical relationship describing the decay pattern of the inspiratory flow profile was developed. The parameter hypothesized to estimate effort was named Flow Index. Esophageal pressure, airway pressure, airflow, and volume waveforms were recorded at three support levels (maximum, minimum and baseline). The association between Flow Index and reference measures of patient effort (pressure time product and pressure generated by respiratory muscles) was evaluated using linear mixed effects models adjusted for tidal volume, respiratory rate and respiratory rate/tidal volume. RESULTS: Flow Index was different at the three pressure support levels and all group comparisons were statistically significant. In all tested models, Flow Index was independently associated with patient effort (p < 0.001). Flow Index prediction of inspiratory effort agreed with esophageal pressure-based methods. CONCLUSIONS: Flow Index is associated with patient inspiratory effort during pressure support ventilation, and may provide potentially useful information for setting inspiratory support and monitoring patient-ventilator interactions.

The hypoxaemia was corrected utilising positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm – 10 cm H(2)O, a technique that has not previously been reported in the management of anaesthetised elephants. PEEP decreases atelectasis, shunt fraction, and increases lung compliance. Positive end-expiratory pressure was achieved by partial occlusion of the tailpiece of a manually triggered demand valve ventilator during expiration. This is a simple effective method of generating PEEP and correcting hypoxaemia without the need for any additional specialised equipment. However, PEEP decreased arterial blood pressure and should be implemented with caution if arterial blood pressure is not monitored.","Leung, Jessica; Beths, Thierry; Lynch, Michael; Frith, Sarah; Bauquier, Sebastien H.",J S Afr Vet Assoc,300,10

A combination of social, economic and environmental indicators was employed to develop the vulnerability index of each household head and estimate quantitatively that is vulnerability is estimated as a function of adaptive capacity, exposure and sensitivity of households. The results indicated that farmers had poor access to public services including access to affordable credit, market, health services and climate information. The survey revealed that droughts, floods, soil erosion, pests and diseases were climate-related challenges in the study area. Regarding vulnerability of households to climate variability, results indicated that around 8.5% and 18.2% of male- and female-headed households, respectively, were highly vulnerable whilst 41% and 45.5% of male- and female-headed households, respectively, were moderately vulnerable.

This study explores prime GPCR targets of the two phlorotannins. In silico proteocheminformatics modeling predicted twenty major protein targets and in vitro functional assays showed a good agonist effect at the α2C adrenergic receptor (α(2C)AR) and an antagonist effect at the adenosine 2A receptor (A(2A)R), δ-opioid receptor (δ-OPR), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-TH(1A)R) of both phlorotannins.

This study aims to explore the system determinants that impact on rural senior women’s utilization of healthcare. Following a qualitative critical social research design, healthcare staff and senior women living in three rural villages of Bangladesh were approached to participate in face-to-face audio-recorded interviews. A total of 11 staff and 25 senior women were interviewed with questions about health policy, healthcare services and management of aged care. Data was analyzed using a blend of critical discourse and thematic analysis methods. Several healthcare system determinants were identified that were complex and cross-sectional. Three major themes emerged from the system determinants: legal framework of aged care; inadequate healthcare support; and professional knowledge and skills of healthcare staff that led the rural senior women to avoid or delay access to hospitals and clinics. The findings revealed that a lack of health focus and professional skills among healthcare staff can be considered as critical. This study recommends that policy and organizational changes are made to improve the women’s access to rural hospitals and clinics in Bangladesh.","Hamiduzzaman, Mohammad; De Bellis, Anita; Abigail, Wendy",Ageing Int,300,5

It incurred over 28,000 infections and ∼11,000 deaths. Early in this epidemic, several mutations in viral glycoprotein (A82V), nucleoprotein (R111C), and polymerase L (D759G) emerged and stabilized. In vitro studies of these new EBOV-Makona isolates showed enhanced fitness and viral replication capacity. However, in vivo studies in mice and rhesus macaques did not provide any evidence of enhanced viral fitness or shedding. Infection with late isolates carrying or early isolates lacking (early) these mutations resulted in uniformly lethal disease in nonhuman primates (NHPs), albeit with slightly delayed kinetics with late isolates. The recent report of a possible reemergence of EBOV from a persistent infection in a survivor of the epidemic highlights the urgency for understanding the impact of genetic variation on EBOV pathogenesis. However, potential molecular differences in host responses remain unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted the first comparative analysis of the host responses to lethal infection with EBOV-Mayinga and EBOV-Makona isolates using bivariate, longitudinal, regression, and discrimination transcriptomic analyses. Our analysis shows a conserved core of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in antiviral defense, immune cell activation, and inflammatory processes in response to EBOV-Makona and EBOV-Mayinga infections. Additionally, EBOV-Makona and EBOV-Mayinga infections could be discriminated based on the expression pattern of a small subset of genes. Transcriptional responses to EBOV-Makona isolates that emerged later during the epidemic, specifically those from Mali and Liberia, lacked signatures of profound lymphopenia and excessive inflammation seen following infection with EBOV-Mayinga and early EBOV-Makona isolate C07. Overall, these findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying the lower case fatality rate (CFR) observed with EBOV-Makona compared to EBOV-Mayinga.","Maroney, Kevin J.; Pinski, Amanda N.; Marzi, Andrea; Messaoudi, Ilhem",Front Microbiol,300,10

TFBs constitute a core element of the cultural identity of a country, although some of them are losing their appeal. In this study, the authors explored the TFBs perceptions of inhabitants in nine countries to determine if their food identity is changing by analysing the TFBs most frequently mentioned by different age cohorts within a country. Six countries were found to have a distinctive core of TFBs shared across age cohorts (homogenous), whereas the remaining showed a heterogeneous pattern. Correspondence and cluster analyses usually grouped younger generations together implying higher similarities among these cohorts. Furthermore, the binary logistic regression analyses performed identified significant differences in the probability of mentioning a specific TFBs across age cohorts per country. Data collected show younger cohorts focusing on TFBs categorised as snacks and foods on-the-go, whereas older cohorts more often refer to time-consuming savoury preparations. The results suggest that lifestyles and current societal trends in food consumption, for example, convenience and healthiness, are impacting the food culture and identity of countries, and therefore play an important role in the variation of TFBs perception and consumption between age cohorts within countries. The results obtained in this study could not only be used by food policymakers and nutritionists to distinguish the current trends that are reshaping the food identity and eating behaviours of the population but also to improve or develop new dietary strategies by age cohorts in the countries studied.","Frez-Muñoz, Lucía; Kampen, Jarl K.; Fogliano, Vincenzo; Steenbekkers, Bea L.

In Norway, farmed fish and other husbandry animals are legally protected under the same laws. Additionally, the legislature has defined a number of aquaculture-specific amendments, including mandatory welfare courses for fish farmers who have a key role in securing animal welfare, also with regards to noting welfare challenges in the production process. This article uses fish welfare courses as a site from which to inquire about the common-sense understanding of fish welfare in Norwegian fish farming. The focus is specifically on fish farm employees, their experiences of welfare-related issues and contradictions in their daily work, and the struggle to act responsibly in aquaculture settings. Through participant observation at welfare courses, as well as interviews and conversations with fish farm workers, the article details how challenges are experienced ‘on the ground’, and suggests how fish farm workers’ own experiential knowledge might be mobilized to improve the general welfare of farmed fish.","Medaas, Christian; Lien, Marianne E.; Gismervik, Kristine; Kristiansen, Tore S.; Osmundsen, Tonje; Størkersen, Kristine Vedal; Tørud, Brit; Stien, Lars Helge",J Agric Environ Ethics,300,11

The paper studies the associations between the inhabitants’ perceptions of UI and their socio-demographic profile. The city of Thessaloniki is the case study of this research. The research was based on data collection via structured questionnaires, and the results were statistically analyzed using: descriptive statistics, χ(2) analysis, crosstabs method, regression analysis and discriminant analysis. The results show that UI, being a generally unknown term to the public, incorporates the notions of history and culture, urban environment, social behavior and everyday life, and it is influenced by social and economic factors. The perceptions on the city’s identity are associated with gender, age and family status, as well as the way people spend their spare time. It emerges that, in Thessaloniki, a policy mix is necessary to preserve and upgrade the historical assets of the city, along with the improvement of its every day functions.","Anastasiou, Dimitrios; Tasopoulou, Anastasia; Gemenetzi, Georgia; Gareiou, Zoe; Zervas, Efthimios",Urban Des Int,300,2

Understanding the mechanisms of substance use behaviours, including those used to cope with COVID-19-related stressors, is imperative to curate targeted prevention efforts. To that end, we examined substance use prevalence and its associations with socio-demographic characteristics, preventive behaviours, and mental health amongst US social work students. We collected data from 457 students across all degree levels (BSW, MSW and PhD) from July to August 2020 through an online survey, to examine thirty-day patterns of substance use behaviours related to cigarettes, electronic vapour products, alcohol, binge drinking and marijuana. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed high rates of substance use behaviours, particularly alcohol use (71 per cent), binge drinking (35 per cent) and marijuana use (25 per cent). Findings also revealed significant associations amongst substance use, socio-demographic characteristics, and mental health. Amongst other implications, our study should encourage social work programmes to promote positive coping strategies amongst students and foster substance abuse prevention efforts, both to mitigate health risk behaviours and to enhance student well-being, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Youn Kyoung; Moon, Sung Seek; Yu, Mansoo; Um, Mee Young; Maleku, Arati; Kehinde, Omoshola; Pooler, David",Br J Soc Work,300,24

Antimonene is used here as bio-recognition element (BRE) layer to attach the Hb analyte through physical adsorption due to its hydrophilic nature, higher adsorption energy and larger active surface area. The use of BaTiO(3) adlayer (7 nm) just before antimonene is to enhance the refractive index (RI) sensitivity up to 1.90 times for the proposed SPR biosensor. The reason behind sensitivity enhancement is its high dielectric constant which enhances the electromagnetic field with in analyte medium. The performance of the biosensor is demonstrated with performance parameters namely sensitivity, detection accuracy (DA), figure of merit (FOM) and resolution. The proposed biosensor has potential to achieve much higher performance in terms of RI sensitivity of 303.83°/RIU, FOM of 50.39 RIU(−1) and resolution of 0.021 g/l in comparison with reported biosensors in the literature for detection of Hb concentration. Thus, based on the obtained results one can say that the proposed work unlocks a reliable sensing in the field of medical science to detect hemoglobin-related diseases in human being.","Singh, Maneesh Kumar; Pal, Sarika; Verma, Alka; Das, Ritwick; Prajapati, Yogendra Kumar",Appl Phys A Mater Sci Process,300,8

It is not known how such a formation of atelectasis is related to transpulmonary pressure (PL ) during weaning from mechanical ventilation when the spontaneous breathing effort is increased. If the relation between PL and atelectasis were known, monitoring of PL might help to avoid formation of atelectasis and cyclic collapse during weaning. The main purpose of this study was to determine the relation between PL and atelectasis in an experimental model representing weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS Dynamic transverse computed tomography scans were acquired in ten anaesthetized, surfactant-depleted pigs with preserved spontaneous breathing, as ventilator support was lowered by sequentially reducing inspiratory pressure and positive end expiratory pressure in steps. The volumes of gas and atelectasis in the lungs were correlated with PL obtained using oesophageal pressure recordings. Work of breathing (WOB) was assessed from Campbell diagrams. RESULTS Gradual decrease in PL in both end-expiration and end-inspiration caused a proportional increase in atelectasis and decrease in the gas content (linear mixed model with an autoregressive correlation matrix; P < 0.001) as the WOB increased. However, cyclic alveolar collapse during tidal ventilation did not increase significantly. CONCLUSION We found a proportional correlation between atelectasis and PL during the 'weaning process' in experimental mild lung injury. If confirmed in the clinical setting, a gradual tapering of ventilator support can be recommended for weaning without risk of sudden formation of atelectasis.","Gudmundsson, M; Perchiazzi, G; Pellegrini, M; Vena, A; Hedenstierna, G; Rylander, C",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,300,24

Fibrinolytic therapy should always be considered when timely primary PCI cannot be delivered appropriately. Clinicians should promptly recognize the signs of fibrinolytic therapy failure and consider rescue PCI. When fibrinolytics are used, coronary angiography and revascularization should not be conducted within the initial 3 hours after fibrinolytic administration.","Krittanawong, Chayakrit; Hahn, Joshua; Kayani, Waleed; Jneid, Hani",Interventional cardiology clinics,300,5

In 2017, on average, a stroke-related death occurred every 3 minutes and 35 seconds in the United States, and stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability (1). To prevent mortality or long-term disability, strokes require rapid recognition and early medical intervention (2,3). Common stroke signs and symptoms include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side; sudden confusion or trouble speaking; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, or loss of balance; and a sudden severe headache with no known cause. Recommended action at the first sign of a suspected stroke is to quickly request emergency services (i.e., calling 9-1-1) (2). Public education campaigns have emphasized recognizing stroke signs and symptoms and the importance of calling 9-1-1, and stroke knowledge increased 14.7 percentage points from 2009 to 2014 (4). However, disparities in stroke awareness have been reported (4,5). Knowledge of the five signs and symptoms of stroke and the immediate need to call emergency medical services (9-1-1), collectively referred to as ""recommended stroke knowledge,"" was assessed among 26,076 adults aged ≥20 years as part of the 2017 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).

The prevalence of recommended stroke knowledge was highest among non-Hispanic White adults (71.3%), followed by non-Hispanic Black adults (64.0%) and Hispanic adults (57.8%). Stroke knowledge also differed significantly by sex, age, education, and urbanicity. After multivariable adjustment, these differences remained significant. Increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke continues to be a national priority.

To decrease postoperative morbidity and shorten the recovery period, the senior author (J.A.A.) sought a less invasive approach to sternal debridement and flap closure in carefully selected patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by obtaining specific outcomes data from a series of patients treated with this less invasive method. MATERIALS AND METHODS Of the most recent 174 sternal wounds treated by the senior author, 25 underwent limited debridement and partial bilateral pectoralis major advancement flaps. The charts of these 25 patients were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS In the 25 patients who underwent limited debridement, there were no mortalities intraoperatively or during the 30-day postoperative period. Six patients (24%) experienced complications after debridement, including 1 recurrent sternal wound infection, 1 partial wound dehiscence, 1 seroma, 1 hematoma, and 1 wound edge necrosis requiring revision. Mean length of hospitalization after the procedure was 10 days, compared with 30 days (P = 0.0001) as previously reported with full debridement (Plast Reconstr Surg 2004; 114:676). Mean estimated intraoperative blood loss was reduced from 331 mL during full debridement to 93 mL (P < 0.0001) with limited debridement (Plast Reconstr Surg 2004; 114:676). There was no increase in postoperative morbidity (24 % vs 13 %, P = 0.2117). CONCLUSIONS The authors advocate limited sternal debridement and partial bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps in patients with limited wounds and partially or fully healed sternums. We demonstrate that the procedure is effective but less invasive than complete debridement, reduces operative time and blood loss, and shortens length of hospitalization.","Preminger, Beth Aviva; Yaghoobzadeh, Yousha; Ascherman, Jeffrey A",Annals of plastic surgery,300,1

METHODS One hundred consecutive rectal cancer patients who underwent rectal resection with primary anastomosis were enrolled in this study. RESULTS The overall rate of clinical anastomotic leakage in both groups was 7 % (7/100); 6 % (3/50) in the CSA group and 8 % (4/50) in the DSA group. The anastomotic technique did not have any significant influence on the rate of AL. All AL were seen in low anastomoses (7 cm and below). The rate of AL in patients with a diverting stoma (13 %, 3/23) was not significantly different from that of the patients without (5.2 %, 4/77) (p = 0.195). The mean length of the operation was significantly shorter in the DSA group compared to the CSA group, at 127 and 141 min, respectively (p = 0.005). There were significantly higher rates of AL in patients receiving preoperative long course radiotherapy (15.4 %, 6/39) compared with those who did not receive radiotherapy (1.63 %, 1/61) (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS The CSA and DSA techniques are equally safe for the creation of a rectal anastomosis, without any significant difference in the AL rate. However, we recommend using the DSA technique because it has other definite advantages. In cases of neoadjuvant treatment and a low anastomosis, proximal diversion is recommended.","Radovanovic, Z; Petrovic, T; Radovanovic, D; Breberina, M; Golubovic, A; Lukic, D",Surgery today,300,16

STUDY DESIGN Experimental study. METHODS Fresh 172 RRP tissue samples from 12 patients were implanted onto chick embryo CAMs. Morphological and morphometric analysis of the experimental CAM and chorionic epithelium was performed. The microvascular network of the CAM with the RRP implant was investigated under the effect of fluoresceinated anionic dextran. The peculiarities of the clinical course of the disease were evaluated. RESULTS The implanted RRP tissue samples survived on CAMs in 86% of cases, retaining their essential morphologic characteristics and proliferative capacity of the original tumor. Implants induced thickening of both the CAM and the chorionic epithelium, but none of the RRP implants crossed the basement membrane of the hosting CAM. A ""crawling film"" of acellular material with newly formed papilloma sprouts located on the outer chorionic epithelium of the CAM was detected. Direct association between a recurrence rate of RRP and the number of newly formed papilloma sprouts around the implanted tumor on CAMs was revealed. CONCLUSION The chicken embryo CAM-based model is appropriate for investigations of RRP and facilitates the understanding of tumor biology and the clinical course of the disease, thus providing the basis for further research and acceleration of the identification and development of new specific therapeutic compounds that limit the spread and recurrence of RRP.

Despite evidence that symptoms of both depression and anxiety are common during pregnancy and the postpartum, the impact of maternal anxiety on the child has received relatively less attention than the impact of maternal depression. Furthermore, the evidence base for the direct impact of maternal anxiety during pregnancy and the postpartum on children's emotional outcomes lacks cohesion. The aim of this systematic review is to summarise the empirical evidence regarding the impact of maternal prenatal and postnatal anxiety on children's emotional outcomes. Overall, both maternal prenatal and postnatal anxiety have a small adverse effect on child emotional outcomes. However, the evidence appears stronger for the negative impact of prenatal anxiety. Several methodological weaknesses make conclusions problematic and replication of findings is required to improve the identification of at-risk parents and children with appropriate opportunities for intervention and prevention.","Rees, Sarah; Channon, Susan; Waters, Cerith S",European child & adolescent psychiatry,300,29

Herein, we report a case of POT that occurred in the right maxilla of a 10-year-old boy and reveal unique features in comparison with those previously reported. Radiologically, the lesion presented as a well-defined, unilocular radiolucency with notable radiopaque foci on the periphery. Microscopically, the tumor was mainly composed of dental papilla-like myxoid fibrous connective tissue, largely surrounded by non-keratinized squamous epithelium with numerous calcified particles, and partly enclosed by inner enamel epithelium-like columnar cells and enamel organ-like structures accompanied with cuboidal and/or stellate reticulum-like cells. Immunohistochemically, the epithelium tested positive for cytokeratin 14 and 19. Moreover, amelogenin and ameloblastin, matrix proteins relating to enamel formation, were positive in the covering epithelium. The tumor was enucleated as a whole, and no recurrence was recorded thereafter. Although the presence of numerous calcified particles was unique, we diagnosed this lesion as POT based on the above-described features. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the differential diagnosis of POT and other odontogenic tumors that resemble corresponding tooth germ components.","Kayamori, Kou; Tsuchiya, Maiko; Michi, Yasuyuki; Kuribayashi, Ami; Mikami, Toshinari; Sakamoto, Kei; Yoda, Tetsuya; Ikeda, Tohru",Pathology international,300,1

Among other benefits, it is associated with decreased lengths of stay, wound and surgical site infections, pain scores, and has an overall lower complication rate vs. open surgery (1). Recently, however, the role of minimally invasive surgery has been called into question in the effective and safe treatment of rectal cancer. This manuscript will outline the history of minimally invasive rectal cancer surgery, examine evidence detailing its safety (compared with alternatives), and discuss important aspects of use, most notably the considerable learning curve required to achieve proficiency, the extent of its current use, and potential pitfalls. The current evidence suggests minimally invasive surgery is a very safe way to treat rectal cancer when performed by experienced and specialty trained surgeons.","Hsieh, Christine; Cologne, Kyle G",Frontiers in oncology,300,13

Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). METHODS We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. FINDINGS The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. INTERPRETATION At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.

Although LESS-A is more technically complex than conventional laparoscopic adrenalectomy, its learning curve and the factors associated with poor surgical outcomes are poorly understood. We analyzed the learning curve of LESS-A and attempted to identify risk factors associated with worse surgical outcomes. METHODS We identified 103 patients who underwent LESS-A [performed by the same surgeon (A.M.)] from 2009 to 2015. The learning curve was analyzed using the moving average method (the 10-case moving average), and we assessed potential risk factors for a prolonged pneumoperitoneum time. RESULTS The learning curve stabilized at 30 cases. The cases were divided into two groups, the learning stage (LS) (cases 1-29) and master stage (MS) (cases 30-103) groups. The percentage of females and the frequency of previous abdominal surgery were higher in the LS group (p = 0.022 and 0.001, respectively). In the LS group, the mean pneumoperitoneum time was 92 ± 35 min, which was significantly longer than the equivalent value for the MS group (55 ± 18 min, p < 0.001). In the LS group, univariate analysis revealed that tumor size (≥50 mm) and the visceral fat area (VFA)/total fat area (TFA) ratio (≥0.49) were significantly associated with a prolonged pneumoperitoneum time (p = 0.046 and 0.046, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, tumor size and the VFA/TFA ratio were confirmed to be associated with a prolonged pneumoperitoneum time (p = 0.029 and 0.029, odds ratio 20.83 and 20.83, respectively). On the other hand, none of the examined factors were found to be associated with a prolonged pneumoperitoneum time in the MS group. CONCLUSIONS LESS-A was performed safely in most cases. However, surgeons who are learning the LESS-A procedure need to pay attention to tumor size and visceral obesity.","Fukumoto, Keishiro; Miyajima, Akira; Hattori, Seiya; Matsumoto, Kazuhiro; Abe, Takayuki; Kurihara, Isao; Jinzaki, Masahiro; Kikuchi, Eiji; Oya, Mototsugu",Surgical endoscopy,300,5

This research used spatial panel models and data from 30 provinces in China from 2004 to 2017 to empirically analyse the relationship between OFDI and air pollution. The results revealed that, first, China's air pollution showed two spatial clustering areas: the eastern coastal area (e.g. Zhejiang) and the north-western area (e.g. Xinjiang). Second, with the increase in OFDI, the direct effect on the concentration of respirable suspended particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) was negative, and the direct effect on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was positive; however, the total effect was negative. An increase of 1% in OFDI would directly decrease the concentrations of PM10 and SO2 by 0.024% and 0.096%, respectively, while NO2 would directly increase by 0.061%, but the total effect of OFDI on the three air pollutants was negative. Third, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis existed between economic growth and SO2 and NO2 but not between economic growth and PM10. The spatial panel model results revealed that the spatial spillover effects of air pollutants (i.e. PM10, SO2, and NO2) were 0.494, 0.447 and 0.314, respectively. Moreover, the impact of OFDI on air pollution had significant temporal heterogeneity. To make the results robust, this research conducted a robustness test by replacing the spatial weight matrix and dependent variables. Finally, the conclusion of this article demonstrates the importance of OFDI in improving air pollution, and we could benefit from OFDI. Our research conclusions provide an important reference for policymakers in implementing trade policies and improving air pollution.","Zhou, Anhua; Li, Jun",Environmental science and pollution research international,300,1

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is responsible for the vast majority of pancreatic cancer cases, and is characterised by the presence of a dense stroma that impacts therapeutic efficacy and drives pro-tumorigenic programs. More specifically, the inflammatory nature of the tumour microenvironment is thought to underlie the loss of anti-tumour immunity and development of resistance to current treatments. Inflammatory pathways are largely mediated by the expression of, and signalling through, cytokines, chemokines, and other cellular messengers. In recent years, there has been much attention focused on dual targeting of cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment.

It has been traditionally regarded as a purely microvascular disease in the retina. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that DR is a complex neurovascular disorder that affects not only vascular structure but also neural tissue of the retina. Deterioration of neural retina could precede microvascular abnormalities in the DR, leading to microvascular changes. Furthermore, disruption of interactions among neurons, vascular cells, glia and local immune cells, which collectively form the neurovascular unit, is considered to be associated with the progression of DR early on in the disease. Therefore, it makes sense to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent or reverse retinal neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and impaired cell-cell interactions of the neurovascular unit in early stage DR. Here, we present current perspectives on the pathophysiology of DR as a neurovascular disease, especially at the early stage. Potential novel treatments for preventing or reversing neurovascular injuries in DR are discussed as well.","Nian, Shen; Lo, Amy C Y; Mi, Yajing; Ren, Kai; Yang, Di",Eye and vision,300,16

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine whether shorter DAPT in patients with drug-eluting stents and CKD is associated with lower mortality or major adverse cardiovascular event rates compared with longer DAPT. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS A Medline literature research was conducted to identify randomized trials in patients with drug-eluting stents comparing different DAPT duration strategies. Inclusion of patients with CKD was also required. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or stent thrombosis (definite or probable). Major bleeding was the secondary outcome. The risk ratio (RR) was estimated using a random-effects model. RESULTS Five randomized trials were included (1902 patients with CKD). Short DAPT (≤6 months) was associated with a similar incidence of the primary outcome, compared with 12-month DAPT among patients with CKD (48 versus 50 events; RR, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.64 to 1.36; P=0.72). Twelve-month DAPT was also associated with a similar incidence of the primary outcome compared with extended DAPT (≥30 months) in the CKD subgroup (35 versus 35 events; RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.62; P=0.87). Numerically lower major bleeding event rates were detected with shorter versus 12-month DAPT (9 versus 13 events; RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.60; P=0.39) and 12-month versus extended DAPT (9 versus 12 events; RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.35 to 1.93; P=0.66) in patients with CKD. CONCLUSIONS Short DAPT does not appear to be inferior to longer DAPT in patients with CKD and drug-eluting stents. Because of imprecision in estimates (few events and wide confidence intervals), no definite conclusions can be drawn with respect to stent thrombosis.","Mavrakanas, Thomas A; Chatzizisis, Yiannis S; Gariani, Karim; Kereiakes, Dean J; Gargiulo, Giuseppe; Helft, Gérard; Gilard, Martine; Feres, Fausto; Costa, Ricardo A; Morice, Marie-Claude; Georges, Jean-Louis; Valgimigli, Marco; Bhatt, Deepak L; Mauri, Laura; Charytan, David M",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,300,1

Hypertension, diabetes, and obesity are under discussion as important factors affecting the severity of disease. Air pollution has been considered to play a role in the diffusion of the virus, in the propagation of the contagion, in the severity of symptoms, and in the poor prognosis. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that environmental particulate matter (PM) can trigger inflammatory responses at molecular, cellular, and organ levels, sustaining respiratory, cardiovascular, and dysmetabolic diseases.To better understand the intricate relationships among pre-existing conditions, PM, and viral infection, we examined the response at the molecular level of T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells exposed to different fractions of PM. T47D cells express several receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and ACE2, the main - but not the only - receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.PM samples were collected in an urban background site located in the Northern area of the City of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna Region, Northern Italy) during winter 2013. T47D cells were exposed to organic or aqueous (inorganic) extracts at the final concentration of 8 m3 for a 4-hour duration. Both the concentration and the exposure time were chosen to resemble an average outdoor exposure. RNA was extracted from cells, purified and hybridised on 66k microarray slides from Agilent.The lists of differentially expressed genes in PM organic extracts were evaluated by using Metacore, and an enrichment analysis was performed to identify pathways maps, process networks, and disease by biomarkers altered after T47D treatment.The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for the involvement of PM in dysmetabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity, and hypertension through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) canonical pathway.On the basis of current knowledge, existing data, and exploratory experimental evidence, we tease out the likely molecular interplay that can ultimately tip the disease outcome into severity. Looking beyond ACE2, several additional key markers are identified. Disruption of these targets worsens pre-existing conditions and/or exacerbates the adverse effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whilst appropriately designed, epidemiological studies are very much needed to investigate these associations based on our hypothesis of investigation, by reviewing recent experimental and epidemiological evidence, here we speculate and provide new insights on the possible role of environmental pollution in the exacerbation of effects by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses.

Here we investigate the status of implementation in a nationwide survey in Germany which took place in 2012. METHODS We conducted a nationwide telephone survey including a total of 951 German intensive care units (ICUs). ICUs were identified by using the online registry for hospitals in Germany. A questionnaire was used for the interview about basic data of the intensive care unit and about details concerning use and implementation of TTM after cardiac arrest. RESULTS The overall response rate was 91% (865/951). 86% (742/865) of ICUs used TTM after cardiac arrest and implementation peaked in 2010. 95% (702/736) of the ICUs using TTM perform treatment independently of the initial rhythm and 48% (355/738) apply TTM with the use of a feedback device for cooling and controlled re-warming. However, 22% (166/742) still use conventional methods like ice and cold infusion and only 61% (453/742) of the participants provided a written standard operating procedure (SOP). CONCLUSION With a delay of several years, TTM after cardiac arrest is now implemented in the majority of German ICUs. The moderate proportion of ICUs using SOPs for TTM and feedback-controlled cooling devices indicates the need of further improvement in post cardiac arrest care.","Storm, C; Meyer, T; Schroeder, T; Wutzler, A; Jörres, A; Leithner, C",Resuscitation,300,24

Endovascular reperfusion therapy (EVT) improves recanalization rates in patients with emergent large vessel intracranial occlusion. OBJECTIVE To examine the hypothesis that good collateral patterns identified by pretreatment CT angiography (CTA) might be associated with favorable outcomes after EVT. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients presenting with AIS due to BAO in a tertiary care stroke center during a 4-year period. BAO was diagnosed by CTA in all cases. Admission stroke severity was documented using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score. Pretreatment collateral score for posterior circulation was defined as follows: 0, no posterior communicating artery (PCOM); 1, unilateral PCOM; 2, bilateral PCOM. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 3 months. RESULTS A total of 21 patients with AIS due to BAO (age range 31-84 years, median admission NIHSS score: 18 points, range 2-38) underwent EVT. Eleven of 21 patients (52.4%) had bilateral PCOMs, while unilateral PCOM was seen in 3 patients (14.3%). Patients with bilateral PCOMs tended (p=0.261) to have less severe stroke at admission than those with absent/unilateral PCOM (median NIHSS score 18 vs 27 points). Neurological improvement during hospitalization (quantified by the median decrease in NIHSS score) and the rate of 3-month functional independence were greater in patients with good collaterals (16 vs 0 points (p=0.016) and 72.7% vs 0% (p=0.001)). CONCLUSIONS The presence of bilateral PCOMs on pretreatment CTA appears to be associated with more favorable outcomes in BAO treated with EVT.","Goyal, Nitin; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Nickele, Chris; Doss, Vinodh T; Hoit, Dan; Alexandrov, Andrei V; Arthur, Adam; Elijovich, Lucas",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,300,8

Horseshoe bats are a speciose group that exhibit a derived form of high-duty cycle echolocation in which the inner ear is finely tuned to echoes of the narrowband call frequency. Here, by focusing on three recently diverged subspecies of the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) that display divergent echolocation call frequencies, we aim to identify candidate loci putatively involved in hearing frequency variation. We used de novo transcriptome sequencing of two mainland taxa (himalayanus and macrurus) and one island taxon (hainanus) to compare expression profiles of thousands of genes. By comparing taxa with divergent call frequencies (around 15 kHz difference), we identified 252 differentially expressed genes, of which six have been shown to be involved in hearing or deafness in human/mouse. To obtain further validation of these results, we applied quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to the candidate gene FBXL15 and found a broad association between the level of expression and call frequency across taxa. The genes identified here represent strong candidate loci associated with hearing frequency variation in bats.","Sun, Haijian; Chen, Wenli; Wang, Jiaying; Zhang, Libiao; Rossiter, Stephen J; Mao, Xiuguang",Proceedings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of disinfectants continues to increase and is of fundamental importance in infection control. OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of sensitization and the value of patch testing to didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) and the alcohols: ethanol, 1-propanol and isopropanol. METHODS Clinical patch test data of 145 patients with suspected contact allergy to disinfectants were retrospective analyzed. RESULTS Among the 145 patients patch tested with the different alcohols, only one nurse was detected with a possible allergy to 1-propanol. Additional patch testing in 84 patients with DDAC 0.05% resulted in five patients with weakly positive reactions only, without clinical relevance. Patch testing with DDAC 0.03% showed no positive reactions at all on day 3 readings. CONCLUSION DDAC and alcohols are rarely responsible for allergic contact dermatitis. The accused products of the patients should be checked for other allergens and further additives with skin irritating properties. Individual susceptibility and mishandling of the disinfectants should be considered. This article is protected by copyright.

To date, it is unknown if impaired cerebrovascular reactivity during the acute phase is associated with ongoing impaired continuously measured cerebrovascular reactivity at in the long-term, and if such measures are associated with clinical phenotype at those points in time. OBJECTIVE Within this manuscript we highlight a prospective pilot study that will preliminarily assess near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) derived continuous measures of cerebrovascular reactivity during both acute and long-term phases in adults with TBI. METHODS Over the course of a 2 year period we will recruit up to 80 moderate/severe TBI patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. These patients will undergo high-frequency data capture of ICP, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and NIRS for the first 5 days of care. Patients will then have 30 minutes of non-invasive NIRS and ABP monitoring in clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. Outcomes will be assessed via Glasgow Outcome Scale and Short Form-12 questionnaires. Various relationships between NIRS and ICP derived cerebrovascular reactivity metrics, and associated outcomes, will be assessed using biomedical signal processing techniques and both multi-variate and time-series statistical methodologies. RESULTS This study has currently started recruitment as of the end of February 2020, with data collection ongoing, having enrolled 3 patients at the time of this manuscript composition. Expected duration of data collection will be from February 2020 to January 2022, as per our local research ethics board (REB) approval (B2018:103). Support for this work has been obtained through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), though the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (R03NS114335), funded in January 2020. CONCLUSIONS Through application of NIRS technology in the monitoring of TBI patients, we expect to be able to outline core relationships between non-invasively measured aspects of cerebral physiology and both invasive measures, as well as patient outcomes. Documenting these relationships carries the potential to revolutionize the way we monitor TBI patients, moving to more non-invasive techniques.

Targeting of bacterial signaling through their the two-component systems (TCSs) may be a viable strategy. TCSs are comprisesd of a sensory histidine kinase (HK), of which a bacterium can have up to 160 distinct proteins, and a cognate response regulator (RR). The TCSs are generally non-essential for life, but control many virulence and antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. This, along with their absence in animals makes the TCSs an attractive target for antimicrobial therapy, whether as a stand-alone treatments or adjuvants for existing therapies. This review focuses on progress in the development of inhibitors that target the HK ATP-binding domain. Because this domain is highly conserved, it may be feasible to disrupt multiple TCSs within a single organism to increase effectiveness and reduce pressure for the evolution of resistance.","Fihn, Conrad A; Carlson, Erin E",Current opinion in microbiology,300,31

Here we examined country-specific kidney transplantation and graft failure rates in children and explore their country- and patient-level determinants. Patients under 20 years of age initiating kidney replacement therapy from January 2007 through December 2015 in 37 European countries participating in the ESPN/ERA-EDTA Registry were included in the analyses. Countries were categorized as low-, middle-, and high-income based on gross domestic product. At five years of follow-up, 4326 of 6909 children on kidney replacement therapy received their first kidney transplant. Overall median time from kidney replacement therapy start to first kidney transplantation was 1.4 (inter quartile range 0.3-4.3) years. The five-year kidney transplantation probability was 48.8% (95% confidence interval: 45.9-51.7%) in low-income, 76.3% (72.8-79.5%) in middle-income and 92.3% (91.0-93.4%) in high-income countries and was strongly associated with macro-economic factors. Gross domestic product alone explained 67% of the international variation in transplantation rates. Compared with high-income countries, kidney transplantation was 76% less likely to be performed in low-income and 58% less likely in middle-income countries. Overall five-year graft survival in Europe was 88% and showed little variation across countries. Thus, despite large disparities transplantation access across Europe, graft failure rates were relatively similar. Hence, graft survival in low-risk transplant recipients from lower-income countries seems as good as graft survival among all (low-, medium-, and high-risk) graft recipients from high-income countries.","Bonthuis, Marjolein; Cuperus, Liz; Chesnaye, Nicholas C; Akman, Sema; Melgar, Angel Alonso; Baiko, Sergey; Bouts, Antonia H; Boyer, Olivia; Dimitrova, Kremena; Carmo, Carmen do; Grenda, Ryszard; Heaf, James; Jahnukainen, Timo; Jankauskiene, Augustina; Kaltenegger, Lukas; Kostic, Mirjana; Marks, Stephen D; Mitsioni, Andromachi; Novljan, Gregor; Palsson, Runolfur; Parvex, Paloma; Podracka, Ludmila; Bjerre, Anna; Seeman, Tomas; Slavicek, Jasna; Szabo, Tamas; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Torres, Diletta D; Van Hoeck, Koen J; Ladfors, Susanne Westphal; Harambat, Jérôme; Groothoff, Jaap W; Jager, Kitty J",Kidney international,300,1

In doing so, the environmental impacts of the financialization process are also explored, in line with the fact that these countries face constraints in financing technological developments. In this context, the effects of technological development, financialization, renewable energy consumption, and non-renewable energy consumption on environmental degradation are examined through the second-generation panel data methods for the period 1995-2016. The findings indicate that technological innovation is effective in reducing carbon emissions, but does not have a significant impact on the ecological footprint, namely a 1% increase in technological innovations reduces carbon emission by 0.082-0.088%. Moreover, it is found that financialization harms environmental quality for both indicators of the environment because a 1% increase in financialization increases carbon emissions by 0.203-0.222% and increases ecological footprint by 0.069-0.071%.","Destek, Mehmet Akif; Manga, Muge",Environmental science and pollution research international,300,24

Surgical techniques aimed at preventing this potential complication are sought. OBJECTIVE To describe our surgical technique of retrosigmoid ileal conduit, and to assess perioperative outcomes and postoperative complications with a focus on UAS rate. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective single-centre, single-surgeon cohort of 67 consecutive patients undergoing open RC with ileal conduit urinary diversion between July 2013 and April 2017 was analysed. A study group of 30 patients receiving retrosigmoid ileal conduit was compared with a control group of 37 patients receiving standard Wallace ileal conduit. SURGICAL PROCEDURE Retrosigmoid versus Wallace ileal conduit diversion after open RC. MEASUREMENTS Operative room (OR) time, estimated blood loss (EBL), transfusion rate, and 90-d postoperative complications were recorded and compared between the two groups. In particular, rate of UAS, defined as upper collecting system dilatation requiring endourological or surgical management, was assessed and compared. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The two groups were comparable with regard to all demographic, clinical, and pathological variables. No differences were observed in terms of OR time (p=0.35), EBL (p=0.12), and transfusion rate (p=0.81). Ninety-day postoperative complications were observed in 11 (36.7%) patients who underwent a retrosigmoid ileal conduit and 20 (54.1%) patients who received a traditional ileal conduit (p=0.32). Major complications (grade 3-4) were observed in three (10%) cases in the former group and in 12 (32.4%) cases in the latter group (p=0.08). Mean (standard deviation) follow-up time was 10.8±4.0 mo in the study group and 27.5±9.5 mo in the control group (p<0.001). No single case of UAS was observed in the study group, whereas six (16.2%) cases of UAS occurred in the control group (p=0.02). The main limitation is a nonrandomised comparison of a relatively small cohort with short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In our study, we observed a significantly reduced rate of UAS and no increase in postoperative complications with the retrosigmoid ileal conduit diversion compared with standard Wallace ileal conduit diversion after open RC. PATIENT SUMMARY We describe our surgical technique of retrosigmoid ileal conduit as urinary diversion after open radical cystectomy. Compared with traditional techniques, our technique for ileal conduit was found to be safe and reduce the risk of ureteric strictures.","Ficarra, Vincenzo; Giannarini, Gianluca; Crestani, Alessandro; Palumbo, Vito; Rossanese, Marta; Valotto, Claudio; Inferrera, Antonino; Pansadoro, Vito",European urology,300,16

Design, Setting, and Participants In this prospective, observational study performed from November 1, 2013, through October 31, 2015, at 16 hospitals in Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic, surgeons completed initial training programs in hernia repair, underwent interval proficiency assessments, and were appointed regional trainers. Competency-based evaluations of technical proficiency were performed using the Operative Performance Rating Scale (OPRS). Maintenance of proficiency was evaluated by video assessments 6 months after training. Certified trainees received incentives to document independent surgical outcomes after training. Main Outcomes and Measures An OPRS score of 3.0 (scale of 1 [poor] to 5 [excellent]) indicated proficiency. Secondary outcomes included initial vs final scores by country, scores among surgeons trained by the regional trainers (second-order trainees), interval scores 6 months after training, and postoperative complications. Results A total of 20 surgeon trainers, 81 local surgeons, and 364 patients (343 adult, 21 pediatric) participated in the study (mean [SD] age, 47.5 [16.3] years; age range, 16-83 years). All 81 surgeons successfully completed the program, and all 364 patients received successful operations. Mean (SD) OPRS scores improved from 4.06 (0.87) before the initial training program to 4.52 (0.57) after training (P < .001). No significant variation was found by country in final scores. On trainee certification, 20 became regional trainers. The mean (SD) OPRS score among 53 second-order trainees was 4.34 (0.68). After 6-month intervals, the mean (SD) OPRS score among participating surgeons was 4.34 (0.55). The overall operative complication rate during training series was 1.1%.

Studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α]) can increase in many pathophysiological conditions. In addition, IL-10 as one of the most important anti-inflammatory cytokines contributes to the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Few studies have addressed cytokine levels in calves with NCD. Therefore, the goal of this study was to evaluate the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as IL-10, in the calves naturally infected with NCD syndrome. For this purpose, 87 neonatal calves were monitored for 1 month. Out of this population, 10 cases were diagnosed with NCD and studied as the case group. In addition, a control group was considered that consisted of 10 age- and gender-matched neonatal calves without any diseases. From each calf, 5 ml blood sample was collected into EDTA tubes by jugular venipuncture. The samples were then centrifuged, and the extracted plasmas were aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. Finally, the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were measured using the ELISA kits based on the manufacturer's protocols. The results showed that the plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in the case group than in the control group. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of the plasma concentrations of IL-10. This study indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines could be used to recognize the immune system response to NCD.","Beheshtipour, J; Raeeszadeh, M",Archives of Razi Institute,300,27

The investigation was based on the results of a previous animal test, which was aimed to investigate and confirme the clinical efficacy of Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection in the treatment of COVID-19. The animal test demonstrated that Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection has a significant therapeutic effect on the human coronavirus pneumonia for the model mice. The lung inhibition index reached up to 86.86%. The evaluation was conducted on 40 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated at Jingzhou Hospital of Infectious Disease(Chest Hospital) of Hubei Pro-vince from January 30~(th) to March 21~(th), 2020. In these cases, patients were treated with other integrated Chinese and Western medicines regimens in the recommended Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection diagnosis and treatment regimen. The clinical manifestations, laboratory data, nucleic acid clearance time, and imaging data were compared and analyzed before and after treatment. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the clinical symptoms of 40 cases were alleviated markedly, and their blood analysis and biochemical indexes returned to normal. The lung CT showed more than 50% of lesion absorption rate, and the viral nucleic acid test showed the average clearance time of patients was 16.6 days, and the average length of hospital stay was 25.9 days. After administration with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection, the symptoms of cough and fatigue were alleviated significantly, and the appetite was significantly improved compared with before, especially for patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally, laboratory indicators, especially absolute value and ratio of lymphocytes and CRP were significantly alleviated. According to the chest CT for short-term review, the absorption of lung lesions was faster than before, especially for grid-like and fibrotic lesions. Compared with antiviral drugs, such as Abidol and Kriging, the nucleic acid clearance time was significantly shorter than the cases treated with Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection. The clinical effective rate of 40 cases was 100.0%. We believed that Matrine and Sodium Chloride Injection have a good clinical effect in the treatment of COVID-19, and suggested increasing the clinical application and further conducting large-sample-size cli-nical verification.","Yang, Ming-Wei; Chen, Feng; Zhu, Ding-Jun; Li, Jia-Zhu; Zhu, Jin-Ling; Zeng, Wei; Qu, Shi-Lin; Zhang, Yun",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,300,7

DESIGN Retrospective, observational analysis of patients with PCR-diagnosed VRI discharged from 3 acute-care hospital EDs within 1 health system. RESULTS In total, 323 patients were discharged from the ED with a VRI diagnosis, of whom 68 were prescribed antibiotics (21.1%). These patients were older (median, 59.5 vs 43 years; P = .04), experienced symptoms longer (median, 4 vs 2 days; P = .002), were more likely to have received antibiotics in the preceding 7 days (27.9% vs 9.8%; P < .001), and had higher proportions of abnormal chest X-rays (64.5% vs 28.4%; P < .001). Patients were more likely to receive antibiotics for a diagnosis of pneumonia (39.7% vs 1.6%; P < .001) or otitis media (7.4% vs 0.4%; P = .002), and were less likely with diagnosis of upper respiratory infection (2.9% vs 13.7%; P = .02) or influenza (20.6% vs 44.3%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Despite a diagnosis of VRI, one-fifth of ED patients were prescribed antibiotics. Patient characteristics including age, duration of symptoms, abnormal chest X-rays, and specific diagnosis may increase provider concern for concurrent bacterial infections. Opportunities exist for antimicrobial stewardship strategies to incorporate rapid diagnostics in promoting judicious antibiotic usage in the ED.","Li, Jing; Kang-Birken, S Lena; Mathews, Samantha K; Kenner, Catelynn E; Fitzgibbons, Lynn N",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,300,27

We used preterm pigs delivered at gestational day 102 as a translational model for 26-28-week infants to test the hypothesis administering recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (rhKGF) at initiation of mechanical ventilation will stimulate type II cell proliferation and surfactant production, mitigate ventilator induced lung injury, and reduce epithelial to mesenchymal transition considered as a precursor to BPD. Newborn preterm pigs were intubated and randomized to receive intratracheal rhKGF (20 μg/kg; n = 6) or saline (0.5 ml 0.9% saline; control; n = 6) before initiating 24 h of ventilation followed by extubation to nasal oxygen for 12 h before euthanasia and collection of lungs for histopathology and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of surfactant protein B and markers of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. rhKGF pigs required less oxygen during mechanical ventilation, had higher tidal volumes at similar peak pressures indicative of improved lung compliance, and survival was higher after extubation (83% vs. 16%). rhKGF increased surfactant protein B expression (p < 0.05) and reduced TGF-1β (p < 0.05), that inhibits surfactant production and is a prominent marker for epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Our findings suggest intratracheal administration of rhKGF at initiation of mechanical ventilation enhances surfactant production, reduces ventilator induced lung injury, and attenuates epithelial-mesenchymal transition while improving pulmonary functions. rhKGF is a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate pulmonary responses of preterm infants that require mechanical ventilation and thereby reduce the incidence and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","Krishnan, Ramesh; Arrindell, Esmond L; Frank, Caminita; Jie, Zhang; Buddington, Randal K",Frontiers in pediatrics,300,27

We examined e-cigarette marketing activities during this restriction. Using web scraping, we accessed data for 2661 e-cigarette liquids marketed online by South African vendors in June 2020. We also analyzed e-cigarette volume sales (complete kits) using retail scanner data. The 2661 e-cigarette liquids assessed comprised cannabidiol liquids, 28.8%[767/2661], nicotine salts, 10.4%[276/2661], e-cigarette juice concentrates, 14.1%[376/2661], nicotine-free e-liquid, 4.0%[107/2661], and nicotine-containing e-liquid, 42.6%[1135/2661]. Cannabidiol liquids had the highest percentage of fruit (78.4%[601/767]) and tobacco flavors (9.4%[72/767]). During the restriction, many online e-cigarette vendors actively promoted cannabidiol liquid in lieu of regular e-liquid. Volume e-cigarette sales in February 2020, preceding the restriction (7.76 million kits), were higher than in February 2019 (4.52 million kits). The restriction saw decreased e-cigarette sales; mean weekly e-cigarette sales in the 6 weeks following the restriction (772,585 kits/week) was dramatically lower versus the 6 weeks preceding the restriction (2.26 million kits/week). Lifting the restriction saw a 131% spike in sales between the latter half of August 2020 (825,638 kits) and mid-September 2020 sales (1.90 million kits), even though total sales in September 2020 were half of what was observed in the preceding year (3.81 million units in September 2020, vs 6.33 million units, September 2019). The marketing of cannabidiol by e-cigarette manufacturers may perpetuate e-cigarette use without net public health gain, especially if it encourages youth use; close monitoring is required.","Agaku, Israel; Egbe, Catherine O; Ayo-Yusuf, Olalekan A",Preventive medicine,300,1

However, it is unclear whether this effect stems from inaccuracies in children's spontaneous labeling of facial expressions or their tendency not to label facial expressions spontaneously. To further explore the label superiority effect, Japanese children aged 3-5 years (N = 48) were assigned to one of three conditions: label cue, photo cue, and compelled to label, and asked to categorize facial expressions by emotion by placing cards in a box. The children correctly put more facial expressions in the box for label cues than photo cues, but the compelled to label group performed as well as the label cues group. These results suggest that the label superiority effect occurs because children do not label facial expressions spontaneously, and this tendency may explain their difficulty in understanding facial expressions.","Ikeda, Shinnosuke",The Journal of genetic psychology,300,1

However, large-scale changes of the kinetochore architecture (such as its shape or dimensions) may also contribute to the value of delta. To assess contributions of these non-elastic changes, we compare behaviour of delta values in human kinetochores with small yet mechanically malleable kinetochores against compound kinetochores in Indian muntjac (IM) cells whose architecture remains constant. Due to the micrometre-scale length of kinetochore plates in IM, their shape and orientation are discernible in conventional light microscopy, which enables precise measurements of IKT independent of contributions from changes in overall architecture of the organelle. We find that delta in IM kinetochores remains relatively constant when microtubule-mediated forces are suppressed by Taxol, but it prominently decreases upon detachment of microtubules. By contrast, large decreases of delta observed in Taxol-treated human cells coincide with prominent changes in length and curvature of the kinetochore plate. These observations, supported by computational modelling, suggest that at least 50% of the decrease in delta in human cells reflects malleable reorganization of kinetochore architecture rather than elastic recoil due to IKT.","Renda, Fioranna; Magidson, Valentin; Tikhonenko, Irina; Fisher, Rebecca; Miles, Christopher; Mogilner, Alex; Khodjakov, Alexey",Open biology,300,31

OBJECTIVE We sought to investigate outcomes of different surgical approaches to abdominoperineal resection in patients with rectal cancer. DESIGN The nationwide inpatient sample database was used to examine the clinical data of patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resection between 2009 and 2012 in the United States. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare outcomes of different surgical approaches. SETTINGS A retrospective review according to the national inpatient sample database was designed. PATIENTS We included patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resection between 2009 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes of different surgical approaches to abdominoperineal resection were investigated. RESULTS We sampled 18,359 patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resections. Of these, 69.5% had open surgery, 25.8% had laparoscopic surgery, and 4.7% had robotic surgery. The rate of robotic procedures increased >4-fold, from 2.1% to 8.1%, from 2009 to 2012. The conversion rate in robotic surgery was significantly lower compared with laparoscopic surgery (5.7% vs 13.4%; p < 0.01). After risk adjustment, patients who underwent laparoscopic and robotic approaches had lower morbidity risks compared with those who underwent the open approach (adjusted OR = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.92), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.40-0.80); p < 0. 01). There were no significant differences in the morbidity rate of patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic approaches (adjusted OR = 0.79 (95% CI, 0.55-1.14); p = 0.21). However, patients who underwent the robotic approach had significantly higher total hospital charges compared with those who underwent the laparoscopic approach (mean difference, $24,890; p < 0.01). LIMITATIONS We could not adjust the results with some important factors, such as the tumor stage and BMI. CONCLUSIONS The use of robotic and laparoscopic approaches to abdominoperineal resection have increased between 2009 and 2012. Both minimally invasive approaches decrease morbidity rates of patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The robotic approach has a significantly lower conversion rate compared with the laparoscopic approach.

CASE DESCRIPTION A 35-year-old woman presented with back pain, progressive weakness in her bilateral lower extremities, and inability to walk for 2 months. Imaging demonstrated anterior destruction of T10, T11, T12, and L1 with severe retropulsion and cord impingement at T11-T12. The patient was taken for anterolateral corpectomies of T10-L1 with decompression of the thoracic spinal cord and fibular strut autograft placement followed by a T8 to L3 posterior spinal fusion. An intramedullary Kirschner-wire (K-wire) was placed during the anterolateral procedure to enhance fibular graft placement and prevent dislodgement before definitive posterior fusion. CONCLUSIONS At follow-up five-and-a-half months after the operation, the patient had recovered full strength and was ambulating without difficulty. Imaging at this time demonstrated stable restoration of alignment without graft dislodgement. Intramedullary fibular K-wire placement in this procedure helped to optimize anterior column reconstruction.

It is estimated that up to 70% of the health workforce are women, however, this pattern is not reflected in the leadership of health systems where women are under-represented. METHODS This systematized review explored the existing literature around women's progress towards leadership in the health sector in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) which has used intersectional analysis. RESULTS While there are studies that have looked at the inequities and barriers women face in progressing towards leadership positions in health systems within LMICs, none explicitly used an intersectionality framework in their approach. These studies did nevertheless show recurring barriers to health systems leadership created at the intersection of gender and social identities such as professional cadre, race/ethnicity, financial status, and culture. These barriers limit women's access to resources that improve career development, including mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, reduce value, recognition and respect at work for women, and increase the likelihood of women to take on dual burdens of professional work and childcare and domestic work, and, create biased views about effectiveness of men and women's leadership styles. An intersectional lens helps to better understand how gender intersects with other social identities which results in upholding these persisting barriers to career progression and leadership. CONCLUSION As efforts to reduce gender inequity in health systems are gaining momentum, it is important to look beyond gender and take into account other intersecting social identities that create unique positionalities of privilege and/or disadvantage. This approach should be adopted across a diverse range of health systems programs and policies in an effort to strengthen gender equity in health and specifically human resources for health (HRH), and improve health system governance, functioning and outcomes.","Zeinali, Zahra; Muraya, Kui; Molyneux, Sassy; Morgan, Rosemary",International journal of health policy and management,300,16

Right internal carotid artery to middle cerebral artery embolic occlusion was noted immediately after the procedure, and left-sided weakness and facial palsy were found. Ipsilateral suprabulbar cervical internal carotid artery puncture was performed under fluoroscopic guidance, and rescue suction thrombectomy was successful. The patient had no significant neurological sequela. Transcarotid intraarterial thrombectomy is a reasonable method for managing postembolization large vessel occlusion, even in the neck, after irradiation.","Lu, Chi-Ju; Lin, Yen-Heng; Lee, Chung-Wei",Neurointervention,300,5

We aimed to specify the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 and early lung cancer and to unveil the discrepancy between them. Methods One hundred and fifty-seven COVID-19 patients and 374 early lung cancer patients from four hospitals in China were retrospectively enrolled. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics were compared between the two groups using propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. Results COVID-19 patients had more distinct symptoms, tended to be younger (P<0.0001), male (P<0.0001), and had a higher body mass index (P=0.014). After 1:1 PSM, 121 matched pairs were identified. Regarding radiological characteristics, patients with a single lesion accounted for 17% in COVID-19 and 89% in lung cancer (P<0.0001). Most lesions were peripherally found in both groups. Lesions in COVID-19 involved more lobes (median 3.5 vs. 1; P<0.0001) and segments (median 6 vs. 1; P<0.0001) and tended to have multiple types (67%) with patchy form (54%). Early lung cancer was more likely to have a single type (92%) with oval form (66%). Also, COVID-19 and early lung cancer either had some distinctive features on computed tomography (CT) images. Conclusions Both COVID-19 and early lung cancers showed GGOs, with similar but independent features. The imaging characteristics should be fully understood and combined with epidemiological history, pathogen detection, laboratory tests, short-term CT reexamination, and pathological results to aid differential diagnosis.","Zhang, Ya-Jie; Yang, Wen-Jie; Liu, Dong; Cao, Yu-Qin; Zheng, Yu-Yan; Han, Yi-Chao; Jin, Run-Sen; Han, Yu; Wang, Xiao-Yang; Pan, A-Shan; Dai, Jian-Yi; Sun, Qing-Feng; Zhao, Feng-Quan; Yang, Qing-Yuan; Zhang, Jia-Hao; Liu, Sheng-Jun; Da, Qian; Guo, Wei; Li, Cheng-Qiang; Zhang, Wen-Tian; Wu, Han; Chen, Xing-Shi; Ji, An-Qi; Xiang, Jie; Chen, Kai; Feng, Xi-Jia; Zhang, Xian-Fei; Cao, Qi-Qi; Qin, Le; Li, Jian; Zhou, Min; Lu, Yong; Wang, Chao-Fu; Yan, Fu-Hua; Li, He-Cheng; Qu, Jie-Ming",Translational lung cancer research,300,17

We hypothesized that morbidity, like mortality, is associated with physiological dysfunction and could be predicted simultaneously with mortality. DESIGN Prospective cohort study from December 4, 2011, to April 7, 2013. SETTING General and cardiac/cardiovascular PICUs at seven sites. PATIENTS Randomly selected PICU patients from their first PICU admission. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Among 10,078 admissions, the unadjusted morbidity rates (measured with the Functional Status Scale and defined as an increase of ≥ 3 from preillness to hospital discharge) were 4.6% (site range, 2.6-7.7%) and unadjusted mortality rates were 2.7% (site range, 1.3-5.0%). Morbidity and mortality were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with physiological instability (measured with the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score) in dichotomous (survival and death) and trichotomous (survival without new morbidity, survival with new morbidity, and death) models without covariate adjustments. Morbidity risk increased with increasing Pediatric Risk of Mortality III scores and then decreased at the highest Pediatric Risk of Mortality III values as potential morbidities became mortalities. The trichotomous model with covariate adjustments included age, admission source, diagnostic factors, baseline Functional Status Scale, and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score. The three-level goodness-of-fit test indicated satisfactory performance for the derivation and validation sets (p > 0.20). Predictive ability assessed with the volume under the surface was 0.50 ± 0.019 (derivation) and 0.50 ± 0.034 (validation) (vs chance performance = 0.17). Site-level standardized morbidity ratios were more variable than standardized mortality ratios. CONCLUSIONS New morbidities were associated with physiological status and can be modeled simultaneously with mortality. Trichotomous outcome models including both morbidity and mortality based on physiological status are suitable for research studies and quality and other outcome assessments. This approach may be applicable to other assessments presently based only on mortality.","Pollack, Murray M; Holubkov, Richard; Funai, Tomohiko; Berger, John T; Clark, Amy E; Meert, Kathleen; Berg, Robert A; Carcillo, Joseph; Wessel, David L; Moler, Frank; Dalton, Heidi; Newth, Christopher J L; Shanley, Thomas; Harrison, Rick E; Doctor, Allan; Jenkins, Tammara L; Tamburro, Robert; Dean, J Michael",Critical care medicine,300,1

Respiratory infection with B. pseudomallei leads to a fulminant and often fatal disease. It has previously been shown that glycoconjugate vaccines can provide significant protection against lethal challenge; however, the limited number of known Burkholderia antigens has slowed progress toward vaccine development. The objective of this study was to identify novel antigens and evaluate their protective capacity when incorporated into a nanoglycoconjugate vaccine platform. First, an in silico approach to identify antigens with strong predicted immunogenicity was developed. Protein candidates were screened and ranked according to predicted subcellular localization, transmembrane domains, adhesive properties, and ability to interact with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II. From these in silico predictions, we identified seven ""high priority"" proteins that demonstrated seroreactivity with anti-B. pseudomallei murine sera and convalescent human melioidosis sera, providing validation of our methods. Two novel proteins, together with Hcp1, were linked to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and incorporated with the surface of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP). Animals receiving AuNP glycoconjugate vaccines generated high protein- and polysaccharide-specific antibody titers. Importantly, immunized animals receiving the AuNP-FlgL-LPS alone or as a combination demonstrated up to 100% survival and reduced lung colonization following a lethal challenge with B. pseudomallei Together, this study provides a rational approach to vaccine design that can be adapted for other complex pathogens and provides a rationale for further preclinical testing of AuNP glycoconjugate in animal models of infection.","Muruato, Laura A; Tapia, Daniel; Hatcher, Christopher L; Kalita, Mridul; Brett, Paul J; Gregory, Anthony E; Samuel, James E; Titball, Richard W; Torres, Alfredo G",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,300,7

We performed a subgroup analysis on subjects enrolled within an extended time window in the Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Proximal Occlusion Ischemic Stroke (ESCAPE) trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-nine of 315 subjects (33 in the intervention group and 26 in the control group) were randomized in the ESCAPE trial between 5.5 and 12 hours after last seen healthy (likely to have groin puncture administered 6 hours after that). Treatment effect sizes for all relevant outcomes (90-day mRS shift, mRS 0-2, mRS 0-1, and 24-hour NIHSS scores and intracerebral hemorrhage) were reported using unadjusted and adjusted analyses. RESULTS There was no evidence of treatment heterogeneity between subjects in the early and late windows. Treatment effect favoring intervention was seen across all clinical outcomes in the extended time window (absolute risk difference of 19.3% for mRS 0-2 at 90 days). There were more asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage events within the intervention arm (48.5% versus 11.5%, P = .004) but no difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Patients with an extended time window could potentially benefit from endovascular treatment. Ongoing randomized controlled trials using imaging to identify late presenters with favorable brain physiology will help cement the paradigm of using time windows to select the population for acute imaging and imaging to select individual patients for therapy.","Evans, J W; Graham, B R; Pordeli, P; Al-Ajlan, F S; Willinsky, R; Montanera, W J; Rempel, J L; Shuaib, A; Brennan, P; Williams, D; Roy, D; Poppe, A Y; Jovin, T G; Devlin, T; Baxter, B W; Krings, T; Silver, F L; Frei, D F; Fanale, C; Tampieri, D; Teitelbaum, J; Iancu, D; Shankar, J; Barber, P A; Demchuk, A M; Goyal, M; Hill, M D; Menon, B K",AJNR.

On March the 11th the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with over 118,000 cases in more than 110 countries around the world. In response to the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, clinical trial research assessing the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are emerging at an unprecedented rate. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION After a priori protocol registration with PROSPERO (181483), a systematic research of the published literature was conducted on 24 April 2020 using Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), and WHO databases. Moreover, to explore the more recent literature we also searched the preprint server medRxiv. Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database for identifying relevant ongoing clinical trials. Thereafter we selected the articles according to the PRISMA guidelines. Animal or in-vitro experimental studies were excluded. Moreover editorials, commentaries, abstracts, reviews, book chapters, and articles not in English were not included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 pre-print articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials. Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19. The first group included phase I/II trials with different types of molecules (DNA or mRNA vaccine, bacterial plasmid or viral vectors), the latter were phase III/IV trials designed on the basis of a heterologous lymphocyte activation by the BCG vaccine. CONCLUSIONS This new disease is pushing the scientific community to develop swiftly a safe and effective vaccine. Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans. Our analysis reveals a worldwide effort of both scientists and enterprises to achieve one of the most challenging goals of our century.","Checcucci, Enrico; Piramide, Federico; Pecoraro, Angela; Amparore, Daniele; Campi, Riccardo; Fiori, Cristian; Elhage, Oussama; Kotecha, Pinky; Vyakarnam, Annapurna; Serni, Sergio; Dasgupta, Prokar; Porpiglia, Francesco",Panminerva medica,300,24

However, the powerful spectral representation in the field of image processing is rarely considered in these models. METHODS In this work, we propose to introduce frequency representation into convolution neural networks (CNNs) and design a novel model, tKFC-Net, to combine powerful feature representation in both frequency and spatial domains. Through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operation, frequency representation is employed on pooling, upsampling, and convolution without any adjustments to the network architecture. Furthermore, we replace original convolution with twin-Kernel Fourier Convolution (t-KFC), a new designed convolution layer, to specify the convolution kernels for particular functions and extract features from different frequency components. RESULTS We experimentally show that our method has an edge over other models in the task of medical image segmentation. Evaluated on four datasets-skin lesion segmentation (ISIC 2018), retinal blood vessel segmentation (DRIVE), lung segmentation (COVID-19-CT-Seg), and brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2019), the proposed model achieves outstanding results: the metric F1-Score is 0.878 for ISIC 2018, 0.8185 for DRIVE, 0.9830 for COVID-19-CT-Seg, and 0.8457 for BraTS 2019. CONCLUSION The introduction of spectral representation retains spectral features which result in more accurate segmentation. The proposed method is orthogonal to other topology improvement methods and very convenient to be combined.","Tang, Xianlun; Peng, Jiangping; Zhong, Bing; Li, Jie; Yan, Zhenfu",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,300,1

METHODS The procedure combines extensive circular liposuction with circular skin resection immediately under the dermis. We classify lower trunk deformities using three parameters: (1) excess skin (in the horizontal direction, or both horizontally and vertically); (2) the body mass index (BMI); and, (3) skin quality (hyperlaxity or a normal tone). All patients can be divided into four groups, of whom groups I and II are the best candidates for the Lipo-Bodylift procedure. We also describe our perioperative management and patient outcomes, with a focus on postoperative complications. RESULTS Between January 2015 and January 2020, 100 patients underwent Lipo-Bodylift treatment. The median patient age was 41 years. The median preoperative BMI was 26.3 kg/m2. The median drainage duration and hospital stay were both 3 days. Of all patients, 30% experienced at least one complication, 2% of which were major. Of the minor complications, 27 patients evidenced wound dehiscence. Only (positive) smoking status was significantly associated with postoperative complications (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION We developed the Lipo-Bodylift technique after analyzing changes in the skin and subcutaneous fat after massive weight loss. The technique completes the arsenal of body contouring techniques, appears to be less invasive than the undermining that is usually performed during circumferential reconstruction of the lower trunk, and is associated with a lower rate of major complications.

Overall, patients with vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency and sufficiency were 16.9%, 43.6% and 39.5%, respectively. The presence of comorbidity, length of hospitalization, ICU admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation requirement and overall complications were significantly more in patients with vitamin D deficiency (p-value < 0.001). 46.8% (51/109) of vitamin D deficient patients died due to the disease, whilst the mortality rate among insufficient and sufficient vitamin D groups was 29.4% (83/282) and 5.5% (14/255), respectively. In univariate analysis, age > 60 years (odds ratio (OR) = 6.1), presence of comorbidity (OR = 10.7), insufficient vitamin D status (OR = 7.2), and deficient vitamin D status (OR = 15.1) were associated with increase in COVID-19 mortality (p-value < 0.001). Finally, the multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities indicated vitamin D deficiency as an independent risk factor for mortality (OR = 3.3, p-value = 0.002).

The underlying mechanisms and risk factors are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine if the bladder wall structure affects the risk of bladder perforation during TUR. METHODS Fifteen patients who underwent TUR complicated by a bladder perforation (group 1) and fifteen matched controls who underwent uncomplicated TUR (group 2) were retrospectively enrolled in this morphological analysis. Surgical specimens were collected from all participating patients to describe the quality and architecture of urothelium and bladder submucosa. Immunohistochemical studies were performed with primary mouse anti-human E-cadherin, beta-catenin, type IV collagen, cytokeratin 20 and epithelial membrane antigen antibodies. The intensity of the immunohistochemical reaction was assessed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Ultrastructural examinations were performed by transmission electron microscopy. The microscopic assessment was focused on the intensity of fibrosis in the bladder submucosa and the presence of degenerative changes in the urothelium. RESULTS Patients' age, sex distribution, tumour diameters, surgeon experience or cancer stage did not differ between study groups. The immunohistochemical analysis did not reveal statistically significant differences between group 1 and group 2. From a clinical point of view, ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy showed a higher rate of severe fibrosis in group 1 (63.6% vs. 38.5%), with no differences in the rate and degree of urothelial changes. However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.32). CONCLUSIONS Bladder perforation during TUR is not a result of a deficient structure of the bladder wall. Based on available evidence, the surgical technique seems to play the most important role in its prevention.","Poletajew, Sławomir; Ilczuk, Tomasz; Krajewski, Wojciech; Niemczyk, Grzegorz; Cyran, Agata; Białek, Łukasz; Radziszewski, Piotr; Górnicka, Barbara; Kryst, Piotr",World journal of surgical oncology,300,28

This study aimed to compare the surgical and postoperative outcomes of laparoscopic colorectal resections with those of open surgery in the octogenarian population. METHODS Retrospective analysis based on a prospectively maintained database of octogenarians who underwent laparoscopic or open elective colorectal resections from 2001 to 2008 was performed. Diagnosis, comorbidities, operative data, and early postoperative complications are analyzed in this report. RESULTS Colon resection was performed for 199 octogenarians, using laparotomy for 116 patients (group 1) and laparoscopic surgery for 83 patients (group 2). The mean age was 84.3 years for the laparotomy patients and 84.7 years for the laparoscopic patients. The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) scores was comparable between groups 1 and 2. Colorectal adenoma was the most common indication for surgery in both groups: for 77.6% of the group 1 patients and 54.2% of the group 2 patients. Right colectomy was the most frequently performed operation in group 2: for 57.8% of the group 2 patients and 31% of the group 1 patients (p = 0.0003). Open resections had a higher mean blood loss in both group 1 (286 ml) and group 2 (152 ml) (p = 0.0002), and more patients required intraoperative transfusions (p = 0.005) despite similar operative times. The conversion rate in the laparoscopic group was 25.3%. The patients in the laparoscopic group had less morbidity, both overall and clinically, than the open group (p < 0.05). The median hospital stay was 8 days in group 1 and 6 days in group 2 (p = 0.0065). The rate of major surgical complications was similar in the two groups of patients: 6% in group 1 and 4.8% in group 2. The reoperation rate was 2.6% in group 1 and 3.6% in group 2 (p > 0.05). The mortality rate was 3.4% in group 1 and 2.4% in group 2. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic colorectal resection was effective and safe for octogenarians, with less blood loss and faster postoperative recovery.

However, reconstruction of the continuity of pancreas with end-to-end anastomosis after robotic central pancreatectomy has not been applied. In this study, we report surgical techniques for robotic central pancreatectomy with end-to-end anastomosis. The pancreas is reconstructed by duct-to-duct anastomosis of the pancreatic duct with a pancreatic stent inserted in the two stumps of pancreatic duct, and by end-to-end anastomosis of the pancreatic parenchyma. Compared with traditional central pancreatectomy with pancreaticoenteric anastomosis, this approach decreases the operative injury to the patient, and also conserves the integrity and continuity of the digestive duct and pancreatic duct. The robotic surgical system integrated with multiple instruments with flexible and precise movement is particularly suitable for the dissection and reconstruction of the pancreatic duct. We found that robotic central pancreatectomy with end-to-end anastomosis is safe and feasible, and we need more experience to evaluate its best indications and long-term outcomes.","Liu, Rong; Wang, Zi-Zheng; Gao, Yuan-Xing; Xu, Yong",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,300,24

STUDY DESIGN This was a cross-sectional survey among pregnant women enrolled in a prospective COVID-19 cohort study in Salt Lake City, UT, Birmingham, AL, and New York, NY, from August 9 to December 10, 2020. Women were eligible if they were 18 to 50 years old and <28 weeks of gestation. Upon enrollment, women completed surveys regarding concerns about COVID-19 illness and likelihood of getting COVID-19 vaccine if one were available during pregnancy. Vaccine acceptability was defined as a response of ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" on a 4-point Likert scale. Factors associated with vaccine acceptability were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Of 939 pregnant women eligible for the main cohort study, 915 (97%) consented to participate. Among these 915 women, 39% self-identified as White, 23% Black, 33% Hispanic, and 4% Other. Sixty-two percent received an influenza vaccine last season. Seventy-two percent worried about getting sick with COVID-19. If they were to get sick, 92% worried about harm to their pregnancy and 80% about harm to themselves. Only 41% reported they would get a vaccine. Of women who were unlikely to get vaccinated, the most frequently cited concern was vaccine safety for their pregnancy (82%). Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women had lower odds of accepting a vaccine compared with non-Hispanic White women (adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6 for both). Receipt of influenza vaccine during the previous season was associated with higher odds of vaccine acceptability (aOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.0). CONCLUSION Although most pregnant women worried about COVID-19 illness, <50% were willing to get vaccinated during pregnancy. Racial and ethnic disparities in plans to accept COVID-19 vaccine highlight the need to prioritize strategies to address perceived barriers among groups at high risk for COVID-19. KEY POINTS · Less than half of pregnant patients stated they would get a COVID-19 vaccine.. · Protecting their baby was the most common reason for acceptance and refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine.. · Patients of minority race/ethnicity and those without prior influenza vaccination were less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine..","Battarbee, Ashley N; Stockwell, Melissa S; Varner, Michael; Newes-Adeyi, Gabriella; Daugherty, Michael; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Tita, Alan T; Vorwaller, Kelly; Vargas, Celibell; Subramaniam, Akila; Reichle, Lawrence; Galang, Romeo R; Powers, Emily; Lucca-Susana, Miriam; Parks, Mickey; Chen, Tiffany J; Razzaghi, Hilda; Dawood, Fatimah S",American journal of perinatology,300,17

There remains sparse transparent reporting of model generalizability in different subpopulations especially for implemented systems. METHODS A prognostic study included adult admissions at a multi-site, academic medical center between 2015 and 2017. A predictive model for all-cause mortality (including initiation of hospice care) within 60 days of admission was developed. Model generalizability is assessed in temporal validation in the context of potential demographic bias. A subsequent prospective cohort study was conducted at the same sites between October 2018 and June 2019. Model performance during prospective validation was quantified with areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves stratified by site. Prospective results include timeliness, positive predictive value, and the number of actionable predictions. RESULTS Three years of development data included 128,941 inpatient admissions (94,733 unique patients) across sites where patients are mostly white (61%) and female (60%) and 4.2% led to death within 60 days. A random forest model incorporating 9614 predictors produced areas under the receiver operating characteristic and precision recall curves of 87.2 (95% CI, 86.1-88.2) and 28.0 (95% CI, 25.0-31.0) in temporal validation. Performance marginally diverges within sites as the patient mix shifts from development to validation (patients of one site increases from 10 to 38%). Applied prospectively for nine months, 41,728 predictions were generated in real-time (median [IQR], 1.3 [0.9, 32] minutes). An operating criterion of 75% positive predictive value identified 104 predictions at very high risk (0.25%) where 65% (50 from 77 well-timed predictions) led to death within 60 days. CONCLUSION Temporal validation demonstrates good model discrimination for 60-day mortality. Slight performance variations are observed across demographic subpopulations.

Although long tube (LT) placement and administration of Gastrografin through a nasogastric tube (NGT-G) have shown advantages over NGT alone in previous studies, no studies appear to have compared LT and NGT-G. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, patients with NSASBO were randomly assigned to receive LT or NGT-G between July 2016 and November 2018 at 11 Japanese institutions. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of NGT-G compared to LT for non-surgery rate, and the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the non-surgery rate (-15%) was set as the lower margin for inferiority of NGT-G compared to LT. RESULTS In total, 223 patients (LT group, n = 111; NGT-G group, n = 112) were analyzed in the present trial. The non-surgery rate was 87.4% in the LT group and 91.1% in the NGT-G group, with a 3.7% difference between NGT-G and LT (95.3%CI - 5.55 to 12.91; non-inferiority P = 0.00002923). On the other hand, the non-surgery rate with pure NGT-G alone (76.8%) that represents non-cross-over NGT-G without subsequent LT was significantly lower than that with LT (P = 0.039). Median procedure time was significantly shorter with NGT-G (1 min) than with LT (25 min; P < 0.001), whereas no significant differences in mortality or hospital stay were noted between groups. CONCLUSION NGT-G is an effective alternative to LT as a first-line treatment for NSASBO. A sequential strategy comprising NGT-G followed by LT might offer a new standard for NSASBO.

The method is increasingly being used to evaluate population-level interventions in epidemiology. While the original version can be used with bounded outcomes, it imposes strong constraints on the balancing weights to ensure that the counterfactuals are based solely on interpolation. This feature, while attractive from a causal inference perspective, is sometimes too conservative and can lead to unnecessary bias due to poor covariate balance. Alternatives exist that allow for extrapolation to improve balance, but existing procedures may produce negative estimates of the counterfactual outcomes and are therefore inappropriate for count data. We propose an alternative way to allow for extrapolation while ensuring that the estimated counterfactuals remain non-negative. Following a related proposal, we add a penalty to the balancing procedure that favors interpolation over extrapolation whenever possible. As we demonstrate theoretically and using empirical examples, our proposal can serve as a useful alternative when existing approaches yield demonstrably poor or unrealistic counterfactuals.

Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments-based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T-related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.","Banerjee, Rahul; Shah, Nina; Dicker, Adam P",JCO clinical cancer informatics,300,13

We aimed to characterize patients with recurrent disease by comparing the demographics, skin and mucosal involvement, seasonality, and treatment to those with single episodes (isolated MIRM). METHODS This retrospective case series screened all patients seen by our dermatology inpatient consult service from September 2014 to March 2020. Cases were selected based on laboratory and clinical criteria that confirmed a diagnosis of MIRM. RESULTS We identified 13 patients with MIRM: 5 who experienced recurrence (38%) and 8 with isolated, single episodes without recurrence. Mean age was 13.6 years for initial episodes in the recurrent patients compared to 11.7 in patients with isolated episodes. All 5 recurrent MIRM patients were male (compared with 75% of isolated MIRM patients) and predominantly Black (60%, compared with 25%). Most episodes overall (isolated and recurrent) occurred from the months of October to February. Recurrences after initial MIRM episode had less severe skin and mucosal findings, often involving only one mucous membrane, less frequent need for hospital admission, and shorter duration of hospital stay. Prophylactic treatments and treatments beyond supportive care were of unclear value. CONCLUSIONS Some characteristics of MIRM differ between patients with recurrent and isolated disease. Clinicians should be aware of the potential for recurrence, which occurred in 38% of our cohort. Although recurrences after initial MIRM episode tended to be less severe, there is still potential for prolonged hospitalizations with recurrent episodes.

Stent retrievers are accepted as the most effective devices for intracranial thrombectomy. OBJECTIVE To analyze the mechanical properties of stent retrievers, their behavior during retrieval, and interaction with different clots and to identify device features that might correlate with the effectiveness of thrombus removal. MATERIALS AND METHODS All stent retrievers available in France up to June 2015 were evaluated by mechanical and functional tests aimed at investigating the variation of their radial force and their behavior during retrieval. Devices were also tested during in vitro thrombectomies using white and red experimental thrombi produced with human blood. Functional tests and in vitro thrombectomies were conducted using a rigid 3D printed vascular model. RESULTS Mechanical tests showed a variation in radial force during retrieval for each stent. A constant radial force during retrieval was related to continuous cohesion over the vessel wall and a higher rate of clot removal efficacy. All stent retrievers failed when interacting with white large thrombi (diameter ≥6 mm). CONCLUSIONS None of the tested devices were effective in removing white clots of large diameter (≥6 mm). Constant radial force during retrieval allows constant cohesion to the vessel wall and pressure over the clot; such features allow for a higher rate of clot removal.","Machi, Paolo; Jourdan, Franck; Ambard, Dominique; Reynaud, Cedric; Lobotesis, Kyriakos; Sanchez, Mathieu; Bonafé, Alain; Costalat, Vincent",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,300,1

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a class of crucial regulators for gene expression and are involved in the regulation of virus defence and immunological processes. To understand miRNA regulation in chickens in response to IBV infection, high-throughput sequencing was performed to compare the small RNA libraries from the kidneys of chicken infected with SCK2, SCDY2 and LDT3-A. By comparing these data to healthy chickens, a total of 58 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified. The DE miRNAs were further classified into five miRNA expression patterns (up or down regulation compared to control). Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment prediction, the DE miRNAs were shown to be mostly associated with metabolic processes, catalytic activities, gene expression, binding activities and immune responses. Seven highly expressed miRNAs (gga-miR-30d, gga-miR-1454, gga-miR-7b, gga-miR-215-5p, gga-miR-1a-3p, gga-miR-3538 and gga-miR-2954) were selected for miRNA-mRNA conjoint analysis. Furthermore, the miRNAs inversely correlated with the corresponding target gene mRNAs. These seven miRNAs were considered to play an important role in IBV-host interactions and the differing virulence of IBV strains. This is the first demonstration that infection with different virulent IBVs elicits different expression of miRNAs in chicken kidneys; this expression also seems to be associated with the virulence of IBV. These results are significant for the study of immune responses to infection with different virulent IBVs mediated by miRNAs as well as the interaction between the chicken host and IBV.","Yang, Xin; Gao, Wenqian; Liu, Hui; Li, Jianan; Chen, Danyu; Yuan, Feng; Zhang, Zhikun; Wang, Hongning",Archives of virology,300,1

We analysed the available evidence to ascertain the effectiveness and safety of all types of medicinal cannabinoids in treating symptoms of various mental disorders. METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between Jan 1, 1980, and April 30, 2018. We also searched for unpublished or ongoing studies on ClinicalTrials.gov, the EU Clinical Trials Register, and the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry. We considered all studies examining any type and formulation of a medicinal cannabinoid in adults (≥18 years) for treating depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis, either as the primary condition or secondary to other medical conditions. We placed no restrictions on language, publication status, or study type (ie, both experimental and observational study designs were included). Primary outcomes were remission from and changes in symptoms of these mental disorders. The safety of medicinal cannabinoids for these mental disorders was also examined. Evidence from randomised controlled trials was synthesised as odds ratios (ORs) for disorder remission, adverse events, and withdrawals and as standardised mean differences (SMDs) for change in symptoms, via random-effects meta-analyses. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059372, CRD42017059373, CRD42017059376, CRD42017064996, and CRD42018102977). FINDINGS 83 eligible studies (40 randomised controlled trials, n=3067) were included: 42 for depression (23 randomised controlled trials; n=2551), 31 for anxiety (17 randomised controlled trials; n=605), eight for Tourette syndrome (two randomised controlled trials; n=36), three for ADHD (one randomised controlled trial; n=30), 12 for post-traumatic stress disorder (one randomised controlled trial; n=10), and 11 for psychosis (six randomised controlled trials; n=281). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) improved anxiety symptoms among individuals with other medical conditions (primarily chronic non-cancer pain and multiple sclerosis; SMD -0·25 [95% CI -0·49 to -0·01]; seven studies; n=252), although the evidence GRADE was very low. Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) worsened negative symptoms of psychosis in a single study (SMD 0·36 [95% CI 0·10 to 0·62]; n=24). Pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental disorders examined but did increase the number of people who had adverse events (OR 1·99 [95% CI 1·20 to 3·29]; ten studies; n=1495) and withdrawals due to adverse events (2·78 [1·59 to 4·86]; 11 studies; n=1621) compared with placebo across all mental disorders examined. Few randomised controlled trials examined the role of pharmaceutical CBD or medicinal cannabis. INTERPRETATION There is scarce evidence to suggest that cannabinoids improve depressive disorders and symptoms, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, or psychosis. There is very low quality evidence that pharmaceutical THC (with or without CBD) leads to a small improvement in symptoms of anxiety among individuals with other medical conditions. There remains insufficient evidence to provide guidance on the use of cannabinoids for treating mental disorders within a regulatory framework. Further high-quality studies directly examining the effect of cannabinoids on treating mental disorders are needed.

One method of ensuring standard patient care within these guidelines is through the implementation of telemedicine. AIMS To evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine for elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and/or rehabilitation period. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of articles in Medline/PubMed and The Cochrane Library databases was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines for prospective randomised controlled trials to compare clinical and symptomatic measures for elective patients managed routinely with remote care compared to those managed with standard in-clinic management. To be included for meta-analysis, parameters must be evaluated in ≥3 studies. RESULTS Eleven studies were included in the meta-analyses. Both telemedicine and control cohorts were comparable for patient satisfaction (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.90-1.07; I2 = 0%; p = 0.52) and patient retention analysis (RR, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.51-3.06; p = 0.54; I2 = 0%). Similarly, there was no statistical difference appreciated between cohorts for overall Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score (p = 0.30), Timed Up and Go Test (p = 0.40), and Stair Test (p = 0.18). Significant difference did exist for visual analogue scale (VAS) scores (p = 0.02) in favour of in-clinic management. CONCLUSION Telemedicine will serve an integral aspect of healthcare delivery throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond in an effort to deliver safe, efficient and time-sensitive care to the orthopaedic patient population. The results of our meta-analyses indicate that virtual consultations are as effective as traditional in-person consultations for the care of elective orthopaedic patients in the recovery and rehabilitation period. However, further studies are needed to evaluate for initial consultations and certain sub-specialties of orthopaedics.","McDonnell, J M; Ahern, D P; Ross, T D; Gibbons, D; Synnott, K A; Butler, J S",The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,300,17

Timely and accurate diagnosis is essential for the optimal management of pertussis, especially in severe cases. Methods Nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum specimens were obtained from patients suspected of having pertussis on the day of hospitalization at Shanghai Children's Medical Center from December 01, 2016, to November 30, 2017. The specimens were tested with the FilmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae). Results Among the 140 children studied, 50.0% (70/140) were detected with a single pathogen, 45.0% (63/140) were detected with multiple pathogens, and 5.0% (7/140) had no detected pathogens. Forty-nine (35%, 49/140) patients tested positive for B. pertussis. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (Para) and rhinovirus/enterovirus (Rhino/Entero) were the most prevalent pathogens in patients with pertussis-like syndrome. No significant differences between the groups with pertussis and pertussis-like syndrome were observed regarding the clinical symptoms. Severe cases were more frequently observed in unvaccinated, premature and pertussis/RSV co-infection patients. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of the timely and accurate diagnosis of pertussis based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory methods.","Tao, Yue; Tang, Mingyu; Luo, Lijuan; Xiang, Long; Xia, Yijun; Li, Biru; Cao, Qing; Mo, Xi",Annals of translational medicine,300,4

Production of proinflammatory neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been suggested to be a key factor in inducing a hyperinflammatory signaling cascade, allegedly causing both pulmonary tissue damage and peripheral inflammation. Accordingly, therapeutic blockage of neutrophil activation and NETosis, the cell death pathway accompanying NET formation, could limit respiratory damage and death from severe COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic glycopolymers that activate the neutrophil checkpoint receptor Siglec-9 suppress NETosis induced by agonists of viral toll-like receptors (TLRs) and plasma from patients with severe COVID-19. Thus, Siglec-9 agonism is a promising therapeutic strategy to curb neutrophilic hyperinflammation in COVID-19..","Delaveris, Corleone; Wilk, Aaron; Riley, Nicholas; Stark, Jessica; Yang, Samuel; Rogers, Angela; Ranganath, Thanmayi; Nadeau, Kari; Blish, Catherine; Bertozzi, Carolyn",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,300,1

Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in patients with COPD. Previous studies have not demonstrated a beneficial effect of vitamin D on exacerbation rate in COPD patients. However, subgroup analyses suggested protective effects in vitamin D deficient patients. Our objective is to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate specifically in vitamin D deficient COPD patients. METHODS/DESIGN We will perform a randomised, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study. The study population consists of 240 COPD patients aged 40 years and older with vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration < 50 nmol/L). Participants will be recruited after an exacerbation and will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or placebo orally once a week during 1 year. Participants will receive a diary card to register the incidence of exacerbations and changes in medication during the study period. Visits will be performed at baseline, at 6 months and at 12 months after randomisation. Participants will undergo spirometry, measurement of total lung capacity and assessment of maximal respiratory mouth pressure. Several physical performance and hand grip strength tests will be performed, questionnaires on quality of life and physical activity will be filled in, a nasal secretion sample and swab will be obtained and blood samples will be taken. The primary outcome will be exacerbation rate. DISCUSSION This study will be the first RCT aimed at the effects of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in vitamin D deficient COPD patients. Also, in contrast to earlier studies that used infrequent dosing regimens, our trial will study effects of a weekly dose of vitamin D supplementation. Secondly, the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D on host immune response of COPD patients and underlying mechanisms will be studied. Finally, the effects on physical functioning will be examined.

DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING Acute-care academic hospital. PARTICIPANTS A total of 59 HCWs agreed to have their PPE, clothing, and/or skin swabbed for virus measurement. METHODS The PPE worn by HCW participants, including glove, face mask, gown, and personal stethoscope, were swabbed with Copan swabs. After PPE doffing, bodies and clothing of HCWs were sampled with Copan swabs: hand, face, and scrubs. Preamplification and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were used to quantify viral RNA copies in the swab samples. RESULTS Overall, 31% of glove samples, 21% of gown samples, and 12% of face mask samples were positive for virus. Among the body and clothing sites, 21% of bare hand samples, 11% of scrub samples, and 7% of face samples were positive for virus. Virus concentrations on PPE were not statistically significantly different than concentrations on skin and clothing under PPE. Virus concentrations on the personal stethoscopes and on the gowns were positively correlated with the number of torso contacts (P < .05). Virus concentrations on face masks were positively correlated with the number of face mask contacts and patient contacts (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Healthcare workers are routinely contaminated with respiratory viruses after patient care, indicating the need to ensure that HCWs complete hand hygiene and use other PPE to prevent dissemination of virus to other areas of the hospital.

These were discussed as a team and with other stakeholder groups for feasibility. A consensus approach was used. Stakeholder input changed many aspects of the study including: the care model that treated stroke as a chronic condition after hospital discharge, training for hospital-based providers who often lacked awareness of the barriers to recovery that patients face, support for caregivers who were essential for stroke patients' recovery, and for community-based health and social service providers whose services can support recovery yet often go underutilized. Stakeholders brought value to both pragmatic research and health service delivery.

However, only a few studies have examined their impact on the dispersion of droplets and aerosols, which are both thought to be significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19. METHODS Two commonly used barrier devices, an intubation box and a clear plastic intubation sheet, were evaluated using a physiologically accurate cough simulator. Aerosols were modeled using a commercially available fog machine, and droplets were modeled with fluorescein dye. Both particles were propelled by the cough simulator in a simulated intubation environment. Data were captured by high-speed flash photography, and aerosol and droplet dispersion were assessed qualitatively with and without a barrier in place. RESULTS Droplet contamination after a simulated cough was seemingly contained by both barrier devices. Simulated aerosol escaped the barriers and flowed toward the head of the bed. During barrier removal, simulated aerosol trapped underneath was released and propelled toward the HCW at the head of the bed. Usage of the intubation sheet concentrated droplets onto a smaller area. If no barrier was used, positioning the patient in slight reverse Trendelenburg directed aerosols away from the HCW located at the head of the bed. CONCLUSIONS Our observations imply that intubation boxes and sheets may reduce HCW exposure to droplets, but they both may merely redirect aerosolized particles, potentially resulting in increased exposure to aerosols in certain circumstances. Aerosols may remain within the barrier device after a cough, and manipulation of the box may release them. Patients should be positioned to facilitate intubation, but slight reverse Trendelenburg may direct infectious aerosols away from the HCW. Novel barrier devices should be used with caution, and further validation studies are necessary.","Fried, Eric A; Zhou, George; Shah, Ronak; Shin, Da Wi; Shah, Anjan; Katz, Daniel; Burnett, Garrett W",Anesthesia and analgesia,300,5

A ""complex systems approach"" has been advocated to account for real world complexity. Qualitative methods may be well suited to understanding change in complex social environments, but guidance on applying a complex systems approach to inform qualitative research remains limited and underdeveloped. This systematic review aims to analyze published examples of process evaluations that utilize qualitative methods that involve a complex systems perspective and proposes a framework for qualitative complex system process evaluations. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a systematic search to identify complex system process evaluations that involve qualitative methods by searching electronic databases from January 1, 2014-September 30, 2019 (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), citation searching, and expert consultations. Process evaluations were included if they self-identified as taking a systems- or complexity-oriented approach, integrated qualitative methods, reported empirical findings, and evaluated public health interventions. Two reviewers independently assessed each study to identify concepts associated with the systems thinking and complexity science traditions. Twenty-one unique studies were identified evaluating a wide range of public health interventions in, for example, urban planning, sexual health, violence prevention, substance use, and community transformation. Evaluations were conducted in settings such as schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods in 13 different countries (9 high-income and 4 middle-income). All reported some utilization of complex systems concepts in the analysis of qualitative data. In 14 evaluations, the consideration of complex systems influenced intervention design, evaluation planning, or fieldwork. The identified studies used systems concepts to depict and describe a system at one point in time. Only 4 evaluations explicitly utilized a range of complexity concepts to assess changes within the system resulting from, or co-occurring with, intervention implementation over time. Limitations to our approach are including only English-language papers, reliance on study authors reporting their utilization of complex systems concepts, and subjective judgment from the reviewers relating to which concepts featured in each study. CONCLUSION This study found no consensus on what bringing a complex systems perspective to public health process evaluations with qualitative methods looks like in practice and that many studies of this nature describe static systems at a single time point. We suggest future studies use a 2-phase framework for qualitative process evaluations that seek to assess changes over time from a complex systems perspective. The first phase involves producing a description of the system and identifying hypotheses about how the system may change in response to the intervention. The second phase involves following the pathway of emergent findings in an adaptive evaluation approach.","McGill, Elizabeth; Marks, Dalya; Er, Vanessa; Penney, Tarra; Petticrew, Mark; Egan, Matt",PLoS medicine,300,19

The nucleocapsid (N) protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major immunogenic protein that can induce protective immunity. To screen for potential T-cell epitopes on IBV N protein, forty overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. Four T-cell epitope peptides were identified by IFN-γ ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, and CFSE lymphocyte proliferation assays; among them, three peptides (N211-230, N271-290, and N381-400) were CTL epitopes, and one peptide (N261-280) was a dual-specific T-cell epitope, which can be recognized by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Multi-epitope gene transcription cassettes comprising four neutralizing epitope domains and four T-cell epitope peptides were synthesized and inserted into the genome of Newcastle disease virus strain La Sota between the P and M genes. Recombinant IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT was generated via reverse genetics, and its immune protection efficacy was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free chickens. Our results show that rLa Sota/SBNT induced IBV-specific neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses and provided significant protection against homologous and heterologous IBV challenge. Thus, the T-cell epitope peptides identified in this study could be good candidates for IBV vaccine development, and recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing IBV multi-epitope genes represents a safe and effective vaccine candidate for controlling infectious bronchitis. IMPORTANCE T-cell-mediated immune responses are critical for the elimination of IBV-infected cells. To screen conserved T-cell epitopes in the IBV N protein, forty overlapping peptides covering the entirety of the N protein were designed and synthesized. By combining IFN-γ ELISpot, intracellular cytokine staining, and CFSE lymphocyte proliferation assays, we identified three CTL epitopes and one dual-specific T-cell epitope. The value of T-cell epitope peptides identified in the N protein was further verified by the design of an IBV multi-epitope vaccine. Results show that IBV multi-epitope vaccine candidate rLa Sota/SBNT provided cross protection against challenges with a QX-like or a TW-like IBV strain. So T-cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the control of viral infection and conserved T-cell epitopes serve as promising candidates for use in multi-epitope vaccine construction. Our results provide a new perspective for the development of a safer and more effective IBV vaccine.","Qin, Yifeng; Tu, Kaihang; Teng, Qingyuan; Feng, Delan; Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Guozhong",Journal of virology,300,1

Although far-reaching prevention measures such as the increase of intensive care capacities and drastic restrictions of public life have so far been able to avert an overload of the German health care system, the current situation implies an exceptionally high burden on medical professionals. The current study presents the results of an opinion evaluation among 513 pneumology specialists in Germany in the period from March 27th to April 11th, 2020. While the majority of respondents stated that Germany was ""well"" prepared for the pandemic, this assessment was significantly worse among participants from the outpatient sector compared to the hospital sector (p < 0.001). Furthermore, a lack of medical protective equipment was reported significantly more frequently by respondents from the outpatient sector (p < 0.001). The importance of telemedicine approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic was rated ""high"" (35.2 %) or ""very high"" (17.2 %) by most pneumology professionals, with participants from the hospital sector giving a higher rating (p < 0.001). Finally, 45.8 % of the respondents expressed a ""negative"" influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their personal mood and 58.3 % expressed ""strong"" or ""very strong"" concerns about the health of their fellow human beings. This assessment was significantly stronger among female participants and participants from the nursing sector (p < 0.001). In summary, the current study analyses for the first time the professional and personal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pneumology professionals in Germany. The results could help to identify first starting points to better support health professionals during the current and future challenges.","Peine, A; Paffenholz, P; Hellmich, M; Martin, L; Roderburg, C; Heidenreich, A; Marx, G; Trautwein, C; Luedde, T; Loosen, S H",Pneumologie,300,16

The posterior compartment is repaired using a second mesh or a procedure along with LLS, such as posterior colporrhaphy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical results of LLS for POP using a five-arm mesh instead of a T-shaped mesh graft to repair the defect of the posterior compartment in addition to the apical and anterior compartments. METHODS Data from 37 patients with a diagnosis of advanced-stage (≥ 3) POP undergoing LLS with the use of a five-arm mesh were retrospectively analysed. Pre-operative and post-operative examinations and, surgical outcomes were determined. The results of measurements and examinations, reoperation rates, erosion rates, lower urinary tract symptoms, and complications were analysed. The Prolapse Quality of Life Questionnaire (P-QOL) was also used. RESULTS The median post-operative follow-up was 20 (13-34) months. There was a significant improvement in POP-Q scores in all treated compartments, with overall objective cure rates of 94.5% for the apical compartment, 86.4% for the anterior compartment, and 91.8% for the posterior compartment. The median operative time was 96 (76-112) minutes. The median length of hospitalization was 2 (1-3) days. A significant improvement in vaginal bulge, urinary urgency, incomplete voiding, urinary frequency, and constipation was observed after surgery. The sexuality among patients increased from 13 (35.1%) preoperatively to 22 (59.4%) post-operatively. De novo stress urinary incontinence developed in 7 (18.9%) patients. The P-QOL scores improved significantly after surgery. CONCLUSIONS In advanced-stage POP patients, the posterior compartment damage can also be repaired in LLS with the use of a single five-arm mesh without the need for an additional procedure, and the recurrence rate can be reduced.","Akbaba, Eren; Sezgin, Burak",BMC women's health,300,1

This mode of medication is often done with the help of African traditional medicines. Because of the misconception that African traditional medicines can cure/prevent all diseases, some Africans may opt for COVID-19 prevention and management by self-medicating. Thus to efficiently predict the dynamics of COVID-19 in Africa, the role of the self-medicated population needs to be taken into account. In this paper, we formulate and analyse a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 in Cameroon. The model is represented by a system of compartmental age-structured ODEs that takes into account the self-medicated population and subdivides the human population into two age classes relative to their current immune system strength. We use our model to propose policy measures that could be implemented in the course of an epidemic in order to better handle cases of self-medication.","Kong, Jude D; Tchuendom, Rinel F; Adeleye, Samuel A; David, Jummy F; Admasu, Fikreab Solomon; Bakare, Emmanuel A; Siewe, Nourridine",Journal of biological dynamics,300,1

To further quantify on-body path loss, measurements for five different on-body scenarios are presented as well. To compensate for the effect of often large path losses, two mitigation strategies to (dynamically) improve on-body links are introduced and experimentally verified: beam steering using a phased array, and usage of on-body RF repeaters. The results of this study can serve as a tool for WBAN designers to aid in the selection of the right RF frequency and technology for their application.","Thielens, Arno; Benarrouch, Robin; Wielandt, Stijn; Anderson, Matthew G; Moin, Ali; Cathelin, Andreia; Rabaey, Jan M",Sensors,300,1

The aim of the current study was to investigate how the pandemic has affected the burnout, stress, and emotional well-being of pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) providers and staff in the New York and New Jersey epicenter. METHODS The study was conducted in June 2020 during the pandemic through an electronic survey. The survey contained questions surrounding demographics, pandemic experiences, and validated burnout, stress, and emotional well-being measures. RESULTS Two hundred fifty-two PHO providers and staff responded to the survey. Overall, half of the participants reported high levels of burnout, average stress scores were in the mild-moderate range, and the majority scored in the none-to-mild symptomatology range for their well-being. Self-reported burnout levels before the pandemic and geographic work location were statistically significant risk factors for all outcomes. Additional predictors for some outcomes included hospital role, lack of trust in leadership, and deployment. The majority of participants (87.0%) reported that their hospitals had made mental health resources related to COVID-19 available to them but only 8.4% reported having used them. CONCLUSION PHO providers and staff in the NYC/NJ area are experiencing a range of emotional experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the majority are not using current resources. With the continuation of the pandemic, we must continue efforts to improve provider and staff distress to mitigate the degree of potential negative short-term and long-term impact.","Moerdler, Scott; Steinberg, Dara M; Jin, Zhezhen; Cole, Peter D; Levy, Adam S; Rosenthal, Susan L",JCO oncology practice,300,26

However, the immobilization of biologically active proteins on a gold carrier technique with the ability to detect viral or bacterial nucleic acids is individual for each DNA-modifying enzyme group, due to a different number of active sites, C and N terminal locations and arrangement, therefore, individual protocols based on the 'masking' of active sites should be elaborated for each enzyme.","Dronina, Julija; Bubniene, Urte Samukaite; Ramanavicius, Arunas",Biosensors & bioelectronics,300,1

In the early days of laparoscopic surgery, capacitive coupling, associated with hybrid trocars, was thought to be the major cause of laparoscopic electrosurgery injuries. Modern laparoscopy has reduced capacitive coupling, and now insulation failure is thought to be the main cause of electrosurgical complications. The aim of this study was (1) to determine the incidence of insulation failures, (2) to compare the incidence of insulation failure in reusable and disposable instruments, and (3) to determine the location of insulation failures. METHODS At four major urban hospitals, reusable laparoscopic instruments were checked for insulation failure using a high-voltage porosity detector. Disposable L-hooks were collected following laparoscopic cholecystectomy and similarly evaluated for insulation failure. Instruments were determined to have insulation failure if 2.5 kV crossed the instrument's insulation to create a closed loop circuit. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact or chi(2) analysis (*denotes significance set at p < 0.05). RESULTS Two hundred twenty-six laparoscopic instruments were tested (165 reusable). Insulation failure occurred more often in reusable (19%; 31/165) than in disposable instruments (3%; 2/61; *p < 0.01). When reusable sets were evaluated, 71% (12/17) were found to have at least one instrument with insulation failure. Insulation failure incidence in reusable instruments was similar between hospitals that routinely checked for insulation failure (19%; 25/130) and hospitals that do not routinely check for insulation failures (33%; 7/21; p = 0.16). Insulation failure was most common in the distal third of the instruments (54%; 25/46) compared to the middle or proximal third of the instruments (*p < 0.05). CONCLUSION One in five reusable laparoscopic instruments has insulation failure; a finding that is not altered by whether the hospital routinely checks for insulation defects. Disposable instruments have a lower incidence of insulation failure. The distal third of laparoscopic instruments is the most common site of insulation failure.","Montero, Paul N; Robinson, Thomas N; Weaver, John S; Stiegmann, Greg V",Surgical endoscopy,300,16

MATERIAL AND METHODS We analyzed retrospectively 236 total and subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomies done by two surgeons from the time they first performed the procedure. The interventions were classified in three groups based on the surgeon's experience: the first 75 hysterectomies (""novice period""), the subsequent 75 hysterectomies (""intermediate""), and the subsequent 86 hysterectomies (""routine period""). RESULTS Patient's characteristics changed as surgeons gained experience, with more complex operations (greater obesity, previous surgery and malignant disease) becoming more frequent. During the second group of operations when surgeons had an intermediate level of experience, the risk of major complications decreased (adjusted odds ratio: 0.28, 95% confidence interval: 0.10-0.85), as did the risk of type III complications of Clavien-Dindo classification (adjusted odds ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval: 0.03-0.93). However, the percent rate of conversion to laparotomy remained stable in the second (intermediate experience) group. In the third group, after the surgeons had performed 150 procedures and when the risk of any type of complication was lowest, the risk of conversion to laparotomy decreased compared to the routine group. CONCLUSIONS The surgeon's experience in performing laparoscopic hysterectomy plays an essential role in the decrease in the risk of complications, and this finding supports the importance of providing appropriate training for residents and gynecologists to enable them to perform this procedure with an optimal degree of competence and safety.","Naveiro-Fuentes, M; Rodríguez-Oliver, A; Fernández-Parra, J; González-Paredes, A; Aguilar-Romero, T; Mozas-Moreno, J",Journal of gynecology obstetrics and human reproduction,300,7

Staple line and anastomotic leakage are the most feared postoperative complications after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Traditional treatment options like revisional surgery and endoscopic stent placement are associated with high morbidity and mortality as well as variable success rates. Endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) has shown to be a new successful and feasible treatment option for leaks of different etiology after major gastro-esophageal surgery. METHOD We report a case of the EVT principle being applied in a patient with three major leaks located apart from each other within the gastric staple line after LSG for morbid obesity (BMI 62.7). EVT was initiated on postoperative day 8. RESULTS In total, 18 endoscopic interventions were performed in 72 days, the vacuum sponge being replaced endoscopically every 4 days. Hospital length of stay was 106 days. No relevant procedure related complications were observed during the course of therapy and during the follow up. CONCLUSION EVT of postoperative leaks in the upper GI tract has been shown to be feasible and safe. It combines defect closure and effective drainage and allows a periodic inspection of the wound cavity. In case of therapeutic failure, it does not jeopardize surgical repair or stent placement. Even though the techniques and materials used in EVT still vary considerably according to local expertise, EVT has the potential to succeed as a nonsurgical, feasible, safe, and effective treatment option for postoperative leaks in bariatric surgery.","Schmidt, Fabian; Mennigen, Rudolf; Vowinkel, Thorsten; Neumann, Philipp A; Senninger, Norbert; Palmes, Daniel; Laukoetter, Mike G",Obesity surgery,300,1

Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is frequently used as a bedside-tool for diagnosis and management of respiratory failure among critically ill lung transplant recipients (LTRs). We study the indications, results, therapeutic impact, and complications of FB in LTRs admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU). METHODS Retrospective chart review was performed for all critically ill LTRs undergoing FB while admitted to MICU at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2009 and 2011. ICD-9 codes for bronchoscopy were used to identify patients. The procedures were categorized as: (i) airway examination and interventions, (ii) microbiological, and (iii) histopathologic diagnosis. SAS version 9.2 was used for analysis. RESULTS A cohort of 76 LTRs accounted for 93 hospital admissions, 101 MICU admissions, and 129 bronchoscopies. FB was helpful in evaluation and management of airway complications [secretion clearance (18% bronchoscopy procedures), stenosis/dehiscence (8% patients)] and optimizing management of lower respiratory tract infections. Isolation of resistant gram-negative organisms, community-acquired respiratory viruses, and fungi commonly led to modification in antimicrobial therapy (35% microbiological samples). Nonspecific finding of acute lung injury was the most commonly seen histopathology (70%) on transbronchial biopsy. Twenty percent (4/20) of transbronchial biopsies showed acute cellular rejection, with 1 episode contributing to respiratory failure. Occasional hypoxia and hypotension, but no deaths, were noted due to FB during the ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS Use of FB modified clinical management in one third of airway evaluation and microbiological sampling procedures for critically ill LTRs. No fatalities were attributed to bronchoscopy in this critically ill population.","Mohanka, Manish R; Mehta, Atul C; Budev, Marie M; Machuzak, Michael S; Gildea, Thomas R",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,300,17

A survey was carried out with on-site application with 226 home kitchens' food handlers in the Federal District, Brazil to evaluate Brazilian home kitchens' good practices. Of the home kitchen food handlers, most of them were female (64.6%), had completed undergraduate education (29.2%), and were 45-59 years old (23.5%). The visited households had an average of 3.38 ± 1.48 residents that ate some of their meals at home, and 40% declared the monthly family income to be between 5 and 15 Brazilian minimum wages (MW). Regarding the reliability of the instrument, from the KR-20 test, it was verified that the instrument presents good internal consistency (α = 0.758). According to the instrument classification, the home kitchens' sample was considered as at a medium risk of food contamination (46.5% of them presented from 51 to 75% of conformities to the instrument). There was a statistical difference between house-kitchens with a family income from zero to one minimum wage (MW) and those receiving from 5 to 15 MW (p = 0.017), as well as between those from zero to one MW and who earn above 15 MW (p = 0.009).

Additionally, a novel electrochemical sensor is constructed by using Ag/AgVO3/N-rGO on screen-printed carbon paste electrodes for the detection of antiviral drug levofloxacin (LEV) which is used as a primary antibiotic in controlling COVID-19. Using differential pulse voltammetry, LEV is determined with a low detection limit of 0.00792 nm for a linear range of 0.09-671 μM with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 152.19 μA μM-1 cm-2.

Methods: Baseline demographics and clinicopathological data of eligible patients were retrieved from medical records. Information of clinical manifestations, history of epidemiology, lab tests and chest CT scan images of visiting patients from February 13 to February 28 were collected. Literatures about pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients were searched from databases including PUBMED, EMBASE and CNKI. Results: Among the 139 cancer patients underwent chest CT scans before chemotherapy, pulmonary infiltrates were identified in eight patients (5.8%), five of whom were characterized as GGOs in lungs. 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing was performed in three patients and the results were negative. One case was a 66-year-old man diagnosed as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent CHOP chemotherapy regimen. His chest CT scan image displayed multiple GGOs in lungs and the complete blood count showed decreased lymphocytes. This patient denied any contact with confirmed/suspected cases of 2019-nCoV infection and without fever and other respiratory symptoms. Considering the negative result of nuclear acid testing, this patient was presumptively diagnosed as viral pneumonia and an experiential anti-infection treatment had been prescribed for him. Conclusions: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complicates the clinical scenario of pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients. The epidemic history, clinical manifestation, CT scan image and lab test should be combined consideration. The 2019-nCoV nuclear acid testing might be applicated in more selected patients. Active anti-infection treatment and surveillance of patient condition should be initiated if infectious disease is considered.","Zhu, W J; Wang, J; He, X H; Qin, Y; Yang, S; Hu, X S; Wang, H Y; Huang, J; Zhou, A P; Ma, F; Shi, Y K; Zhou, S Y",Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],300,1

However, the ultimate aesthetic appearance is dictated by how the soft tissue envelope drapes over the altered skeletal foundation. Intraoperative and postoperative fat grafting enhances the final aesthetic result in patients who undergo skeletal aesthetic procedures. OBJECTIVES The authors describe cases in which selective fat grafting has been successful in optimizing facial soft tissue symmetry in patients undergoing skeletal aesthetic surgery of the face. METHODS A retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent aesthetic skeletal surgery of the face between November 1, 2003, and October 31, 2011, in the Department of Surgery at Georgetown University Hospital was performed, and any patient who required fat grafting either at the time of aesthetic facial skeletal surgery or in the postoperative period was identified (n = 21). Common indications for fat grafting and the surgical plans are reviewed and presented in this article. RESULTS Twenty-one patients were identified who required 37 fat grafting procedures either at the time of aesthetic skeletal surgery of the face or in the postoperative period. The procedures most frequently requiring fat grafting were genioplasty, facial shape modifications, and facial symmetry improvement. Fat grafting most commonly corrected irregularities or asymmetries and improved the soft tissue contour overlying repositioned bone or alloplastic implants. Most patients were female (72%) with a mean age of 42 years (range, 4-58 years). There were 4 complications in total: 3 surgical site infections (managed conservatively in 1 patient and with incision and drainage in the remaining 2) and 1 hematoma requiring drainage and closure on the day of surgery. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge of which procedures are likely to require fat grafting and the techniques for doing so can improve the plastic surgeon's ability to provide optimal aesthetic results following facial skeletal alterations.","Endara, Matthew R; Allred, Lindsay Jones; Han, Kevin D; Baker, Stephen B",Aesthetic surgery journal,300,12

Sixty children were randomly allocated to laryngeal mask, cuffed tracheal tube or uncuffed tracheal tube. The average mean (maximum) sevoflurane concentrations within the surgeons' operating area were 1.05 (10.05) ppm in the laryngeal mask group, 0.33 (1.44) ppm in the cuffed tracheal tube group and 1.79 (18.02) ppm in the uncuffed tracheal tube group, (p < 0.001), laryngeal mask and cuffed tracheal tube groups vs. uncuffed tube group.

Thus, an overview was conducted including all systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated women who received corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy to prevent RDS. Therefore, a search strategy was developed using the terms ""respiratory distress syndrome, newborn,"" ""corticosteroids,"" ""perinatal death,"" ""neonatal death,"" ""neonate,"" and ""pregnancy."" The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and Google Scholar, for studies published until June 2020. We identified 354 references, 38 of which were relevant after the initial screening. Ten systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. For RDS, 1522 cases occurred in the control group composed of 8716 participants, while in the intervention group was 1088 in 8740 participants (RR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.60-0.75). For neonatal death, 343 cases occurred in 5248 participants of the control group, while in the intervention group, there were 227 cases in 5246 participants (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.56-0.78).

We describe the current state of national and local protocols for managing neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. METHODS Care providers from neonatal intensive care units on six continents exchanged and compared protocols on the management of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers. Data collection was between March 14 and 21, 2020. We focused on central protocol components, including triaging, hygiene precautions, management at delivery, feeding protocols, and visiting policies. RESULTS Data from 20 countries were available. Disease burden varied between countries at the time of analysis. In most countries, asymptomatic infants were allowed to stay with the mother and breastfeed with hygiene precautions. We detected discrepancies between national guidance in particular regarding triaging, use of personal protection equipment, viral testing, and visitor policies. Local protocols deviated from national guidance. CONCLUSIONS At the start of the pandemic, lack of evidence-based guidance on the management of neonates born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers has led to ad hoc creation of national and local guidance. Compliance between collaborators to share and discuss protocols was excellent and may lead to more consensus on management, but future guidance should be built on high-level evidence, rather than expert consensus. IMPACT At the rapid onset of the COVID19 pandemic, all countries presented protocols in place for managing infants at risk of COVID19, with a certain degree of variations among regions. A detailed review of ad hoc guidelines is presented, similarities and differences are highlighted. We provide a broad overview of currently applied recommendations highlighting the need for international context-relevant coordination.","Lavizzari, Anna; Klingenberg, Claus; Profit, Jochen; Zupancic, John A F; Davis, Alexis S; Mosca, Fabio; Molloy, Eleanor J; Roehr, Charles C",Pediatric research,300,16

The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of 3 different dynamic CT angiography parameters, occlusion length, collateralization extent, and time delay to maximum enhancement, for latest generation of stent retriever thrombectomy recanalization outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this study, subjects were selected from an initial cohort of 2059 consecutive patients who had undergone multiparametric CT, including whole-brain CT perfusion. We included all patients with a complete occlusion of the M1 segment of the MCA or the carotid T and subsequent intra-arterial stent retriever thrombectomy. Dynamic CT angiography was reconstructed from whole-brain CT perfusion raw datasets. Angiographic outcome was scored by using the modified TICI scale; and clinical outcome, by using the modified Rankin Scale. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine independent predictors of a favorable angiographic (mTICI = 3) and clinical outcome (mRS ≤2). RESULTS Sixty-nine patients (mean age, 68 ± 14 years; 46% men) were included for statistical analysis. In the regression analysis, a short occlusion length was an independent predictor of favorable angiographic outcome (OR, 0.41; P < .05). Both collateralization grade (OR, 1.00; P > .05) and time delay to peak enhancement (OR, 0.90; P > .05) failed to predict a favorable angiographic outcome. None of the dynamic CT angiography predictors were significantly associated with clinical outcome on discharge (OR, 0.664-1.011; P = .330-.953) or at 90 days (OR, 0.779-1.016; P = .130-.845). CONCLUSIONS A short occlusion length as determined by dynamic CT angiography is an independent predictor of a favorable angiographic outcome of stent retriever thrombectomy in patients with ischemic stroke.","Thierfelder, K M; Sommer, W H; Ertl-Wagner, B; Beyer, S E; Meinel, F G; Kunz, W G; Buchholz, G; Reiser, M F; Janssen, H",AJNR.

We analyzed the gene co-expression networks (GCNs) derived from an aging signature of 130 immune-related genes obtained from CD3+ T-cell splenocytes extracted from FVB/N, C57BL/6N, and BALB/c mice at ages 2 and 22- 24 months. The network structure for the two different mouse age-groups was derived and subsequently analyzed. Analysis of network hubs using clustering coefficients, degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and closeness centralities, as well as local, indirect, and total influence measures, demonstrated changes in gene behavior and network control between the two age groups. Our quantification shows that the young, 2-month old mouse network is more organized than the 22-24-month, old mouse network, while the network structure of the older mouse GCN appears to be far more complicated but far more dispersed. Changes in network structure between the old and young mice suggest deterioration in transcription regulation with age in peripheral T- cells, particularly within the TCR signaling pathway, and potential compensatory mechanisms in older T-cells to overcome loss to regular function resulting from transcriptional irregularity. These results demonstrate the need for more research into gene co-expression in peripheral T-cells in order to better understand both network irregularities and the phenotypic dysfunction observed in older individuals. Author Summary In order to better understand the potential mechanisms of transcriptional irregularities in the immune system with aging, we analyzed the structure of gene co-expression networks of T-cells extracted from the spleens of 2 and 22-24-month old mice. Gene co-expression describes the correlation relationship between two expressed genes; as the expression of one gene goes up, the expression of another gene might also increase (or, conversely, decrease). Strong gene co- expression relationships can signal the existence of a number of important biological phenomena, such as two genes belonging to a transcription pathway or protein structure. Network diagrams visualizing these co-expression relationships in both younger and older mice demonstrated the existence of differences in network structure and properties that may be attributed to the aging of the immune system. Network mathematical methods were used to examine the complexity of each network. We found that the younger mouse network was more organized than the older mouse network. The older mouse group exhibited a 255% increase in co-expression relationships but a decrease of 92% of the connections from the young mouse network. This suggests the older mouse T-cells suffer dysfunction at a transcriptional level. This results in the loss of regular immune and cellular functions. These results demonstrate the importance of future research into gene co-expression to decipher senescence or diseases that perturb gene expression through time.","Mair, Megan L.; Tchitcheck, Nicolas; Witten, Tarynn M.; Thomas-Vaslin, Véronique",bioRxiv,300,1

Locusts are short horned grasshoppers that exhibit two behaviour types depending on their local population density. These are; solitarious, where they will actively avoid other locusts, and gregarious where they will seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts can form massive and destructive flying swarms or plagues. However, these swarms are usually preceded by the formation of hopper bands by the juvenile wingless locust nymphs. It is thus important to understand the hopper band formation process to control locust outbreaks. On longer time-scales, environmental conditions such as rain events synchronize locust lifecycles and can lead to repeated outbreaks. On shorter time-scales, changes in resource distributions at both small and large spatial scales have an effect on locust gregarisation. It is these short time-scale locust-resource relationships and their effect on hopper band formation that are of interest. In this paper we investigate not only the effect of food on both the formation and characteristics of locust hopper bands but also a possible evolutionary explanation for gregarisation in this context. We do this by deriving a multi-population aggregation equation that includes non-local inter-individual interactions and local inter-individual and food interactions. By performing a series of numerical experiments we find that there exists an optimal food width for locust hopper band formation, and by looking at foraging efficiency within the model framework we uncover a possible evolutionary reason for gregarisation. Author summary Locusts are short horned grass hoppers that live in two diametrically opposed behavioural states. In the first, solitarious, they will actively avoid other locusts, whereas the second, gregarious, they will actively seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts form the recognisable and destructive flying adult swarms. However, prior to swarm formation juvenile flightless locusts will form marching hopper bands and make their way from food source to food source. Predicting where these hopper bands might form is key to controlling locust outbreaks. Research has shown that changes in food distributions can affect the transition from solitarious to gregarious. In this paper we construct a mathematical model of locust-locust and locust-food interactions to investigate how and why isolated food distributions affect hopper band formation. Our findings suggest that there is an optimal food width for hopper band formation and that being gregarious increases a locusts ability to forage when food width decreases.","Georgiou, Fillipe; Buhl, Jerome; Green, J.E.F.; Lamichhane, Bishnu; Thamwattana, Natalie",bioRxiv,300,1

Given the paucity of research exploring how undocumented migrants are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we set out to explore the association between being an undocumented migrant and a range of social and mental health measures. Methods Our study draws on three complementary surveys conducted among migrants in France between April 1st and June 7th 2020 (APART TOGETHER, MAKASI, ECHO; n = 716). We tested associations between eight outcome measures, covering health literacy, prevention behaviours, perceptions of government responses, livelihoods and mental health (PHQ-9 score), and the participants' legal status as either undocumented or documented. We modelled the probability of food insecurity increase, job loss, depression, and responses to SARS-COV-2 symptoms with logistic regression models, adjusted for age, gender and legal status. Results Undocumented migrants had a higher probability of experiencing food insecurity increase (aORs=10.40 [3.59, 30.16], and 2.19 [1.39, 3.50] in APART TOGETHER and ECHO), a higher probability of depression (aOR=2.65 [1.01, 6.97] in MAKASI). In all three surveys, undocumented migrants were more likely to lose their job (aORs=6.51 [1.18, 36.00], 8.36 [1.08, 64.70] and 3.96 [1.79, 9.16] in APART TOGETHER, MAKASI and ECHO respectively). Conclusion Our results suggest that the lives of undocumented migrants have been dramatically worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, exposing and amplifying the inequalities facing this group. There is an urgent need for action to address these inequalities.","Gosselin, A.; Longchamps, C.; Oulahal, R.; Derluyn, I.; Ducarroz, S.; Skovdal, M.; Verelst, A.; Sturm, G.; Desgrees du Lou, A.; Melchior, M.",,300,1

Although airway acidification occurs early in CF, whether transient acidification is sufficient to initiate mucus abnormalities is unknown. We studied mucus secretion and mucus transport in piglets forty-eight hours following an intra-airway acid challenge. Acid-challenged piglet airways were distinguished by increased mucin 5B (MUC5B) in the submucosal gland but decreased lung lavage fluid MUC5B, following in vivo cholinergic stimulation, suggesting a failure in submucosal gland secretion. Concomitantly, intrapulmonary airways were obstructed with glycoprotein rich material under both basal and methacholine-stimulated conditions. To mimic a CF-like environment, we also studied mucus secretion and transport under diminished bicarbonate and chloride transport conditions ex vivo. Cholinergic stimulation in acid-challenged piglet airways induced extensive mucus films, greater mucus strand formation, increased dilation of submucosal gland duct openings and decreased mucociliary transport. Finally, to elucidate potential mediators of acid-induced mucus defects, we investigated diminazene aceturate, a small molecule that inhibits the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Diminazene aceturate restored surface MUC5B in acid-challenged piglet airways under basal conditions, mitigated acid-induced airway obstruction, and magnified the number of dilated submucosal gland duct openings. These findings suggest that even transient airway acidification early in life might have profound impacts on mucus secretion and transport properties. Further they highlight diminazene aceturate as an agent that might be beneficial in alleviating certain mucus defects in CF airway disease. One sentence summary Early life airway acidification has profound impacts on mucus secretion and transport.","Liao, Yan Shin J.; Kuan, Shin Ping; Guevara, Maria V.; Collins, Emily N.; Atanasova, Kalina R.; Dadural, Joshua S.; Vogt, Kevin; Schurmann, Veronica; Reznikov, Leah R.",bioRxiv,300,16

Capturing data in the moment reduces important sources of measurement error but also generates challenges for noncompliance (ie, missing data). To date, EMA research has only examined the overall rates of noncompliance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we identify four types of noncompliance among people who use drugs and aim to examine the factors associated with the most common types. METHODS: Data were obtained from a recent pilot study of 28 Nebraskan people who use drugs who answered EMA questions for 2 weeks. We examined questions that were not answered because they were skipped, they expired, the phone was switched off, or the phone died after receiving them. RESULTS: We found that the phone being switched off and questions expiring comprised 93.34% (1739/1863 missing question-instances) of our missing data. Generalized structural equation model results show that participant-level factors, including age (relative risk ratio [RRR]=0.93; P=.005), gender (RRR=0.08; P=.006), homelessness (RRR=3.80; P=.04), personal device ownership (RRR=0.14; P=.008), and network size (RRR=0.57; P=.001), are important for predicting off missingness, whereas only question-level factors, including time of day (ie, morning compared with afternoon, RRR=0.55; P<.001) and day of week (ie, Tuesday-Saturday compared with Sunday, RRR=0.70, P=.02; RRR=0.64, P=.005; RRR=0.58, P=.001; RRR=0.55, P<.001; and RRR=0.66, P=.008, respectively) are important for predicting expired missingness. The week of study is important for both (ie, week 2 compared with week 1, RRR=1.21, P=.03, for off missingness and RRR=1.98, P<.001, for expired missingness). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest a three-pronged strategy to preempt missing EMA data with high-risk populations: first, provide additional resources for participants likely to experience phone charging problems (eg, people experiencing homelessness); second, ask questions when participants are not likely to experience competing demands (eg, morning); and third, incentivize continued compliance as the study progresses. Attending to these issues can help researchers ensure maximal data quality.","Markowski, Kelly L; Smith, Jeffrey A; Gauthier, G Robin; Harcey, Sela R",JMIR Form Res,300,1

Furthermore, assortative mating (i.e. a non-random pattern in which individuals are more likely to pair with others who are similar to themselves) is hypothesised to occur in relation to systemizing, and so romantic couples may be more similar on this variable than chance would dictate. However, no published study has yet tested this hypothesis. We therefore examined intra-couple correlations for a measure of autistic traits (Autism Spectrum Quotient [AQ]), self-report measures of empathizing (Empathy Quotient [EQ]), and systemizing (Systemizing Quotient-Revised [SQ-R]), as well as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and Embedded Figures Task (EFT). We observed positive intra-couple correlations of small-to-medium magnitude for all measures except EQ. Further analyses suggest that these effects are attributable to people pairing with those who are more similar to themselves than chance (initial assortment) rather than becoming more alike over the course of a relationship (convergence), and to seeking out self-resembling partners (active assortment) rather than pairing in this manner due to social stratification increasing the likelihood of similar people meeting in the first place (social homogamy). Additionally, we found that the difference in scores for the AQ, SQ-R, RMET and EFT of actual couples were smaller (i.e. more similar) than the average difference scores calculated from all other possible male-female pairings within the dataset. The current findings therefore provide clear evidence in support of the assortative mating theory of autism.","Richards, Gareth; Baron-Cohen, Simon; Stokes, Holly; Warrier, Varun; Mellor, Ben; Winspear, Ellie; Davies, Jessica; Gee, Laura; Galvin, John",bioRxiv,300,16

It has tightened its knot around EIs that forced their previous half shut shades completely down to prevent the risk of spreading COVID19. In such a situation, fetching new enrollments on EI campuses is a difficult and challenging task, as students behavior and family preferences have changed drastically due to mental stress and emotions attached to them. Consequently, it becomes a prerequisite to examine the choice characteristics influencing the selection of EI during the COVID-19 pandemic to make it normal for new enrollments. The purpose of this study is to critically examine choice characteristics that affect students choice for EI and consequently to explore relationships between institutional characteristics and the suitability of EI during the COVID19 pandemic across students characteristics. The findings of this study revealed dissimilarities across students characteristics regarding the suitability of EIs under pandemic conditions. Regression analysis revealed that EI characteristics such as proximity, image and reputation, quality education and curriculum delivery have significantly contributed to suitability under COVID19. At the micro level, multiple relationships were noted between EI characteristics and the suitability of EI under the pandemic across students characteristics. The study has successfully demonstrated how choice characteristics can be executed to regulate the suitability of EI under the COVID19 pandemic for the inclusion of diversity. It is useful for policy makers and academicians to reposition EIs that fetch diversity during the pandemic. This study is the first to provide insights into the performance of choice characteristics and their relationship with the suitability of EIs under a pandemic and can be a yardstick in administering new enrollments.","Mahajan, Prashant",,300,24

In malaria, females demonstrate higher concentrations of antibodies and rates of severe adverse events and mortality following natural infections and malaria vaccination. Although monocytes/macrophages play a crucial role in disease and protection in malaria, no studies have investigated sex differences in their functions in production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in malaria-infected subjects. Here, we show significant sex differences in serum concentrations of HMGB1, a non-histone chromatin-associated protein, and numbers of pigmented monocytes, which are both markers of severe malaria, in infants <5 years old from a malaria endemic region in Northern Uganda. Female infants with clinical malaria had significantly higher HMGB1 concentrations than male infants, and female infants with asymptomatic malaria had significantly lower numbers of pigmented monocytes than male infants with asymptomatic malaria. There was (1) a significant correlation between HMGB1 concentrations and pigmented monocyte numbers in female but not male infants; and (2) a significant correlation between HMGB1 concentrations and parasite densities in female but not male infants. These findings suggest that female infants with clinical malaria might be at a greater risk of morbidity characterized by higher serum HMGB1 levels.","Kanoi, Bernard N.; Egwang, Thomas G.",bioRxiv,300,1

Genetic variants, such as polymorphisms of the GST gene and other genes, may increase the risk of experiencing such toxicity events. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence base for associations between variants of the GST gene and other genes and toxicity outcomes related to anti-TB drugs. Methods We searched for relevant studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSIS and Web of Science. We pooled effect estimates for each genotype on each outcome, and stratified all analyses by country. We qualitatively assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. Results We included data from 28 distinct cohorts of patients in the review. The methodological quality of included studies was variable, with several important areas of concern. For GSTM1, patients with the homozygous null genotype were significantly more likely to experience hepatotoxicity than patients with heterozygous or homozygous present genotype (odds ratio [OR]=1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15, 1.82). Moderate heterogeneity was observed in this analysis (I2=51.2%). No significant difference was observed for the GSTT1 null polymorphism. For the rs3814057 polymorphism of the PXR gene, both heterozygous genotype and homozygous mutant-type significantly increased hepatotoxicity risk compared with homozygous wild-type (heterozygous versus homozygous wild-type: OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.06, 3.69; I2=0%; homozygous mutant-type versus homozygous wild-type: OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.07, 4.44; I2=0%). Conclusions We found that it is challenging to perform robust synthesis of the evidence base for associations between GST and other genetic variants and toxicity related to anti-TB drugs. We identified significant associations between the GSTM1 null and PXR rs3814057 polymorphisms and ATDH. To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analyses on genetic variants other than variants of the NAT2, CYP2E1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have been published. Our results therefore add to the existing understanding of the association between genetic variants and hepatotoxicity.","Richardson, Marty; Kirkham, Jamie; Dwan, Kerry; Sloan, Derek J; Davies, Geraint; Jorgensen, Andrea L",bioRxiv,300,1

However, the findings of Phase III clinical trials raise concerns about the efficacy of MSCs, which are rooted mainly in the applied populations’ heterogeneity. Although several factors, one of the most crucial causes of this heterogeneity is the lack of an optimized cell culture technique to manufacture a homogenous cultured MSCs. Moreover, it is necessary to provide a good manufacturing practice (GMP) platform to ensure the safety of final cell therapy products (CTPs) and satisfy the legal requirements for clinical applications. Establishing a tired cell bank system is the final step to support the proper translation of producing MSCs into medicine by ensuring standardization of the entire cell manufacturing process, accredited identity, function and safety assessments, and transparent sharing of standard operating procedures (SOPs) data. Methods, Results & Conclusion: Here, clonal MSCs (cMSCs) were isolated based on the subfractionation culturing method (SCM) protocol under the GMP-compatible condition and through an innovative, cost-effective screening approach. Then, cMSCs were compared with their heterogeneous counterparts in terms of identity and function. The validated clones were stored in a four-tiered cell bank system consisting of an initial, master, working, and end of product cell banks (ICB, MCB, WCB, and EoPCB). Additionally, to further develop towards GMP- compatible cMSCs production, several identities, quality, and safety assessments were performed during all banking phases. Finally, the cells stored in the EoPCB were released as a drug product (DP) for the Phase I/II clinical trial of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Regarding senescence assessment and capability to serial passaging, three similar passagable clones were manufactured. Remarkably, the clones’ genomic stability was fully retained after 15 passages and were neither tumorigenic nor immunogenic. Altogether, this study presents a technical and translational overview of GMP-compatible cMSCs manufacturing technology, which could be used as a guide for the development of similar production processes with the therapeutic goals.","Pakzad, M.; Abbasi, F.; Samadian, A.; Hajizadeh Saffar, E.; Hassani, S.; Baharvand, H.",Cytotherapy,300,17

Therefore, rapid body temperature may be used as early screening of covid-19 suspect. Many location use staff equipped with thermometer gun for screening the visitor body temperature. This scenario has drawbacks since there is closed contact between staff and visitor within body temperature screening which may cause the spread of the virus. This paper present low cost non-contact rapid body temperature screening using a thermal camera that integrate with barrier gate. Therefore, there is no staff needed for body temperature screening since visitor may check their body temperature independently. For visitors who are detected as having a body temperature ≤ 37.5°C, system will count as covid-19 suspect and the barrier gate will not open.

Their complex nervous systems, intricate color- and texture-changing body patterns, and problem-solving abilities have attracted the attention of the biological research community, while the high growth rates and short life cycles of some species render them suitable for laboratory culture. Octopus chierchiae is a small octopus native to the central Pacific coast of North America whose predictable reproduction, short time to maturity, small adult size, and ability to lay multiple egg clutches (iteroparity) make this species ideally suited to laboratory culture. Here we describe novel methods for culture of O. chierchiae, with emphasis on enclosure designs, feeding regimes, and breeding management. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of multigenerational culture of O. chierchiae. Specifically, O. chierchiae bred in the laboratory grows from a 3.5-millimeter mantle length at hatching to an adult mantle length of approximately 20-30 millimeters in 250-300 days, with 14-15% survivorship to over 400 days of age in first and second generations. O. chierchiae sexually matures at around an estimated six months of age and, unlike most octopus species, can lay multiple clutches of eggs, approximately every 30-90 days. Eggs are large and hatchlings emerge as direct developing octopuses. Based on these results, we propose that O. chierchiae possesses both the practical and biological features needed for a model octopus that can be cultured repeatedly to address a wide range of fundamental biological questions.","Grearson, Anik G.; Dugan, Alison; Sakmar, Taylor; Dölen, Gül; Gire, David H.; Sivitilli, Dominic M.; Niell, Cristopher M.; Caldwell, Roy L.; Wang, Z.

Aims and Objectives: The purpose of our research was to show how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected patient's quality of life after infection with the virus post recovery. Materials and Methods: It was a questionnaire based cross sectional study. Study tool included a reliability checked selfmade questionnaire with 30 questions. It was disseminated through mobile and web-based social media platforms to recovered COVID-19 patients hospitalized at centre, in and around Surathkal. Sample collection was done between September 2020 to December 2020 for about 3 months duration with a total of 550 recovered patients. We found significant stress with increasing age, which was more among males and housewives. Data analyzed by the descriptive statistics association. Results: Out of 550 recovered patients, with 314 (57.1%) of them being males. The average age was 41.02 years (SD) (16.86). Gender (p=0.017), occupation (p=0.0002), and age (p=0.001) were found to be related to stress levels. Age (p=0.001), occupation (p=0.001), and gender (p=0.002) were found to be related to feelings of isolation. The majority took all precautions, such as social distancing and disinfectant use. Conclusions: Significant increase in stress with increasing age, which was more among males and housewives. Reduced quality of life in males and elderly patients of covid-19 infection predominantly because of psychological discomfort, but family and friends played a major role as coping mechanisms.

Methods We model the effectiveness of reduced prescribing, drug rescheduling, prescription monitoring programs (PMPs), tamper-resistant drug reformulation, excess opioid disposal, naloxone availability, syringe exchange, pharmacotherapy, and psychosocial treatment. We measure life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and opioid-related deaths over five and ten years. Findings Under the status quo, our model predicts that approximately 547,000 opioid-related deaths will occur from 2020 to 2024 (range 441,000 - 613,000), rising to 1,220,000 (range 996,000 - 1,383,000) by 2029. Expanding naloxone availability by 30% had the largest effect, averting 25% of opioid deaths. Pharmacotherapy, syringe exchange, psychosocial treatment, and PMPs are uniformly beneficial, reducing opioid-related deaths while leading to gains in life years and QALYs. Reduced prescribing and increasing excess opioid disposal programs would reduce total deaths, but would lead to more heroin deaths in the short term. Drug rescheduling would increase total deaths over five years as some opioid users escalate to heroin, but decrease deaths over ten years. Combined interventions would lead to greater increases in life years, QALYs, and deaths averted, although in many cases the results are subadditive. Interpretation Expanded health services for individuals with opioid use disorder combined with PMPs and reduced opioid prescribing would moderately lessen the severity of the opioid crisis over the next decade. Tragically, even with improved public policies, significant morbidity and mortality is inevitable.","Rao, Isabelle J.; Humphreys, Keith Brandeau Margaret L.",The Lancet Regional Health - Americas,300,7

These specimens provide an opportunity to study mandibular biomechanical properties and tooth morphology to infer changes in feeding behaviour and bite force through ontogeny in tyrannosaurids. Mandibular force profiles reveal that the symphyseal region of albertosaurines is consistently stronger in bending than the mid-dentary region, indicating that the anterior extremity of the jaws played an important role in prey capture and handling through ontogeny. The symphyseal region was better adapted to withstand torsional stresses than in most non-avian theropods, but not to the extent seen in Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting that albertosaurine feeding behaviour may have involved less bone crushing or perhaps relatively smaller prey than in Tyrannosaurus rex. The constancy of these biomechanical properties at all known growth stages indicates that although albertosaurines maintained a similar feeding strategy through ontogeny, prey size/type had to change between juvenile and mature individuals. This ontogenetic dietary shift likely happened when individuals reached a mandibular length of similar to 58 cm, a size at which teeth shift from ziphodont to incrassate in shape and bite force begins to increase exponentially. The fact that large albertosaurines were capable of generating bite forces equivalent to similar-sized tyrannosaurines suggests that no significant differences in jaw-closing musculature existed between the two clades and that the powerful bite of Tyrannosaurus rex is the result of its large body size rather than of unique adaptations related to a specialized ecology.","Therrien, F.; Zelenitsky, D.

This was because they would be unable to impose restrictions, undertake mass testing, or provide adequate safety nets to the poor. Bangladesh was one of the first countries to allow the reopening of work places (as early as April 28, 2020), especially in the export-oriented garment industry, and has done economically better than its South Asian counterparts. A crucial enabling factor for this pandemic-era economic growth has been the explosive boom in digital money. On the downside, free speech has been sharply curtailed, and women's futures were further jeopardized when the garment industry was severely hit by order cancellations.

They have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated Spike than the original virus. It is possible that novel variants with abilities of enhanced transmissibility and/or immunoevasion will appear in the near future and perfectly escape from vaccine-elicited immunity. Therefore, the current vaccines may need to be improved to compensate for the viral evolution. For this purpose, it may be beneficial to take advantage of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of CTLs on the viral control in COVID-19, and CTLs target a wide range of proteins involving comparatively conserved non-structural proteins. Here, we identified twenty-two HLA-A*24:02-restricted CTL candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV-2 using computational algorithms, HLA-A*24:02 transgenic mice and the peptide-encapsulated liposomes. We focused on pp1a and HLA-A*24:02 because pp1a is relatively conserved and HLA-A*24:02 is predominant in East Asians such as Japanese. The conservation analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of 7 out of the 22 epitopes were hardly affected by a number of mutations in the Sequence Read Archive database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The information of such conserved epitopes might be useful for designing the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that is universally effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variants by the induction of both anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies and CTLs specific for conserved epitopes. Importance COVID-19 vaccines have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against variants.

We aimed to examine (i) the effect of living in lockdown on fruit and vegetable consumption; (ii) whether any population subgroup was particularly adversely affected; (iii) the barriers and facilitators to a healthy diet in lockdown; and (iv) the effect of lockdown on secondary outcomes such as weight and mental wellbeing. Methods: We conducted a mixed-method longitudinal study, involving an online survey of 1003 adults in the West Midlands, UK, 494 of whom were surveyed at two different points in time. Our first time point (T0: May 2020) was during stringent COVID-19 lockdown and the second (T1: September 2020) during a period of more relaxed restrictions. The survey included detailed quantitative questions about fruit and vegetable consumption; questions on physical activity, socio-demographic characteristics, BMI and wellbeing; and qualitative data collection about the reasons behind reported changes. Results: We find no evidence for respondents decreasing their fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown compared to afterwards. If anything, consumption of fruit and vegetables increased by about half a portion daily among women, particularly among those who normally have a long commute. These findings combined with a significant increase in physical activity, suggest that behaviours were healthier during lockdown, consistent with higher self-reported health compared with afterwards. However, there was a marked deterioration in wellbeing during lockdown, and on average participants self-reported being heavier during this period as well. Our qualitative data suggested that an abundance of resources supported higher fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown, for instance, participants had more time, while access issues were one barrier to consumption. Conclusions: Our results are reassuring for those concerned that lockdowns may have adversely affect diets. They may point to the impact of commuting on diet, particularly for women, and intervening to reduce commuting times may be one way to improve population diets. Our study adds longitudinal evidence to a growing body of literature on the adverse effect of lockdown on mental health.","van Rens, T.; Hanson, P.; Oyebode, O.; Walasek, L.; Barber, T.

Two forces – renewable energy and price volatility – call into question the profitability of investing in the massive, decades-long conventional projects which form the backbone of global production. Facing a volatile, unknown future, energy financiers are retracting from long-term projects. United States (US) hydraulic fracturing has offered a partial solution. The unique material properties of hydraulic fracturing give it—relative to conventional production—a small investment scope with a short cycle of production. This flexible production process has helped sections of the industry avoid the commodity’s uncertain outlook by narrowly focusing on the near term. However, hydraulic fracturing, while offering a different temporal and financial scale of investment, is often more expensive per barrel.

There were countries where the COVID-19 peak occurred during extremely low temperatures, such as Norway, Canada and on the other hand there were countries with high-temperature ranges such as Brazil, India, UAE. Most of the high-latitude countries received their outbreak in winter and most of the countries near the equator mark the outbreak during the summer. Most of the biological organisms have their growth dependent on the temperature, and hence we explored that if there is any relation of temperature versus COVID-19 outbreak in the particular country. It was also seen that people are not behaving differently during the peak of the COVID-19 wave, hence it was important to know whether the COVID-19 virus has evolved or the global temperature variation caused these multiple peaks.

However, a quantitative understanding of how various immune compartments change with age in Down syndrome remains lacking. Here we performed deep immunophenotyping of a cohort of individuals with Down syndrome across the lifespan, selecting for individuals not affected by autoimmunity. We simultaneously interrogated age- and sex-matched healthy neurotypical controls and people with type 1 diabetes, as a representative autoimmune disease. We built a new analytical software, IMPACD, that enabled us to rapidly identify many features of immune dysregulation in Down syndrome that are recapitulated in other autoimmune diseases. We found significant quantitative and qualitative dysregulation of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in Down syndrome and identified IL-6 as a candidate driver of some of these changes, thus extending the consideration of immunopathologic cytokines in Down syndrome beyond interferons. Notably, we successfully used immune cellular composition to generate three quantitative models of aging (i.e. immune clocks) trained on control subjects. All three immune clocks demonstrated significantly advanced immune aging in people with Down syndrome. Notably, one of these clocks, informed by Down syndrome-relevant biology, also showed advanced immune aging in people with type 1 diabetes.

Objective: To estimate the association between vaccination and COVID-19 hospitalization rate in MHD patients Design: Using Bayesian multivariable spatiotemporal models, we estimated the expected number of SARS-CoV-2 severe infections (infections with hospital admission) in MHD patients from simultaneous cases in the general population. Setting: French population-based retrospective analysis in MHD and non-dialysis patients. Participants: Models were fitted from 3620 hospitalizations of MHD patients and 457,160 hospitalizations in the general population. Exposure: Severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population and vaccine exposure. Main Outcome and Measure: Weekly incidence of severe infections in MHD patients. Results: During the first epidemic wave, incidence of severe infections in MHD patients was approximately proportional to incidence in the general population. However, our model overestimated incidence during the second wave, suggesting an effect of prevention measures during the 2nd wave. A second model (based on data up to the end of the 2nd wave) estimated that the risk in MHD patients decreased between waves 1 and 2, with incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.76). Moreover, while this model correctly estimated the reported MHD cases up to the end of the 2nd wave, predictions overestimated the expected number of cases from the beginning of the vaccination campaign. Using vaccination coverages as additional predictors permitted to correctly fit the weekly reported number of cases, with IRR in MHD patients of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.28, 0.58) for vaccine exposure in MHD patients and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.61) per 10% increase in vaccination coverage in the same-age general population. Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings suggest that both individual and herd immunity due to vaccination may yield a protective effect against severe forms of COVID-19 in MHD patients.","el karoui, k.; hourmant, m.; ayav, c.; glowacki, f.; couchoud, c.; lapidus, n.; registry, REIN",,300,24

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study. SETTING: Wearing face masks was made mandatory for employees of the police during working hours at the rise of the second wave of the pandemic in mid-October 2020. Protests and police fieldwork provided a high exposure environment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The investigation was performed prior to initiation of a vaccine programme. Study participants were invited for serological testing of SARS-CoV-2 and to complete questionnaires on sociodemographic, work and health-related questions. PARTICIPANTS: 978 police personnel working in four different geographic districts, representing 35% of the entire staff, participated from February to March 2021. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in February to March 2021, geographic and work-related risk factors for seropositivity, and serum neutralization titres towards the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G) and the alpha and beta variants. RESULTS: Seroprevalence was 12.9% (126 of 978 employees). It varied by geographic region within the canton; ranged from 9% to 13% in three regions, including the city; and was 22% in Bernese Seeland/Jura. Working in the latter region was associated with higher odds for seropositivity (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 4.44, P=0.006). Job roles with mainly office activity were associated with a lower risk of seropositivity (0.33, 0.14 to 0.77, P=0.010). Most seropositive employees (67.5%) reported having had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 3 months or longer prior to serological testing, and the proportion of agreement between positive nasopharyngeal test results and seroconversion was 95% to 97%. Among reported symptoms, new loss of smell or taste was the best discriminator for seropositivity (odds ratio 52.4, 30.9 to 89.0, P<0.001). Compliance with mask wearing during working hours was 100%, and 45% of all seropositive versus 5% of all seronegative participants (P<0.001) reported having had contact with a proven COVID-19 case living in the same household. The level of serum antibody titres correlated well with neutralization capacity. Antibodies derived from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection effectively neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (expressing D614G), but were less effective against the alpha and beta variants. A regression model demonstrated that anti-spike antibodies had higher odds for neutralization than did anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence in the pre-vaccinated police cohort was similar to that reported in the general population living in the same region. The high compliance with mask wearing and the low proportion of seroconversion after contact with a presumed or proven COVID-19 case during working hours imply that personal protective equipment is effective and that household contacts are the leading transmission venues. The level of serum antibody titres, in particular that of anti-spike antibodies, correlated well with neutralization capacity. Low antibody titres were not effective against the alpha and beta variants.","Sendi, P.; Baldan, R.; Thierstein, M.; Widmer, N.; Gowland, P.; Gahl, B.; Buechi, A.

While limiting super-spreading promotes more effective control when cases are growing, we find that when incidence is waning, curbing sub-spreading is more important for achieving reliable elimination of the epidemic. Controlling super-spreading in this low-transmissibility phase offers diminishing returns over non-selective population-wide measures. By restricting sub-spreading we efficiently dampen remaining variations among event reproduction numbers, which minimises the risk of premature and late end-of-epidemic declarations. Because case-ascertainment rates can be modelled in exactly the same way as control policies, we concurrently show that the under-reporting of sub-spreading events during waning phases will engender overconfident assessments of epidemic elimination. While controlling sub-spreading may not be easily realised, the likely neglecting of these events by surveillance systems could result in unexpectedly risky end-of-epidemic declarations. Super-spreading controls the size of the epidemic peak but sub-spreading mediates the variability of its tail.","Parag, K. V.",,300,1

One-to-one interaction between performers and audience members results in highly flexible performances that respond to physical and auditory input from individual audience members, through which performers curate customized multisensory experiences that communicate the production's theatrical world to its audience. Given this reliance on close-up interaction, the circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have posed a particular challenge for sensory theatre makers.

This paper focuses on the possible secondary transmission due to resuspension of virus-laden droplets from common surfaces, which several studies have shown to be possible under external disturbances. Such disturbances could be body motion during walking, running, clothes removal, or airflow in the environment. In this paper, a three-dimensional two-phase model is utilized to study respiratory droplet resuspension dynamics on various surfaces due to sudden agitation. The velocity range and variation during walking, surgical glove removal, and dropping an object are studied experimentally. A parametric study is performed to characterize the effects of droplet size and surface wettability on the minimum initial droplet velocity required for detachment from surfaces. The results are reported as average droplet velocity during the detachment process, total detachment time, and detached droplet volume. The obtained results indicate that respiratory droplets larger than 200 μm can detach from typical surfaces due to normal daily activities. Droplets are partially separated from hydrophilic surfaces with contact angle Furthermore, the minimum initial droplet velocity to induce the resuspension depends on the droplet size. Droplet velocity immediately after detachment is a function of droplet size, initial droplet velocity, and surface wettability. Bigger droplets have larger detached volume percentage as well as higher velocity after detachment compared to smaller droplets. Finally, a higher initial velocity is needed to separate droplets from hydrophilic surfaces as compared to hydrophobic surfaces. In accordance with the results, the droplet minimum initial velocity to cause detachment is 2 m s−1, while our experiments show that surface velocity can reach up to 3 m s−1 during normal human activities. We also develop an analytical model to predict the required kinetic energy to detach droplets from different surfaces, which is in good agreement with numerical results. The mechanism of droplet detachment is dictated by a competition between droplet kinetic energy induced by surface motion and surface energy due to droplet-surface interaction as well as droplet-vapor and surface-vapor interactions. We believe that the results of this fundamental study can potentially be used to suggest proper surface wettability and safe motion that reduce respiratory droplet resuspension from various surfaces. © 2021 Author(s).","Nikfar, M.; Paul, R.; Islam, K.; Razizadeh, M.; Jagota, A.; Liu, Y.",Journal of Applied Physics,300,16

As a result, multiple dissimilar battery cell tabs are joined together in parallel and carry larger currents in the electrical circuit. Ultrasonic and laser welding have been the two dominant battery cell joining processes in the automotive industry. However, both of them have limitations for joining a large number of stacked battery tabs at one time. Since failure of a single joint can impact the battery and eventually the vehicle, it is important to ensure process robustness and soundness of the resulting battery tab joints. In this study a new joining method, resistive joining (RJ), has been developed for welding multiple dissimilar (copper and aluminum) battery tabs. First, nickel-phosphorus (Ni-P, with ~7 wt% phosphorus) is electroless plated on both sides of selected tabs. In the subsequent resistive joining process, heat is concentrated at the high-electrical-resistivity Ni-P coatings as an electric current is passed through the joint. Aluminum is melted adjacent to the Ni-P coating due to its low melting temperature, and a portion of the Ni-P coating is dissolved into the liquid aluminum and a metallurgical bond is formed as the aluminum re-solidifies. In the meantime, solid-state bonds are formed between the Ni-P coating and copper due to material interdiffusion. Consequently, no Al-Cu intermetallic compound (IMC) is generated at the joint, and the strengths of RJ joints are higher than the base metal when tested in a lap-shear configuration.","Wang, Hongliang; Wagner, Sean; Sekol, Ryan; Chen, Nannan; Perry, Thomas; Schroth, James",Procedia Manufacturing,300,5

Certainly, the extent of emergency medical services (EMSs) use at some stage within the COVID-19 pandemic has been increased. However, the impact on the use of EMS in Kazakhstan during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied. AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of changes in the number of emergency medical calls during the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the time of year, day of the week, and the causes for the calls. METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated the Nur-Sultan (capital of Kazakhstan) EMS data for the period after the pandemic was first seen in Kazakhstan. The necessary permissions for the study were obtained from the Nur-Sultan City Public Health Department. EMS data for the same time interval (February 1–May 1) in the past 3 years (2018, 2019, and 2020) were compared. The data were taken from the database of the automated control system “Komek 103,” which is used in the ambulance station since the end of 2019, and the automated dispatch information systems “ADIS” used by the ambulance station in Nur-Sultan. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS call rates had been maximum common on Mondays and Thursdays by 13, 75%. The evaluation suggests that the quantity of male sufferers extended by 14, 05% in the course of the pandemic length, as compared to the pre-pandemic length. The quantity of patients with inside the 65+ age group in the course of the pandemic length has extended by 31.5%. During the pandemic, the signs and symptoms of fever enlarged significantly by 83%. Moreover, suicides elevated by 61% during the pandemic period. During the COVID☐19 pandemic, using EMS particularly for time touchy illnesses, which include hypertension (−31%), surgical emergencies (acute abdomen) (−40%), cerebrovascular illnesses (−11%), and other heart illnesses (−29%) decreased. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic period, there was an increase in the calls from male patients, compared to the pre-pandemic period. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS call rates had been increased on Mondays and Thursdays. We found an alteration with inside the sample of obtained calls. Furthermore, the quantity of patients with inside the 65+ age group in the course of the pandemic length has extended. © 2021 Akerke Chayakova, Marzhan Dauletyarova, Daulet Aldyngurov, Aiman Mussina, Roza Suleimenova, Aigul Utegenova, Murat Orazbayev, Gulnara Tuyakova.","Chayakova, A.; Dauletyarova, M.; Aldyngurov, D.; Mussina, A.; Suleimenova, R.; Utegenova, A.; Orazbayev, M.; Tuyakova, G.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,300,1

Although many individuals have been infected and have cleared the virus, developing virus-specific antibodies and effector/memory T cells, an important question still to be answered is what levels of T cell and antibody responses are sufficient to protect from the infection. Methods: In 5,340 Moscow residents, we evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG titers and the frequencies of the T cells specific to the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using IFNy; ELISpot, and we also evaluated the fractions of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells using intracellular staining of IFNy; and IL2 followed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, we analyzed the post-inclusion COVID-19 rates as a function of the assessed antibody and T cell responses using the Kaplan-Meyer estimator method. Results: We showed that T cell and antibody responses are closely interconnected and commonly are induced concurrently. Individuals positive for both antibody and T cell immunities demonstrated the highest levels of protectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 infection, indistinguishably from individuals with antibody response only. Meanwhile, individuals with T cell response only demonstrated slightly higher protectivity than individuals without both types of immunity, as measured from N-protein-specific or CD4+IL2+ T cells. However, these individuals were characterized by higher IgG titers than individuals without any immunity, although the titers were below the seropositivity cut-off. Conclusions: The results of the study indicated the advantage of serology testing over the analysis of T cell responses for the prediction of SARS-CoV-2 infection rates on a populational level.","Molodtsov, I.; Kegeles, E.; Mitin, A.; Mityaeva, O.; Musatova, O.; Panova, A.; Pashenkov, M.; Peshkova, I.; Almaqdad, A.; Asaad, W.; Budikhina, A.; Deryabin, A.; Dolzhikova, I.; Filimonova, I.; Gracheva, A.; Ivanova, O.; Kizilova, A.; Komogorova, V.; Komova, A.; Kompantseva, N.; Lagutkin, D.; Lomakin, Y.; Maleeva, A.; Maryukhnich, E.; Mohammad, A.; Murugin, V.; Murugina, N.; Navoikova, A.; Nikonova, M.; Ovchinnikova, L.; Pinegina, N.; Potashnikova, D.; Romanova, E.; Saidova, A.; Sakr, N.; Samoilova, A.; Serdyuk, Y.; Shakirova, N.; Sharova, N.; Sheetikov, S.; Shemetova, A.; Shevkova, L.; Shpekt,",,300,26

There is currently no fully effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis, which has stimulated interest in anticryptosporidial development over the last ∼10 years with numerous lead compounds identified including several tRNA synthetase inhibitors. In this study, we report the results of a dairy calf efficacy trial of the methionyl-tRNA (CpMetRS) synthetase inhibitor 2093 and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Dairy calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum initially improved with 2093 treatment, but parasite shedding resumed in two of three calves on treatment day five. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had different amino acid altering CpMetRS mutations, coding either an aspartate 243 to glutamate (D243E) or a threonine 246 to isoleucine (T246I) mutation. Transgenic parasites engineered to have either the D243E or T246I CpMetRS mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 grew normally but were highly 2093 resistant; the D243E and T246I mutant expressing parasites respectively had 2093 EC50S of 613- or 128-fold that of transgenic parasites with wild-type CpMetRS. In studies using recombinant enzymes, the D243E and T246I mutations shifted the 2093 IC50 by >170-fold. Structural modeling of CpMetRS based on an inhibitor-bound Trypanosoma brucei MetRS crystal structure suggested that the resistance mutations reposition nearby hydrophobic residues, interfering with compound binding while minimally impacting substrate binding. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance, highlighting the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence. Importance Cryptosporidium is a leading protozoan cause of diarrhea in young children with no reliable treatment. We report results of a dairy calf drug efficacy trial and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Cryptosporidium parvum infected calves initially improved with drug treatment, but infection relapsed in two animals. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had mutations in the gene encoding the drug target that altered its amino acid sequence. Recapitulation of the drug target mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing resulted in highly drug-resistant parasites, and recombinant mutant enzymes were resistant to inhibition. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance. There is a currently a great opportunity to impact public health with new drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis, and this report highlights the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence in order to realize their full potential.

Empathy, emotional intelligence (EI), and emotional stability play an important role. Our objective was to study the relationship between empathy, EI, intuition, attitudes toward uncertainty and personality traits in doctors performing their professional activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study involved 122 doctors of different specialties (psychiatrists, pediatricians, surgeons, oncologists, etc.). Six questionnaires were used. The Jefferson Scale of Empathy and confirmatory factor analysis were used to verify the factor structure, where the original three-factor model showed the best fit. To identify the relationships between the variables, the Spearman test was used. In our sample of medical doctors, emotional stability characterizes individuals with high self-control and sociality (TEIQue scales). Our data allows us to highlight that empathy fails to be integrated with traits of emotional intelligence in the personality profiles of medical doctors. But distancing from the sphere of one's experiences in interpersonal relationships during the COVID pandemic may be a necessary component in the personal regulation of the performance of one's professional responsibilities.","Krasnov, E.; Kryukova, E.; Kotlovskiy, M.",Psychology-Journal of the Higher School of Economics,300,16

The impact of the removal of mask restrictions, however, on COVID-19 outcomes for elementary students, educators/staff, and their households is not well known. Methods We used a previously published agent-based dynamic transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in K-12 schools to simulate an elementary school with 638 students across 6 scenarios: combinations of three viral infectiousness levels (reflecting wild-type virus, alpha variant, and delta variant) and two student vaccination levels (0% and 50% coverage to reflect potential authorization in this age group). For each scenario, we varied observed community COVID-19 incidence (0 to 50 cases/100,000 people/day) and mitigation effectiveness (0-100% reduction to in-school secondary attack rate), and evaluated two outcomes over a 30 day period: (1) the probability of at least one in-school transmission, and (2) the increase in total cases among students, educators/staff, and their household members between in-person and remote instruction. Results Over 30 days in the simulated elementary school, the probability of at least one in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of projected infections in the immediate school community varied widely. In one scenario with the delta variant and no student vaccination, assuming that baseline mitigation measures of simple ventilation and handwashing reduce the secondary attack rate by 40%, if decision-makers seek to keep the monthly probability of an in-school transmission below 50%, additional mitigation (e.g., masking) would need to be added at a community incidence of approximately 4/100,000/day. Once students are vaccinated, thresholds shift substantially higher. Limitations The interpretation of model results should be limited by the uncertainty in many of the parameters, including the effectiveness of individual mitigation interventions and vaccine efficacy against the delta variant, and the limited scope of the model beyond the school community. Additionally, the assumed case detection rate (33% of cases detected) may be too high in areas with decreased testing capacity. Conclusion Despite the assumption of high adult vaccination, the risks of both in-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission and resulting infections among students, educators/staff, and their household members remain high when the delta variant predominates and students are unvaccinated. Mitigation measures or vaccinations for students when available can substantially reduce these risks. These findings underscore the potential role for responsive plans, where mitigation is deployed based on local COVID-19 incidence and vaccine uptake.","Giardina, J.; Bilinski, A.; Fitzpatrick, M.

Real-time PCR assays are sensitive and rapid, but their specificity limits their utility in detecting divergent agents. Shotgun high-throughput sequencing methods provide unbiased sequence identification, however, they have limited sensitivity and require complex analyses. In order to meet the need for a sensitive, high-throughput virus detection and discovery platform with good sensitivity, we combine two existing technologies, broadly-reactive consensus-degenerate pan-viral group PCR and the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina), using the Access Array (Fluidigm), a commercially-available microfluidic PCR system. Pan-viral group primers target conserved regions of virus taxonomic groups and can amplify known and potentially novel species. The Access Array employs dozens of these assays in parallel, which are then sequenced all at once on the MiSeq. In this study, we run a respiratory panel of pan-viral group PCR assays using AA-PCR-Seq. We validate the panel on a collection of representative human and animal samples, comparing it to qPCR and shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS). AA-PCR-Seq provides a robust, straightforward method for screening large numbers of samples for virus detection and discovery.","Tao, Ying; Paden, Clinton R.; Queen, Krista; Zhang, Jing; Tyagi, Eishita; Tong, Suxiang",bioRxiv,300,1

For this purpose, two different datasets from Recursion Pharmaceuticals, a siRNA image dataset (RxRx1), which were used to build and calibrate our model for feature extraction, and a SARS-CoV-2 dataset (RxRx19a) was used to train our model for ranking efficacy of candidate drug compounds. The SARS-CoV-2 dataset contained healthy, uninfected control or “mock” cells, as well as “active viral” cells (cells infected with COVID-19), which were the two cell types used to train our deep learning model. In addition, it contains viral cells treated with different drug compounds, which were the cells not used to train but test our model. We devised a new cascade transfer learning strategy to construct our model. We first trained a deep learning model, the DenseNet, with the siRNA set, a dataset with characteristics similar to the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, for feature extraction. We then added additional layers, including a SoftMax layer as an output layer, and retrained the model with active viral cells and mock cells from the SARS-CoV-2 dataset. In the test phase, the SoftMax layer outputs probability (equivalently, efficacy) scores which allows us to rank candidate compounds, and to study the performance of each candidate compound statistically. With this approach, we identified several compounds with high efficacy scores which are promising for the therapeutic treatment of COVID-19. The compounds showing the most promise were GS-441524 and then Remdesivir, which overlapped with these reported in the literature and with these drugs that are approved by FDA, or going through clinical trials and preclinical trials. This study shows the potential of deep learning in its ability to identify promising compounds to aid rapid responses to future pandemic outbreaks.","Zhuang, Dylan Ibrahim Ali K.",Applied Sciences,300,23

Research question: With this study, we aim to investigate pulmonary outcome following SARS-CoV-2 infection including pulmonary function, computed chest tomography, respiratory symptoms and quality of life over 12 months. Study design and Methods 180 patients after acute COVID-19 were enrolled into a single-centre, prospective observational study and examined 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Chest CT-scans, pulmonary function and symptoms assessed by St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire were used to evaluate objective and subjective respiratory limitations. Patients were stratified according to acute COVID-19 disease severity. Results Of 180 patients enrolled, 42/180 were not hospitalized during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, 29/180 were hospitalized without need for oxygen, 43/180 with need for low-flow and 24/180 with high-flow oxygen, 26/180 required invasive mechanical ventilation and 16/180 were treated with ECMO. After acute COVID-19, pulmonary restriction and reduced carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was associated with disease severity after the acute phase and improved over 12 months except for those requiring ECMO treatment. Patients with milder disease showed a predominant reduction of ventilated area instead of simple restriction. The CT score of lung involvement in the acute phase increased significantly with COVID-19 severity and was associated with restriction and reduction in diffusion capacity in follow-up. Respiratory symptoms improved for patients in higher severity groups during follow-up, but not for patients with mild initially disease. Interpretation Severity of respiratory failure during COVID-19 correlates with the degree of pulmonary function impairment and respiratory quality of life in the year after acute infection.

This case is one of the highest cases in East Kalimantan and has been a red zone several times. At that time, the first PCR Laboratory in East Kalimantan was at Pertamina Balikpapan Hospital. Starting from May to September, the number of patients performing PCR examinations at the PCR Laboratory of Pertamina Balikpapan Hospital has increased significantly every month. However, there are problems in this PCR Laboratory which cause the long time to complete the whole process. These problems are caused by limited human resources, technologies, and facilities and are not used optimally. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the PCR examination business process using the Business Process Improvement (BPI) method by analyzing each sub-process contained in the business process using streamlining tools. By using this method, the company can also find out the company's performance which can be seen from the efficiency of the cycle time in its business processes. Based on the research that has been done, the total cycle time in the existing business process is 1810 minutes with a cycle time efficiency level of 61.66%. After designing improvements to the existing business processes, the total cycle time for the proposed business process is 792 minutes with a cycle time efficiency level that increased to 80.30%.

As a first step in this research, this study reports on the cytotoxic effects of 58 metal compounds in the Balb/3T3 cell line. After harmonisation and standardisation of the Balb/3T3 protocol, cells were exposed for 72 hours to a fixed dose (100 microM) of 58 individual compounds. The cytotoxicity induced by some metal compounds was found to be related to their chemical form (for example, Cr(NO(3))(3) and Na(2)CrO(4)), suggesting that the Balb/3T3 cell line is a valuable cellular model in relation to this aspect of metal speciation. The results of the systematic study on the metal-induced cytotoxic effects in the Balb/3T3 cell line could be arbitrarily classified into three groups according to the degree of cytotoxicity. Group I includes 26 species that induced no observable effect or only a slight cytotoxic effect; Group II includes 13 metal compounds that exhibited an obvious degree of cytotoxicity; and Group III includes 19 metal species that displayed a strong cytotoxic response.

Controlling exposure to bioaerosols is important for disease control and prevention. In this study, we evaluated the efficacies of various functional filters coated with antimicrobial chemicals in deactivating representative microorganisms on filters or as bioaerosols. Tested functional filters were coated with different chemicals that included (i) Ginkgo and sumac, (ii) Ag-apatite and guanidine phosphate, (iii) SiO2, ZnO, and Al2O3, and (iv) zeolite. To evaluate the filters, we used a model ventilation system (1) to evaluate the removal efficiency of bacteria (Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila), bacterial spores (Bacillus subtilis spore), and viruses (MS2 bacteriophage) on various functional filters, and (2) to characterize the removal efficiency of these bioaerosols. All experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 25 degrees C and humidity of 50%. Most bacteria (excluding B. subtilis) rapidly decreased on the functional filter. Therefore, we confirmed that functional filters have antimicrobial effects. Additionally, we evaluated the removal efficiency of various bioaerosols by these filters. We used a six-jet collision nebulizer to generate microbial aerosols and introduced it into the environmental chamber. We then measured the removal efficiency of functional filters with and without a medium-efficiency filter. Most bioaerosol concentrations did not significantly decrease by the functional filter only but decreased by a combination of functional and medium-efficiency filter. In conclusion, functional filters could facilitate biological removal of various bioaerosols, but physical removal of these by functional was minimal. Proper use of chemical-coated filter materials could reduce exposure to these agents.","Kim, Sung Yeon; Kim, Misoon; Lee, Sunghee; Lee, JungEun; Ko, GwangPyo",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,300,17

METHODS One hundred and seventy-seven serum specimens were collected during the period of June to August, 2003 from children and adults who had been clinically diagnosed as SARS and who closely contacted with those diagnosed as SARS during SARS epidemic in Beijing. Serum specimens were also collected from 49 children from Anhui province which was non-epidemic region and 93 healthy kindergarten children without history of contacting with SARS patients in Beijing during SARS epidemic. Serum specimens collected from 90 healthy kindergarten children in Beijing in September 2002 were included in the study. All the 409 serum specimens were tested for specific antibodies against SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by different methods including ELISA for specific IgM and IgG, whole antibodies against SARS-CoV, IFA for specific IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV, and Western-blot for IgG to expressed N protein from SARS-CoV. RESULTS The positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV ranged from 39.1% to 43.5% in the children who had been clinically diagnosed as SARS, zero in children and 6.0% to 9.0% in adults who had closely contacted with the clinically diagnosed SARS children. Among those clinically diagnosed SARS adult patients, the positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV were 57.1% to 71.4%. In children and adults who closely contacted with these clinically diagnosed SARS adult patients, the positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV were 0 to 9.7% and 4.4% to 7.1%, respectively. None of the serum specimens collected from healthy children before and during epidemic in Beijing and children from non-epidemic region was positive when IFA methods and ELISA with Beier kits were used for detection, but some were positive when ELISA with the diagnostic kit from other source was applied. CONCLUSION The positive rates of specific IgG and whole antibodies against SARS-CoV in children who had been clinically diagnosed as SARS were around 40%, which is much lower than the positive rate in clinically diagnosed adult SARS patients, indicating that a large proportion of those ""SARS"" children were infected with respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV during SARS epidemic in Beijing. Some of the children who closely contacted with children and adults SARS patients showed positive SARS-CoV antibodies, suggesting that asymptomatic infections may occur.

On March 13, 2003, on receiving notification of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, nurses from the study emergency department (ED) started screening patients for the disease that became known as SARS. METHODS The ED nurses started with a simple screening tool that was incorporated into triage. The screening tool was later revised into a questionnaire. An outdoor screening station was set up and patients were subsequently screened before triage. After the patients were screened, they were assigned to different risk areas, where triage and treatment were rendered. Two further revisions were made to the questionnaire. RESULTS From March 13 to May 31, 11457 patients were screened. Version One of the screening questionnaire was used to screen 72 patients from March 13 to 17, Version Two screened 93 patients from March 18 to 21, Version Three screened 2909 patients from March 22 to April 8, and Version Four screened 8383 patients from April 9 to May 31. There was a significant (p < 0.05) downward trend in the proportion of admissions. Among those discharged from the ED, 0.28% reattended and were later confirmed to have SARS. CONCLUSIONS The screening tool underwent three major revisions in response to new information. By keeping it relatively simple, user-friendly, and regularly updated, nurses were able to screen patients rapidly. Risk categorization ensured that no cross-infection occurred among patients and that no one contracted SARS in the ED.","Foo, Chik-Loon; Tham, Kum-Ying; Seow, Eillyne",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,300,1

Hyperimmune antiserum or monoclonal antibodies were added to milk at each feeding or at selected feedings when the amount of antiserum was reduced. Three-day-old piglets were challenged with virulent virus that had been preincubated with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies. The results indicated that supplementing antiserum every other day was not efficacious for protection. Supplementing even small quantities of hyperimmune antiserum (0.5 ml) at least once a day in most cases was sufficient for piglet survival but did not prevent morbidity. Increasing the amount (>2 ml) and providing antiserum 3 times/day completely blocked the TGEV challenge infection. Two monoclonal antibodies were discovered that also provided passive protection for baby pigs. One monoclonal antibody, 5G1, had a high neutralizing titer, and the other, 6C4, was more effective in neutralizing and binding to virulent TGEV than to attenuated TGEVs. Both of these monoclonal antibodies were partially effective as supplements in milk for passive protection. Furthermore, these monoclonal antibodies were useful for boosting the efficacy of TGEV-neutralizing colostrum, which by itself was ineffective. These results show that other antigenic sites, different from the 4-well characterized epitopes on the S glycoprotein of TGEV, also are important for passive protection.","Wesley, R D; Woods, R D","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",300,1

Remarkably, as long as the individuals with different capability of acquiring the disease interact with unequal frequency, there always exist a cross point for the fraction of vaccinated, below which the diversity of infection rate hinders the epidemic spreading and above which expedites it.

A key variable in such models is the reproductive number R. For new emerging infectious diseases, the value of the reproductive number can only be inferred indirectly from the observed exponential epidemic growth rate r. Such inference is ambiguous as several different equations exist that relate the reproductive number to the growth rate, and it is unclear which of these equations might apply to a new infection. Here, we show that these different equations differ only with respect to their assumed shape of the generation interval distribution. Therefore, the shape of the generation interval distribution determines which equation is appropriate for inferring the reproductive number from the observed growth rate. We show that by assuming all generation intervals to be equal to the mean, we obtain an upper bound to the range of possible values that the reproductive number may attain for a given growth rate. Furthermore, we show that by taking the generation interval distribution equal to the observed distribution, it is possible to obtain an empirical estimate of the reproductive number.","Wallinga, J; Lipsitch, M",Proceedings.

The present study aimed to assess the change in the pattern of cycling attendances to an Irish ED during a pandemic. Methods This is a retrospective before-and-after study carried out at a university hospital ED. We compared cycling attendances during Lockdown (LD) (13th March-7th June 2020) with Pre-Lockdown (PLD) (January 1st-March 12th, 2020). Furthermore, we also compared lockdown to an historical control period during the equivalent dates in 2019 (i.e. March 13th-June 7th, 2019) Results There were 151 cycling attendances during LD, 122 in PLD and 164 during the control period. The number of cyclists presenting during ""rush hour traffic"" in the LD period was 30 (19.9%) versus 42 (34.4%) during PLD (p<0.05) and 51 (31.1%) during the control period (p<0.05). During LD, 8 (5.3%) collisions involved a motor vehicle compared to 26 (21.3%) in PLD (p<0.05) and 43 (26.2%) during the control period (p<0.05). Conclusion Lockdown did not result in increased cycling attendances to this ED. The patients who did sustain a cycling-related injury during lockdown were less likely to have collided with a motor vehicle compared to the control period. The reduction in motor vehicle collisions could be attributed to less traffic congestion and highlights the potential benefits of road-user segregation.","Foley, J; Robinson, M; Ryan, J; Cronin, J",Irish medical journal,300,9

Although rotavirus was extensively studied in China, few comprehensive studies of all viral agents related to diarrhea in children have been conducted. OBJECTIVES Our study was performed to investigate the role of enteric viruses in acute diarrhea in our country and to evaluate methods that could be used in routine diagnostics. STUDY DESIGN One hundred stool samples were collected from children under 5 years of age seeking medical care for acute diarrhea during the winter season 2000/2001 in Beijing Children's Hospital. All specimens were initially screened microscopically for leucocytes/red blood cells. Samples with negative results were analyzed for virus presence using commercial EIAs and/or in-house RT-PCRs. RESULTS At least one viral agent was found in 67% of the specimens. The frequency of rotavirus, astrovirus, norovirus and enteric adenovirus was 59%, 8%, 6% and 2%, respectively. Dual infections were found in 9.0% (6/67) of the positive samples. The results from rotavirus and astrovirus EIAs were concordant with those of rotavirus and astrovirus RT-PCRs.

In our effort the non-PDE4 inhibitor isocoumarins were transformed into the promising inhibitors via introducing an aminosulfonyl/aminocarboxamide moiety to the C-3 benzene ring attached to the isocoumarin framework. This new class of isocoumarins were synthesized via a PdCl2-catalyzed construction of the 4-allyl substituted 3-aryl isocoumarin ring starting from the appropriate 2-alkynyl benzamide derivative. Several compounds showed good inhibition of PDE4B in vitro and the SAR indicated superiority of aminosulfonamide moiety over aminocarboxamide in terms of PDE4B inhibition. Two compounds 3q and 3u with PDE4B IC50 = 0.43 ± 0.11 and 0.54 ± 0.19 µM and &#8805; 2-fold selectivity over PDE4D emerged as initial hits. The participation of aminosulfonamide moiety in PDE4B inhibition and the reason for selectivity though moderate shown by 3q and 3u was revealed by the in silico docking studies. In view of potential usefulness of moderately selective PDE4B inhibitors the compound 3u (that showed PDE4 selectivity over other PDEs) was further evaluated in adjuvant induced arthritic rats. At an intraperitoneal dose of 30 mg/kg the compound showed a significant reduction in paw swelling (in a dose dependent manner), inflammation and pannus formation (in the knee joints) as well as pro-inflammatory gene expression/mRNA levels and increase in body weight. Moreover, besides its TNF-&#945; inhibition and no significant toxicity in an MTT assay the compound did not show any adverse effects in a thorough toxicity studies e.g. teratogenicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and apoptosis in zebrafish. Thus, the isocoumarin 3u emerged as a new, safe and moderately selective PDE4B inhibitor could be useful for inflammatory diseases possibly including COVID-19.","Thirupataiah, B; Mounika, Guntipally; Reddy, Gangireddy Sujeevan; Kumar, Jetta Sandeep; Hossain, Kazi Amirul; Medishetti, Raghavender; Samarpita, Snigdha; Rasool, Mahaboobkhan; Mudgal, Jayesh; Mathew, Jessy E; Shenoy, Gautham G; Rao, C Mallikarjuna; Chatti, Kiranam; Parsa, Kishore V L; Pal, Manojit",Eur J Med Chem,300,16

The establishment of temporary integrated isolation wards in hospitals, which is universal and representative in China, is one of the most-effective strategies in solving these problems according to China's experiences. Aim: To conduct a preliminary study on the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward during the outbreak of COVID-19 and to evaluate related impact. Methods: SWOT analysis was used to analyze the advantages, disadvantages, opportunities, and risks in the establishment of the temporary integrated isolation ward, and corresponding corrective measures were made according to the analysis results. Findings: The ward has formulated more than 10 related work procedures and prevention and control measures. A total of 93 patients with 18 critically ill patients were admitted for treatment and isolation. They were all evaluated based on established procedures and protocols. Twenty-four supplementary nucleic acid tests were ordered and conducted. One new patient with COVID-19 was confirmed and was successfully transferred to the designated COVID-19 infectious control hospital. There were no missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, no cross-infection of patients, no cluster outbreak, and no infection of medical workers during the entire process. Conclusion: SWOT analysis is helpful in guiding the establishment of a temporary integrated isolation ward and the formulation of prevention and control measures in Hebei General Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. It provides the guidance and reference of significance for the establishment of similar types of wards in the future.","Zhou, Ye; Bai, Lixiang; Guo, Hao; Guo, Shaowei; Han, Xiaowen; Yue, Ning J; Li, Qingxia",Front Public Health,300,16

This work presents a nonlinear and robust control algorithm based on variable structure control (VSC) to control the transmission of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The VSC algorithm is a control gain switching technique in which is necessary to define a switching surface. Three switching surfaces are proposed based on rules that depend on: (i) exposed and infected population, (ii) susceptible and infected population, and (iii) susceptible and total population. In case (iii) a model-based state estimator is presented based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the estimator is used in combination with the VSC. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed control strategies have the ability to flatten the infection curve. In addition, the simulations show that the success of lowering and flattening the epidemic peak is strongly dependent on the chosen switching surfaces. A comparison between the VSC and sliding mode control (SMC) is presented showing that the VSC control can provide better performance taking into account two aspects: time duration of pandemic and the flattened curve peak with respect to SMC.","Piccirillo, Vinicius","Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals",300,29

Alongside the canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway involving stepwise processing and export of pri- and pre-miRNA transcripts by the microprocessor complex, Exportin 5 and Dicer, several alternative mechanisms of miRNA production have been described. Here, we reveal that the atypical box C/D snoRNA U3, which functions as a scaffold during early ribosome assembly, is a miRNA source. We show that a unique stem-loop structure in the 5' domain of U3 is processed to form short RNA fragments that associate with Argonaute. miR-U3 production is independent of Drosha, and an increased amount of U3 in the cytoplasm in the absence of Dicer suggests that a portion of the full length snoRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is efficiently processed into miRNAs. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that miR-U3 can act as a low proficiency miRNA in vivo and our data support the 3' UTR of the sortin nexin SNX27 mRNA as an endogenous U3-derived miRNA target. We further reveal that perturbation of U3 snoRNP assembly induces miR-U3 production, highlighting potential cross-regulation of target mRNA expression and ribosome production.","Lemus-Diaz, Nicolas; Ferreira, Rafael Rinaldi; Bohnsack, Katherine E; Gruber, Jens; Bohnsack, Markus T",Nucleic acids res,300,16

Here, European seabass acclimatized at 3, 6, 12, and 30 PSU were subjected to 20 days of an ambient extreme winter cold event (8 °C), and monitored for growth and physiological performance. Growth performance decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU compared to 6 and 12 PSU. During cold stress exposure, serum Na+, Cl-, and K+ concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in fish exposed at 30 PSU. Serum cortisol, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were increased significantly (p < 0.05) in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU. In contrast, opposite trends were observed for serum protein, lactate, and triglycerides content during cold exposure. Transaminase activities [glutamic-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl-transaminase (Î³GGT)] were significantly higher in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU on days 10 and 20. The abundance of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance (CFTR) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased in fish exposed at 3 and 30 PSU during cold shock exposure.

This single-center retrospective study evaluated the correlation between serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels at admission with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia, as determined by admission to the intensive Care Unit (ICU). MATERIAL AND METHODS Patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, China, in January and February 2020 for COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this study. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in throat swab samples using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription PCR. Serum IL-6 concentrations at admission were measured by ELISA. Correlations between serum IL-6 concentrations and ICU admission due to the development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated. RESULTS This study enrolled 68 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with more severe than less severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eight of 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia became critically ill and required ICU admission. IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who were than who were not treated in the ICU. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.816 (P<0.01), indicating that IL-6 was prognostic of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS Serum IL-6 concentration is closely associated with the severity of COVID-19.

Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre-post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers' comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners' skill retention. Future work will focus on implementing similar train-the-trainers strategies for other health professions, specialties, and high-risk or rare procedures.","Peterson, William J; Munzer, Brendan W; Tucker, Ryan V; Losman, Eve D; Harvey, Carrie; Hatton, Colman; Sefa, Nana; Bassin, Ben S; Hsu, Cindy H",Acad. med,300,12

Patient symptoms vary greatly and range from mild symptoms to severe fatal complications. Supportive treatments include antipyretics, antiviral therapies, different combinations of broad-spectrum antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine and plasma transfusion. Unfortunately, cancer patients are at higher risk of viral infection and more likely to develop serious complications due to their immunocompromised state, the fact that they are already administering multiple medications, as well as combined comorbidity compared to the general population.

DESIGN: REDcap online based survey of hospital capacity. SETTING: UK secondary and tertiary hospitals providing head and neck cancer surgery. PARTICIPANTS: One representative per hospital was asked to report the capacity for head and neck cancer surgery in that institution. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The principal measures of interests were new patient referrals, capacity in outpatients, theatres and critical care; therapeutic compromises constituting delay to surgery, de-escalated surgery and therapeutic migration to non-surgical primary modality. RESULTS: Data was returned from approximately 95% of UK hospitals with a head and neck cancer surgery specialist service. 50% of UK head and neck cancer patients requiring surgery have significantly compromised treatments during the second wave: 28% delayed, 10% have received radiotherapy-based treatment instead of surgery and 12% have received de-escalated surgery. Surgical capacity has been more severely constrained in the second wave (58% of pre-pandemic level) compared with the first wave (62%) despite the time to prepare. CONCLUSIONS: Some hospitals are overwhelmed by COVID-19 and unable to offer essential cancer surgery, but all have neighbouring hospitals in their region retaining good (or even normal) capacity. It is noteworthy that very few patients have been appropriately re-directed away from the hospitals most constrained by their burden of COVID-19. The paucity of an effective central or regional strategic response to this evident mismatch between demand and surgical capacity is to the detriment of our head and neck cancer patients.","Shaw, Richard",Clin. otolaryngol,300,25

However, incidence might be affected by lower testing rates among vulnerable populations. We aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence, disease severity, and neutralising antibody activity after infection among people with and without HIV receiving care in a county hospital system over a 3-month period. METHODS: In this matched case-control observational study, remnant serum samples were collected between Aug 1 and Oct 31, 2020, from all people living with HIV who underwent routine outpatient laboratory testing in a municipal health-care system (San Francisco General Hospital, CA, USA). Samples from people living with HIV were date of collection-matched (same day) and age-matched (±5 years) to samples from randomly selected adults (aged 18 years or older) without HIV receiving care for chronic conditions at the same hospital. We compared seroprevalence by HIV status via mixed-effects logistic regression models, accounting for the matched structure of the data (random effects for the matched group), adjusting for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and clinical factors (ie, history of cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes). Severe COVID-19 was assessed in participants with past SARS-CoV-2 (IgG or PCR) infection by chart review and compared with multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralising antibody titres, and antibody avidity were measured in serum of participants with previous positive PCR tests and compared with multivariable mixed-effects models, adjusting for age, sex, and time since PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. FINDINGS: 1138 samples from 955 people living with HIV and 1118 samples from 1062 people without HIV were tested. SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroprevalence was 3·7% (95% CI 2·4 to 5·0) among people with HIV compared with 7·4% (5·7 to 9·2) among people without HIV (adjusted odds ratio 0·50, 95% CI 0·30 to 0·83). Among 31 people with HIV and 70 people without HIV who had evidence of past infection, the odds of severe COVID-19 were 5·52 (95% CI 1·01 to 64·48) times higher among people living with HIV. Adjusting for time since PCR-confirmed infection, SARS-CoV-2 IgG concentrations were lower (percentage change -53%, 95% CI -4 to -76), pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres were lower (-67%, -25 to -86), and avidity was similar (7%, -73 to 87) among people living with HIV compared with those without HIV. INTERPRETATION: Although fewer infections were detected by SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing among people living with HIV than among those without HIV, people with HIV had more cases of severe COVID-19. Among people living with HIV with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, lower IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising antibody titres might reflect a diminished serological response to infection, and the similar avidity could be driven by similar time since infection.

METHODS: We apply a novel health services research approach to systematically assess a sample of 55 institutional websites. The accessibility, content, and coverage of occupational health/safety program information were systematically coded for several domains (e.g., OSHA-related, specific hazards, clinical, person-oriented, COVID-19, and coverage). RESULTS: Information was more available for programs related to OSHA mandates (e.g., chemical hygiene) and specific hazards than for person-oriented programs (e.g., counseling). Larger institutions provide better information and more comprehensive programs than smaller institutions. CONCLUSIONS: Higher education institutions warrant increasing attention to occupational health and safety, particularly as COVID-19 increased attention to workplace health issues.","Malomet, Maayan S; Harber, Philip",J Occup Environ Med,300,24

Signatories of this letter to the President of the United States convey concerns that deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a higher prevalence of severe and persistent grief, i.e., prolonged grief disorder. We support their call to action to direct government funding to helping those who develop this condition during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we think that concerns about prolonged grief disorder during the pandemic can be more convincingly conveyed by firmly embedding such concerns within scientific literature. Therefore, we highlight prior scientifically informed opinion pieces from various international researchers who voiced similar concerns in the early months of the pandemic. Additionally, we provide an overview of pioneering empirical research elucidating whether prolonged grief disorder and related mental health problems will become more prevalent during the pandemic.","Eisma, Maarten C; Boelen, Paul A",Omega (Westport),300,3

We have optimized the architecture of two different networks for CT images: (i) a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a specific architecture that integrates the class labels inside the encoder layers and uses side information with shared attention layers for the encoder, which make the most of the contextual clues for representation learning, and (ii) a downstream convolutional neural network for supervised classification using the encoder structure of the CVAE. With the explainable classification results, the proposed diagnosis system is very effective for COVID-19 classification.

However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication-including uncertainty-about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g., social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.","Kerr, J.

Fast, inclusive and adaptive methods are required for the heterogenous SARS-CoV-2 sequence data generated at an unprecedented rate. RESULTS: We present an updated version of the SARS-CoV-2 analysis module of our automated computational pipeline, Infectious Pathogen Detector (IPD) 2.0, to perform genomic analysis to understand the variability and dynamics of the virus. It adopts the recent clade nomenclature and demonstrates the clade prediction accuracy of 92.8%. IPD 2.0 also contains a SARS-CoV-2 updater module, allowing automatic upgrading of the variant database using genome sequences from GISAID. As a proof of principle, analyzing 208,911 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we generate an extensive database of 2.58 million sample-wise variants. A comparative account of lineage-specific mutations in the newer SARS-CoV-2 strains emerging in the UK, South Africa and Brazil and data reported from India identify overlapping and lineages specific acquired mutations suggesting a repetitive convergent and adaptive evolution. CONCLUSIONS: A novel and dynamic feature of the SARS-CoV-2 module of IPD 2.0 makes it a contemporary tool to analyze the diverse and growing genomic strains of the virus and serve as a vital tool to help facilitate rapid genomic surveillance in a population to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections.

Root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) calculations indicated that compounds 132, 134, and 159 were the best scoring compounds against main protease, while compounds 115, 120, and 131 were the best scoring ones against spike glycoprotein. Compounds 120 and 131 were able to achieve significant stability and binding free energies during molecular dynamics simulation. In addition, the highest scoring compounds were investigated for their pharmacokinetic properties and drug-likeness. The Aloe compounds are promising active phytoconstituents for drug development for SARS-CoV-2.","Abouelela, Mohamed E; Assaf, Hamdy K; Abdelhamid, Reda A; Elkhyat, Ehab S; Sayed, Ahmed M; Oszako, Tomasz; Belbahri, Lassaad; El Zowalaty, Ahmed E; Abdelkader, Mohamed Salaheldin A",Molecules (Basel),300,6

This study investigates the stress impact from COVID-19 exposure and how nurses and medical providers (eg, physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) experience these challenges differently. METHODS: An electronic, self-administered questionnaire was sent to all hospital staff over 6 weeks surveying exposure to COVID-19 patients and degree of stress caused by this exposure. Responses from medical providers and nurses were analyzed for significant contributors to stress levels, as well as comparing responses from medical providers versus nurses. RESULTS: Stress levels from increased risk of disease contraction while on the job, fear of transmitting it to family or friends, and the resulting social stigma were highest in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with medical providers, nurses had nearly 4 times the odds of considering job resignation due to COVID-19. However, most health care workers (77.4% of medical providers and 52.9% of nurses) strongly agreed or agreed with the statements indicating high levels of altruism in their desire to treat COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The significant stress burden placed on nurses likely contributes to increased thoughts of job resignation. However, health care providers displayed high levels of altruism during this time of extreme crisis, despite their personal risks of caring for COVID-19 patients.","Chu, Everett; Lee, Kyung-Min; Stotts, Ronnie; Benjenk, Ivy; Ho, Geoffrey; Yamane, David; Mullins, Billy; Heinz, Eric R",J Am Board Fam Med,300,16

This meant that there were no fans in attendance, games played on neutral courts and no traveling for teams, which in theory removes home-court advantage from the games. This setting has attracted much discussion as analysts and fans debated the possible effects it may have on the outcome of games. Home-court advantage has historically played an influential role in NBA playoff series outcomes. The 2020 playoff provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of the bubble and home-court advantage by comparing the 2020 season with the seasons in the past. While many factors contribute to the outcome of games, points scored is the deciding factor of who wins games, so scoring is the primary focus of this study. The specific measures of interest are team scoring totals and team shooting percentage on two-pointers, three-pointers, and free throws. Comparing these measures for home teams and away teams in 2020 vs. 2017-2019 shows that the 2020 playoffs favored away teams more than usual, particularly with two point shooting and total scoring.","Price, Michael; Yan, Jun",,300,10

METHODOLOGY: The nonlinear feature of updated cases is captured through Generalized Additive Mixed Model (GAMM) with threshold points; Exposure-response curve suggests that daily confirmed cases is changed at the different stages of TD according to the threshold points of piecewise function, which traces out the rule of updated cases under different meteorological condition. RESULTS: Our results show that the confirmed cases decreased by 0.390% (95% CI: -0.478 ~ -0.302) for increasing each one degree of TD if TD is less than 11.5°C; It will increase by 0.302% (95% CI: 0.215 ~ 0.388) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) at the interval [11.5, 16]; Meanwhile the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases will increase by 0.321% (95% CI: 0.142 ~ 0.499) for every 1°C increase in the TD (lag0-4) when the TD (lag0-4) is over 16°C, and the most fluctuation occurred on Sunday. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed our model robust. CONCLUSIONS: In US, this interval effect of TD reminds us that it is urgent to control the spread and infection of COVID-19 when TD becomes greater in autumn and the ongoing winter.","Ding, Yongmei; Gao, Liyuan; Shao, Ning-Yi",J Infect Dev Ctries,300,20

This document aims to summarize recent evidence and experts' opinion and formulate recommendations to guide the surgical community on how to best organize the recovery plan for surgical activity across different sub-specialities after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Recommendations were developed through a Delphi process for establishment of expert consensus. Domain topics were formulated and subsequently subdivided into questions pertinent to different surgical specialities following the COVID-19 crisis. Sixty-five experts from 24 countries, representing the entire EAES board, were invited. Fifty clinicians and six engineers accepted the invitation and drafted statements based on specific key questions. Anonymous voting on the statements was performed until consensus was achieved, defined by at least 70% agreement. RESULTS: A total of 92 consensus statements were formulated with regard to safe resumption of surgery across eight domains, addressing general surgery, upper GI, lower GI, bariatrics, endocrine, HPB, abdominal wall and technology/research. The statements addressed elective and emergency services across all subspecialties with specific attention to the role of MIS during the recovery plan. Eighty-four of the statements were approved during the first round of Delphi voting (91.3%) and another 8 during the following round after substantial modification, resulting in a 100% consensus. CONCLUSION: The recommendations formulated by the EAES board establish a framework for resumption of surgery following COVID-19 pandemic with particular focus on the role of MIS across surgical specialities. The statements have the potential for wide application in the clinical setting, education activities and research work across different healthcare systems.","Arezzo, Alberto; Francis, Nader; Mintz, Yoav; Adamina, Michel; Antoniou, Stavros A; Bouvy, Nicole; Copaescu, Catalin; de Manzini, Nicolò; Di Lorenzo, Nicola; Morales-Conde, Salvador; Müller-Stich, Beat P; Nickel, Felix; Popa, Dorin; Tait, Diana; Thomas, Cenydd; Nimmo, Susan; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Pietrabissa, Andrea",Surg Endosc,300,29

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as PCR and isothermal amplification methods provide excellent analytical performance and significantly faster turnaround times than conventional culture-based methods. However, the inherent cost and complexity of NAATs limit their application in resource-limited settings and the developing world. To help address this urgent need, we have developed a sensitive method for nucleic acid analysis based on padlock probe rolling circle amplification (PLRCA), nuclease protection (NP) and lateral flow detection (LFA), referred to as PLAN-LFA, that can be used in resource-limited settings. The assay involves solution-phase hybridization of a padlock probe to target, sequence-specific ligation of the probe to form a circular template that undergoes isothermal rolling circle amplification in the presence of a polymerase and a labeled probe DNA. The RCA product is a long, linear concatenated single-stranded DNA that contains binding sites for the labeled probe. The sample is then exposed to a nuclease which selectively cleaves single-stranded DNA, the double-stranded labeled probe is protected from nuclease digestion and detected in a lateral flow immunoassay format to provide a visual, colorimetric readout of results. We have developed specific assays targeting beta-lactamase resistance gene for monitoring of antimicrobial resistance and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus discovered in 2019) using the PLAN-LFA platform. The assay provides a limit of detection of 1.1 pM target DNA (or 1.3 × 106 copies per reaction). We also demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the method by performing analysis on DNA and RNA targets, and perform analysis in complex sample matrices like saliva, plant tissue extract and bacterial culture without any sample pretreatment steps.","Jain, Sidhartha; Dandy, David S; Geiss, Brian J; Henry, Charles S",Analyst,300,26

The authors posit that improved supply chain signals can result in improved handling and distribution of vaccines in a post-COVID world and identify recommendations for redesign of the vaccine supply chain as well as future research questions for scholars. Design/methodology/approach: The supply chain operating reference (SCOR) model is used as a framework to identify each of the major gaps that exist in the supply chain for the COVID vaccine. The critical bottlenecks and delays that exist within this supply chain are identified through this framework and validated through the ongoing research and interviews in the field. Findings: Whilst the vaccine supply chain for influenza is perfectly sized for development and distribution of this cyclical virus, the emergence of a new virus created a pandemic, which has exposed a number of critical shortages. The authors find that the design of the COVID vaccine supply chain suffers from a flawed structure. To date, less than 3% of the United States and global population has been fully vaccinated. The authors advocate a “back to front design”, beginning with demand planning for actual vaccinations and working backwards toward supply planning and distribution planning. These lessons may be helpful for capacity planning and supply chain strategy for future vaccinations as variants of the COVID vaccine emerge. Originality/value: The authors provide a unique approach for viewing the current shortages that exist in the vaccine supply chain and offer suggestions for new variants of this supply chain for the future. © 2021, Government of the United States of America.","Finkenstadt, D.

Voluntary and anonymous responses were collected from April 15 to May 15, 2020. In addition to summary statistics, categorical data were compared using &#967;2 tests (Fisher's exact). Responses were obtained from FITs across all years of training and primary specialties (Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Medicine-Pediatrics) with a response rate of 32.6% (124 of 380). Reassignment to COVID-19 clinical responsibilities was reported by 12% (15 of 124) of FITs, with the largest proportion in the US northeast region. A majority of FITs used telehealth (95%) and virtual learning (82%) during the pandemic. Overall, 21% (25 of 120) of FITs expressed concern about potentially lacking clinical experience for independently practicing allergy and immunology. However, FITs using telehealth reported lower concern compared with those who did not (18.4% [21 of 114] vs 66.7% [4 of 6]; P = .01). The survey shows that allergy and immunology trainee experiences have varied considerably since the COVID-19 outbreak. Notably, the adoption of telehealth and virtual learning was commonly reported, and optimization of these virtual experiences will be helpful. Even outside of pandemics, training on the use of telemedicine may be a sound strategy in preparation for future health care delivery and unexpected events.","Kahwash, Basil M; Deshpande, Deepti R; Guo, Canting; Panganiban, Christine M; Wangberg, Hannah; Craig, Timothy J",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,300,24

Air pollution has been warned of as a modifiable factor contributing to differential SARS-CoV-2 spread but the biological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are still unknown. Air quality and COVID-19 epidemiological data from 110 Italian provinces were studied by correlation analysis, to evaluate the association between particulate matter (PM)2.5 concentrations and incidence, mortality rate and case fatality risk of COVID-19 in the period 20 February-31 March 2020. Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was performed to identify consensus motifs for transcription factors mediating cellular response to pollutant insult.

Studies show that despite its similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, there are critical differences in key RBD residues when compared to SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a short in silico study, showing that SARS-like bat coronavirus Rs3367 shares a high conservation with SARS-CoV-2 in important RBD residues for ACE2 binding: SARS-CoV-2's Phe486, Thr500, Asn501 and Tyr505; implicated in receptor-binding strength and host-range determination. These features were not shared with other studied bat coronaviruses belonging to the betacoronavirus genus, including RaTG13, the closest reported bat coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2's spike protein. Sequence and phylogeny analyses were followed by the computation of a reliable model of the RBD of SARS-like bat coronavirus Rs3367, which allowed structural insight of the conserved residues. Superimposition of this model on the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-RBD complex revealed critical ACE2 contacts are also maintained. In addition, residue Asn488Rs3367 interacted with a previously defined pocket on ACE2 composed of Tyr41, Lys353 and Asp355. When compared to available SARS-CoV-2 crystal structure data, Asn501SARS-CoV-2 showed a different interaction with the ACE2 pocket. Taken together, this study offers molecular insights on RBD-receptor interactions with implications for vaccine design.","Fraguas Bringas, Conchita; Booth, David",Access Microbiol,300,26

METHODSPeople with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nashville, Tennessee and central and western Wisconsin and their household contacts were followed daily for 14 days to ascertain symptoms and secondary transmission events. Households were enrolled between April 2020 and April 2021. Secondary infection risks (SIR) by age of the primary case and contacts were estimated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTSThe 226 primary cases were followed by 198 (49%) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections among 404 household contacts. Age group-specific SIR among contacts ranged from 36% to 53%, with no differences by age. SIR was lower from primary cases aged 12-17 years than from primary cases 18-49 years (risk ratio [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-0.91). SIR was 55% and 45%, respectively, among primary case-contact pairs in the same versus different age group (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.98-2.22). SIR was highest among primary case-contacts pairs aged [≥]65 years (76%) and 5-11 years (69%).

Given the chemical interaction between calcium and phosphate (Pi), the increased serum Pi in chronic kidney disease may cause changes in the composition and structure of the prCa fraction. Here, we report the phosphate binding on the protein-bound calcium in uremic rat serum. Using adenine-fed rats as a uremic model, we separated the calcium and phosphate fractions in rat serum by ultrafiltration, and found that the level of protein-bound phosphate (prPi) in the uremic serum was markedly higher than in control. The elevated prPi level was comparable to the prCa level, consistent with the presence of protein-bound calcium phosphate pr(Ca)j-m(CaPi)m. We then confirmed its presence by ex vivo X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, revealing the discrete state of the calcium phosphate clusters associated with protein. Finally, in a quantitative investigation using Ca- and Pi-boosted serum, we discovered the threshold concentration for the Pi binding on prCa, and determined the binding constant. The threshold, while preventing Pi from binding to prCa in normal condition, allows the reaction to take place in hyperphosphatemia conditions. The protein-bound calcium phosphate could act as a link between the metabolism of serum proteins and the homeostasis of phosphate and calcium, and it deserves further investigation whether the molar ratio of (prPi/prCa)â 100% may serve as a serum index of the vascular calcification status in chronic kidney disease.","Fan, Hong-Xing; Gou, Bao-Di; Gao, Yu-Xi; Wu, Gang; Liu, Shu-Hu; Li, Fan; Zhang, Tian-Lan",,300,22

In this study, we investigated the value of non-diabetic glycosuria as a diagnostic clue for ATIN. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adult patients who underwent a kidney biopsy as an evaluation for serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dL. Patients with proteinuria in the nephrotic range, diabetes mellitus, or transplanted kidney were excluded. The laboratory abnormalities suggestive of tubular injury were compared between 28 patients (14 men and 14 women, mean age 48.5 ± 14.1 years) with ATIN and 116 patients (76 men and 40 women, mean age 53.1 ± 15.0 years) with other diagnoses. RESULTS: In ATIN, glycosuria (&#8805; 1+ on dipstick; 68%) was more frequent than hypophosphatemia (18%), hypouricemia (18%), hypokalemia (18%), and tubular proteinuria (40%). In other diagnoses, glycosuria (&#8805; 1+) was detected in 7 (6%) patients; 6 of them had the histological diagnosis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated glomerulonephritis. The presence of glycosuria (&#8805; 1+) had 68% sensitivity and 94% specificity for ATIN, with the positive likelihood ratio of 11.24 and the negative likelihood ratio of 0.34. Pyuria and low total CO2 were equally and more sensitive (68% and 71%, respectively) than glycosuria (&#8805; 1+), but had no diagnostic value due to low specificities (58% and 60%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In non-diabetic, non-nephrotic patients undergoing a kidney biopsy for azotemia, 1+ or higher glycosuria, if present, was a good predictor of the diagnosis of ATIN.","Lee, Taeyeon; Yang, Won Seok",Ren Fail,300,16

Initially, the large number of infected people required the direction of global healthcare resources to provide supportive care for the acutely ill population in an attempt to reduce mortality. While clinical trials for safe and effective antiviral agents are ongoing, and vaccine development programs are being accelerated, long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized and concerning. Although the upper and lower respiratory tracts are the main sites of entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body, resulting in COVID-19 pneumonia as the most common presentation, acute lung damage may be followed by pulmonary fibrosis and chronic impairment of lung function, with impaired quality of life. Also, increasing reports have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection involves the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and directly or indirectly damages neurons, leading to long-term neurological sequelae. This review aims to provide an update on the mechanisms involved in the development of the long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the 3 main areas of lung injury, neuronal injury, and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and multiple sclerosis, and highlights the need for patient monitoring following the acute stage of infection with SARS-CoV-2 to provide a rationale for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of these potential long-term sequelae.","Wang, Fuzhou; Kream, Richard M; Stefano, George B",Med Sci Monit,300,26

This information can be dynamically filtered and focus analyzes on the national, departmental, or municipal order. Additionally, methods are implemented for trend analysis, both on a linear and semi-log scale, as well as for calculating the case fatality rate in each of the municipalities. Results A web-based data analysis dashboard is implemented for semi-continuous monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. With the use of the tool, a situational analysis is carried out for five of the most important cities in Colombia. Conclusions The application is effective, flexible, and easy to use. The situational analysis reflects that public policies for the control of the disease have been favorable for Medellín, but for Cartagena, Bogotá, Barranquilla, and Cali, complementary measures are required.(AU)","Aristizábal-Torres, Daniel; Peñuela-Meneses, Cesar A; Barrera-Rodríguez, Ana M",Rev. salud pública,300,3

To properly address this crisis with both robust testing and novel treatments, we require a deep understanding of the life cycle of the causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Here, we examine the architecture and self-assembly properties of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which packages viral RNA into new virions. We determined a 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of this protein's N2b domain, revealing a compact, intertwined dimer similar to that of related coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. While the N2b domain forms a dimer in solution, addition of the C-terminal spacer B/N3 domain mediates formation of a homotetramer. Using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we find evidence that at least part of this putatively disordered domain is structured, potentially forming an &#945;-helix that self-associates and cooperates with the N2b domain to mediate tetramer formation. Finally, we map the locations of amino acid substitutions in the N protein from over 38,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. We find that these substitutions are strongly clustered in the protein's N2a linker domain, and that substitutions within the N1b and N2b domains cluster away from their functional RNA binding and dimerization interfaces. Overall, this work reveals the architecture and self-assembly properties of a key protein in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle, with implications for both drug design and antibody-based testing.","Ye, Qiaozhen; West, Alan M V; Silletti, Steve; Corbett, Kevin D",Protein sci,300,24

To estimate the number of infected persons in our community, we conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This cross-sectional study evaluated the presence of immunoglobulin G, antibody for SARS-CoV-2 during the time period of July 15, 2020, to July 27, 2020. Testing was done on serum samples from patients who had visited affiliated outpatient clinics or our emergency department. Additionally, we collected age, gender, ethnicity, race, and location of testing. RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-five tests were included in the study. The outpatient clinics cohort accounted for 56% of results and emergency department (ED) contributed 44%. The positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 test was 9.4% (95% CI: 0.08-0.12). The positivity rates of the outpatient (5.6%) and ED (14.2%) setting differed. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG was greatest in those that identified as Hispanic/Latino, 18.1% versus 13.4% in other groups. Specifically compared to the non-Hispanic/Latino population, the prevalence was significantly higher, with a relative risk of 2.73 (95% CI: 1.8-4.1), p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: The low antibody positivity rate in the community indicates the need for a vaccine. The Hispanic/Latino patient population should be considered for increased education on preventing transmission and acquisition of COVID-19 as well as being considered as a priority for vaccination once a vaccine is available.","Yamaki, Jason; Peled, Harry; Mathews, Sajen; Park, David; Firoozi, Mina; Smith, Kim; Nguyen, Lee",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),300,28

Here we report the cryo-EM structures of HKU2 and SADS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein trimers at 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å resolution, respectively. We systematically compare the domains of HKU2 spike with those of &#945;-, ß-, Î³-, and Î´-coronavirus spikes, showing that the S1 subunit N- and C-terminal domains of HKU2/SADS-CoV are ancestral domains in the evolution of coronavirus spike proteins. The connecting region after the fusion peptide in the S2 subunit of HKU2/SADS-CoV adopts a unique conformation.

Here, we studied the time trend of inflammatory markers in a population of hemodialysis (HD) patients affected by COVID-19, undergoing two different dialysis approaches. In a prospective study, thirty-one maintenance HD patients with COVID-19 were randomized to expanded HD (HDx), performed using a medium cut-off membrane, or standard treatment using a protein-leaking dialyzer (PLD). Circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-10 (IL-10), soluble TLR4 (sTLR4), and interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³), were collected at diagnosis, and one and two weeks after. Compared with 14 non-infected HD patients, COVID-19 patients showed lymphopenia and higher ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Moreover, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of IL-10 (15.2 (12.5) vs. 1.2 (1.4) pg/mL, p = 0.02). Twenty-nine patients were randomized to HDx (n = 15) or PLD (n = 14). After a single treatment, IL-8 showed a significant reduction in both groups, whereas IL-10 decreased only in HDx. All over the study, there were no significant modifications in circulating cytokine levels between the two groups, except for a parallel increase of IL-8 and IL-10 at one week control in the HDx group. No correlations were found between cytokine levels and clinical outcomes. In maintenance HD patients, COVID-19 is not related to a sustained inflammatory response. Therefore, modulation of inflammation seems not to be a suitable therapeutic target in this specific population.","Esposito, Pasquale; Cipriani, Leda; Verzola, Daniela; Grignano, Maria Antonietta; De Amici, Mara; Testa, Giorgia; Grosjean, Fabrizio; Russo, Elisa; Garibotto, Giacomo; Rampino, Teresa; Viazzi, Francesca",,300,24

In this study, we aimed to analyze the potential risk and protective factors for parents' and children's well-being during a potentially traumatic event such as the COVID-19 quarantine. Specifically, we investigated parents' and children's well-being, parental stress, and children's resilience. The study involved 463 Italian parents of children aged 5-17. All participants completed an online survey consisting of the Psychological General Well Being Index (PGWB) to assess parental well-being, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to measure children's well-being, the Parent Stress Scale (PSS) to investigate parental stress, and the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-R) to measure children's resilience. The results show that confinement measures and changes in daily routine negatively affect parents' psychological dimensions, thus exposing children to a significant risk for their well-being. Our results also detect some risk factors for psychological maladjustments, such as parental stress, lower levels of resilience in children, changes in working conditions, and parental psychological, physical, or genetic problems. In this study, we attempted to identify the personal and contextual variables involved in the psychological adjustment to the COVID-19 quarantine to identify families at risk for maladjustment and pave the way for ad hoc intervention programs intended to support them. Our data show promising results for the early detection of the determinants of families' psychological health. It is important to focus attention on the needs of families and children-including their mental health-to mitigate the health and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cusinato, Maria; Iannattone, Sara; Spoto, Andrea; Poli, Mikael; Moretti, Carlo; Gatta, Michela; Miscioscia, Marina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,21

To investigate the expression level of these SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes in the lung airway, we used public gene expression datasets. We have found a differential expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in nasal and bronchial airways relative to age and diseases status. Children were found to have significantly lower expression of COVID-19 receptors in the upper and lower airways (nasal and bronchial). Moreover, the lung airway expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was found to be significantly upregulated in smokers compared with non-smokers, and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with healthy subjects. No difference was observed in the blood expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between children and adults, or in COPD or diabetic patients. However, a significant increase in blood expression levels of these genes was observed in patients with essential hypertension, whereas only ACE2 was upregulated in the blood of asthmatics. These results suggest that the observed difference in COVID-19 severity between children and adults could, in part, be attributed to the difference in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 airways tissue expression levels. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins to enter human cells. Using gene expression datasets, Halwani and coworkers showed that the airways expression of these receptors is lower in children, but upregulated in smokers and COPD patients. This may contribute to the difference in disease severity observed among these patient categories.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Alabed, Mashael; Temsah, Mohamed-Hani; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Mol.

The ability of the virus to evade the host immune response have been major reasons for high morbidity and mortality. One of the important clinical observations under conditions of critical illness show increased risk of developing disseminated intravascular coagulation. Molecular mechanisms of how SARS CoV-2 induces such conditions still remain unclear. This report describes the presence of two unique motifs in the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N-protein) that can potentially interact with fibrinogen and possibly prothrombin. This is based on an established function of secretory proteins in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-coagulase, Efb (Extracellular fibrinogen binding) and vWBP (von Willebrand factor Binding Protein), which are known to regulate the blood clotting cascade and the functions of host immune response. It is hypothesized that having protein interaction motifs that are homologous to these S. aureus proteins, the N-protein of this virus can mimic their functions, which may in turn play a crucial role in formation of blood clots in the host and help the virus evade host immune response. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in vitro. Considering the overwhelming increase in the incidence of SARS CoV-2 infection globally, this information may be useful for further investigation and could help in deducing new therapeutic strategies to combat advanced stages of this disease.","Sangith, Nikhil",Med Hypotheses,300,33

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of RRI in relation to AKI in patients with COVID-19 treated in the intensive care unit. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, RRI was measured in COVID-19 patients in six intensive care units at two sites of a Swedish University Hospital. AKI was defined by the creatinine criteria in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes classification. We investigated the association between RRI and AKI diagnosis, different AKI stages and urine output. RESULTS: RRI was measured in 51 patients, of which 23 patients (45%) had AKI at the time of measurement. Median RRI in patients with AKI was 0.80 (IQR 0.71-0.85) compared to 0.72 (IQR 0.67-0.78) in patients without AKI (p = 0.004). Compared to patients without AKI, RRI was higher in patients with AKI stage 3 (median 0.83, IQR 0.71-0.85, p = 0.006) but not in patients with AKI stage 1 (median 0.76, IQR 0.71-0.83, p = 0.347) or AKI stage 2 (median 0.79, min/max 0.79/0.80, n = 2, p = 0.134). RRI was higher in patients with an ongoing AKI episode compared to patients who never developed AKI (median 0.72, IQR 0.69-0.78, p = 0.015) or patients who developed AKI but had recovered at the time of measurement (median 0.68, IQR 0.67-0.81, p = 0.021).

After multivariable adjustment, RRI was independently associated with AKI (OR for 0.01 increments of RRI 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.41). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill COVID-19 patients with AKI have higher RRI compared to those without AKI, and elevated RRI may have a role in identifying severe and oliguric AKI at the bedside in these patients.","Renberg, Mårten; Jonmarker, Olof; Kilhamn, Naima; Rimes-Stigare, Claire; Bell, Max; Hertzberg, Daniel",Ultrasound J,300,24

The Chinese Government has been taking a series of rapid, comprehensive, and effective prevention and control measures. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. This is one of the major factors affecting the progress of epidemic prevention and control. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. A sound system of emergency reserve supplies is crucial to the management of public health emergencies. Based on international experiences with pandemic control, the world should emphasize improving the system of emergency reserve medical supplies in the process of establishing and improving public health emergency response systems, and it should promote the establishment of international cooperative programs to jointly deal with public health emergencies of international concern in the future.","Wang, Xu; Zhang, Xiaoxi; He, Jiangjiang",Biosci Trends,300,24

The patient received antiviral therapy, antibacterial therapy, recombinant human interferon-&#945;2a, vitamin C and oxygen inhalation. After two weeks of treatment and observation, the patient was clinical cured and discharged. However, two days later, the patient had a sudden chest stuffiness, CT images indicted: his lung didn't heal like others, but developed a large pulmonary cavity in the lower lobe of right lung. In hospital, the patient showed no symptoms of infection for another 14 days, and the pulmonary cavity remain unchanged.

Currently, there is a lack of evidence-based therapies to prevent COVID-19 following exposure to the virus, or to prevent worsening of symptoms following confirmed infection. We describe the design of a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-emptive therapy (PET) for COVID-19. METHODS: We will conduct two nested multicentre international double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine for: 1) PEP of asymptomatic household contacts or healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 within the past four days, and 2) PET for symptomatic outpatients with COVID-19 showing symptoms for less than four days. We will recruit 1,500 patients each for the PEP and PET trials. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive five days of hydroxychloroquine or placebo. The primary PEP trial outcome will be the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19. The primary PET trial outcome will be an ordinal scale of disease severity (not hospitalized, hospitalized without intensive care, hospitalization with intensive care, or death). Participant screening, informed consent, and follow-up will be exclusively internet-based with appropriate regulatory and research ethics board approvals in Canada and the United States. DISCUSSION: These complementary randomized-controlled trials are innovatively designed and adequately powered to rapidly answer urgent questions regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine to reduce virus transmission and disease severity of COVID-19 during a pandemic. In-person participant follow-up will not be conducted to facilitate social distancing strategies and reduce risks of exposure to study personnel. Innovative trial approaches are needed to urgently assess therapeutic options to mitigate the global impact of this pandemic.

While in the past, programming skills were much more related to fields of computer sciences and engineering, today, professionals from different areas benefit from the ability to write codes for different applications. Furthermore, programming stimulates logical thinking, which impacts other personal abilities. Health science students have limited exposure to programming during their studies. Aware of this and considering the prolonged time in social distancing in Brazil due to the SARS-COV2 pandemic in 2020, we organized an outreach course dedicated to teaching introductory concepts of programming for health science students. The activity was developed fully online using the Zoom web conference agent, lasting 12 wk (8 synchronous classes, 15 synchronous hours in total), and attended by 27 undergraduate and graduate students from two different universities. A collaborative problem-based learning and group-learning methodology were developed through asynchronous homework and mainly online synchronous activities. In this article, we describe our approach and provide some suggestions for replicating the course in other universities. We observed that the activities of the outreach course improved programming skills and confidence for most of the students. More importantly, it piqued their interest enough to motivate them to continue to practice writing and testing their programs. We concluded that an outreach course dedicated to programming promoted improvements in programming skills in health science students. Furthermore, the program was an opportunity to keep the students active in science while working from their homes during the pandemic.","De la Fuente, Carlos I; Guadagnin, Eliane Celina; Kunzler, Marcos Roberto; Carpes, Felipe P",Adv Physiol Educ,300,5

Outcomes from community based commercial weight management programmes vary, relapse is common and drop out is high. Outcomes could be improved by better understanding experiences on these programmes. The aim of our study was to generate accounts of people's experience on a commercial weight-management program to identify what experiences were perceived as facilitating, and what posed risks, to programme effectiveness and compliance. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with eighteen Caucasian women (mean age 45.4y) who were members of nation-wide UK commercial, fee-paying, community weight management programme. Interview data was analysed via framework analysis. Participants' experiences indicated that the programme helped by triggering several intra- and interpersonal processes that catalysed change across psychological, physiological, dietary and behavioural areas of their life. Risks to program adherence and effectiveness spanned well-known risks such as self-regulation fatigue and the difficulty of recovering from negative self-criticism, as well as new factors such as the confusing nature of weight change, the relatively powerful impact of everyday events, and the difficulty in getting the balance right between personalised support vs. intrusion. The complexity of reported experiences challenges the linear, predictive pathways of change proposed by many health behaviour models of weight management. To improve effectiveness, programmes need to go well beyond behavioural and dietary support. It is recommended that community, commercial programmes educate people about the physiological and psychological tensions they will encounter, why people lose weight at different rates, the likelihood of weight relapse and strategies to manage these, including evidence-based support for managing self-criticism.","Hugh-Jones, Siobhan; Burke, Shaunna; Stubbs, James",Appetite,300,16

Even though damping mechanisms and causes are well-known, no simple, generally valid formula exists. Here, a simulation technique is shown that allows producing an optical model for any bending geometries of melt-spun polymer optical fibres. The developed model takes all relevant loss mechanisms into account, especially regarding the scattering losses at the interface of core and cladding as well as those of the cladding-air interface. The latter is caused by interfacial roughness for which experimental data have been obtained by atomic force microscopy measurements.

The variance between model and experimental data is low (S < 4.6%). The model not only contributes to improving the understanding of the optical properties of POFs, but it also has direct applicability to the design of photonic textile sensors for medicine, where the fibres are incorporated with small bending radii.","Lustermann, Birgit; Quandt, B Maike; Ulrich, Sebastian; Spano, Fabrizio; Rossi, René M; Boesel, Luciano F",Sci Rep,300,21

Despite high importance of macrophytes in shallow permafrost thaw lakes for control of major and trace nutrients in lake water, the trace element (TE) partitioning between macrophytes and lake water and sediments in the permafrost regions remains virtually unknown. Here we sampled dominant macrophytes in thermokarst lakes of discontinuous and continuous permafrost zones in the Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) and measured major and trace elements in plant biomass, lake water, lake sediments and sediment porewater. All six plant species (Hippuris vulgaris L., Glyceria maxima (Hartm.) Holmb., Comarum palustre L., Ranunculus spitzbergensis Hadac, Carex aquatilis Wahlenb s. str., Menyanthes trifoliata L.) sizably accumulated macronutrients (Na, Mg, Ca), micronutrients (B, Mo, Nu, Cu, Zn, Co) and toxicants (As, Cd). Accumulation of other trace elements, including rare earth elements (REE), in macrophytes relative to pore waters and sediments was highly variable among species. Using miltiparametric statistics, we described the behavior of Ð¢Ð across two permafrost zones and identified several group of elements depending on their sources in the lake ecosystems and their affinity to sediments and macrophytes. Under future climate warming and shifting the permafrost border to the north, we anticipate an increasing uptake of heavy metals and lithogenic low mobile elements such as Ti, Al, Cr, As, Cu, Fe, Ni, Ga, Zr, and REEs by macrophytes in the discontinuous permafrost zone and Ba, Zn, Pb and Cd in the continuous permafrost zone. This may eventually diminish transport of metal micronutrients and geochemical tracers from soils to lakes and rivers and further to the Arctic Ocean.","Manasypov, Rinat M; Pokrovsky, Oleg S; Shirokova, Liudmila S; Auda, Yves; Zinner, Nadezhda S; Vorobyev, Sergey N; Kirpotin, Sergey N",Sci Total Environ,300,16

There is insufficient data in Pakistan and in South Asia regarding paediatric COVID-19 demographics and related parameters. The main aim of this study was to assess the paediatric population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection, their clinical parameters, risk factors, and outcome. Methods. This was a descriptive retrospective study conducted at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and Federal General Hospital Islamabad from 23rd July 2020 to 22nd August 2020. All paediatric contacts (≤13 years) of one hundred adult COVID-19 patients were included. Data of the index cases was taken from the medical records. Paediatric data was collected on the phone using a predesigned proforma. Results. There were 137 paediatric contacts of 100 adult COVID-19 index cases. The index cases were predominantly males (67%) and belonged to the middle socioeconomic class (89%), and 14% succumbed to the disease. Females had more paediatric contacts. The mean age of contacts was 6.6 years, and the majority (80%) developed no symptoms. Among the symptomatic contacts, fever and cough were the most common symptoms. None of the contacts developed dyspnoea or required hospitalization. Majority of the contacts had been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine. Testing for COVID-19 was done in only 77 (56%) contacts, 25 (32%) by the government team, and 52 (67%) privately. A higher number of symptomatic contacts were positive (15/17 (88%)) as compared to that of the asymptomatic contacts (6/60 (10%)) (p=0.002). Development of symptoms in the contacts was associated with the history of respiratory illnesses, recurrent infections, use of hematinics, a positive COVID-test result, and health professionals being index cases (p≤0.01). Parents with higher education and in the health profession and the families of symptomatic contacts reported better compliance with quarantine regulations. Conclusion. A significant number of children were exposed to adult COVID-19 patients. Most paediatric contacts remained asymptomatic. Children with preexisting medical conditions and with parents in health profession were susceptible to infection.","Farooq, A.; Sheikh, T.

We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing allogeneic HCT (4/2008-9/2018) with HCoV (OC43/NL63/HKU1/229E) detected by polymerase chain reaction during conditioning or post-HCT. Risk factors for all manifestations of LRTI and progression to LRTI among those presenting with HCoV upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) were analyzed by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Mortality rates following HCoV LRTI were compared according to virologic documentation by BAL. A total of 297 patients (61 children and 236 adults) developed HCoV infection as follows: 254 had URTI alone, 18 presented with LRTI, and 25 progressed from URTI to LRTI (median, 16 days; range, 2-62 days). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that male sex, higher immunodeficiency scoring index, albumin <3 g/dL, glucose >150 mg/dL, and presence of respiratory copathogens were associated with occurrence of LRTI. Hyperglycemia with steroid use was associated with progression to LRTI (P < .01) in Cox models. LRTI with HCoV detected in BAL was associated with higher mortality than LRTI without documented detection in BAL (P < .01). In conclusion, we identified factors associated with HCoV LRTI, some of which are less commonly appreciated to be risk factors for LRTI with other respiratory viruses in HCT recipients. The association of hyperglycemia with LRTI might provide an intervention opportunity to reduce the risk of LRTI.","Ogimi, Chikara; Xie, Hu; Waghmare, Alpana; Ueda Oshima, Masumi; Mallhi, Kanwaldeep K; Jerome, Keith R; Leisenring, Wendy M; Englund, Janet A; Boeckh, Michael",Blood Adv,300,1

While great global efforts are underway to develop vaccines and to discover or repurpose therapeutic agents for this disease, as of this writing only the nucleoside drug remdesivir has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization to treat COVID-19. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a viral enzyme for viral RNA replication in host cells, is one of the most intriguing and promising drug targets for SARS-CoV-2 drug development. Because RdRP is a viral enzyme with no host cell homologs, selective SARS-CoV-2 RdRP inhibitors can be developed that have improved potency and fewer off-target effects against human host proteins and thus are safer and more effective therapeutics for treating COVID-19. This review focuses on biochemical enzyme and cell-based assays for RdRPs that could be used in high-throughput screening to discover new and repurposed drugs against SARS-CoV-2.","Zhu, Wei; Chen, Catherine Z; Gorshkov, Kirill; Xu, Miao; Lo, Donald C; Zheng, Wei",SLAS Discov,300,24

The gold standard for COVID-19 detection is the use of RT-PCR tests. However, due to the high demand for tests, these can take days or even weeks in some regions of Brazil. Thus, an alternative for detecting COVID-19 is the analysis of Digital Chest X-rays (XR). Changes due to COVID-19 can be detected in XR, even in asymptomatic patients. In this context, models based on deep learning have great potential to be used as support systems for diagnosis or as screening tools. In this paper, we propose the evaluation of convolutional neural networks to identify pneumonia due to COVID-19 in XR. The proposed methodology consists of a preprocessing step of the XR, data augmentation, and classification by the convolutional architectures DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, MovileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16 pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. The obtained results demonstrate that the VGG16 architecture obtained superior performance in the classification of XR for the evaluation metrics using the methodology proposed in this article. The obtained results for our methodology demonstrate that the VGG16 architecture presented a superior performance in the classification of XR, with an Accuracy of 85.11%, Sensitivity of 85.25%, Specificity of $85.16%, F1-score of $85.03%, and an AUC of 0.9758.","Zeiser, Felipe Andr'e; Costa, Cristiano Andr'e da; Ramos, Gabriel de Oliveira; Bohn, Henrique; Santos, Ismael; Righi, Rodrigo da Rosa",,300,29

Obesity alters different components of the innate and adaptive immune responses, creating a chronic and low-grade state of inflammation. Nutritional status is closely related to a better or worse prognosis of viral infections. Excess weight has been recognised as a risk factor for COVID-19 complications. In addition to the direct risk, obesity triggers other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, increasing the risk of severe COVID-19. The present review explains the diets that induce obesity and the importance of different foods in this process. We also review tissue disruption in obesity, leading to impaired immune responses and the possible mechanisms by which obesity and its co-morbidities increase COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Nutritional strategies that support the immune system in patients with obesity and with COVID-19 are also discussed in light of the available data, considering the severity of the infection. The discussions held may contribute to combating this global emergency and planning specific public health policy.","Morais, Ana Heloneida de Araújo; Passos, Thais Sousa; de Lima Vale, Sancha Helena; da Silva Maia, Juliana Kelly; Maciel, Bruna Leal Lima",Nutr Res Rev,300,1

To ascertain whether it is necessary to treat these patients in hospitals, especially in asymptomatic cases, we summarize and analyze the clinical and treatment characteristics of patients re-admitted to hospital with a second COVID-19 infection. Methods: Of the 141 COVID-19 cases admitted to the Wenzhou Central Hospital between January 17, 2020, to March 5, 2020, which were followed until March 30, 2020, 12 patients were re-admitted with a second COVID-19 infection. Data was collected and analyzed from their clinical records, lab indexes, commuted tomography (CT), and treatment strategies. Results: Most of the 141 patients had positive outcomes from treatment, with only 12 (8.5%) being re-admitted. In this sub-group: one (8.3%) had a fever, a high white blood cell count (WBC), and progressive CT changes; and one (8.3%) had increased transaminase. The PCR tests of these two patients returned negative results. Another 10 patients were admitted due to a positive PCR test result, seven of which were clinically asymptomatic. Compared to the CT imaging following their initial discharge, the CT imaging of all patients was significantly improved, and none required additional oxygen or mechanical ventilation during their second course of treatment. Conclusions: The prognoses of the re-admitted patients were good with no serious cases. We conclude that home treatment with concentrated medical observation is a safe and feasible course of treatment if the patient returns a positive PCR test result but does not display serious clinical symptoms. During medical observation, patients with underlying conditions should remain a primary focus, but most do not need to be re-admitted to the hospital.","Ye, Xinchun; Yuan, Yuping; Huang, Risheng; Cheng, Aiqiong; Yu, Zhijie; Huang, Ziyang; Chen, Rongrong; Jiang, Xiangao; Zheng, Yuanliang; Shi, Jichan",Front Public Health,300,16

Despite the continuous progress in ASCVD therapy, the residual risk persists beyond the management of traditional risk factors. Several infections including Helicobacter pylori infection, periodontal disease, and viral infections are associated with the increased risk of ASCVD, both directly by damage to the heart muscle and vasculature, and indirectly by triggering a systemic proinflammatory state. Hence, beyond the optimal management of the traditional ASCVD risk factors, infections should be considered as an important non-classical risk factor to enable early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Here, we summarized the currently available evidence regarding the role of inflammation in ASCVD and the association between the particular infections and pathogens (Helicobacter pylori, periodontal disease, pneumonia, Cytomegalovirus, Human immunodeficiency virus, Herpes simplex virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) on the development and progression of ASCVD. We also speculated about the potential therapeutic implications of the anti-inflammatory and anti-infective drugs on ASCVD outcomes, including drugs routinely administered in patients with ASCVD (statins, P2Y12 receptor inhibitors, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers) and novel strategies aiming at residual risk reduction (colchicine, anti-cytokine drugs, and methotrexate). Considering the emerging association between infections and ASCVD, it is crucial to determine the possible advantages of infection prevention and treatment in patients with ASCVD.","Szwed, Piotr Gąsecka Aleksandra Zawadka Mateusz Eyileten Ceren Postuła Marek Mazurek Tomasz Szarpak Łukasz Filipiak Krzysztof J.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,300,1

While most developed countries count on supporting healthcare and social systems, developing countries face additional challenges due to low macro indicators. The implementation of measurements such as quarantine are shown to be successful to flatten the curve of infection and death. In this context, it is important to test whether those measurements have an impact on the distribution of cases of COVID-19 in developing countries that face additional challenges such as lack of social security due to informal employment. A country comparison for Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Chile has therefore been conducted. Method: The healthcare systems and macro indicator as well as the distribution of death due to COVID-19 per thousand inhabitants are compared descriptively. Using Multiple Interrupted Time Series Analysis with synthetic control units the impact of the General Mandatory Quarantine in Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador as well as the impact of Mask Obligation in public in Colombia and Chile have been tested. Results: No clear impact of the poverty headcount ratio at the national poverty line and urban population on the percentage of death within the confirmed cases has been found. The out-of-pocked spending within health expenditure as a barrier in access to healthcare can be considered as a determinant of death within the confirmed cases of COVID-19. The implementation of a general mandatory quarantine did not show a curve-flattening effect in Ecuador and Peru but did so in Colombia. The implementation of Mask obligation in public spaced showed positive impact on the distribution of confirmed case in both countries tested. Conclusion: The implementation of a general mandatory quarantine does not guarantee the curve-flattening effect. Various macro indicators should therefore always be considered while analyzing the effect of policies.","Poppe, Adriana",Front Public Health,300,21

A safe, effective vaccine is urgently needed to halt this pandemic. In this study, immunogenicity of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein was examined in mice. Animals were immunized with recombinant RBD antigen intraperitoneally using three different adjuvants (Zn-chitosan, Alhydrogel, and Adju-Phos), and antibody responses were followed for over 5 months. Results showed that potent neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) can be induced with 70% neutralization titer (NT70) of ~14,580 against live, infectious viruses. Although antigen-binding antibody titers decreased gradually over time, sufficiently protective levels of nAbs persisted (NT80 >2,430) over the 5-month observation period. Results also showed that adjuvants have profound effects on kinetics of nAb induction, total antibody titers, antibody avidity, antibody longevity, and B-cell epitopes targeted by the immune system. In conclusion, a recombinant subunit protein immunogen based on the RBD is a highly promising vaccine candidate.

In response to the global need for effective sterilization techniques, this study evaluated the virucidal efficacy of FATHHOME's self-contained, ozone-based dry-sanitizing device, by dose and time response assessment. We tested inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, a close genetic model of SARS-CoV-2, on porous (N95 filtering facepiece respirator/FFR) and nonporous (glass) surfaces. We started our assays with 20 ppm-10 min ozone exposure, and effectively reduced 99.8% and 99.9% of virus from glass and N95 FFR surfaces, respectively. Importantly, the virus was completely inactivated, below the detection limit (over 6-log10 reduction) with 25 ppm-15 min ozone exposure on both tested surfaces. As expected, a higher ozone exposure (50 ppm-10 min) resulted in faster inactivation of HCoV-OC43 with 100% inactivation from both the surfaces, with no residual ozone present after completion of the 5-min post exposure recapture cycle and no measurable increase in ambient ozone levels. These results confirmed that FATHHOME's device is suitable for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2- from worn items, frequently touched items, and PPE including N95 FFRs, face shields, and other personal items.","Uppal, Timsy; Khazaieli, Amir; Snijders, Antoine M; Verma, Subhash C",,300,1

Loss of smell and taste occurring in COVID-19 cases are now recognized by the international scientific community as being among the main symptoms of the disease. This study investigates loss of smell and taste in outpatients and hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Enrolled in the study were patients with a positive PCR test for COVID-19. Excluded were patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, common cold, influenza, and olfactory/gustatory dysfunction predating the pandemic. Patients were asked about changes in their sense of smell and taste by structured questionnaire. Their status was classified according to severity of the symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were included in the study, of whom 129 received outpatient treatment, whereas 88 were hospitalized; mean age was 41.74 years (range18-76), 59.4% were male. At evaluation for olfactory dysfunction, 53.9% of the patients were found to be normal, whereas 33.2% were anosmic. No gustatory dysfunction was found in 49.8% of patients, whereas in those with loss of taste, the most commonly recorded symptom was ageusia. Anosmia was significantly more common in outpatients (P = 0.038). Presentation of chemosensorial symptoms in women was higher than in men (Pâ=â0.009). No correlation was found between olfactory and gustatory dysfunction and age (Pâ=â0.178). CONCLUSIONS: About one-half of our patients presented olfactory and/or gustatory deficits, and loss of smell was more common in mild cases. It should be considered; a sudden, severe, and isolated loss of smell and/or taste may also be present in COVID-19 patients who are otherwise asymptomatic. We suggest that identification of persons with these signs and early isolation could prevent spread of the disease in the community.","Polat, Burcu; Yilmaz, Nesrin Helvaci; Altin, Gökhan; Atakcan, Zeynep; Mert, Ali",J. craniofac. surg,300,7

Egyptian poultry industry suffered from severe economic losses since the isolation of Velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) genotype VIId in 2011 and up till now despite the use of different vaccination programs. So, this study aimed to isolate and characterize the vNDV from a total of 120 poultry flocks from ten provinces in the Egyptian Delta region with a history of respiratory manifestation, high mortalities or a decrease in egg production between 2015 and 2019. Seventy-three samples' allantoic fluid (73/120, 60.8%) were positive for hemagglutination with chicken RBCs. These samples were submitted to molecular examination using qRT-PCR specific primers for AOAV-1, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI-H5), low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI-H9) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). RESULTS: Fifty samples (50/120: 41.6%) were confirmed positive for AOAV-1, based on genetic analysis of matrix and fusion protein. The co-infection rate of other respiratory viral diseases examined was 1.6, 14.1, and 4.1%, for HPAI-H5, LPAI-H9, and IBV, respectively. Biologically, the intracerebral pathogenicity index of ten selected AOAV-1 isolates ranged from 1.70 to 1.98, which indicated the velogenic nature of these isolates. All the sixteen sequenced isolates were AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1. The full F gene sequence of six examined AOAV-1 VII.1.1 isolates contained the seven neutralizing epitopes, and the glycosylation motif of six-potential sites for N linked glycosylation at residues 85, 191, 366, 447, 471, and 541. CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that the high prevalence of AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1 in the Egyptian chicken flocks despite the intensive vaccination with live and killed ND vaccines, as all the 16 isolates tested were belonged to this genotype. Homologous vaccination is badly needed to control and reduce the spread of AOAV-1 genotype VII.1.1infection in Egyptian poultry flocks.","Abd El-Hamid, Hatem S; Shafi, Manal E; Albaqami, Najah M; Ellakany, Hany F; Abdelaziz, Naglaa M; Abdelaziz, Mohamed N; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E; Taha, Ayman E; Alanazi, Khalid M; Elbestawy, Ahmed R",BMC Vet Res,300,24

METHODS: The extended unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT2) was enhanced with a new health-related framework: behavior intention to recommend and new mediation effects. We applied partial least squares (PLS) causal modeling to test the research model. RESULTS: We obtained 322 valid responses through an online questionnaire. The drivers of behavior intention with statistical significance were performance expectancy (ß=.29, P<.001), habit (ß=.39, P<.001), and personal empowerment (ß=.18, P=.01). The precursors of use behavior were habit (ß= .47, P<.001) and personal empowerment (ß=.17, P=.01). Behavior intention to recommend was significantly influenced by behavior intention (ß=.58, P<.001) and personal empowerment (ß=.26, P<.001). The model explained 66% of the total variance in behavior intention, 54% of the variance in use behavior, and 70% of the variance in behavior intention to recommend. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a significant role of personal empowerment, as a second-order construct, in the mHealth acceptance context. The presence of a chronic health condition predicates an impact on acceptance of this technology.","Salgado, Tânia; Tavares, Jorge; Oliveira, Tiago",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,300,16

Knowing the distribution of symptoms across diseases and individuals can support clinical actions on timelines shorter than those for drug and vaccine development. Here, we focus on zinc deficiency symptoms, symptom overlap with other conditions, as well as zinc effects on immune health and mechanistic zinc deficiency risk groups. There are well-studied beneficial effects of zinc on the immune system including a decreased susceptibility to and improved clinical outcomes for infectious pathogens including multiple viruses. Zinc is also an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress agent, relevant to some severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms. Unfortunately, zinc deficiency is common worldwide and not exclusive to the developing world. Lifestyle choices and preexisting conditions alone can result in zinc deficiency, and we compile zinc risk groups based on a review of the literature. It is also important to distinguish chronic zinc deficiency from deficiency acquired upon viral infection and immune response and their different supplementation strategies. Zinc is being considered as prophylactic or adjunct therapy for COVID-19, with 12 clinical trials underway, highlighting the relevance of this trace element for global pandemics. Using the example of zinc, we show that there is a critical need for a deeper understanding of essential trace elements in human health, and the resulting deficiency symptoms and their overlap with other conditions. This knowledge will directly support human immune health for decreasing susceptibility, shortening illness duration, and preventing progression to severe cases in the current and future pandemics.","Joachimiak, Marcin P",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,300,1

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is extremely computationally intensive for these situations, but the parametric assumptions required for efficient variational inference (VI) result in incorrect inference when they encounter the multi-modal posterior distributions that are common for such models. SVGD provides a non-parametric alternative to variational inference which is substantially faster than MCMC but unhindered by parametric assumptions. We prove that for GP models with Lipschitz gradients the SVGD algorithm monotonically decreases the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the sampling distribution to the true posterior. Our method is demonstrated on benchmark problems in both regression and classification, and a real air quality example with 11440 spatiotemporal observations, showing substantial performance improvements over MCMC and VI.","Pinder, Thomas; Nemeth, Christopher; Leslie, David",,300,1

This cross-reactivity prompts questions about their protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 disease severity. However, the relationship between sCoV exposure and SARS-CoV-2 correlates of protection have not been clearly identified. Here we performed a cross-sectional analysis of cross-reactivity and cross-neutralization to three SARS-CoV-2 antigens using pre-pandemic serum from four different groups: pediatrics and adolescents (<21 yrs of age), persons 21 to 70 yrs of age, persons older than 70 yrs of age, and persons living with HCV or HIV. We find that antibody cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 antigens varied between 1.6% and 15.3% depending on the cohort and the isotype-antigen pair analyzed. We also demonstrate a broad range of neutralizing activity (0-45%) in pre-pandemic serum that interferes with SARS-CoV-2 spike attachment to ACE2. While the abundance of sCoV antibodies did not directly correlate with neutralization efficiency, by using machine learning methodologies, we show that neutralizing activity is rather dependent on the latent variables related to the pattern ratios of sCoVs antibodies presented by each person. These were independent of age or sex, and could be accurately predicted by comparing the relative ratios of IgGs in sera directed to NL63, 229E, HKU-1, and OC43 spike proteins. More specifically, we identified antibodies to NL63 and OC43 as being the two most important predictors of latent variables responsible for protection, and 229E as being the least weighted. Our data support that exposure to sCoVs triggers various cellular and immune responses that influence the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to ACE2, and may impact COVID-19 disease severity through various other latent variables.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of a Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and research institute in an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with chronic (&#8805; 1 year from injury) SCI and uninjured individuals. OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum antibody titers were determined by commercial multiplex ELISA. RESULTS: Blood samples were collected from individuals with chronic SCI (N = 29, 83% males) and uninjured individuals (N = 25, 64% males). Among participants with SCI, the distribution of American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grades was: A (n = 15), B (n = 2), C (n = 4), D (n = 8). Neurological levels of injury were: cervical (n = 17), thoracic (n = 10), and lumbar (n = 2). IgA levels were significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 1.98 vs. 1.21 mg/ml, P < 0.0001), with levels most elevated in individuals with motor complete injuries compared to uninjured participants (P < 0.0003). IgG2 antibodies were also significantly elevated in participants with SCI compared to uninjured participants (median: 5.98 vs. 4.37 mg/ml, P < 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of elevated IgA, the antibody type most prevalent at respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts, common sites of infections in individuals with SCI. IgG2 levels were also elevated in individuals with SCI. These data support further investigations of IgA and other antibody types in individuals with chronic SCI, which may be increasingly important in the context of emerging novel infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.","Shnawa, Aya; Lee, Samuel; Papatheodorou, Angelos; Gibbs, Katie; Stein, Adam; Morrison, Debra; Bloom, Ona",J Spinal Cord Med,300,16

CBT-I is the guideline-recommended, first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, but availability of CBT-I therapists is limited. Somryst addresses this need by providing asynchronous access to CBT-I treatment. As a contactless therapeutic medium, Somryst is also an ideal option when face-to-face therapy is not available or recommended for safety reasons (e.g., because of possible exposure to pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus). Areas covered: PDTs are the first class of software-based medical devices FDA-cleared and available via mobile applications. This review summarizes the mechanisms of action and technical features of Somryst, and describes safety and effectiveness data from the randomized trials on which FDA clearance was based. Expert opinion: Somryst demonstrates robust clinical efficacy with a favorable benefit-to-risk profile for treating adults with chronic insomnia. FDA clearance was based on data from 2 clinical trials of the first-generation web-based CBT-I platform Sleep Healthy Using the Internet (SHUTi).

To review and discuss recent literature on the specific nature of COVID-19 in children and adolescents compared to the adult population. Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is a threat to the health and well-being of all people around the world. A significant proportion of adults require hospitalization, some developing severe life-threatening complications. However, although children can carry and transmit the virus, they typically do not develop severe disease, and the incidence is lower compared to adults. Design. An integrative literature review, prepared using the PRISMA-ScR reporting checklist. Methods. Using Arksey and O'Malley's framework, relevant databases were searched for articles published in English since the pandemic onset in March 2020 through August 2020. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and selected articles were thematically analyzed. Results. Four themes were identified and discussed relating to the potential care implications for children and adolescents: 1) the differing immune system in children, 2) the presentation of COVID-19 in children and adolescents, 3) vascular disease as a response to COVID-19, and 4) global policy changes relevant to COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Conclusion. The incidence, severity, and presentation of COVID-19 in young children differs to that of adults. Less is known about the disease pattern in adolescence. A new condition named as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has emerged, about which we are still learning globally. Although perhaps not affected severely, children may still be vulnerable to the secondary consequences of policy changes (e.g., school closures, social distancing). Relevance to clinical practice. It is vital to address the significant global issues and contribute a pediatric and adolescent nursing perspective to the rapidly emerging body of evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge and understanding of the disease impact in children and adolescents are essential to offering optimum support and care to this patient group.","Green, Janet Petty Julia Staff Lynette Bromley Patricia Orr Fiona Brown Nicola Smart Larissa Walker Karen Jones Linda",Pediatric Nursing,300,20

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of corticosteroids in non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF). METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study, from 16th March, 2020 to 30th April, 2020; final follow-up on 10th May, 2020. 265 patients consecutively admitted to the non-ICU wards with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were screened for inclusion. 205 patients who developed AHRF (SpO2/FiO2 &#8804; 440 or PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300) were only included in the final study. Direct admission to the Intensive care unit (ICU), patients developing composite primary outcome within 24 hours of admission, and patients who never became hypoxic during their stay in the hospital were excluded. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on corticosteroid. The primary outcome was a composite of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU transfer, intubation, in-hospital mortality, discharge, length of stay, and daily trend of SpO2/FiO2 (SF) ratio from the index date. Cox-proportional hazard regression was implemented to analyze the time to event outcomes. RESULT: Among 205 patients, 60 (29.27%) were treated with corticosteroid. The mean age was ~57 years, and ~75% were men. Thirteen patients (22.41%) developed a primary composite outcome in the corticosteroid cohort vs. 54 (37.5%) patients in the non-corticosteroid cohort (P = 0.039). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for the development of the composite primary outcome was 0.15 (95% CI, 0.07-0.33; P <0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio for ICU transfer was 0.16 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.34; P < 0.001), intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.70; P- 0.005), death was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.22 to 1.31; P- 0.172), composite of death or intubation was 0.31 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.66; P- 0.002) and discharge was 3.65 (95% CI, 2.20 to 6.06; P<0.001). The corticosteroid cohort had increasing SpO2/FiO2 over time compared to the non-corticosteroid cohort who experience decreasing SpO2/FiO2 over time. CONCLUSION: Among non-ICU patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by AHRF, treatment with corticosteroid was associated with a significantly lower risk of the primary composite outcome of ICU transfer, intubation, or in-hospital death, composite of intubation or death and individual components of the primary outcome.","Majmundar, Monil; Kansara, Tikal; Lenik, Joanna Marta; Park, Hansang; Ghosh, Kuldeep; Doshi, Rajkumar; Shah, Palak; Kumar, Ashish; Amin, Hossam; Chaudhari, Shobhana; Habtes, Imnett",PLoS One,300,16

METHODS: The study included five male patients who presented with the sole complaint of unilateral SSNHL to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic between 03-12 April 2020. The patients were referred to the infectious diseases clinic to be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in one of the patients and negative in the other four patients. A positive response to COVID-19-specific treatment in the SARS-CoV-2 positive SSNHL patient was noted. CONCLUSION: It should be remembered that non-specific symptoms such as SSNHL could be the only sign with which to recognize a COVID-19 case. Awareness of such a non-specific presentation of COVID-19 patients is crucial during this pandemic period for preventing infectious spread through isolation and early initiation of COVID-19 targeted treatment.,"Kilic, Osman; Kalcioglu, Mahmut Tayyar; Cag, Yasemin; Tuysuz, Ozan; Pektas, Emel; Caskurlu, Hulya; Cetin, Ferihan",Int J Infect Dis,300,29

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered an opportunity to assess how well equipped the UK is to leverage health information technology and apply the principles of a national learning health and care system in response to a major public health shock. With the experience acquired during the pandemic, each country within the UK should now re-evaluate their digital health and care strategies. After leaving the EU, UK countries now need to decide to what extent they wish to engage with European efforts to promote interoperability between electronic health records. Major priorities for strengthening health information technology in the UK include achieving the optimal balance between top-down and bottom-up implementation, improving usability and interoperability, developing capacity for handling, processing, and analysing data, addressing privacy and security concerns, and encouraging digital inclusivity. Current and future opportunities include integrating electronic health records across health and care providers, investing in health data science research, generating real-world data, developing artificial intelligence and robotics, and facilitating public-private partnerships. Many ethical challenges and unintended consequences of implementation of health information technology exist. To address these, there is a need to develop regulatory frameworks for the development, management, and procurement of artificial intelligence and health information technology systems, create public-private partnerships, and ethically and safely apply artificial intelligence in the National Health Service.","Sheikh, Aziz; Anderson, Michael; Albala, Sarah; Casadei, Barbara; Franklin, Bryony Dean; Richards, Mike; Taylor, David; Tibble, Holly; Mossialos, Elias",Lancet Digit Health,300,20

They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Four cases in which BCoV was detected, grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick, fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane.

It is argued that competition between organs for limited resources is an important mesoscale morphogenetic mechanism that produces fitness-enhancing correlated growth. At the genetic level, the growth of individual characters appears independent, or ""modular,"" because patterns of expression and transcription are often highly localized, mutations have trait-specific effects, and gene complexes can be co-opted as a unit to produce novel traits. However, body parts are known to interact over the course of ontogeny, and these reciprocal exchanges can be an important determinant of developmental outcomes. Genetic mechanisms underlie cell and tissue behaviors that allow organs to communicate with one another, but they also create evolutionarily adaptive competitive dynamics that are driven by physiological and biophysical processes. Advances in the understanding of competitive and closely related coordinative interactions across scales will complement existing research programs that emphasize the role of cellular mechanisms in morphogenesis. Study of the large-scale order produced by competitive dynamics promises to facilitate advances in basic evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as applied research in fields such as bioengineering and regenerative medicine that aim to regulate patterning outcomes.","Gawne, Richard; McKenna, Kenneth Z; Levin, Michael",Bioessays,300,29

It was hypothesized that lockdown would be associated with increased sleep duration. METHODS: Outcomes were changes in bedtime, wake time, and sleep duration in the pandemic compared to before. Logistic regression was applied to evaluate the effects of age and covariates on outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 845 questionnaires completed from May 1 to June 10, 2020 were analyzed (45.8% female; age 3-17 years). During the pandemic, 23.1% of preschoolers, 46.2% of school-age children, and 89.8% of adolescents were going to bed after 10 p.m. on weekdays compared to 7.1%, 9.4%, and 57.1% respectively before the pandemic, with these proportions being higher on weekends. Likewise, 42.5% of preschoolers, 61.3% of school-age children, and 81.2% of adolescents were waking after 8 a.m. on weekdays (11.6%, 4.9%, and 10.3%, before) with these proportions being greater on weekends. Sleep duration did not change in 43% of participants on weekdays and in 46.2% on weekends. The 14-17 years group had fourfold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekdays (p < .01), and children aged 6-13 years had twofold increased odds for longer sleep duration on weekends relative to the 3-5 years age group (p = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Although lockdown was associated with later bedtime and wake time, this shift did not alter sleep duration in more than 40% of children. Yet, compared to preschoolers, high school-aged children were more likely to sleep more on weekdays and primary school children on weekends.","Kaditis, Athanasios G; Ohler, Adrienne; Gileles-Hillel, Alex; Choshen-Hillel, Shoham; Gozal, David; Bruni, Oliviero; Aydinoz, Secil; Cortese, Rene; Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila",Pediatr. pulmonol,300,30

We study the impact on the final match of an increase in the number of interviews for one side of the market. Our motivation is the match between residents and hospitals where, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interviews for the 2020-21 season of the National Residency Matching Program were switched to a virtual format. This drastically reduced the cost to applicants of accepting interview invitations. However, the reduction in cost was not symmetric since applicants, not programs, previously bore most of the costs of in-person interviews. We show that, starting from a situation where the final matching is stable, if doctors can accept more interviews, but the hospitals do not increase the number of interviews they offer, then no doctor is better off and many doctors are potentially harmed. This adverse consequence is the result of what we call interview hoarding. We prove this analytically and characterize optimal mitigation strategies for special cases. We use simulations to extend these insights to more general settings.","Manjunath, Vikram; Morrill, Thayer",,300,23

The disease severity is mediated by cell death and inflammation, which regulate both the antiviral and the pathological innate immune responses. ZBP1, an interferon-induced cytosolic nucleic acid sensor, facilitates antiviral responses via RIPK3. Although ZBP1-mediated cell death is widely described, whether and how it promotes inflammatory signaling is unclear. Here, we report a ZBP1-induced inflammatory signaling pathway that depends on ubiquitination and RIPK3s scaffolding ability independently of cell death. In human cells, ZBP1 associates with RIPK1 and RIPK3 as well as ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and LUBAC. RIPK1 and ZBP1 are ubiquitinated to promote TAK1- and IKK-mediated inflammatory signaling. Additionally, RIPK1 recruits the p43/41-caspase-8-p43-FLIP heterodimer to suppress RIPK3 kinase activity, which otherwise promotes inflammatory signaling in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Lastly, we show that ZBP1 contributes to SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine production. Taken together, we describe a ZBP1-RIPK1-RIPK3-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway relayed by the scaffolding role of RIPKs and regulated by caspase-8. Our results suggest the ZBP1 pathway contributes to inflammation in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Peng, Ruoshi; Wang-Kan, Xuan; Idorn, Manja; Zhou, Felix Y; Orozco, Susana L; McCarthy, Julia; Leung, Carol S; Lu, Xin; Bagola, Katrin; Rehwinkel, Jan; Oberst, Andrew; Maelfait, Jonathan; Paludan, Soren R.; Gyrd-Hansen, Mads",,300,16

For both the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 and the climate change movement that dominated international media in 2019, psychological parallels exist in terms of our experience of loss. As the world grapples with the pandemic and tourism grinds to a halt, stories on social media are surfacing that claim wildlife is returning to quarantined cities and that the Earth is healing itself. Much of the implicit critique of these stories is directed at the tourism industry, with two viral posts in particular supposedly documenting the ‘rewilding’ of Venice, that infamous icon of overtourism. While the popular media have been concerned primarily with the factual accuracy of these claims, what has gone largely unexplored is the apparent desire for environmental reparation that they express. The fixation on environmental healing evidenced in tourist social media can be interpreted as a response to widely-felt ‘ecological grief’, triggered by the events of COVID-19. In this context, animal reclamation of urban spaces can be identified as a motif of environmental hope that symbolises life, regeneration and resilience, the understanding of which may contribute to the project of hopeful tourism in the post-COVID-19 era.","Crossley, Émilie",Tour.

Powder blends were characterized in terms of homogeneity, flow properties, sprayability, in vitro biocompatibility, permeability and mucoadhesion. Nasal deposition studies were performed using 3D printed nasal cavity model. Mannitol provided better powder blend flow properties compared to lactose. Microspheres blended with mannitol retained or enlarged their mucoadhesive properties and enhanced DSP permeability across epithelial model barrier. DSP dose fraction deposited in the olfactory region reached 17.0% revealing the potential of developed powder platform for targeted olfactory delivery.

In one process, the DNA fragment is turned into an extrachromosomal circular DNA, cut somewhere in the circle, and reintegrated into another location in the genome. And in the other, the DNA fragment forms a ""lariat structure"" with a ""knot"", the strand is swapped at the knot, and is then reintegrated into the genome.

To this end, disposable face mask (a piece of personal protective equipment) was pyrolyzed to produce fuel-range chemicals. The pyrolytic gas evolved from the pyrolysis of the single-use face mask consisted primarily of non-condensable permanent hydrocarbons such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. An increase in pyrolysis temperature enhanced the non-condensable hydrocarbon yields. The pyrolytic gas had a HHV of &gt;40 MJ kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, hydrocarbons with wider carbon number ranges (e.g., gasoline-, jet fuel-, diesel-, and motor oil-range hydrocarbons) were produced in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The yields of the gasoline-, jet fuel-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons obtained from the single-use mask were highest at 973 K. The pyrolysis of the single-use face mask yielded 14.7 wt% gasoline-, 18.4 wt% jet fuel-, 34.1 wt% diesel-, and 18.1 wt% motor oil-range hydrocarbons. No solid char was produced via the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The addition of food waste to the pyrolysis feedstock led to the formation of char, but the presence of the single-use face mask did not affect the properties and energy content of the char. More H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and less hydrocarbons were produced by co-feeding food waste in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The results of this study can contribute to thermochemical management and utilization of everyday waste as a source of energy.","Park, C.; Choi, H.; Andrew Lin, K. Y.; Kwon, E.

The general objective of the study is to evaluate the early impact of the Covid-19 emergency and quarantine on the well-being and work practices of mental health service personnel and professionals. Data were collected through an online survey of workers and professionals working with people with mental health problems in Lombardy in several outpatient and inpatient services. Their socio-demographic characteristics, professional background, description of working conditions during lockdown and psychological distress levels were collected. All analyses were performed on a sample of 241. Approximately, 31% of the participants obtained a severe score in at least one of the burnout dimensions, 11.6% showed moderate or severe levels of anxiety, and 6.6% had a moderate or severe level of depression. Different work conditions and patterns of distress were found for outpatient service workers and inpatient service workers. The overall impact of the Covid-19 emergency on mental health workers' level of distress was mild, although a significant number of workers experienced severe levels of depersonalization and anxiety. More research is needed to assess specific predictive factors.","Rapisarda, Filippo; Vallarino, Martine; Cavallini, Elena; Barbato, Angelo; Brousseau-Paradis, Camille; De Benedictis, Luigi; Lesage, Alain",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,4

Liver damage in COVID-19 patients can be caused by the direct cytopathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, an uncontrolled immune response, sepsis, severe hypoxia, or drug damage. In addition, COVID-19 can exacerbate and decompensate previously formed chronic liver diseases with the development of acute liver failure. Physicians should carefully assess the initial state of the liver, and after prescribing therapy, intensify monitoring of its functional state, especially in patients with severe COVID-19. In each clinical case, the doctor needs to establish the possible mechanisms of organ damage in order to select the most optimal patient management tactics, which would take into account all aspects of the COVID-19 course and liver damage. Currently, additional scientific information is required to uncover the features of liver damage during SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the postcovid period.

We assessed the effectiveness of therapeutics in cohorts in Hong Kong SAR and Anhui, China. Methods: We conducted propensity-score analysis of 4771 symptomatic patients from Hong Kong between 21st January and 6th December 2020, and 648 symptomatic patients from Anhui between 1st January and 27th February 2020. We censored all observations as at 13st December 2020.

Findings: Interferon-beta-1b was associated with an improved composite outcome (OR=0.55, 95%CI 0.38, 0.80) and earlier discharge (-8.8 days, 95%CI -9.7, -7.9) compared to those not administered interferon-beta-1b. Oral ribavirin initiated within 7 days from onset was associated with lower risk of the composite outcome in Hong Kong (OR=0.51, 95%CI 0.29, 0.90). Lopinavir-ritonavir, intravenous ribavirin, umifenovir, corticosteroids, interferon-alpha-2b, antibiotics or Chinese medicines failed to show consistent clinical benefit.

SAMPLE: 550 respondent veterinarian members of the Veterinary Information Network (VIN). PROCEDURES: An anonymous online survey was used to gather data from VIN-member veterinarians in small animal general practice regarding their perceptions and use of synchronous video-based telemedicine. Two emails to all VIN members were used to distribute the web-based questionnaire. For consistency, only responses from North American veterinarians who reported working in small animal general practice were included in analyses. Responses were collected between September 28, 2020, and October 21, 2020. RESULTS: There were 69,488 recipients and 680 respondents (1.0% response rate), 550 of whom had North American internet protocol addresses and reported working in small animal general practice. Not all respondents answered all questions. Use of video-based telemedicine substantially increased among respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most (86/130 [66.2%]) reported little to no difficulty in adopting videoconferencing. Respondents also reported that telemedicine took less time (61/135 [45.2%]) and resulted in less financial compensation (103/135 [76.3%]) than in-person consultation. Several respondents reported concerns regarding legal issues and potential inferiorities of telemedicine. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results indicated that a substantial proportion of respondents incorporated synchronous video-based telemedicine into their practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite low perceived difficulty in adopting videoconferencing telemedicine, many planned to discontinue it for some clinical applications once the pandemic is over. Further research is required to elucidate the perceptions and challenges in successful use of veterinary telemedicine.","Bishop, Greg T; Rishniw, Mark; Kogan, Lori R",J Am Vet Med Assoc,300,24

In South Africa (SA), 62 300 adults die annually from alcohol-attributable causes. Alcohol-related harm can be reduced by interventions, such as taxation, government monopolising retail sales, outlet density restriction, hours of sales and an advertising ban. To mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, SA instituted a lockdown that also prohibited alcohol sales. This led to a sharp reduction in unnatural deaths in the country from 800-1000/week to around 400/week during the lockdown. We reviewed three 2-week periods at a large rural regional hospital: Before Covid-19 (February), during social distancing (March) and during lockdown with alcohol ban (April).

As healthcare professionals, we need to advocate for the ban to remain until the crisis is over to ensure that health services can concentrate on Covid-19 and other patients. We encourage other African states to follow suit and implement alcohol restrictions as a mechanism to free up health services.

Although previous studies have showed that NH3 caused kidney injury, the molecular mechanisms of nephrotoxicity induced by NH3 remain unclear. To explore the mechanisms of NH3 nephrotoxicity, a total of 36 broiler chicks at one day of age were exposed to NH3. After 42 days of exposure, blood samples were collected to determine creatinine and uric acid; and kidney samples were weighted and then collected to detect ultrastructural changes, oxidative stress parameters, ATPases, necroptosis- and mitochondrial dynamics-related genes. The results showed that chickens exposed to NH3 showed lower relative kidney weight and an increase concentration in serum creatinine and uric acid. NH3 exposure caused nephrocyte necrosis and increased the expression of necroptosis-related genes (TNF-&#945;, RIPK1, RIPK3, MLKL, and JNK). Besides, the activities of antioxidant systems (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, and T-AOC) were reduced, whereas the concentrations of H2O2 and MDA were elevated. Lower activities of ATPases were obtained in NH3 treatment groups. Furthermore, the mitochondrial fission-related genes drp1 and mff were activated, and mitochondrial fusion-related genes opa1, mfn1 and mfn2 were suppressed after NH3 exposure. Based on the above results, we conclude that NH3 caused-oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction mediated nephrocyte necroptosis in chickens.

Their modes of antiviral activities include direct interaction with targeted viruses, production of antiviral metabolites, and immunomodulatory effects on the host. Hence, probiotics can be a useful prophylactic against COVID-19, and more studies are required on the effects of probiotics against other viral infections that may occur in future.","Lee, Na-Kyoung; Paik, Hyun-Dong",Food Sci Biotechnol,300,27

Given the sharp rise in online misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, it is important to understand the factors that influence the development of false memories. The present study measured susceptibility to false memories following exposure to fabricated news stories about the pandemic in a sample of 3746 participants. We investigated the effect of individual differences in (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) engagement with media or discussion about the coronavirus, (3) anxiety about COVID-19 and (4) analytical reasoning. Notably, objectively and subjectively assessed knowledge about COVID-19 were not significantly correlated. Objectively assessed knowledge was associated with fewer false memories but more true memories, suggesting a true discrimination between true and fake news. In contrast, participants who merely believed themselves to be very knowledgeable were more likely to report a memory for true stories, but showed no reduction in false memories. Similarly, individuals who reported high levels of media engagement or anxiety about COVID-19 reported an increase in true (but not false) memories. Finally, higher levels of analytical reasoning were associated with fewer memories for both true and fabricated stories, suggesting a stricter threshold for reporting a memory for any story. These data indicate that false memories can form in response to fake COVID-19 news and that susceptibility to this misinformation is affected by the individual's knowledge about and interaction with COVID-19 information, as well as their tendency to think critically.","Greene, Ciara M; Murphy, Gillian",Cogn Res Princ Implic,300,13

The traditional method to detect COVID-19 is a PCR test, but it takes about 4-5 hours to get the results. Secondly, in some cases, the false-negative ratio is high in PCR kits. As an alternative method, radiology images, like CT-scan and chest X-rays, can be used for COVID-19 diagnosis.

However, it is now apparent that a small percentage of children can develop a hyperinflammatory syndrome labeled as Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome-temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) with a phenotype resembling Kawasaki disease (KD) ('Kawa-COVID-19'). Features of this newly recognized condition may include fever, hypotension, severe abdominal pain and cardiac dysfunction, evidence of inflammation, and single or multi organ dysfunction in the absence of other known infections. Children emerge to have mild symptoms compared to adults, perhaps due to reduced expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor (the target of SARS-CoV-2) gene, trained innate immunity, and a young and fit immune system. Some of these children may share features of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or cytokine storm syndrome. They can deteriorate rapidly and may need intensive care support as well. The PCR test is more often negative although most of the children have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Although the pathogenesis is not clearly known, immune-mediated injury has been implicated.","Basu, Manjari; Das, Subir Kumar",Indian J Clin Biochem,300,1

Nasal-swab samples are an attractive alternative; however, previous studies have disagreed over how nasal sampling performs relative to NP sampling. Here, we compared nasal vs. NP specimens collected by healthcare workers in a cohort of individuals clinically suspected of COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive outpatients undergoing follow-up. We compared subjects being seen for initial evaluation vs. follow-up, two different nasal-swab collection protocols, and three different transport conditions, including traditional viral transport media (VTM) and dry swabs, on 307 total study participants. We compared categorical results and viral loads to those from standard NP swabs collected at the same time from the same patients. All testing was performed by RT-PCR on the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 RealTime EUA (limit of detection [LoD], 100 copies viral genomic RNA/mL transport medium). We found low concordance overall, with Cohen's kappa of 0.49, with high concordance only for subjects with very high viral loads. We found medium concordance for testing at initial presentation (&#954;=0.68), and very low concordance for followup testing (&#954;=0.27). Finally, we show that previous reports of high concordance may have resulted from measurement using assays with sensitivity &#8805;1,000 copies/mL. These findings suggest nasal-swab testing be used for situations in which viral load is expected to be high, as we demonstrate that nasal-swab testing is likely to miss patients with low viral loads.","Callahan, Cody; Lee, Rose A; Lee, Ghee Rye; Zulauf, Kate; Kirby, James E; Arnaout, Ramy",J Clin Microbiol,300,30

In contrast, video conferencing software such as Zoom uses custom congestion control algorithms whose fairness behavior is mostly unknown. Aggravatingly, video conferencing has recently seen a drastic increase in use – partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic – and could hence negatively affect how available Internet resources are shared. In this paper, we thus investigate the flow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of Zoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to bandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in low-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware congestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these queuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing. However, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how delay and loss affect Zoom’s QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the appendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be studied further. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sander, C.; Kunze, I.; Wehrle, K.; Rüth, J.","22nd International Conference on Passive and Active Measurement, PAM 2021",300,26

High impacts of COVID-19 are apparent in some countries with large tropical peatland areas, some of which are relatively poorly resourced to tackle disease pandemics. Despite this, no previous investigation has considered tropical peatlands in the context of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Here, we review: (i) the potential for future EIDs arising from tropical peatlands; (ii) potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from COVID-19; and (iii) potential steps to help mitigate these risks. We find that high biodiversity in tropical peat-swamp forests, including presence of many potential vertebrate and invertebrate vectors, combined, in places, with high levels of habitat disruption and wildlife harvesting represent suitable conditions for potential zoonotic EID (re-)emergence. Although impossible to predict precisely, we identify numerous potential threats to tropical peatland conservation and local communities from the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes impacts on public health, with the potential for haze pollution from peatland fires to increase COVID-19 susceptibility a noted concern; and on local economies, livelihoods and food security, where impacts will likely be greater in remote communities with limited/no medical facilities that depend heavily on external trade. Research, training, education, conservation and restoration activities are also being affected, particularly those involving physical groupings and international travel, some of which may result in increased habitat encroachment, wildlife harvesting or fire, and may therefore precipitate longer-term negative impacts, including those relating to disease pandemics. We conclude that sustainable management of tropical peatlands and their wildlife is important for mitigating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing the potential for future zoonotic EID emergence and severity, thus strengthening arguments for their conservation and restoration. To support this, we list seven specific recommendations relating to sustainable management of tropical peatlands in the context of COVID-19/disease pandemics, plus mitigating the current impacts of COVID-19 and reducing potential future zoonotic EID risk in these localities. Our discussion and many of the issues raised should also be relevant for non-tropical peatland areas and in relation to other (pandemic-related) sudden socio-economic shocks that may occur in future.","Harrison, Mark E; Wijedasa, Lahiru S; Cole, Lydia E S; Cheyne, Susan M; Choiruzzad, Shofwan Al Banna; Chua, Liana; Dargie, Greta C; Ewango, Corneille E N; Honorio Coronado, Euridice N; Ifo, Suspense A; Imron, Muhammad Ali; Kopansky, Dianna; Lestarisa, Trilianty; O039,; Reilly, Patrick J; Van Offelen, Julie; Refisch, Johannes; Roucoux, Katherine; Sugardjito, Jito; Thornton, Sara A; Upton, Caroline; Page, Susan",PeerJ,300,16

We also analyzed the specific drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 ongoing development and formulated the comprehensive treatment regimens based on condition of patients, diseases and drugs as well as concomitant medications. EXPERT OPINION: No drugs and vaccines have been proven to be particularly effective against SARS-CoV-2 up to now. The recommended comprehensive medication therapy strategies have already displayed favorable effect in the fight against COVID-19. Research should be focused on the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and vaccines based on high-quality clinical trial evidence, treatment guidelines and expert consensus.","Yang, Xiaolei; Liu, Ye; Liu, Yuping; Yang, Qing; Wu, Xubo; Huang, Xuan; Liu, Huijia; Cai, Weimin; Ma, Guo",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,300,9

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the key factors that may enhance the adoption of health-protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Morocco and India. A theoretical framework derived from the health belief model (HBM) was used for this research. Data was collected from a sample of 444 adult individuals split across Morocco (n = 215) and India (n = 229). Data analysis was carried out using two-stage multiple-analytic techniques. First, structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to rank the significant independent variables obtained from SEM analysis. The results of SEM showed that perceived benefit is the key predictor of the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by self-efficacy, and then perceived severity. By contrast, ANN analysis showed that perceived severity was the most vital factor for predicting the protective behavior in Morocco, followed by perceived benefits, and then self-efficacy. For the Indian sample, both SEM analysis and the ANN model revealed that the impact of perceived susceptibility on the adoption of the protective measure is stronger than that of cues to action.

Routinary examinations result in datasets with a predominant amount of negative samples. A potential solution to such class-imbalance is joining forces across multiple institutions. Developing a collaborative computer-aided diagnosis system is challenging in different ways. Patient privacy and regulations need to be carefully respected. Data across institutions may be acquired from different devices or imaging protocols, leading to heterogeneous non-IID data. Also, for learning-based methods, new optimization strategies working on distributed data are required. Recently, federated learning has emerged as an effective tool for collaborative learning. In this setting, local models perform computation on their private data to update the global model. The order and the frequency of local updates influence the final global model. Hence, the order in which samples are locally presented to the optimizers plays an important role. In this work, we define a memory-aware curriculum learning method for the federated setting. Our curriculum controls the order of the training samples paying special attention to those that are forgotten after the deployment of the global model. Our approach is combined with unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with domain shift while preserving data privacy. We evaluate our method with three clinical datasets from different vendors. Our results verify the effectiveness of federated adversarial learning for the multi-site breast cancer classification.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the IgG antibody production against S and N antigens of the virus and their correlation with the time and severity of the disease. METHODS: The IgG antibodies against S and N antigens of SARS-CoV-2 in serum specimens 72 symptomatic patients who tested real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positive for SARS-CoV-2 were detected using the ELISA technique. Different antibody response was compared and the correlation with the time from disease onset and the severity was evaluated. RESULTS: Forty-eight of 72 (67%) patients tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while 24 (33%) did not have detectable antibodies. Comparison of antibody levels for N and S antibodies showed that they correlate with each other well (r= 0.81; P< 0.001). However, sensitivity of anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG and anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 30% and 60%, during the first 7 days after symptom onset (r= 0.53; P= 0.111), but increased to 73% and 68% at more than 1-week post symptom onset (r= 0.89, P= 0.111), respectively.

CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third of the confirmed COVID-19 patients had negative serology results. Lower percent positivity at early time points after symptom onset (less than 1 week) was seen using anti-S SARS-COV-2 IgG kit compare to the anti-N SARS-CoV-2 IgG; therefore, clinicians should interpret negative serology results of especially anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG with caution.","Rezaei, Mitra; Sadeghi, Mohammadhadi; Korourian, Alireza; Tabarsi, Payam; Porabdollah, Mihan; Askari, Elham; Mortaz, Esmaeil; Mahmoudi, Shima; Marjani, Majid",Hum. antibodies,300,24

Methods: The pharmacological effects, including expectorant, anti-acute lung injury, anti-inflammatory, anti-pulmonary fibrosis, relieving cough, anti-oxidation, anti-liver injury, anti-kidney injury effects and etc, of both Citri Grandis Exocarpium and its main chemical constituents were analyzed through literature review. The constituents of Citri Grandis Exocarpium were collected by using traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database and literature searching. The molecular docking study was performed to evaluate the binding ability between the chemical constituents and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 3C-like main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLP), and dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) to predict its potential activity in inhibiting the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Results: The literature review indicated that Citri Grandis Exocarpium possesses expectorant, anti-acute lung injury, anti-inflammatory, anti-pulmonary fibrosis, relieving cough, anti-oxidation, anti-liver injury, anti-kidney injury effects, and so on. Molecular docking results indicated that naringin, neohesperdin, rhoifolin, poncirin, and sitogluside were the main active flavonoids due to showing strong interactions with ACE2, MPro, PLP and DC-SIGN with potential activity in inhibiting the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Conclusion: Citri Grandis Exocarpium may probably delay the progression of COVID-19 through a variety of pharmacological activities and the inhibition of the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 due to targeting ACE2, MPro, PLP, and DC-SIGN, reminding that Citri Grandis Exocarpium may possess a potential capacity to protect against COVID-19.","Li, Pei-Bo; Chen, Pan; Wu, Hao; Wang, Yong-Gang; Rao, Hong-Yu; Su, Wei-Wei",Chin.

The aim of this study was to characterize the association between meatpacking plant exposure and clinical outcomes among emergency department (ED) patients with COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting to a single ED, from March 1 to May 31, 2020, who had: 1) symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and 2) a COVID-19 test performed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 positivity, and secondary outcomes included hospital admission from the ED, ventilator use, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, hospital length of stay (LOS; <48 or &#8805;48 h), and mortality. RESULTS: Patients from meatpacking plants were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than the ED patients without this occupational exposure. Patients with a meatpacking plant exposure were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 2.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59 to 3.53) but had similar rates of hospital admission (aRR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.07) and hospital LOS (aRR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.45 to 1.23). There was no significant difference in ventilator use among patients with meatpacking and nonmeatpacking plant exposure (8.2% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.531), ICU admissions (4.1% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.094), and mortality (2.0% vs. 4.1%, p = 0.473). CONCLUSIONS: Workers in meatpacking plants in Iowa had a higher rate of testing positive for COVID-19 but were not more likely to be hospitalized for their illness. These patients were disproportionately Black and Hispanic.","House, Hans R; Vakkalanka, J Priyanka; Behrens, Nathan G; De Haan, Jessica; Halbur, Christopher R; Harrington, Elaine M; Patel, Pooja H; Rawwas, Lulua; Camargo, Carlos A; Kline, Jeffrey A",Acad. emerg. med,300,16

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included cases of confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in a public hospital in South Korea. The worsening oxygenation group was defined as that with SpO2 &#8804;94% or received oxygen or mechanical ventilation (MV) throughout the clinical course versus the non-worsening oxygenation group that did not experience any respiratory event. Parameters were compared, and the extent of viral pneumonia from an initial chest computed tomography (CT) was calculated using artificial intelligence (AI) and measured visually by a radiologist. RESULTS: We included 136 patients, with 32 (23.5%) patients in the worsening oxygenation group; of whom, two needed MV and one died. Initial vital signs and duration of symptoms showed no difference between the two groups; however, univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a variety of parameters on admission were associated with an increased risk of a desaturation event. A subset of patients was studied to eliminate potential bias, that ferritin &#8805;280 µg/L (p=0.029), lactate dehydrogenase &#8805;240 U/L (p=0.029), pneumonia volume (p=0.021), and extent (p=0.030) by AI, and visual severity scores (p=0.042) were the predictive parameters for worsening oxygenation in a sex-, age-, and comorbid illness-matched case-control study using propensity score (n=52). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that initial CT evaluated by AI or visual severity scoring as well as serum markers of inflammation on admission are significantly associated with worsening oxygenation in this COVID-19 pneumonia cohort.","Hahm, Cho Rom; Lee, Young Kyung; Oh, Dong Hyun; Ahn, Mi Young; Choi, Jae-Phil; Kang, Na Ree; Oh, Jungkyun; Choi, Hanzo; Kim, Suhyun",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),300,1

A new deterministic model is introduced (SEIRQ: susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed, quarantined) with Q compartment capturing individuals and releasing them with delay. We obtain a simple rule defining the reproduction number $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of quarantine parameters, ratio of diagnosed cases and transmission parameters. The model is applied to the epidemic in Poland in March - April 2020, when social distancing measures were in place. We investigate 3 scenarios corresponding to different ratios of diagnosed cases. Our results show that depending on the scenario contact tracing could have prevented from 50\% to over 90\% of cases. The effects of quarantine are limited by fraction of undiagnosed cases. Taking into account the transmission intensity in Poland prior to introduction of social restrictions it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved without any social distancing measures.","Piasecki, Tomasz; Mucha, Piotr B.; Rosi'nska, Magdalena",,300,1

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number R 0 is derived. When R 0 < 1 , the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When R 0 > 1 , the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the USA is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model, which is divided the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantined, recovered, insusceptible and dead individuals. According to the real data of the USA, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks. Hence, the epidemic trend of the USA in the next two weeks is investigated, and the peak of isolated cases is predicted. The modified SEIQRP model successfully capture the development process of COVID-19, which provides an important reference for understanding the trend of the outbreak.","Xu, Conghui; Yu, Yongguang; Chen, YangQuan; Lu, Zhenzhen",Nonlinear Dyn,300,22

While numerous studies are devoted to the deterministic regime of an established epidemic, mathematical descriptions of the initial phase of epidemic growth are comparatively rarer. Here, we review existing mathematical results on the epidemic size over time, and derive new results to elucidate the early dynamics of an infection cluster started by a single infected individual. We show that the initial growth of epidemics that eventually take off is accelerated by stochasticity. These results are critical to improve early cluster detection and control. As an application, we compute the distribution of the first detection time of an infected individual in an infection cluster depending on the testing effort, and estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern Alpha detected in September 2020 first appeared in the United Kingdom early August 2020. We also compute a minimal testing frequency to detect clusters before they exceed a given threshold size.

Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination strategy.

The paper also highlights the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on other environmental indicators including environmental noise, medical and municipal solid wastes. The paper presents the Egyptian COVID-19 story from its different angles including the development of confirmed COVID-19 cases, containment measures from the government, the impact on the country's economy and the national energy consumption so as to effectively evaluate the effect on both the air pollution levels and the other studied environmental indicators. For the other environmental indicators, a strong link was observed between COVID-19 lockdown and the reduction in environmental noise, beaches, surface and groundwater pollution. For environmental noise, this has been confirmed by officially governmental announcements which reported that the level of environmental noise in Egypt was reduced by about 75% during the lockdown period. On the other hand, there are some negative effects, including an increase in medical solid waste (from 70 to 300 ton/day), municipal solid waste, as well as a less efficient solid waste recycling process. For air pollution levels, the data were obtained from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency satellite data sets. The data for the lockdown period in 2020 have been extracted and compared to the corresponding months in the selected baseline period (2015-2019) to identify the effect that the lockdown period had on the air pollution levels in Egypt with focus on Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It was found that the AAI decreased by about 30%, the NO2 decreased by 15 and 33% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates, respectively, and that the CO decreased by about 5% over both governorates. In addition, the GHG emissions in Egypt were reduced by at least 4% during the pandemic. In contrast, ozone levels increased by about 2% over Cairo and Alexandria governorates. It can be concluded that the implemented containment measures during COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in both positive and negative environmental impacts. The positive environmental impacts are not sustainable and deterioration on them is expected to occur after the lockdown as it was before the pandemic. Therefore, stricter laws must be enacted to protect the environment in Egypt.","Mostafa, Mohamed K; Gamal, Gamil; Wafiq, A",J Environ Manage,300,22

Recently an attachment-based coding system for family drawings was developed by attachment researchers and it was used both with clinical and nonclinical samples, but it has never been used with adoptees. METHOD: This study examined the differences between attachment representations of 29 late-adopted children aged 5-7 years (M = 6.35, 51.7% girls) and 12 non-adopted peers as assessed by family drawings, controlling for demographic variables and children's cognitive status. The attachment-based coding system of family drawings included three levels: (1) 24 individual markers, (2) eight global rating scales (1-7 points), and (3) four attachment categories (secure, avoidant, resistant, and disorganized). RESULTS: Late-adopted children assessed with the family drawings were more insecure on the attachment categories and achieved lower scores on positive global ratings such as the Vitality/Creativity and Family Pride/Happiness scales, higher scores on the Role Reversal scale, and a tendency toward higher scores on the Bizarreness/Dissociation scale. No difference emerged between the two groups regarding the individual markers. CONCLUSIONS: Family drawing seemed to be a useful tool for classifying attachment representations, and able to capture underlying mental states that it was hard for late-adopted children to express in words.","Pace, Cecilia Serena; Zavattini, Giulio Cesare; Tambelli, Renata",Child Adolesc Ment Health,300,16

Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core elements from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.","Block, Per; Hoffman, Marion; Raabe, Isabel J; Dowd, Jennifer Beam; Rahal, Charles; Kashyap, Ridhi; Mills, Melinda C",Nat Hum Behav,300,24

Prediction of the number of persons carrying the live COVID-19 coronavirus (I) in a susceptible population (S) was achieved using two rate constants describing the rate of increase and decrease in the number of infectious persons on a daily basis. The model was verified using observational data for the city of Heidelberg, Germany. Three hypothetical scenarios, having their counterparts in practice were considered, namely Scenario A - No restrictions on the population; Scenario B - Assumption of a 10-fold higher number of infections than observed; Scenario C - Protective measures introduced only for elderly persons. It could be demonstrated using the model that the lockdown measures introduced prevented a major medical emergency and possibly a near catastrophe in the region. It was further demonstrated that the prospective application of the model can facilitate realtime decisions on pandemic management strategy for the population. This is achieved by curve-fitting for the rate constants, determinants for the number of infectious persons. The calculated maximum numbers of infected and infectious persons daily increased in proportion to the number of persons initially susceptible to the infection. After appearance of the first two infections in Heidelberg, the calculated maximum number of persons carrying live virus was 2,291 at Day 102 (Scenario B), 18,936 infectious persons at Day 139 (Scenario C) and 22,535 infectious at Day 142 (Scenario A). In Scenario A, high values would have persisted for 6 months during which a total of 124,301 persons would have been infected in Heidelberg. The model predicted that the virus would have disappeared within 1 year after being first detected. A disease catastrophe of this magnitude would not be expected provided the rate constant (&#945;) for the rate of increase in the number of infectious persons remained lower than the rate constant (ß) for the fall in number of infectious persons.","Merle, Uta; Laßmann, Axel; Dressel, Alexander R; Braun, Peter",Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,300,16

METHODS: We calculated infection and death rates amongst US hospital workers per 100 COVID-19-related deaths in the general population based on observed numbers in Hubei, China, and Italy. We used Monte Carlo simulations to compute point estimates with 95% confidence intervals for hospital worker (HW) infections in the US based on each of these two scenarios. We also assessed the impact of restricting hospital workers aged &#8805; 60 years from performing patient care activities on these estimates. RESULTS: We estimated that about 53,000 hospital workers in the US could get infected, and 1579 could die due to COVID19. The availability of PPE for high-risk workers alone could reduce this number to about 28,000 infections and 850 deaths. Restricting high-risk hospital workers such as those aged &#8805; 60 years from direct patient care could reduce counts to 2,000 healthcare worker infections and 60 deaths. CONCLUSION: We estimate that US hospital workers will bear a significant burden of illness due to COVID-19. Making PPE available to all hospital workers and reducing the exposure of hospital workers above the age of 60 could mitigate these risks.","Razzak, Junaid A; Bhatti, Junaid A; Tahir, Muhammad Ramzan; Pasha-Razzak, Omrana",PLoS One,300,24

The liquid state of these markers allows for high-precision placement under image guidance using thin needles. Based on step-by-step modifications, the image features and mechanical properties of markers can be optimized to bridge diagnostic imaging and specific therapeutic interventions. The performance of Carbo-gel is demonstrated for markers that (i) have radiographic, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound visibility; (ii) are palpable and visible; and (iii) are localizable by near-infrared fluorescence and radio guidance.

METHOD: Seventy-seven consecutive patients (mean age, 64 ± 15 years) with mild COVID-19 pneumonia that underwent HRCT were retrospectively included. Three radiologists [two devoted to thoracic imaging (R1, R2), and one generalist (R3)] on a per-examination basis independently assessed ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation, and crazy-paving pattern. The extent of each feature (total feature score, TFS) was semi-quantitatively assessed, and each TFS summed up to obtain total lung score (TLS). Presence of organizing pneumonia (OP) pattern was also recorded. The inter-reader agreement was calculated with Cohen's Kappa (k) and Free-Marginal Multirater k. Multivariable analysis was run to determine whether imaging features were predictive of short-term evolution to severe disease (need for ventilation). RESULTS: Most features showed substantial inter-reader agreement, including TLS > 6 (k = 0.69), which was an independent predictor of short-term occurrence of severe disease, regardless of the reader (OR 9-53.19). Consolidation TFS > 2 and OP pattern showed substantial and moderate agreement, respectively, only when comparing R1 and R2. Consolidation TFS > 2 and OP pattern were independent predictors of severe disease for R2 (OR 4.87) and R1 (OR 6), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-reader agreement for most HRCT features of COVID-19 pneumonia ranges moderate-to-substantial, though it depends on readers' experience in the case of consolidation and OP pattern.","Cereser, Lorenzo; Girometti, Rossano; Da Re, Jacopo; Marchesini, Filippo; Como, Giuseppe; Zuiani, Chiara",,300,17

Evidence reviewWe searched the L.OVE platform through July 6, 2021 and included randomized trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to standard or other active treatments. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analysis, assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach and performed sensitivity analysis excluding trials with risk of bias. ResultsWe included 29 RCTs which enrolled 5592 cases. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was very low to low. Compared to standard of care, ivermectin may reduce mortality, may increase symptom resolution or improvement, may increase viral clearance, may reduce infections in exposed individuals and may decrease hospitalizations (Risk difference (RD) 21 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 35 fewer to 4 more). However, after excluding trials classified as ""high risk"" or ""some concerns"" in the risk of bias assessment, most estimates of effect changed substantially: Compared to standard of care, low certainty evidence suggests that ivermectin may not significantly reduce mortality (RD 7 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 77 fewer to 108 more) nor mechanical ventilation (RD 6 more per 1000, 95%CI: 43 fewer to 86 more), and moderate certainty evidence shows that it probably does not significantly increase symptom resolution or improvement (RD 14 more per 1000, 95%CI: 29 fewer to 71 more) nor viral clearance (RD 12 fewer per 1000, 95%CI: 84 fewer to 76 more). It is uncertain if ivermectin increases or decreases severe adverse events and symptomatic infections in exposed individuals. Conclusions and RelevanceIvermectin may not improve clinically important outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and its effects as a prophylactic intervention in exposed individuals are uncertain. Previous reports concluding significant benefits associated with ivermectin are based on potentially biased results reported by studies with substantial methodological limitations.

An objective and quantitative means of passively monitoring the impact and response of these interventions at a local level is needed. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore the utility of the recently developed open-source mobile health platform Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse (RADAR)-base as a toolbox to rapidly test the effect and response to NPIs intended to limit the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data extracted from smartphone and wearable devices, and managed by the RADAR-base from 1062 participants recruited in Italy, Spain, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. We derived nine features on a daily basis including time spent at home, maximum distance travelled from home, the maximum number of Bluetooth-enabled nearby devices (as a proxy for physical distancing), step count, average heart rate, sleep duration, bedtime, phone unlock duration, and social app use duration. We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn tests to assess differences in these features among baseline, prelockdown, and during lockdown periods. We also studied behavioral differences by age, gender, BMI, and educational background. RESULTS: We were able to quantify expected changes in time spent at home, distance travelled, and the number of nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices between prelockdown and during lockdown periods (P<.001 for all five countries). We saw reduced sociality as measured through mobility features and increased virtual sociality through phone use. People were more active on their phones (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), spending more time using social media apps (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), particularly around major news events. Furthermore, participants had a lower heart rate (P<.001 for Italy and Spain; P=.02 for Denmark), went to bed later (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands), and slept more (P<.001 for Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). We also found that young people had longer homestay than older people during the lockdown and fewer daily steps. Although there was no significant difference between the high and low BMI groups in time spent at home, the low BMI group walked more. CONCLUSIONS: RADAR-base, a freely deployable data collection platform leveraging data from wearables and mobile technologies, can be used to rapidly quantify and provide a holistic view of behavioral changes in response to public health interventions as a result of infectious outbreaks such as COVID-19. RADAR-base may be a viable approach to implementing an early warning system for passively assessing the local compliance to interventions in epidemics and pandemics, and could help countries ease out of lockdown.","Sun, Shaoxiong; Folarin, Amos A; Ranjan, Yatharth; Rashid, Zulqarnain; Conde, Pauline; Stewart, Callum; Cummins, Nicholas; Matcham, Faith; Dalla Costa, Gloria; Simblett, Sara; Leocani, Letizia; Lamers, Femke; Sørensen, Per Soelberg; Buron, Mathias; Zabalza, Ana; Guerrero Pérez, Ana Isabel; Penninx, Brenda Wjh; Siddi, Sara; Haro, Josep Maria; Myin-Germeys, Inez; Rintala, Aki; Wykes, Til; Narayan, Vaibhav A; Comi, Giancarlo; Hotopf, Matthew; Dobson, Richard Jb",J Med Internet Res,300,5

We describe the clinical course and examine factors associated with outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Germany. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study we included patients with COVID-19 admitted to a national network of German hospitals between February 12 and June 12, 2020. We examined demographic characteristics, comorbidities and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We included 1904 patients with a median age of 73 years, 48.5% (924/1904) of whom were female. The mortality rate was 17% (317/1835; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 16-19), the rate of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was 21% (399/1860; 95%CI 20-23), and the rate of invasive mechanical ventilation was 14% (250/1850: 95%CI 12-15). The most prominent risk factors for death were male sex (hazard ratio (HR) 1.45; 95%CI 1.15-1.83), pre-existing lung disease (HR 1.61; 95%CI 1.20-2.16), and increased patient age (HR 4.11 (95%CI 2.57-6.58) for age >79 years versus <60 years). Among patients admitted to the ICU, the mortality rate was 29% (109/374; 95%CI 25-34) and higher in ventilated (33% [77/235; 95%CI 27-39]) than in non-ventilated ICU patients (23%, 32/139; 95%CI 16-30; p < 0.05).

The existing literature on the impact of COVID-19 in the education sector is predominantly descriptive and focused on the difficulties faced by teachers during the process of transferring into online teaching, mainly in the higher education sector. This study adopted a mixed-method design to examine online teaching self-efficacy (TSE) during COVID-19, its associated factors and moderators. A sample of 351 Chinese school teachers retrospectively reported their online TSE at the beginning and end of COVID-19 school lockdown, out of which six were followed up for an in-depth interview. TSE for online instruction did not significantly increase (ß = .014, p > 0.05) whereas that for technology application increased significantly (ß = .231, p < 0.01). Lack of experience in online teaching, separation of teachers from students, school administrative process and unsatisfactory student academic performance were identified as the major associated factors. A moderation effect of adaptability and teacher burnout on the change in online TSE were examined, of which passion burnout was the only significant moderator toward the change in online TSE. The study thus concluded that teachers' online TSE for technology application increased among Chinese teachers during COVID-19 school lockdown.

We examined whether COVID-19 risk differs according to antihypertensive drug class in patients treated by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Three exclusive cohorts of prevalent ACE inhibitors, ARB and CCB users, aged 18 to 80 years, from the French National Health Insurance databases were followed from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020. We excluded patients with a history of diabetes, known cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, or chronic respiratory disease during the previous 5 years, to only consider patients treated for uncomplicated hypertension and to limit indication bias. The primary end point was time to hospitalization for COVID-19. The secondary end point was time to intubation/death during a hospital stay for COVID-19. In a population of almost 2 million hypertensive patients (ACE inhibitors: 566 023; ARB: 958 227; CCB: 358 306) followed for 16 weeks, 2338 were hospitalized and 526 died or were intubated for COVID-19. ACE inhibitors and ARBs were associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 hospitalization compared with CCBs (hazard ratio, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.65-0.83] and 0.84 [0.76-0.93], respectively) and a lower risk of intubation/death. Risks were slightly lower for ACE inhibitor users than for ARB users. This large observational study may suggest a lower COVID-19 risk in hypertensive patients treated over a long period with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with CCBs. These results, if confirmed, tend to contradict previous hypotheses and raise new hypotheses.","Semenzato, Laura; Botton, Jérémie; Drouin, Jérôme; Baricault, Bérangère; Vabre, Clémentine; Cuenot, François; Penso, Laetitia; Herlemont, Philippe; Sbidian, Emilie; Weill, Alain; Dray-Spira, Rosemary; Zureik, Mahmoud",Hypertension,300,20

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the practical and ethical problems of allocating limited medical resources such as intensive care unit beds and ventilators became critical. Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic shifts the medical paradigm from person-centred medicine to community-centred medicine, challenging the main ethical theories. We reviewed the main guidelines and recommendations for resources allocation and examined their position toward persons with disabilities. Based on our findings, we propose criteria for not discriminating against people with disabilities in allocating resources. The shift from person-centred to community-centred medicine offers opportunities but also risks sacrificing the most vulnerable people. The principle of reasonable accommodation must always be considered to guarantee the rights of persons with disabilities.","Panocchia, Nicola; D039,; ambrosio, Viola; Corti, Serafino; Lo Presti, Eluisa; Bertelli, Marco; Scattoni, Maria Luisa; Ghelma, Filippo",J. med. ethics,300,20

However, prevention of a new infectious disease by vaccination or pharmaceuticals is made difficult by the slow process of vaccine and drug development. We propose an additional intervention that allows rapid control of emerging infectious diseases, and can also be used to eradicate diseases that rely almost exclusively on human-to-human transmission. The intervention is based on (1) testing every individual for the disease, (2) repeatedly, and (3) isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient rate of testing, the reproduction number is reduced below 1.0 and the epidemic will rapidly collapse. The approach does not rely on strong or unrealistic assumptions about test accuracy, isolation compliance, population structure or epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored in real time by following the test positivity rate. In addition to the compliance rate and false negatives, the required rate of testing depends on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing outperforming random sampling. Provided that results are obtained rapidly, the test frequency required to suppress an epidemic is monotonic and near-linear with respect to R0, the infectious period, and the fraction of susceptible individuals. The testing regime is effective against both early phase and established epidemics, and additive to other interventions (e.g. contact tracing and social distancing). It is also robust to failure: any rate of testing reduces the number of infections, improving both public health and economic conditions. These conclusions are based on rigorous analysis and simulations of appropriate epidemiological models. A mass-produced, disposable test that could be used at home would be ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests that return immediate results.","Taipale, Jussi; Kontoyiannis, Ioannis; Linnarsson, Sten",,300,24

More or less everyone harbours at least one strain of these viruses in the blood, while not in the spinal fluid.

Tumor Associated Tissue Eosinophilia (TATE) has long been evaluated in the diagnosis and progression of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). However, their association with Tumor Associated Blood Eosinophilia (TABE) in OSCCs is still far fetched. We, therefore, attempted to evaluate their individual roles and to achieve a ratio between TATE and TABE in order to signify its usage in objectifying the diagnosis. Materials and Methods: TATE was evaluated using H and E stain per 10 high power fields in 33 previously diagnosed cases of OSCC which were retrieved from department archives. TABE values were achieved from complete blood hemogram reports of patients. TATE/TABE ratio was calculated. All the parameters were clinicopathologically correlated and statistically evaluated using SPSS. Results: TATE represented higher values in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSCC) and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC) and was least in moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC), whereas TABE linearly increased from WDSCC to PDSCC. TNM Stage II cases revealed the highest TATE and lowest TABE. TATE/TABE ratio was the highest in WDSCC. Conclusion: Due to the dual nature of eosinophils in early and late carcinogenesis events, evaluation of only TATE might not be conclusive in determining tumor grade. Hence, in a first of its kind attempt, the TATE/TABE ratio may be suitable to achieve a criterion for the determination of tumor grade and may also help to unfold the underlying biologic events.","Verma, Flora; Juneja, Saurabh; Tandon, Ankita; Shetty, Devi Charan",J Cancer Res Ther,300,24

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations, which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium state for the coronavirus disease. METHODS: The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as the existence and stability criteria for the disease, using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R0=0) were satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0). RESULTS: With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded. Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","Victor Okhuese, Alexander",JMIR Public Health Surveill,300,26

Adults in our survey who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 positive were confirmed with reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and isolated in various hospitals in Cairo, Egypt. RESULTS: This pilot study included 58 (53.4% males and 46.6% females) COVID-19 patients ages 18-46 years, and 13 (22.4%) were healthcare workers. Our results showed that 67.2% of the patients had at least one manifestation related to the oral cavity and salivary glands, and 32.8% (n = 19) did not have any symptoms associated with the oral cavity. The highest prevalence symptoms were dry mouth 39.7% (n = 23), gustatory dysfunction as 34.5% (n = 20) loss of salt sensation, 29.3% (n = 17) loss of sweet sensation, and 25.9% (n = 15) altered food taste, while the least prevalent symptoms were tongue redness 8.8% (n = 5), and gingival bleeding 7% (n = 4).

There was a 1.5-point overall improvement in median clinical status score on a seven-point ordinal scale from baseline to day 7 in patients in the progesterone group as compared with control subjects (95% CI, 0.0-2.0; P = .024). There were no serious adverse events attributable to progesterone. Patients treated with progesterone required three fewer days of supplemental oxygen (median, 4.5 vs 7.5 days) and were hospitalized for 2.5 fewer days (median, 7.0 vs 9.5 days) as compared with control subjects. INTERPRETATION: Progesterone at a dose of 100 mg, twice daily by subcutaneous injection in addition to SOC, may represent a safe and effective approach for treatment in hypoxemic men with moderate to severe COVID-19.

From loss and grief to silence and simplicity – a philosophical and pastoral approach,18.881874,3.5970576,2020,"We propose a partial identification method for estimating disease prevalence from serology studies. Our data are results from antibody tests in some population sample, where the test parameters, such as the true/false positive rates, are unknown. Our method scans the entire parameter space, and rejects parameter values using the joint data density as the test statistic. The proposed method is conservative for marginal inference, in general, but its key advantage over more standard approaches is that it is valid in finite samples even when the underlying model is not point identified. Moreover, our method requires only independence of serology test results, and does not rely on asymptotic arguments, normality assumptions, or other approximations. We use recent Covid-19 serology studies in the US, and show that the parameter confidence set is generally wide, and cannot support definite conclusions. Specifically, recent serology studies from California suggest a prevalence anywhere in the range 0%-2% (at the time of study), and are therefore inconclusive. However, this range could be narrowed down to 0.7%-1.5% if the actual false positive rate of the antibody test was indeed near its empirical estimate ( â¼ 0.5%). In another study from New York state, Covid-19 prevalence is confidently estimated in the range 13%-17% in mid-April of 2020, which also suggests significant geographic variation in Covid-19 exposure across the US. Combining all datasets yields a 5%-8% prevalence range. Our results overall suggest that serology testing on a massive scale can give crucial information for future policy design, even when such tests are imperfect and their parameters unknown.","Toulis, Panos",Journal of econometrics,300,16

Eight episodes of acute necrotizing encephalopathy among 7 patients were recorded, in which all of them had an initial presentation of fever and seizure. We identified that acute necrotizing encephalopathy patients with a severe score of Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation, brainstem involvement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and higher MR imaging scores were associated with worse outcome. Association of outcome with acute necrotizing encephalopathy severity score, platelet count, and serum alanine aminotransferase level did not reach a statistically significant level.

COVID-19 is frequently associated with increased serum ferritin levels, and hyperferritinemia was shown to correlate with illness severity. The liver is the major site for iron storage, and conditions of iron overload have been established to have a pathogenic role in development of liver diseases. We presented here six patients who developed severe COVID-19, with biochemical evidence of liver failure. Three cases were survived patients, who underwent liver biopsy; the other three were deceased patients, who were autopsied. None of the patients suffered underlying liver pathologies. Histopathological and ultrastructural analyses were performed. The most striking finding we demonstrated in all patients was iron accumulation into hepatocytes, associated with degenerative changes. Abundant ferritin particles were found enclosed in siderosomes, and large aggregates of hemosiderin were found, often in close contact with damaged mitochondria. Iron-caused oxidative stress may be responsible for mitochondria metabolic dysfunction. In agreement with this, association between mitochondria and lipid droplets was also found. Overall, our data suggest that hepatic iron overload could be the pathogenic trigger of liver injury associated to COVID-19.","Del Nonno, Franca; Nardacci, Roberta; Colombo, Daniele; Visco-Comandini, Ubaldo; Cicalini, Stefania; Antinori, Andrea; Marchioni, Luisa; D039,; Offizi, Gianpiero; Piacentini, Mauro; Falasca, Laura",,300,26

The pandemic has brought into focus how climate change is related with virus transmission and health, and has made the global transition toward low-carbon development more difficult and challenged the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the pandemic has significantly reduced carbon emissions and improved the environmental quality in the short term, it is still an unwanted event in the process of pursuing sustainable development;although objectively the pandemic has weakened countries’ efforts in terms of policies and actions to address climate change, the restructuring of global value chains in the post-COVID era has also brought new opportunities for a transition toward green and low-carbon development;although the pandemic has warned people of how important resilient governance and international cooperation is to addressing the crisis, the global climate governance process has come to a complete standstill since the outbreak of COVID-19, attenuating the mutual trust among countries and disabling the leadership in climate governance. The pandemic is a preview of the climate crisis, and it is important to learn from it for a better response. China quickly contained the pandemic within the country, actively resumed work and production, and gained a first-mover advantage in economic recovery. China should maintain strategic focus when pursuing ecological development, enhance the resilience of the socio-economic system, seize the opportunity of transitioning toward low-carbon development by turning the crisis into opportunities, and promote high-quality development within the country while fully engaging in global climate governance to seek ecological progress with other countries.

Airway epithelial cells from infected patients were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named the SARS-CoV-2, on January 12, 2020, which is the seventh member of the coronavirus family to infect humans. Phylogenetic analysis of full-length genome sequences obtained from infected patients showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and uses the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV. The possible person-to-person disease rapidly spread to many provinces in China as well as other countries. Without a therapeutic vaccine or specific antiviral drugs, early detection and isolation become essential against novel Coronavirus. In this review, we introduced current diagnostic methods and criteria for the SARS-CoV-2 in China and discuss the advantages and limitations of the current diagnostic methods, including chest imaging and laboratory detection.","Wang, Huihui; Li, Xuemei; Li, Tao; Zhang, Shubing; Wang, Lianzi; Wu, Xian; Liu, Jiaqing",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,300,30

No proven definitive therapies for this infection currently exist. Unfortunately, the infected patients increased in an alarming way every day, faster than medical evidence. At present, the expanding knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 virology provides several potential drug targets. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, clinicians need a rapid review and guideline about the main adverse effects regarding the most prescribed drugs and, specifically, the efficacy and potential risk of each pharmacological therapy, during hospital care. METHODS: The articles review was performed using PubMed to identify relevant papers in English language reported through July 20th, 2020; a second review was performed using Web of Science until August 28th. Due to the lack of randomized clinical trials, we included case reports, case series, and reviews. We found 1606 total articles related. The authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts for inclusion. CONCLUSION: At present, despite the enormous medical effort for publishing several trials or case reports, we have not yet discovered a definitive therapy against the COVID-19 infection. This brief review aims to prompt identification of risk factors and main adverse effects in a systematic view related to therapy with partial evidence proposed to date.","Mora-Ramírez, Mauricio; Melgoza-Hernández, Paulina; Toledo-Ramírez, Sebastian Eduardo; Aranguré, Juan Manuel Mejía",Curr. med. chem,300,24

Patients with Kawasaki disease were included and matched 1:5 to a population control group, matched by birth year, sex and incident month of the Kawasaki disease diagnosis. A total of 820 cases < 21 years of age were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 3 years. Median follow-up time was 12 years. Patients with KD were at higher risk of being diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease at 10 years (HR 39.94 (95% CI 5.00-319.28)) and 30 years (HR 8.33 (95% CI 3.03-22.91)). The 10-, 20- and 30-year risks of developing autoimmune disorders were HR 4.23 (95% CI 3.01-5.94), HR 3.23 (95% CI 2.44-4.29) and 2.83 (95% CI, 2.17-3.68), all p < 0.001.

Children with KD have increased long-term risks of ischaemic heart disease also of autoimmune disease and cancer, as well as an increased all-cause mortality. The surprisingly increased risk of autoimmunity must be investigated further. What is known: â¢ Kawasaki disease is characterized by acute vasculitis and inflammation that can affect the coronary arteries. â¢ Anti-inflammatory medicine is effective in the acute stages of the disease.

A greater understanding of citizens' perceptions of these measures can help government agencies adapt their strategies to boost compliance. We examined citizens' perceptions of government's measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications on compliance using data from Onitsha city, Anambra State Nigeria. Methods: data was obtained through in-person interviews of 140 consenting adults in March 2020. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarize the data. Results: most participants (84.7%) doubted government's ability to manage the COVID-19 outbreak, raising concerns about ineffective governance (25.7%) and inadequate health facilities (20.7%). However, participants expressed a favorable perception of school closures (92.3%) and a ban on large gatherings (83.9%), driven mostly by the need to contain the COVID-19 and avoid its spread. But, they were generally indifferent about the closure of the markets and workplaces due to concerns for food insecurity and lack of government's relief programs. Participants who had a positive perception of the ban on large gatherings were more likely to have high knowledge and to adopt good COVID-19 preventive practices. Conclusion: the study showed a lack of public's confidence in the government's ability to manage the pandemic. This provides an opportunity for the city government and the public to reflect on the existing relationships, build mutual trust, and devise collaborative engagement that will boost compliance and help contain the devastating impact of COVID-19 pandemic.","Yunusa, Ismaeel; Iloanusi, Sorochi; Mgbere, Osaro; Iloanusi, Nchebe-Jah Raymond; Ajayi, Anthony Idowu; Essien, Ekere James",Pan Afr Med J,300,29

supporting the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of three diseases - human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, syphilis and hepatitis B Significant progress towards triple elimination has been made in some regions, but progress has been slow in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the highest burden of these diseases The shared features of the three diseases, including their epidemiology, disease interactions and core interventions for tackling them, enable an integrated healthsystems approach for elimination of mother-to-child transmission Current barriers to triple elimination in sub-Saharan Africa include a lack of policies, strategies and resources to support the uptake of wellestablished preventive and treatment interventions While much can be achieved with existing tools, the development of new products and models of care, as well as a prioritized research agenda, are needed to accelerate progress on triple elimination in sub-Saharan Africa In this paper we aim to show that health systems working together with communities in sub-Saharan Africa could deliver rapid and sustainable results towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of all three diseases However, stronger political support, expansion of evidence-based interventions and better use of funding streams are needed to improve efficiency and build on the successes in

For mitigating its risk, Japan called on all elementary, junior high, and high schools nationwide to close beginning March 1, 2020. However, its effectiveness in decreasing the disease burden has not been investigated. METHODS: We used daily data of the COVID-19 and coronavirus infection incidence in Japan until March 31, 2020. Time-series analyses were conducted using the Bayesian method. Local linear trend models with interventional effects were constructed for the number of newly reported cases of COVID-19, including asymptomatic infections. We considered that the effects of the intervention started to appear nine days after the school closure. RESULTS: The intervention of school closure did not appear to decrease the incidence of coronavirus infection. If the effectiveness of school closure began on March 9, the mean coefficient &#945; for the effectiveness of the measure was calculated to be 0.08 (95% confidence interval -0.36 to 0.65), and the actual reported cases were more than predicted, yet with a rather wide confidence interval. Sensitivity analyses using different dates also did not demonstrate the effectiveness of the school closure. DISCUSSION: School closure carried out in Japan did not show any mitigating effect on the transmission of novel coronavirus infection.","Iwata, Kentaro; Doi, Asako; Miyakoshi, Chisato",Int J Infect Dis,300,1

This study examines the relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety symptoms at 13, 15, and 17 years using cross-lagged models in a predominantly White (n = 1,430; 92%) subsample of 1,548 participants from the Quebec Longitudinal study of Child Development. Multigroup analyses were conducted to examine the models according to sexual orientation. Demographic covariates were included as control variables, as well as alcohol, cigarette, and other drug use to examine cannabis specificity. The full sample revealed small bidirectional associations, which remained significant once control variables were included in the model: cannabis at 13 and 15 years predicted anxiety symptoms at 15 and 17 years respectively, and depression symptoms at 15 years predicted cannabis at 17 years. The initial association between cannabis at 13 years and depression symptoms at 15 years was accounted for by other drug use at 13 years. Substantial differences were found between heterosexual participants and sexual minorities: LGB participants presented a substantially larger positive association between depression symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years, as well as a negative association between anxiety symptoms at 15 years and cannabis at 17 years. Both of these relationships remained significant when accounting for control variables. These results suggest that the relationships between cannabis, and depression and anxiety symptoms are bidirectional across adolescence, albeit small. Sexual minorities present particularly large associations that may represent self-medication efforts for depressive symptoms between 15 and 17 years.

We found that if goods were tainted or personnel in market was infected, normal transaction behaviors between sellers and customers, daily physiological activities, and marketing activities could lead to viral contamination and spread to the surroundings via fomite, droplet or aerosol routes. Environmental factors such as low temperature and high humidity, poor ventilation, and insufficient hygiene facilities and disinfection practices may contribute to viral transmission in Xinfadi Market. In addition, precautionary control strategies were also proposed to effectively reduce the clustering cases of COVID-19 in large-scale wholesale markets.","Li, Xia; Wang, Qin; Ding, Pei; Cha, Yu039; Mao, Yixin; Ding, Cheng; Gu, Wen; Wang, Youbin; Ying, Bo; Zhao, Xiaoning; Pan, Lijun; Li, Yunpu; Chang, Junrui; Meng, Congshen; Zhou, Jun; Tang, Zhigang; Sun, Ruofeng; Deng, Fuchang; Wang, Chong; Li, Li; Wang, Jiao; MacIntyre, C Raina; Wu, Zunyou; Feng, Zijian; Tang, Song; Xu, Dongqun",Sci Total Environ,300,16

The Covid-19 pandemic has brought in its wake massive unemployment, shifting attention away from pre-pandemic labour market challenges. More labour market turbulence can be expected in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, digitalisation and automation, as well as climate-change-related transitions. In this context of such acute uncertainty, flexible, adaptable public employment institutions are a core requirement. Concerned with institution building, this paper explores how to maximise synergies in existing Public Employment Services (PES) while developing an ecosystem that can utilise all other available resources across public, private and not-for-profit national and local institutions. The political context for policy and institutional reform is a centralised, relatively small and open state which demonstrates some capacity to learn from previous crises and institutional reforms to tackle unemployment. The concept of a Strategic Action Field is used to deepen our understanding of the structure and agency dynamics underlying PES reform in the context of quasi-markets. A more systematic approach to institutional reform is needed that values a diversity of actors - this is visualised as a Public Employment Eco System (PEES) embedded in processes of network governance and collaborative innovation.","Murphy, M.

A literature review,18.882986,3.6566014,2021,"The formation of herd immunity through vaccination is a key point in overcoming the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To acquire herd immunity, a high vaccination rate is required, which is necessary to instill confidence in the public regarding the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. In the real-world setting, thorough preparation of components, such as priority setting, vaccine delivery, logistics, and side-effect monitoring is necessary to overcome vaccine hesitancy. Each country prioritizes vaccination since healthcare workers, nursing facility residents, and the elderly population, and similar trends are found between countries. Vaccination is performed at large centers and medical institutions operated by the country, and variations are dependent on the environment of each country. The transport of mRNA vaccines is a challenging task, and to this end, each government is striving for safe distribution. In addition, each authority operates a surveillance system to monitor the safety of vaccines, and Korea needs to produce evidence for monitoring effects and side effects with expertise. Even after the acquisition of herd immunity, COVID-19 is highly likely to remain an endemic infectious disease, and a higher immunity level may be required because of variants of the virus. If the spread of variants of concern continues, a booster vaccination may be required. Therefore, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, wearing a mask, and epidemiological investigation should be maintained.","Jung, Jaehun",J Korean Med Sci,300,29

We present a unifying framework for blending mechanistic and machine-learning approaches to identify dynamical systems from data. We compare pure data-driven learning with hybrid models which incorporate imperfect domain knowledge. We cast the problem in both continuous- and discrete-time, for problems in which the model error is memoryless and in which it has significant memory, and we compare data-driven and hybrid approaches experimentally. Our formulation is agnostic to the chosen machine learning model. Using Lorenz '63 and Lorenz '96 Multiscale systems, we find that hybrid methods substantially outperform solely data-driven approaches in terms of data hunger, demands for model complexity, and overall predictive performance. We also find that, while a continuous-time framing allows for robustness to irregular sampling and desirable domain-interpretability, a discrete-time framing can provide similar or better predictive performance, especially when data are undersampled and the vector field cannot be resolved. We study model error from the learning theory perspective, defining excess risk and generalization error; for a linear model of the error used to learn about ergodic dynamical systems, both errors are bounded by terms that diminish with the square-root of T. We also illustrate scenarios that benefit from modeling with memory, proving that continuous-time recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can, in principle, learn memory-dependent model error and reconstruct the original system arbitrarily well; numerical results depict challenges in representing memory by this approach. We also connect RNNs to reservoir computing and thereby relate the learning of memory-dependent error to recent work on supervised learning between Banach spaces using random features.","Levine, Matthew E.; Stuart, Andrew M.",,300,16

General practitioners (GPs) provide the vast majority of patient care, and knowledge of their experiences with providing care for regular health issues during a pandemic is scarce. Hence, in a Danish context we explored how GPs experienced reorganising their work in an attempt to uphold sufficient patient care while contributing to minimizing the spread of COVID-19. Further, in relation to this, we examined what guided GPs' choices between telephone, video and face-to-face consultations. METHODS: This study consisted of qualitative interviews with 13 GPs. They were interviewed twice, approximately three months apart in the initial phase of the pandemic, and they took daily notes for 20 days. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and inductively analysed. RESULTS: The GPs re-organised their clinical work profoundly. Most consultations were converted to video or telephone, postponed or cancelled. The use of video first rose, but soon declined, once again replaced by an increased use of face-to-face consultations. When choosing between consultation forms, the GPs took into account the need to minimise the risk of COVID-19, the central guidelines, and their own preference for face-to-face consultations. There were variations over time and between the GPs regarding which health issues were dealt with by using video and/or the telephone. For some health issues, the GPs generally deemed it acceptable to use video or telephone, postpone or cancel appointments for a short term, and in a crisis situation. They experienced relational and technical limitations with video consultation, while diagnostic uncertainty was not regarded as a prominent issue CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates how the GPs experienced telephone and video consultations as being useful in a pandemic situation when face-to-face consultations had to be severely restricted. The GPs did, however, identify several limitations similar to those known in non-pandemic times. The weighing of pros and cons and their willingness to use these alternatives shifted and generally diminished when face-to-face consultations were once again deemed viable. In case of future pandemics, such alternatives seem valuable, at least for a short term.","Due, Tina Drud; Thorsen, Thorkil; Andersen, Julie Høgsgaard",BMC Fam Pract,300,22

OBJECTIVE. Although chest CT is the standard imaging modality in early diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the use of lung ultrasound (US) presents some advantages over the use of chest CT and may play a complementary role in the workup of COVID-19. The objective of our study was to investigate US findings in patients with COVID-19 and the relationship of the US findings with the duration of symptoms and disease severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS. From March 3, 2020, to March 30, 2020, consecutive patients with a positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test result for the virus that causes COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Lung US was performed, and the imaging features were analyzed. The Fisher exact test was used to compare the percentages of patients with each US finding between groups with different symptom durations and disease severity. RESULTS. Our study population comprised 28 patients (14 men and 14 women; mean age ± SD, 59.8 ± 18.3 years; age range, 21-92 years). All 28 patients (100.0%, 28/28) had positive lung US findings. The most common findings were the following: B-lines (100.0%, 28/28), consolidation (67.9%, 19/28), and a thickened pleural line (60.7%, 17/28). A thickened pleural line was observed in a higher percentage of patients with a longer duration of the disease than in those with a shorter duration of the disease, and pulmonary consolidations were more common in severe and critical cases than in moderate cases. CONCLUSION. Typical lung US findings in patients with COVID-19 included B-lines, pulmonary consolidation, and a thickened pleural line. In addition, our results indicate that lung US findings can be be used to reflect both the infection duration and disease severity.","Zhang, Yao; Xue, Heng; Wang, Mixue; He, Nan; Lv, Zhibin; Cui, Ligang",AJR Am J Roentgenol,300,1

The putative viral-induced inhibition of ACE2 could result in the defective degradation of bradykinin, a potent inflammatory substance. We hypothesize that increased bradykinin in the lungs is an important mechanism driving the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure in COVID-19. METHODS: This is a phase II, single-center, three-armed parallel-group, open-label, active control superiority randomized clinical trial. One hundred eighty eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either the inhibitor of C1e/kallikrein 20 U/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 4 plus standard care; or icatibant 30 mg subcutaneously, three doses/day for 4 days plus standard care; or standard care alone, as recommended in the clinical trials published to date, which includes supplemental oxygen, non-invasive and invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, prophylactic antithrombotic therapy, vasopressor support, and renal replacement therapy. DISCUSSION: Accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs is a common side effect of ACE inhibitors leading to cough. In animal models, the inactivation of ACE2 leads to severe acute pneumonitis in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inhibition of bradykinin almost completely restores the lung structure. We believe that inhibition of bradykinin in severe COVID-19 patients could reduce the lung inflammatory response, impacting positively on the severity of disease and mortality rates.

Because a number of COVID-19 e-commerce models have emerged, this paper discusses whether and (if so) why and how e-commerce can ensure the food supply for urban residents if social distancing becomes a norm and the transport and logistics systems are hindered.Design/methodology/approachThis study used qualitative research methods following the lack of empirical data. The authors referred to relevant literature, statistical data and official reports and comprehensively described the importance of e-commerce in ensuring the safety of food supply to Chinese urban residents under the impact of the epidemic. Corresponding to the traditional case study, this study presented a Chinese case on ensuring food supply through e-commerce during an epidemic.FindingsThe authors found that three e-commerce models played a substantial role in preventing the spread of the epidemic and ensuring the food supply for urban residents. The nationwide e-commerce platforms under market leadership played their roles by relying on the sound infrastructure of large cities and its logistics system was vulnerable to the epidemic. In the worst-affected areas, particularly in closed and isolated communities, the local e-commerce model was the primary model, supplemented by the unofficial e-commerce model based on social relations. Through online booking, centralized procurement and community distribution, the risk of cross infection could be effectively reduced and the food demand could be effectively satisfied. The theoretical explanation further verifies that, apart from e-commerce, a governance system that integrates the government, e-commerce platform, community streets and the unofficial guanxi also impels the success of these models.Originality/valueLessons from China are drawn for other countries struggling to deliver food to those in need under COVID-19. The study not only provides a solution that will ensure constant food supply to urban residents under the COVID-19 epidemic but also provides some reference for the maintenance of the food system of urban residents under the impact of a globalization-related crisis in future.","Guo, Hongdong Liu Yehong Shi Xinjie Chen Kevin Z.",China Agricultural Economic Review,300,16

Within the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system, two vulnerable groups include those with a psychotic disorder (PSY) and those who have recently experienced homelessness (recently housed Veterans, RHV). We conducted phone interviews with PSY (n = 81), RHV (n = 76) and control Veterans (CTL, n = 74) between mid-May - mid-August 2020 (""initial"") and between mid-August - mid-October 2020 (""follow-up""). At the initial period, we also collected retrospective ratings relative to January 2020 (""pre-COVID-19""). We assessed clinical factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, loneliness) and community integration (e.g., social and role functioning). All groups reported worse clinical outcomes after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, PSY and RHV exhibited improvements in depression and anxiety from initial to follow up, whereas CTL continued to exhibit elevated levels. There was little change in community integration measures. Our results indicate that all groups reported increased mental health problems after the onset of the pandemic, but vulnerable Veterans were not disproportionately affected and had better mental health resilience (i.e., for depression and anxiety) as the pandemic progressed compared to CTL. This effect could be due to the availability and utilization of VA services for PSY and RHV (e.g., housing and financial support, medical and mental health services), which may have helped to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Wynn, Jonathan K; McCleery, Amanda; Novacek, Derek; Reavis, Eric A; Tsai, Jack; Green, Michael F",J Psychiatr Res,300,14

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in humans leads to increased mortality rates due to alterations of significant pathways, including some resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses linked to the ""cytokine storm"" and extensive lung pathology, as well as being linked to a number of comorbidities. Our current study compared five SARS-CoV-2 sequences from different geographical regions to those from SARS, MERS and two cold viruses, OC43 and 229E, to identify the presence of miR-like sequences. We identified seven key miRs, which highlight considerable differences between the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, compared with the other viruses. The level of conservation between the five SARS-CoV-2 sequences was identical but poor compared with the other sequences, with SARS showing the highest degree of conservation. This decrease in similarity could result in reduced levels of transcriptional control, as well as a change in the physiological effect of the virus and associated host-pathogen responses. MERS and the milder symptom viruses showed greater differences and even significant sequence gaps. This divergence away from the SARS-CoV-2 sequences broadly mirrors the phylogenetic relationships obtained from the whole-genome alignments. Therefore, patterns of mutation, occurring during sequence divergence from the longer established human viruses to the more recent ones, may have led to the emergence of sequence motifs that can be related directly to the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we identified 7 key-microRNAs (miRs 8066, 5197, 3611, 3934-3p, 1307-3p, 3691-3p, 1468-5p) with significant links to KEGG pathways linked to viral pathogenicity and host responses. According to Bioproject data (PRJNA615032), SARS-CoV-2 mediated transcriptomic alterations were similar to the target pathways of the selected 7 miRs identified in our study. This mechanism could have considerable significance in determining the symptom spectrum of future potential pandemics. KEGG pathway analysis revealed a number of critical pathways linked to the seven identified miRs that may provide insight into the interplay between the virus and comorbidities. Based on our reported findings, miRNAs may constitute potential and effective therapeutic approaches in COVID-19 and its pathological consequences.","Arisan, Elif Damla; Dart, Alwyn; Grant, Guy H; Arisan, Serdar; Cuhadaroglu, Songul; Lange, Sigrun; Uysal-Onganer, Pinar",Viruses,300,24

A nutrition survey in Greece,18.825521,3.5545635,2021,"Importance: There is limited information about the clinical course and viral load in asymptomatic patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Objective: To quantitatively describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular viral shedding in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: A retrospective evaluation was conducted for a cohort of 303 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 6 and March 26, 2020. Participants were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea. Main Outcomes and Measures: Epidemiologic, demographic, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Attending health care personnel carefully identified patients' symptoms during isolation. The decision to release an individual from isolation was based on the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharynx and oropharynx swab) and lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) for SARS-CoV-2. This testing was performed on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of isolation. On days 10, 17, 18, and 19, RT-PCR assays from the upper or lower respiratory tract were performed at physician discretion. Cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection were determined in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Results: Of the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median (interquartile range) age was 25 (22-36) years, and 201 (66.3%) were women. Only 12 (3.9%) patients had comorbidities (10 had hypertension, 1 had cancer, and 1 had asthma). Among the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 193 (63.7%) were symptomatic at the time of isolation. Of the 110 (36.3%) asymptomatic patients, 21 (19.1%) developed symptoms during isolation. The median (interquartile range) interval of time from detection of SARS-CoV-2 to symptom onset in presymptomatic patients was 15 (13-20) days. The proportions of participants with a negative conversion at day 14 and day 21 from diagnosis were 33.7% and 75.2%, respectively, in asymptomatic patients and 29.6% and 69.9%, respectively, in symptomatic patients (including presymptomatic patients). The median (SE) time from diagnosis to the first negative conversion was 17 (1.07) days for asymptomatic patients and 19.5 (0.63) days for symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (P = .07). The Ct values for the envelope (env) gene from lower respiratory tract specimens showed that viral loads in asymptomatic patients from diagnosis to discharge tended to decrease more slowly in the time interaction trend than those in symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (ß = -0.065 [SE, 0.023]; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea, the Ct values in asymptomatic patients were similar to those in symptomatic patients. Isolation of asymptomatic patients may be necessary to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Lee, Seungjae; Kim, Tark; Lee, Eunjung; Lee, Cheolgu; Kim, Hojung; Rhee, Heejeong; Park, Se Yoon; Son, Hyo-Ju; Yu, Shinae; Park, Jung Wan; Choo, Eun Ju; Park, Suyeon; Loeb, Mark; Kim, Tae Hyong",JAMA intern. med.

The study uses a self-reported approach of undergraduate students in Spain (n = 337), forced to follow their academic life by using technology comprehensively because of social distancing, as a public health action necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The analysis, based on the exploration of a system of archetypes of the use of social networks, presents insights into contemporary technostress management as a new approach that can suppose opportunities for the optimization of prevention plans. Pearson's correlation coefficients and structural equation modeling based on partial least squares (SEM-PLS) were the methods used for achieving the goals. The results reveal valid and reliable measures where technostress has a high impact on the individual sphere of students and there is a significant relationship between the type of user and techno-anxiety. The conclusions point to the imperative for developing a deeper understanding of technostress by archetypes, in both a higher education context (as antecedent) and the world of work, in an irreversible move towards a digital economy.","González-López, Óscar R; Buenadicha-Mateos, María; Sánchez-Hernández, M Isabel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,16

The model describes the spatio-temporal spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and aims to capture dynamics also based on human habits and geographical features. To test the model, we compare the outputs generated by a finite-element solver with measured data over the Italian region of Lombardy, which has been heavily impacted by this crisis between February and April 2020. Our results show a strong qualitative agreement between the simulated forecast of the spatio-temporal COVID-19 spread in Lombardy and epidemiological data collected at the municipality level. Additional simulations exploring alternative scenarios for the relaxation of lockdown restrictions suggest that reopening strategies should account for local population densities and the specific dynamics of the contagion. Thus, we argue that data-driven simulations of our model could ultimately inform health authorities to design effective pandemic-arresting measures and anticipate the geographical allocation of crucial medical resources.","Viguerie, Alex; Lorenzo, Guillermo; Auricchio, Ferdinando; Baroli, Davide; Hughes, Thomas J.R.; Patton, Alessia; Reali, Alessandro; Yankeelov, Thomas E.; Veneziani, Alessandro",Appl Math Lett,300,0

In addition, the present biologically permeable second near-infrared (NIR-II) light-induced nanocomplexes photo-thermally trigger calcium influx into target cells overexpressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid family type 2 (TRPV2). This combination of nanomaterial design and genetic engineering effectively eliminates cancer cells and suppresses stemness of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

In this review article, we will provide a unifying hypothesis for a homeostatic response to airway inflammation that mitigates oxidative stress and thereby provides resilience to ASM. Previous studies have shown that acute exposure to TNF&#945; increases ASM force generation in response to muscarinic stimulation (hyper-reactivity) resulting in increased ATP consumption and increased tension cost. To meet this increased energetic demand, mitochondrial O2 consumption and oxidative phosphorylation increases but at the cost of increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (oxidative stress). TNF&#945;-induced oxidative stress results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of ASM. In the ER, TNF&#945; selectively phosphorylates inositol-requiring enzyme 1 alpha (pIRE1&#945;) triggering downstream splicing of the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s); thus, activating the pIRE1&#945;/XBP1s ER stress pathway. Protein unfolding in mitochondria also triggers an unfolded protein response (mtUPR). In our conceptual framework, we hypothesize that activation of these pathways is homeostatically directed towards mitochondrial remodeling via an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1&#945;) expression, which in turn triggers: (1) mitochondrial fragmentation (increased dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) and reduced mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) expression) and mitophagy (activation of the Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin mitophagy pathway) to improve mitochondrial quality; (2) reduced Mfn2 also results in a disruption of mitochondrial tethering to the ER and reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ influx; and (3) mitochondrial biogenesis and increased mitochondrial volume density. The homeostatic remodeling of mitochondria results in more efficient O2 consumption and oxidative phosphorylation and reduced ROS formation by individual mitochondrion, while still meeting the increased ATP demand. Thus, the energetic load of hyper-reactivity is shared across the mitochondrial pool within ASM cells.","Dasgupta, Debanjali; Delmotte, Philippe; Sieck, Gary C",Int. j. mol. sci. (Online),300,30

KSA started introducing decisive social distancing measures early before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Kingdom. These ranged from suspension or cancelations of religious, entertainment and sporting mass gatherings and events such as the Umrah, temporary closure of educational establishments and mosques and postponing all non-essential gatherings, to imposing a curfew. These measures were taken in spite of their socio-economic, political and religious challenges in the interest of public and global health.

Ongoing COVID-19 challenges for private psychiatry in Australia,18.784136,3.9483602,2020,"BACKGROUND: Burnout is an occupational syndrome that leads to mental health problems, job turnover, and patient safety events. Those caring for critically ill patients are especially susceptible due to high patient mortality, long hours, and regular encounters with trauma and ethical issues. Interventions to prevent burnout in this population are needed. Preliminary studies suggest debriefing sessions may reduce burnout. This study aims to assess whether participation in regular debriefing can prevent burnout in intensive care unit (ICU) clinicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial will be conducted in two large academic medical centers. Two hundred ICU clinicians will be recruited with target enrollment of 100 physicians and 100 non-physicians (nurses, pharmacists, therapists). Participants must have worked in the ICU for the equivalent of at least 1 full time work week in the preceding 4 weeks. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to virtually attend biweekly debriefing sessions facilitated by a psychotherapist for 3 months or to a control arm without sessions. Our debriefs are modeled after Death Cafés, which are informal discussions focusing on death, dying, loss, grief, and illness. These sessions allow for reflection on distressing events and offer community and collaboration among hospital employees outside of work. The primary outcome is clinician burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) Score. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), respectively. Questionnaires will be administered prior to the intervention, at 1 month, at 3 months, and at 6 months after enrollment. These values will be compared between groups temporally. Qualitative feedback will also be collected and analyzed. DISCUSSION: With ICU clinician burnout rates exceeding 50%, Death Café debriefing sessions may prove to be an effective tool to avert this debilitating syndrome. With COVID-19 limiting social interactions and overloading ICUs worldwide, the virtual administration of the Death Café for ICU clinicians provides an innovative strategy to potentially mitigate burnout in this vulnerable population.

As we can see in [1] a generalized logistic equation captures both the peaks of the total infected and the deaths. In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7, the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries. We think that this trend could be useful for a future epidemic of this coronavirus.","Martelloni, Gabriele; Martelloni, Gianluca",Chaos Solitons Fractals,300,1

This caused a series of interrelated consequences that not only prevent or slow down the spread of disease, but also impact the medical systems' capability to treat the patients and help their recovery. In particular, steeply growing demand for medical safety goods cannot be satisfied by regular suppliers due to the shortage of raw materials originating from other countries or remotely located national sources, under conditions of quarantined manpower. The current context inevitably brings back memories (and records!) of the situation 80 years ago, when WWII necessitated major effort directed at the rapid build-up of low-cost mass production to satisfy all aspects of war-time need. In the present short report we document a successful case of fast mass-production of light transparent medical safety face shields (thousands per day) realized in Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) at Fablab and Machine Shop Shared Facility (Skoltech FabLab). The demand for safety face shields by tens of hospitals in Moscow and other cities rapidly ramped up due to the need to protect medical staff during patient collection and transportation to hospitals, and within both the infected (""red"") and uninfected (""green"") zones. Materials selection for sterilizable transparent materials was conducted based on the analysis of merit indices, namely, minimal weight at given stiffness and minimal cost at given stiffness. Due to the need for permanent wear, design was motivated by low weight and comfortable head fixation, along with high production efficiency. The selection of minimal tooling in University fabrication workshops and the use of distributed volunteer labor are discussed.","Kalyaev, Vladimir; Salimon, Alexey I; Korsunsky, Alexander M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,6

METHOD: A simulated suspected COVID-19 case was designed on the basis of a real patient. The simulation included: pre­ and post-simulation surveys, a PowerPoint presentation, simulation practice, debriefing and reflection. Improvement in survey outcomes was assessed using a paired t-test. RESULTS: A total of 25 trainees participated in the simulation, consisting of first-, second- and third-year family medicine residents. Significant improvement was observed in their knowledge of COVID-19, and sub-analysis showed that all three grades of residents improved their knowledge significantly. Ninety-six per cent of participants believed the simulation was very helpful. DISCUSSION: The simulation scenario improves crisis management skills for family physicians managing the high risk of transmission of respiratory infectious diseases. Higher-order learning outcomes will be explored in future training programs.","Shi, Dandan; Lu, Hong; Wang, Haiyuan; Bao, Shisan; Qian, Lingmei; Dong, Xiaoyan; Tao, Kun; Xu, Zhongqing",Aust J Gen Pract,300,24

This study aims to quantify pneumonia lesions by computed tomography (CT) in the early days to predict progression to severe illness in a cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included confirmed COVID-19 patients. Three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions were automatically calculated using artificial intelligence algorithms, representing the percentages of ground-glass opacity volume (PGV), semi-consolidation volume (PSV), and consolidation volume (PCV) in both lungs. CT features, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and d-dimer, on day 0 (hospital admission) and day 4, were collected to predict the occurrence of severe illness within a 28-day follow-up using both logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: We included 134 patients, of whom 19 (14.2%) developed any severe illness. CT features on day 0 and day 4, as well as their changes from day 0 to day 4, showed predictive capability. Changes in CT features from day 0 to day 4 performed the best in the prediction (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87~0.99; C-index=0.88, 95% CI 0.81~0.95). The hazard ratios of PGV and PCV were 1.39 (95% CI 1.05~1.84, P=0.023) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.17~2.38, P=0.005), respectively. CT features, adjusted for age and gender, on day 4 and in terms of changes from day 0 to day 4 outperformed APACHE-II, NLR, and d-dimer. Conclusions: CT quantification of pneumonia lesions can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness, providing a promising prognostic indicator for clinical management of COVID-19.","Liu, Fengjun; Zhang, Qi; Huang, Chao; Shi, Chunzi; Wang, Lin; Shi, Nannan; Fang, Cong; Shan, Fei; Mei, Xue; Shi, Jing; Song, Fengxiang; Yang, Zhongcheng; Ding, Zezhen; Su, Xiaoming; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhu, Tongyu; Zhang, Zhiyong; Shi, Lei; Shi, Yuxin",Theranostics,300,28

Through an appropriate combination of the momentum equation with the rheological model for Maxwell fluids, an hyperbolic partial differential equation is obtained and semi-analytically solved by using the Laplace transform method to describe the velocity field. In the solution process, different electrostatic conditions and electro-viscous stresses have to be considered in the liquid-liquid interfaces due to the transported fluids content buffer solutions based on symmetrical electrolytes. By adopting a dimensionless mathematical model for the governing and constitutive equations, certain dimensionless parameters that control the start-up of electroosmotic flow appear, as the viscosity ratios, dielectric permittivity ratios, the density ratios, the relaxation times, the electrokinetic parameters and the potential differences. In the results, it is shown that the velocity exhibits an oscillatory behavior in the transient regime as a consequence of the competition between the viscous and elastic forces; also, the flow field is affected by the electrostatic conditions at the liquid-liquid interfaces, producing steep velocity gradients, and finally, the time to reach the steady-state is strongly dependent on the relaxation times, viscosity ratios and the number of fluid layers.","Escandón, Juan; Torres, David; Hernández, Clara; Vargas, René",,300,20

In order to understand how each country is impacted by the virus compared with what would have been expected prior to the pandemic and the mortality risk on a global scale, a multi-factor weighted spatial analysis is presented. Method: A number of key developmental indicators across three main categories of demographics, economy, and health infrastructure were used, supplemented with a range of dynamic indicators associated with COVID-19 as independent variables. Using normalised COVID-19 mortality on 13 May 2020 as a dependent variable, a linear regression (N = 153 countries) was performed to assess the predictive power of the various indicators. Results: The results of the assessment show that when in combination, dynamic and static indicators have higher predictive power to explain risk variation in COVID-19 mortality compared with static indicators alone. Furthermore, as of 13 May 2020 most countries were at a similar or lower risk level than what would have been expected pre-COVID, with only 44/153 countries experiencing a more than 20% increase in mortality risk. The ratio of elderly emerges as a strong predictor but it would be worthwhile to consider it in light of the family makeup of individual countries. Conclusion: In conclusion, future avenues of data acquisition related to COVID-19 are suggested. The paper concludes by discussing the ability of various factors to explain COVID-19 mortality risk. The ratio of elderly in combination with the dynamic variables associated with COVID-19 emerge as more significant risk predictors in comparison to socio-economic and demographic indicators.","Arsalan, Mudassar; Mubin, Omar; Alnajjar, Fady; Alsinglawi, Belal",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,16

For the first time, the impact of different dissociation species (cationic, zwitterionic and anionic forms) of ciprofloxacin (CIP) on its photocatalytic transformation fate was systematically studied in a UVA/LED/TiO2 system. The dissociation forms of CIP at different pH affected the photocatalytic degradation kinetics, transformation products (TPs) formation as well as degradation pathways. Zwitterionic form of CIP exhibited the highest degradation rate constant (0.2217 ± 0.0179 min-1), removal efficiency of total organic carbon (TOC) and release of fluoride ion (F-). Time-dependent evolution profiles on TPs revealed that the cationic and anionic forms of CIP mainly underwent piperazine ring dealkylation, while zwitterionic CIP primarily proceeded through defluorination and piperazine ring oxidation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculation based on Fukui index well interpreted the active sites of different CIP species. Potential energy surface (PES) analysis further elucidated the reaction transition state (TS) evolution and energy barrier (&#916;Eb) for CIP with different dissociation species after radical attack.

It was drawn to our group's attention that healthcare workers (HCWs) had a lower mortality rate against higher COVID-19 incidence compared to the general population in Turkey. Since risk of exposure to tuberculosis bacillus among healthcare workers are higher than the population, we aimed to investigate if there is a relationship between BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history with COVID-19 severity in infected HCWs. This study was conducted with 465 infected HCWs from thirty-three hospitals to assess the relationship between COVID-19 severity (according to their hospitalization status and the presence of radiological pneumonia) and BCG and Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure history. HCWs who required hospital admission had significantly higher rates of chronic diseases, radiological pneumonia, and longer working hours in the clinics. Higher rates of history of contact and care to tuberculosis patients, history of tuberculosis, and BCG vaccine were observed in hospitalized HCWs. HCWs who had radiological pneumonia had a significantly increased ratio of history of care to tuberculosis patients and a higher family history of tuberculosis. The findings from our study suggest that the lower mortality rate despite the more severe disease course seen in infected HCWs might be due to frequent exposure to tuberculosis bacillus and the mortality-reducing effects of the BCG vaccine.","Torun, Serife; Ozkaya, Sevket; Sen, Nazan; Kanat, Fikret; Karaman, Irem; Yosunkaya, Sebnem; Sengoren Dikis, Ozlem; Asan, Ali; Aydogan Eroglu, Selma; Semih Atal, Sefa; Ayten, Omer; Aksel, Nimet; Ermis, Hilal; Özçelik, Neslihan; Demirelli, Meryem; Kara, Iskender; Sümer, Sua; Marakoglu, Kamile; Üzer, Fatih; Uyar, Yasin; Çiçek, Tuba; E Ünsal, Zuhal; Vatansev, Husamettin; Botan Yildirim, Berna; Kuruoglu, Tuba; Atilla, Aynur; Ersoy, Yasemin; Kandemir, Bahar; Durduran, Yasemin; Goksin Cihan, Fatma; Demirbas, Nur; Yildirim, Fatma; Tatar, Dursun; Akcay, M Sule",Pathog Glob Health,300,16

METHODS: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" Madrid, Spain. RESULTS: Three patients (2 men and 1 woman, aged 63-88 years) presented with mild hypersomnia and generalized myoclonus following the onset of the so-called inflammatory phase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All of them had presented previously with anosmia. Myoclonus was generalized with both positive and negative jerks, predominantly involving the facial, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, and upper extremities muscles. These myoclonic jerks occurred spontaneously and were extremely sensitive to multisensory stimuli (auditive and tactile) or voluntary movements, with an exaggerated startle response. Other causes of myoclonus were ruled out, and none of the patients had undergone respiratory arrest or significant prolonged hypoxia. All of them improved, at least partially, with immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our 3 cases highlight the occurrence of myoclonus during the COVID-19 pandemic as a post- or para-infectious immune-mediated disorder. However, we cannot rule out that SARS-CoV-2 may spread transneuronally to first- and second-order structures connected with the olfactory bulb. Further investigation is required to clarify the full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms and optimal treatment.","Rábano-Suárez, Pablo; Bermejo-Guerrero, Laura; Méndez-Guerrero, Antonio; Parra-Serrano, Javier; Toledo-Alfocea, Daniel; Sánchez-Tejerina, Daniel; Santos-Fernández, Teresa; Folgueira-López, María Dolores; Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez, Judit; Ayuso-García, Blanca; González de la Aleja, Jesús; Benito-León, Julián",Neurology,300,0

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained testicular torsion database was performed. Patients <= 18 years of age evaluated in our emergency room between 3/11/2020 to 10/1/2020 (during-COVID-19) and the same period in 2018 and 2019 (pre-COVID-19) with US diagnosed and OR confirmed testicular torsion were included. Basic demographics, timing of presentation, referral rate, time to OR and orchiectomy rate were extracted and compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 82 torsions were included in the study;55 pre-COVID-19 and 27 during-COVID-19. The incidence of testicular torsion remained the same;3.93 cases/month pre-COVID-19 versus 3.86 cases/month during-COVID-19 (p = 0.791). However, there were significantly fewer delayed (> 24 hours) presentations (11.1% versus 45.5% , p = 0.003), shorter time from onset of symptoms to presentation (median 15.5 hours versus 8 hours, p = 0.001), and a lower but not statistically significant overall orchiectomy rate (33.3% versus 50.9% p = 0.1608) during-COVID-19. Among those presenting acutely with torsion (< 24 hours from onset), no statistical differences were found in the median time from US diagnosis to OR, from ED to OR, referral rate, or orchiectomy rate between the two groups. Lastly, SARS-CoV2 testing did not delay median time from ED to OR. CONCLUSIONS: There was a notably less delayed presentation of testicular torsion and shorter ischemia time on presentation during-COVID, however, no significant change of time to OR or orchiectomy rate in those with acute testicular torsion were observed.","Lee, A.

Hemadsorption cartridges may have a potential role in treatment of cytokine storm associated with the development of severe Covid-19. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the case records of patients with severe Covid-19 receiving adjunctive hemadsorption (HA) in our ICU. We analyzed inflammatory biomarkers pre- and post- HA. RESULTS: Fifteen patients received HA during the study period. All were intubated, ventilated and required renal replacement therapy. 11/15 were supported on ECMO. Mean ferritin 2652 (±3286) ng/ml, mean CRP 154 (±92) mg/ml, median D-dimer 3071 (±2689) ng/ml, mean troponin 236 (±461) ng/L. We found significant difference in pre-and post- treatment ferritin 3622 ng/ml versus 1682 ng/ml (p = 0.022), CRP 222 mg/ml versus 103 mg/ml (p = 0.008, 95% CI 22.4-126.5), lactate 2 mmol/L versus 1.3 mmol/L (p = 0.017), and procalcitonin 15.3 ng/ml versus 4.2 ng/ml (p = 0.023). No significant difference in pre- and post- treatment IL-6 14 pg/ml versus 43 pg/ml (p = 0.32), IL-10 3.4 pg/ml versus 2.6 pg/ml (p = 0.31), IL1 ß 0.37 pg/ml versus 0.77 pg/ml (p = 0.75), TNF &#945; 12.77 pg/ml versus 12.49 pg/ml (p = 0.75), VIS 10.04 versus 6.01 (p = 0.31, 95% CI 5.98-17.16) was seen. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HA as adjunctive treatment in a critically unwell group of COVID-19 patients lead to a reduction in ferritin, CRP, procalcitonin and lactate with no significant change in other parameters.

Currently, there is no published evidence or case reports noting anosmia or ageusia as symptoms of COVID-19. Nevertheless, experts in rhinology have suggested that the onset of such symptoms could either act as a trigger for testing for the disease where possible, or could be a new criterion to self-isolate.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of masks and other preventive behaviours in adults aged &#8805;18 years was conducted in five cities: Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; London, UK; and Phoenix and New York, USA. Data were analysed according to the epidemiology of COVID-19, mask mandates and a range of predictors of mask wearing. RESULTS: The most common measures used were avoiding public areas (80.4%), hand hygiene (76.4%), wearing masks (71.8%) and distancing (67.6%). Over 40% of people avoided medical facilities. These measures decreased from March-July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was associated with younger age, low perceived severity of COVID-19 and declining COVID-19 prevalence. Predictors of mask wearing were location (US, UK), mandates, age <50 years, education, having symptoms and knowing someone with COVID-19. Negative experiences with mask wearing and low perceived severity of COVID-19 reduced mask wearing. Most respondents (98%) believed that hand washing and distancing were necessary, and 80% reported no change or stricter adherence to these measures when wearing masks. CONCLUSION: Pandemic mitigation measures were widely reported across all cities, but decreased between March and July 2020. Pandemic fatigue was more common in younger people. Cities with mandates had higher rates of mask wearing. Promotion of mask use for older people may be useful. Masks did not result in a reduction of other hygiene measures.","MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Nguyen, Phi-Yen; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad; Trent, Mallory; Gerber, Brian; Steinhofel, Kathleen; Seale, Holly",Int J Infect Dis,300,1

Alternatively, utilization of old drugs or available medicine that can suppress the viral activity or replication may provide an urgent solution to suppress the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV. Andrographolide is a highly abundant natural product of the medicinal plant, Andrographis paniculata, which has been clinically used for inflammatory diseases and anti-viral therapy. We herein demonstrate that both andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative, the nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated andrographolide (Andro- NBD), suppressed the main protease (Mpro) activities of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, Andro-NBD was shown to covalently link its fluorescence to these proteases. Further mass spectrometry (MS) analysis suggests that andrographolide formed a covalent bond with the active site Cys145 of either 2019-nCoV Mpro or SARS-CoV Mpro. Consistently, molecular modeling analysis supported the docking of andrographolide within the catalytic pockets of both viral Mpros. Considering that andrographolide is used in clinical practice with acceptable safety and its diverse pharmacological activities that could be beneficial for attenuating COVID-19 symptoms, extensive investigation of andrographolide on the suppression of 2019-nCoV as well as its application in COVID-19 therapy is suggested.","Shi, Tzu-Hau; Huang, Yi-Long; Chen, Chiao-Che; Pi, Wen-Chieh; Hsu, Yu-Ling; Lo, Lee-Chiang; Chen, Wei-Yi; Fu, Shu-Ling; Lin, Chao-Hsiung",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,300,16

The ACE2 levels were recorded at 0 days, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days after a high-fat diet, and they increased at 14 days after high-fat diet initiation. In addition, triglyceride levels were also significantly increased at 14 days after high-fat diet initiation, but body weight was not changed. Furthermore, we examined the ACE2 levels in Calu3 cells (a lung cancer cell line) after triglyceride treatment, and the results indicated that ACE2 levels were increased at 25 μM and reached their peak at 200 μM. Finally, we found that the mRNA level of mthfd1 was significantly increased in the high-fat diet group.

METHODS: Information on individual hospitalizations related to the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic were accessed from Statistics Netherlands. The influenza cases were stratified between non-carnival and carnival regions. Distributions of influenza cases were plotted with time and compared between regions. A similar investigation in the early outbreak of COVID-19 was also conducted using open data from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics between non-carnival and carnival regions were broadly similar. There were 13,836 influenza-related hospitalizations in the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic, and carnival fell about 1 week before the peak of these hospitalizations. The distributions of new influenza-related hospitalizations per 100,000 inhabitants with time between regions followed the same pattern with a surge of new cases in the carnival region about 1 week after carnival, which did not occur in the non-carnival region. The increase of new cases for COVID-19 in the carnival region exceeded that in the non-carnival region about 1 week after the first case was reported, but these results warrant caution as for COVID-19 there were no cases reported before the carnival and social measures were introduced shortly after carnival.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, most practitioners worldwide had to turn to teletherapy. US psychoanalytic practitioners were more negative towards teletherapy than those from other theoretical orientations. We predicted that CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners would be more prepared for teletherapy services during the pandemic, since they their training and treatment had been on-line. METHOD: We compared survey results from 164 CAPA practitioners with 165 US psychoanalytic practitioners (matched for age) who had recently psychoanalytically treated a patient on-line. CAPA participants were recruited from CAPA email lists and the US sample were recruited from the Society for Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychology of the American Psychological Association, the American Psychoanalytic Association and International Psychotherapy Institute. RESULTS: CAPA practitioners as compared to US psychoanalytic practitioners had more positive opinions about teletherapy before the pandemic; had more positive opinions about teletherapy during the pandemic; and had more positive opinions about the effectiveness of teletherapy in working with transference, relational issues and resistance. The CAPA practitioners were more prepared to do psychoanalytic psychotherapy during the pandemic than the US psychoanalytic practitioners.

For this information to be propagated through cell cycles, parental histones and their PTMs need to be maintained at the same genomic locations. Yet, during DNA replication, every nucleosome in the genome is disrupted to allow passage of the replisome. Recent data have identified histone chaperone activities that are intrinsic components of the replisome and implicate them in maintaining parental histones during DNA replication. We propose that structural and kinetic coordination between DNA replication and replisome-associated histone chaperone activities ensures positional inheritance of histones and their PTMs. When this coordination is perturbed, histones may instead be recycled to random genomic locations by alternative histone chaperones.","Francis, Nicole J; Sihou, Djamouna",Trends biochem. sci,300,11

First, all patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort or a validation cohort. By univariate analysis of the training cohort, we developed combination scores and screened the superior score for predicting the prognosis. Subsequently, we identified the independent factors influencing prognosis. Finally, we demonstrated the predictive efficiency of the score in validation cohort.A total of 145 patients were enrolled. In the training cohort, nonsurvivors had higher levels of lactic dehydrogenase than survivors. Among the 7 combination scores that were developed, lactic dehydrogenase-lymphocyte ratio (LLR) had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value for predicting prognosis, and it was associated with the incidence of liver injury, renal injury, and higher disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score on admission. Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that C-reactive protein, DIC score &#8805;2 and LLR >345 were the factors associated with prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that only LLR >345 was an independent risk factor for prognosis (odds ratio [OR] = 9.176, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.674-31.487, Pâ<â.001). Lastly, we confirmed that LLR was also an independent risk factor for prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients in the validation cohort where the AUC was 0.857 (95% CI: 0.718-0.997).LLR is an accurate predictive score for poor prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.","Li, Guojun; Xu, Fumin; Yin, Xinru; Wu, Na; Li, Yuanjie; Zhang, Tinghong; Chen, Dongfeng; Liu, Kaijun; Qiu, Qiu",Medicine (Baltimore),300,29

We aimed to investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital in Hangzhou, China. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in XiXi Hospital of Hangzhou from 15 January 2020 to 30 March 2020. We reviewed and analysed the epidemiological, demographic, clinical, radiological, and laboratory features involving these cases. Age-tratification analysis was also implemented. RESULTS: We analysed 96 confirmed cases. The patients had a mean age of 43 years, with six patients younger than 18 years and 14 patients older than 60 years. No significant gender difference was discovered. Co-morbidities were commonly observed in patients aged over 40 years. Twenty eight of the patients had travelled from Wuhan City, and 51 patients were infected through close contact. Familial clusters accounted for 48 of the cases. The mean incubation time was 7 days, and the symptoms were mainly fever, cough, fatigue, and sore throat. Lymphocytopenia was observed predominantly in patients aged over 60 years. Fifty five patients presented with bilateral pulmonary lesions. The radiological changes were typically distributed in the subpleural area, and pleural effusion rarely occurred. All patients were discharged successfully. CONCLUSION: During the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, half of the patients from a designated hospital in Hangzhou City were discovered as familial clusters. Therefore, strict prevention and control measures during self-isolation should be implemented. Patients aged over 60 years who had underlying co-morbidities were prone to lymphocytopenia and severe infection.","Gao, J; Zhang, S; Zhou, K; Zhao, X; Liu, J; Pu, Z",Hong Kong med. j,300,22

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are higher in severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients, but studies have not focused on levels in convalescent patients with MetS, which this study aimed to assess. METHODS: This retrospective study focused on adult convalescent outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 positive serology during the COVID-19 pandemic at NewYork Presbyterian/Weill Cornell. Data collected for descriptive and correlative analysis included SARS-COV-2 IgG levels and history of MetS comorbidities during 4/17/2020-5/20/2020. Additional data, including SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels, Body Mass Index, HbA1c and lipid levels were collected and analyzed for a second cohort during 5/21/2020-6/21/2020. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were measured in a subset of the study cohort. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in convalescent individuals with MetS comorbidities. When adjusted for age, sex, race, and time duration from symptom onset to testing, increased SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels remained significantly associated with obesity (p<0.0001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with HbA1c &#8805;6.5% compared to those with HbA1c <5.7% (p=0.0197) and remained significant on multivariable analysis (p=0.0104). A positive correlation was noted between Body Mass Index (BMI) and antibody levels (95% CI: 0.37 [0.20-0.52] p<0.0001). Neutralizing antibody titers were higher in COVID-19 individuals with BMI &#8805; 30 (p=0.0055).

Absent an effective vaccine, preventive measures used, some of which are being relaxed, have included school closures, restriction of movement, and banning of large gatherings. Our goal was to estimate the association of voter turnout with county-level COVID-19 risks. METHODS: We used publicly available data on voter turnout in the March 10 primary in three states, COVID-19 confirmed cases by day and county, and county-level census data. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to estimate the association of voter turnout with COVID-19 incidence, adjusted for county-level population density and proportions: over age 65 years, female, Black, with college education, with high school education, poor, obese, and smokers. RESULTS: COVID-19 risk was associated with voter turnout, most strongly in Michigan during the week starting 3 days postelection (risk ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.33). For longer periods, the association was progressively weaker (risk ratio 0.98-1.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased absentee-ballot voting in the primary, our results suggest an association of voter turnout in at least one state with a detectable increase in risks associated with and perhaps due to greater exposures related to the primary.","Flanders, W Dana; Flanders, William D; Goodman, Michael",Ann Epidemiol,300,16

This multicentre observational study aimed to establish early surgical outcomes from breast cancer surgery performed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods Data were collected on consecutive patients that underwent breast surgery in four units between 16 March and 24 April 2020. Outcome data at 30 days post-operation were collected, including documented COVID-19 cases in patients and reported cases in healthcare workers directly involved in their care. Recommended modifications to practice to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk, both to patients and healthcare workers in each centre, are described. Results A total of 202 patients underwent surgery in four hospitals delivering breast services in the West Yorkshire region over the six-week period at the peak of the pandemic. The age ranged from 28 to 91 years (median 57, interquartile range, 48-65) with 22% having co-morbidities linked to COVID-19, e.g. diabetes or respiratory disease. No patients presented post-operatively with COVID-19 symptoms and at 30 days there had not been any identified COVID-19 cases. There were no unexpected critical care admissions or deaths. One healthcare worker involved in the delivery of breast surgery was diagnosed with COVID-19 during this time and made an uneventful recovery. Conclusion Breast cancer surgery, in selected groups and with meticulous adherence to measures designed to reduce COVID-19 transmission, does not appear to be associated with elevated risk to patients or healthcare workers.","MacInnes, Emma G; Piper, Jenny; Tait, Catherine; Waterworth, Alison; Achuthan, Raj; Hogan, Brian; McKenzie, Shireen; Turton, Philip; Kim, Baek; Horgan, Kieran",Cureus,300,15

This article addresses how guidance for ophthalmologists on managing patients with retinal disease receiving intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during the pandemic should be adapted to the local epidemic pressure, with more or less stringent measures implemented according to the ebb and flow of the pandemic. METHODS: The Vision Academy's membership of international retinal disease experts analyzed guidance for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 pandemic and graded the recommendations according to three levels of increasing epidemic pressure. The revised recommendations were discussed, refined, and voted on by the 14-member Vision Academy Steering Committee for consensus. RESULTS: Protocols to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19, including use of personal protective equipment, physical distancing, and hygiene measures, should be routinely implemented and intensified according to local infection rates and pressure on the hospital/clinic or healthcare system. In areas with many COVID-19-positive clusters, additional measures including pre-screening of patients, postponement of non-urgent appointments, and simplification of complex intravitreal anti-VEGF regimens should be considered. Treatment prioritization for those at greatest risk of irreversible vision loss should be implemented in areas where COVID-19 cases are increasing exponentially and healthcare resources are strained. CONCLUSION: Consistency in monitoring of local infection rates and adjustment of clinical practice accordingly will be required as we move forward through the COVID-19 era. Ophthalmologists must continue to carefully weigh the risk-benefits to minimize the exposure of patients and healthcare staff to COVID-19, ensure that patients receive sight-saving treatment, and avoid the potential long-term impact of prolonged treatment postponement.","Korobelnik, Jean-François; Loewenstein, Anat; Eldem, Bora; Joussen, Antonia M; Koh, Adrian; Lambrou, George N; Lanzetta, Paolo; Li, Xiaoxin; Lövestam-Adrian, Monica; Navarro, Rafael; Okada, Annabelle A; Pearce, Ian; Rodríguez, Francisco J; Wong, David T; Wu, Lihteh",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,300,26

These forecasts were compared with the observed data from April 2020 to September 2020. The results suggest that the observed numbers of total arrests for vehicle thefts and illegal arms dealing are not significantly different from their predicted values. However, the observed frequency of the total number of arrests for illegal drug trafficking shows a steep upward trend, which is 75% more than that of the expected frequencies.

Most of these models, however, predict concentrations of pollutants following a data-driven approach in which the physical laws that govern their behaviors and relationships remain hidden. With the aid of real-world air quality data collected hourly in different stations throughout Madrid, we present an empirical approach using data-driven techniques with the following goals: (1) Find parsimonious systems of ordinary differential equations via sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) that model the concentration of pollutants and their changes over time; (2) assess the performance and limitations of our models using stability analysis; (3) reconstruct the time series of chemical pollutants not measured in certain stations using delay coordinate embedding results. Our results show that Akaike's Information Criterion can work well in conjunction with best subset regression as to find an equilibrium between sparsity and goodness of fit. We also find that, due to the complexity of the chemical system under study, identifying the dynamics of this system over longer periods of time require higher levels of data filtering and smoothing. Stability analysis for the reconstructed ordinary differential equations (ODEs) reveals that more than half of the physically relevant critical points are saddle points, suggesting that the system is unstable even under the idealized assumption that all environmental conditions are constant over time.","Rubio-Herrero, Javier; Marrero, Carlos Ortiz; Fan, Wai-Tong Louis",,300,4

This implies compliance with key performance indicators (KPIs) required by applications. Key performance indicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip time, and video delay. They depend on the end-to-end connection between the server and the end-user device. For VHC networks, Telco operators must provide the required application quality. Moreover, they must meet the objectives of economic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve the above objectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks without considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main contribution of this paper concerns the definition of a deployment framework to address performance and cost issues for VHC networks. We show three actions on which it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video compression. Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial intelligence algorithms for line stabilization. Third, reduce latency (i.e., round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual application of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the ultra-broadband""trap""of the access network, as defined in the paper. We propose to work on end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth utilization ratio. This leads to a better performance experienced by the end-user. It also allows a Telco operator to create new business models and obtain new revenue streams at a sustainable cost. To give a clear example, we describe how to realize mobile virtual and augmented reality, which is one of the most challenging future services.","Vatalaro, Francesco; Ciccarella, Gianfranco",,300,16

In countless approaches worldwide, scientists are using single cell analyses to better understand the significance and variation within different cellular populations, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting has become a major technique for cell isolation in both basic and clinical research. However, majority of available cell sorters are pressurized, droplet-based systems, which apply significant environmental pressure and shear stress to cells during sorting. Recently, the flow cytometry community has become increasingly aware about the potential negative effects this could have on sorted cells and the term ""sorter induced cell stress"" (SICS) has been proposed. However, up to date only a limited number of studies have investigated the effects of cell sorting on cell viability and function. Therefore, solid data on the effects of sheath pressure and nozzle size on survival and function of sorted cells are surprisingly rare. With this in mind, we sorted ""CD4+"" T-cells and ""live"" cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at different sort conditions and analyzed their quality before and after sorting in a series of assays. Here we present our findings in reference to cell viability and cell proliferation following sorting on different instruments (BD FACSAria III SORP and BD FACSJazz), utilizing different nozzle sizes (70 to 100â¯µm) and sheath pressure settings (20 to 70â¯psi). The results show no significant differences in cell viability and proliferation after the different tested sort conditions, but rather differences between individual experiments. These findings are evaluated and their potential significance in cell sorting experiments is discussed.","Pfister, Gerald; Toor, Salman M; Nair, Varun Sasidharan; Elkord, Eyad",J Immunol Methods,300,33

OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of hospitalization (as a marker of severe COVID-19) in patients by smoking status: former, current and never smokers, who tested positive for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV2) at an academic medical center in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in patients with SARS-COV2 between March-1-2020 and January-31-2021 to identify the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 by smoking status. RESULTS: We identified 10216 SARS-COV2-positive patients with complete documentation of smoking habits. Within 14 days of a SARS-COV2 positive test, 1150 (11.2%) patients were admitted and 188 (1.8%) died. Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized from COVID-19 than current or never smokers (21.2% former smokers;7.3% current smokers;10.4% never smokers, p&lt;0.0001). In univariable analysis, former smokers had higher odds of hospitalization from COVID-19 than never smokers (OR 2.31;95% CI 1.94-2.74). This association remained significant when analysis was adjusted for age, race and gender (OR 1.28;95% CI 1.06-1.55), but became non-significant when analysis included Body Mass Index, previous hospitalization and number of comorbidities (OR 1.05;95% CI 0.86-1.29). In contrast, current smokers were less likely than never smokers to be hospitalized due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more former smokers were hospitalized and died from COVID-19 than current or never smokers. This effect is mediated via age and comorbidities in former smokers.","Puebla Neira, D.; Watts, A.; Seashore, J.; Polychronopoulou, E.; Kuo, Y. F.; Sharma, G.",Respiratory Medicine,300,30

We propose that imaginative metaphors help participants make their experience tangible and accessible, identify problematic assumptions, behaviors, as well as resources available to them. Some reported gaining a renewed sense of empowerment. Simultaneously, IME provides an opportunity to collect rich data while co-creating solutions for and with participants. We contribute to calls for embedding social impact in the research design by highlighting the value of IME in gaining deeper access to participants' experiences while supporting them in taking an active role in their situations.

These novel alcoholic beverages were chemically and sensorially characterized for evaluating if the gentian geographic origin influenced bitter and elemental and volatile composition and sensory profiles in the final products. For that, the chemical fingerprint of gentian powders and wines were carried by headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC), liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (LC-DAD) and inductive coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The mineral and volatile analysis show that the geographic distinction is more obvious in gentian powders compared to gentian macerated wines. Interestingly the maceration process in Chardonnay wine involves extraction processes revealing statistical distinctions in other chemical markers of gentian origin, like for amarogentin and loganic acid or some mineral elements such as barium and aluminum that affect undoubtedly bitterness perception and sensory properties in macerated wines compared to unmacerated wine. Additionally, the gentian volatile 2-methoxy-3-sec-butylpyrazine and the Chardonnay wine volatile ethyl-9-decenoate differentiated, respectively by extraction and powder adsorption mechanisms could be responsible of more subtle sensory differentiations between macerated wines from two distinct gentian origins.","Biehlmann, Manon; Nazaryan, Samvel; Krauss, Emily; Ardeza, Mike Iron; Flahaut, Stéphanie; Figueredo, Gilles; Ballester, Jordi; Lafarge, Céline; Bou-Maroun, Elias; Coelho, Christian",,300,24

PATIENTS OR MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a retrospective study of 46 patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. Venous duplex ultrasound of lower limbs was performed in all patients at Day 0 and Day 5. All patients had antithrombotic-prophylaxis upon admission using low molecular weight heparin with Enoxaparin. Demographics, comorbidities and laboratory parameters were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Elevated AT were reported in 28 patients (61%). 10 had acute VTE events of which eight (17.4%) had aminotransferases disorders. They had been treated with curative Enoxaparin. After a follow-up of 15 and/or 30 days, six of them were controlled, and treated with direct oral anticoagulant (DOACs) after normalization of aminotransferases. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of aminotransferases disorders associated with acute VTE events in patients infected with COVID-19 is significant. The use of DOACs appear pertinent in these patients. Monitoring of the liver balance should therefore be considered at a distance from the acute episode in the perspective of DOACs relay.","Hamadé, Amer; Woehl, Bastien; Talbot, Marjolaine; Bensalah, Naouel; Michel, Pierre; Obringer, Golnaz; Lehn-Hogg, Michèle; Buschenrieder, Nathalie; Issa, Mahdi; Tousch, Jonathan; Stephan, Dominique; Jambert, Lucas",Ann Hepatol,300,29

This randomized, open-label, controlled, phase III trial assessed the efficacy of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for five days in combination with standard care compared to standard care alone in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. Chloroquine 450 mg BID on day 1 and 450 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 or hydroxychloroquine 400 mg BID on day 1 and 400 mg once daily from days 2 to 5 were administered in the intervention group. Patients were enrolled from April 16 to August 06, 2020, in 6 hospitals in southern Brazil. The primary outcome was the clinical status measured on day 14 after randomization with a 9-point ordinal scale. The main secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality; invasive mechanical ventilation use; the incidence of acute renal dysfunction in 28 days; and the clinical status of patients on days 5, 7, 10 and 28. All patients with a positive RT-PCR result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed (modified intention to treat (mITT) population). Arrythmias and cardiovascular complications were assessed as safety outcomes. A total of 105 patients were enrolled and followed for 28 days. The trial was stopped before reaching the planned sample size due to harmful effects. Patients in the intervention group had a worse clinical outcome on the 14th day (odds ratio (OR) 2.45 [1.17 to 4.93], p = 0.016) and on the 28th day (OR 2.47 [1.15 to 5.30], p = 0.020). Moreover, the intervention group had higher incidences of invasive mechanical ventilation use (risk ratio (RR) 2.15 [1.05 to 4.40], p = 0.030) and severe renal dysfunction (KDIGO stage 3) (RR 2.24 [1.01 to 4.99], p = 0.042) until the 28th day of follow-up. No significant arrythmia was noted. In patients with severe COVID-19, the use of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine added to standard treatment resulted in a significant worsening of clinical status, an increased risk of renal dysfunction and an increased need for invasive mechanical ventilation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04420247.

During overstressing circumstances like pandemics, it is important to know how the population, especially special groups, are coping with such a major disaster. Measures and policies which are adopted according to this special patient group can change the quality of care in HIV patients. Health authorities have implemented some policies for elderly and special patient populations. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment, follow-up and lifestyle and behavioral characteristics of HIV patients. Materials and Methods: A phone survey was applied to all HIV patients who were followed regularly in our center. A total of 100 patients were included. The patients were asked about whether there was a disruption in follow-up and treatment. In addition, patient groups with and without anxiety were compared. Results: Education level was higher and the duration of HIV infection was longer in the patient group with anxiety (p=0.01 and p=0.007, respectively). The groups were compared for follow-up disruption. Disruption of follow-up was more frequent in retired, working and student patients (p=0.01). Eighty-five percent stated that they adopted lifestyle and behavioral changes due to COVID-19.

Participants who reported that their opioid use increased after learning about COVID-19, or whose motivation to quit opioids decreased, were more likely to also be engaged in treatment than those whose use or motivation stayed the same. These preliminary findings suggest that there likely is an association between COVID-19, opioid use, and treatment engagement that merits further in-depth investigation.","Parker, Maria A; Agley, Jon; Adams, Zachary W; Villanti, Andrea C",BMC Res Notes,300,16

Excessive inflammation is believed to result in the most severe symptoms and death from this disease. Because treatment options for patients with severe COVID-19 related pulmonary symptoms remain limited, whole-lung low-dose radiation therapy is being evaluated as an anti-inflammatory modality. However, there is concern about the long-term risks associated with low-dose pulmonary irradiation. To help quantify the benefit-risk balance of low-dose radiation therapy for COVID-19, we estimated radiation-induced lifetime risks of both lung cancer and heart disease (major coronary events) for patients of different sexes, treated at ages 50 to 85, with and without other relevant risk factors (cigarette smoking and baseline heart disease risk). METHODS AND MATERIALS: These estimates were generated by combining state-of-the-art radiation risk models for lung cancer and for heart disease together with background lung cancer and heart disease risks and age/sex-dependent survival probabilities for the U.S. RESULTS: Estimated absolute radiation-induced risks were generally higher for lung cancer compared with major coronary events. The highest estimated lifetime radiation-induced lung cancer risks were approximately 6% for female smokers treated between ages 50 and 60. The highest estimated radiation-induced heart disease risks were approximately 3% for males or females with high heart disease risk factors and treated between ages 50 and 60. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated summed lifetime risk of lung cancer and major coronary events reached up to 9% in patients with high baseline risk factors. Predicted lung cancer and heart disease risks were lowest in older nonsmoking patients and patients with few cardiac risk factors. These long-term risk estimates, along with consideration of possible acute reactions, should be useful in assessing the benefit-risk balance for low-dose radiation therapy to treat severe COVID-19 pulmonary symptoms, and suggest that background risk factors, particularly smoking, should be taken into account in such assessments.","Shuryak, Igor; Kachnic, Lisa A; Brenner, David J",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,300,1

We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical testing to determine whether there is any correlation between COVID-19 infection and mortality rates and lifestyles. We used ESRI Tapestry LifeModes data that are collected at the U.S. household level through geodemographic segmentation typically used for marketing purposes to identify consumers' lifestyles and preferences. According to the ANOVA analysis, a significant association between COVID-19 deaths and LifeModes emerged on 1 April 2020 and was sustained until 30 June 2020. Analysis of means (ANOM) was also performed to determine which LifeModes have incidence rates that are significantly above/below the overall mean incidence rate. We sequentially mapped and graphically illustrated when and where each LifeMode had above/below average risk for COVID-19 infection/death on specific dates. A strong northwest-to-south and northeast-to-south gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the United States into several epidemic subregions based on household lifestyle characteristics. Our approach correlating lifestyle characteristics to COVID-19 infection and mortality rate at the U.S. county level provided unique insights into where and when COVID-19 impacted different households. The results suggest that prevention and control policies can be implemented to those specific households exhibiting spatial and temporal pattern of high risk.","Ozdenerol, Esra; Seboly, Jacob",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),300,24

As was demonstrated during Ebola, preparedness is key to limiting a health crisis' spread and impact on health systems and ensuring continued care for vulnerable populations including people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess COVID-19 preparedness and inform interventions to ensure continuity of HIV services at health facilities (HFs) and community service points (CSPs), we conducted site readiness assessments in Freetown, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone. Data were collected at nine high-volume HIV HFs and seven CSPs in April 2020, a month after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. CSPs comprised three community drop-in centers providing HIV counseling and testing services as well as HIV prevention services (e.g., condoms and lubricants) for key and priority populations and four community-based support groups serving PLHIV. At the time of assessment, CSPs did not provide antiretroviral therapy (ART) but were considered potential sites for expansion of differentiated service delivery (DSD)-a client-centered approach to HIV care-in the context of COVID-19. Overall, 5/9 HFs had trained staff on use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and prevention of COVID-19 transmission. Most had access to masks (5/9) and gloves (7/9) for management of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases, and 4/9 HFs had triage procedures for isolation of suspected cases. Conversely, few CSPs had access to masks (2/7) or gloves (2/7) and no staff were trained on PPE use or COVID-19 transmission. 7/9 HFs had adequate ART stock for multi-month dispensing though few had procedures for (3/9) or had trained staff in providing DSD (2/9). Among CSPs where measures were applicable, 2/4 had procedures for DSD, 1/3 had staff trained on DSD and none had adequate ART stock. Identification of gaps in COVID-19 preparedness is a critical step in providing support for infection control and modified service delivery. Findings from this assessment highlight gaps in COVID-19 preparedness measures at sites supporting PLHIV in Sierra Leone and indicate CSPs may require intensive supervision and training to ensure HIV services are uninterrupted while minimizing COVID-19 risk, especially if used as sites to scale up DSD.","Parmley, Lauren E; Hartsough, Kieran; Eleeza, Oliver; Bertin, Akopon; Sesay, Bockarie; Njenga, Amon; Toure, Mame; Egesimba, Ginika; Bah, Haja; Bayoh, Alex; Yakubu, Abdulraheem; Morrison, Ellen A B; Michaels-Strasser, Susan",PLoS One,300,26

We have developed procedures for the standard PRNT, microneutralization assay (MNA) and pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (PNA) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The MNA offers advantages over the PRNT by reducing assay time, allowing increased throughput and reducing operator workload while remaining dependent upon the use of wild-type virus. This ensures that all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigens are present, but Biosafety Level 3 facilities are required. In addition to the advantages of MNA, PNA can be performed with lower biocontainment (Biosafety Level 2 facilities) and allows for further increases in throughput. For each new vaccine, it is critical to ensure good correlation of the neutralizing activity measured using PNA against the PRNT or MNA. These assays have been used in the development and licensure of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca; Oxford University) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and are critical for demonstrating bioequivalence of future vaccines.","Bewley, Kevin R; Coombes, Naomi S; Gagnon, Luc; McInroy, Lorna; Baker, Natalie; Shaik, Imam; St-Jean, Julien R; St-Amant, Natalie; Buttigieg, Karen R; Humphries, Holly E; Godwin, Kerry J; Brunt, Emily; Allen, Lauren; Leung, Stephanie; Brown, Phillip J; Penn, Elizabeth J; Thomas, Kelly; Kulnis, Greg; Hallis, Bassam; Carroll, Miles; Funnell, Simon; Charlton, Sue",Nat.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is also involved and we evaluated these changes in the management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). METHODS: OHCA of medical origins identified from the French National Cardiac Arrest Registry between March 1st and April 31st 2020 (COVID-19 period), were analysed. Different resuscitation characteristics were compared with the same period from the previous year (non-COVID-19 period). RESULTS: Overall, 1005 OHCA during the COVID-19 period and 1620 during the non-COVID-19 period were compared. During the COVID-19 period, bystanders and first aid providers initiated CPR less frequently (49.8% versus 54.9%; difference, - 5.1 percentage points [95% CI, - 9.1 to - 1.2]; and 84.3% vs. 88.7%; difference, - 4.4 percentage points [95% CI, - 7.1 to - 1.6]; respectively) as did mobile medical teams (67.3% vs. 75.0%; difference, - 7.7 percentage points [95% CI, - 11.3 to - 4.1]).

These young people, however, are an often-neglected research population, due in part to perceived challenges associated with their inclusion as well as marginalized communities' justifiable mistrust of research. OBJECTIVES: Based on our experience conducting a school-based randomized intervention trial in Baltimore, Maryland, we present strategies for conducting research with low-income, urban youth of color. We discuss strategies in three domains: university-community partnership development, participant recruitment, and participant retention. METHODS: We reviewed partnership building and recruitment strategies employed by our team across four years of trial implementation and evaluated success of participant retention at our final survey timepoint. RESULTS: Partnership building was facilitated by selection of a study design that maximized benefits for all participants, promotion of capacity building at partner institutions, and attention to research staff hiring and training practices. Effective study recruitment strategies included personal contact with parents and close cooperation between school personnel and study staff. Providing incentives and collecting multiple types of participant contact information contributed to increased retention rates. On average, those who participated in the final survey timepoint were less likely to be male and Latinx and exhibited more favorable baseline mental health than those who did not, suggesting differential attrition based on youth characteristics.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicenter prospective study analyzed the consulting activity of 12 ENT physicians in full-time private practice. The main endpoints were the number, characteristics and conditions of consultations. Secondary endpoints comprised presenting symptoms, diagnosis, prescriptions, adverse effects, and progression of monthly consulting turnover. RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety three consultations were performed during the study period (Appendix 1), with 50% emergency consultations. In 57.9% were face-to-face, 28.4% by phone and 13.7% video. In face-to-face consultation, the physician wore gloves in 53.8% of cases and a mask in 92.2%: surgical mask in 71.6% of cases and FFP2 in 28.4%. The three most frequent symptoms (48.5% of cases) were otalgia, hearing impairment, and vertigo. The three most frequent diagnoses (60.6% of cases) were otitis, intra-auricular foreign body (including wax), and pharyngeal infection. The three most frequently prescribed complementary exams (74.3% of cases) were imaging, hearing work-up, and specialist opinion. The three most frequently prescribed treatments (52.7% of cases) were intra-auricular drops, oral antibiotics, and nasal spray. The incidence of adverse effects was 0.001%. None of the physicians or patients seemed to have been infected by Covid-19 during the study period. There was a 47.3-91% (median, 75.6%) drop in monthly consultation turnover. CONCLUSION: The present study underscored the availability and adaptability of ENT physicians in the Réunion Island in an epidemic context, although economic impact was detrimental.","Rubin, F; Vellin, J-F; Berkaoui, J; Al Assaf, W; Pennica, A; Girard, B; Hoarau, P; Pescatori, P; Dupre, M; Bensoussan, S; Vurpillot, P; Challut, N; Laccourreye, O",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,300,16

Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been particularly affected due to the often-intensive service needs required by this population. As a result, the aim of this review was to examine the evidence base, methodology, and outcomes of studies that have used telehealth for assessment and/or intervention with children and adolescents with ASD as well as their families over the last decade. Further, the goal is to highlight the advances in telehealth and its use with this special population. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken, with 55 studies meeting inclusion criteria and quality analysis. Specified details were extracted from each article, including participant characteristics, technology, measures, methodology/study design, and clinical and implementation outcomes. Services provided via telehealth included diagnostic assessments, preference assessments, early intervention, applied behavior analysis (ABA), functional assessment and functional communication training, and parent training. Findings, although still emerging, encouragingly suggested that services via telehealth were equivalent or better to services face-to-face. Results support the benefits to using telehealth with individuals with ASD. Future research should continue to explore the feasibility of both assessments and interventions via telehealth with those having ASD to make access to assessment services and interventions more feasible for families, while acknowledging the digital divide it could create.","Ellison, Kimberly S; Guidry, Jerrica; Picou, Paige; Adenuga, Paige; Davis, Thompson E",Clin Child Fam Psychol Rev,300,16

Here, we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter HCoV-OC43 strain expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in mice with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS. Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice. Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo. These results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of HCoV-OC43 in the CNS, and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive HCoVs in live mice.","Niu, Junwei; Shen, Liang; Huang, Baoying; Ye, Fei; Zhao, Li; Wang, Huijuan; Deng, Yao; Tan, Wenjie",Antiviral Res,300,24

(NPI) Some scientists questioned these assumptions Regions that followed other softer mitigation strategies such as work from home, crowd limits, use of masks, individual quarantining, basic social-distancing, testing and tracing ? at least in the first wave of infections- saw similar health outcomes Clear results were confusing, complicated and difficult to assess Ultimately, in the US, what kind of mitigation strategy was enforced became a political decision only partly based on scientific models We do not test for what levels of NPI are necessary for appropriate management of the first wave of the pandemic Rather we use the ?inverse-fitting Gompertz function? methodology suggested by anti-lockdown advocate and Nobel Laureate Dr Levitts to estimate the rate of growth/decline in COVID-19 infections as well to determine when disease peaking occurred Our estimates may help predict levels of first wave infections in the future and help a region to monitor new outbreaks prior to opening its economy The inverse fitting function is applied to the first wave of infections in the U S and in the hard hit New York and New Jersey regions for the time period March to June 2020 This is the earliest days of pandemic in the US The estimates for the rates of growth/decline are computed and used to predict underlying future infections, so that decision makers can monitor the disease threat as they open their economies This preliminary and exploratory analysis and findings are discussed briefly and presented primarily in charts and tables but the following waves of disease diffusion are not included and certainly were not anticipated","Haynes, Kingsley E.; Kulkarni, Rajendra",Regional Science Policy &amp; Practice,300,1

However, the LSM suffers from high computational burden and numerical instability, requiring additional regularization terms or re-initialization techniques. In this paper, we use characteristic functions to implicitly represent the contours, propose a new representation to the geodesic active contours and derive an efficient algorithm termed as the iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM). Compared to the LSM, the ICTM is simpler and much more efficient. In addition, the ICTM enjoys most desired features of the level set-based methods. Extensive experiments, on 2D synthetic, 2D ultrasound, 3D CT, and 3D MR images for nodule, organ and lesion segmentation, demonstrate that the proposed method not only obtains comparable or even better segmentation results (compared to the LSM) but also achieves significant acceleration.","Ma, Jun; Wang, Dong; Wang, Xiao-Ping; Yang, Xiaoping",,300,1

No specific studies have been found that evaluate the impact of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pandemic on AA and its surgical management. An analysis was made on the influence of this new pathology on the clinical course of AA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study was conducted on patients operated on for AA from January to April 2020. They were classified according to the time of the appendectomy, before the declaration of the state of alarm (pre-COVID-19), and after its declaration (post-COVID-19) in Spain, one the most affected countries in the world. An evaluation was made of demographic variables, duration of symptoms, type of appendicitis, surgical time, hospital stay, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: The study included 66 patients (41 pre-COVID-19; 25 post-COVID-19) with mean age of 10.7 ± 3 and 9.3 ± 3.1; P = .073, respectively. Fever was found in a higher number of post-COVID-19 patients (52 vs. 19.5%; P = 0.013), as well as a higher CRP (72.7 ± 96.2 vs. 31.3 ± 36.2 mg/dL; P = 0.042). This group presented with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis when compared to pre-COVID-19 (32 vs. 7.3%; P = 0.015). The mean hospital stay was longer in the post-COVID-19 group (5.6 ± 5.9 vs. 3.2 ± 4.3 days; P = 0.041). No differences were found in the time of onset of symptoms or surgical time. CONCLUSIONS: The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic influenced the time of diagnosis of appendicitis, as well as its course, and mean hospital stay. Peritonitis was more frequently seen. As a result of the significant circumstances, delaying diagnosis and treatment of AA during SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, inappropriate management of this common surgical disorder has been noticed.","Velayos, María; Muñoz-Serrano, Antonio Jesús; Estefanía-Fernández, Karla; Sarmiento Caldas, Ma Carmen; Moratilla Lapeña, Lucas; López-Santamaría, Manuel; López-Gutiérrez, Juan Carlos",An Pediatr (Barc),300,26

Countries of the WHO African region have put in place measures for the COVID-19 pandemic containment that may adversely affect blood system activities and subsequently reduce the supply and demand of blood and blood components. This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on blood supply and demand in the WHO African Region and propose measures to address the challenges faced by countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey questionnaire was sent to all 47 countries in the WHO African Region to collect information on blood supply and demand for the first 5 months of 2019 and 2020, respectively, and on COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma therapy in September 2020. RESULTS: Thirty-seven countries provided responses. The total number of blood donations dropped in 32 countries while it increased in five countries. The proportion of blood drives also decreased in 21 countries and increased in nine countries. The blood requested and issued for transfusion decreased for blood demand and for blood issued for transfusion in 30 countries. Ten countries reported some activities of convalescent plasma. However, very few units of this product collected have been transfused to COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a reduction of blood related activities in the region, including the supply and demand. Countries preparedness plans for health emergencies need more emphasis to maintaining blood stock.","Loua, André; Kasilo, Ossy Muganga Julius; Nikiema, Jean Baptiste; Sougou, Aissatou Sarassa; Kniazkov, Stanislav; Annan, Edith Andrews",Vox sang,300,12

Some institutions have started to treat these patients showing encouraging results. To shorten procedure times is crucial for the comfort of symptomatic patients receiving respiratory support and to optimize institutional facilities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At our institution, LD-RT is offered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and signs of early cytokine-released syndrome on behalf of a multicenter study. We designed a coordinated process flow starting from the patient transfer to the simulation CT-scan (first-step), to the end of the LD-RT treatment (last step). The times spent on each step of the process flow were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean age of treated patients was 83 (72-91) years-old. The timing parameters of the first 10 consecutive patients were analyzed. Except for the first (dummy run), patients were managed from the first to the last step in a median of 38 min (25-58, SD 10.67). The most time-consuming sub-process was the contouring of the treatment volumes and dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: LD-RT is not only an encouraging option for COVID-19 pneumonia patients, but a convenient and feasible procedure if performed in a coordinated way by reducing procedure times.","Bonet, M; Vázquez, S; García, E; Visus, M; Jové, D; Ripol, O; Solé, C; Gutiérrez, L; Morales-Rull, J L; Montero, Á; Algara, M; Arenas, M; Mira, M",Clin. transl. oncol.

Four online questionnaires were completed by general population samples from the US and the UK in June 2020 (N = 1198, N = 3890, N = 1663, N = 2237). After controls, all four studies found a positive association between intention to be vaccinated and usage of broadcast and print media. The three studies which operationalised media usage in terms of frequency found no effect for social media. However, the study which operationalised media use in terms of informational reliance found a negative effect for social media. Youth, low household income, female gender, below degree-level of education, and membership of other than white ethnic groups were each also found to be associated with lower intentions to be vaccinated in at least two of the four studies. In all four studies, intention to be vaccinated was positively associated with having voted either for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential elections or for Labour Party candidates in the 2019 UK general election. Neither of the UK studies found an association with having voted for Conservative Party candidates, but both US studies found a negative association between intention to be vaccinated and having voted for Donald Trump. The consistent finding of greater intention to be vaccinated among users of legacy media but not among users of social media suggests that social media do not currently provide an adequate replacement for legacy media, at least in terms of public health communication.

Moreover, studies have yet to focus on key mechanisms of air pollution toxicity such as oxidative stress. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a within-city analysis of spatial variations in COVID-19 incidence and the estimated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lung lining fluid attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). METHODS: Sporadic and outbreak-related COVID-19 case counts, testing data, population and sociodemographic data for 140 neighbourhoods were obtained from the City of Toronto. ROS estimates were based on a mathematical model of ROS generation in lung lining fluid in response to iron and copper in PM2.5. Spatial variations in long-term average ROS were predicted using a land use regression model derived from measurements of iron and copper in PM2.5. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models adjusting for covariates identified using a directed acyclic graph and accounting for spatial autocorrelation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A significant positive association was observed between neighbourhood level ROS and COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio = 1.07, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.15 per interquartile range ROS). Effect modification by neighbourhood-level measures of racialized group membership and socioeconomic status was also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of neighbourhood characteristics associated with COVID-19 incidence can identify inequalities and generate hypotheses for future studies.

In turn, the immune systems of infected populations get updated, chasing viruses even further away. Quantitatively understanding how these dynamics result in observed patterns of rapid pathogen and immune adaptation is instrumental to epidemiological and evolutionary forecasting. Here we present a mathematical theory of co-evolution between immune systems and viruses in a finite-dimensional antigenic space, which describes the cross-reactivity of viral strains and immune systems primed by previous infections. We show the emergence of an antigenic wave that is pushed forward and canalized by cross-reactivity. We obtain analytical results for shape, speed, and angular diffusion of the wave. In particular, we show that viral-immune co-evolution generates a new emergent timescale, the persistence time of the wave's direction in antigenic space, which can be much longer than the coalescence time of the viral population. We compare these dynamics to the observed antigenic turnover of influenza strains, and we discuss how the dimensionality of antigenic space impacts on the predictability of the evolutionary dynamics. Our results provide a concrete and tractable framework to describe pathogen-host co-evolution.","Marchi, Jacopo; Lassig, Michael; Walczak, Aleksandra M.; Mora, Thierry",,300,15

Prior to this, each ECMO centre managed independently around 20 ECMO referrals per month. Early during the pandemic, we recognised the need for a referral system to co-ordinate the anticipated increased number of referrals. We implemented rapidly a referral system with universal access across England. This allowed the five National ECMO centres to manage over 1000 referrals in the first seven weeks of the pandemic. Key benefits of the new system included facilitated communication and collaboration between centres;data on demand;and capacity shared in real-time.

Therefore, predicting post-CABG AF development is important for treatment management. In this study, we investigated the value of the ratio E/(Ea × Sa) as a combined systolic-diastolic index in predicting post-CABG AF development. METHODS: This prospective study included 102 patients who underwent only isolated coronary bypass. Preoperative demographic features, biochemical, and hematological parameters, and the electrocardiographic data of all patients were recorded. The E/(Ea × Sa) indices were calculated from the echocardiographic measurements. Those who retained their postoperative sinus rhythm were defined as group 1, and those who developed AF were defined as group 2. RESULTS: Group 2 had significantly higher lateral (group 1:1.14 ± 0.61 vs. group 2:1.47 ± 0.87; P = .02), medial (group 1:1.61 ± 0.70 vs. group 2:1.99 ± 0.91; P = .02), and mean (group 1:1.30 ± 0.58 vs. group 2:1.62 ± 0.74; P = .001) E/(Ea × Sa) indices than group 1. In the univariate analysis, age, CHA2 DS2 -VASc score, sPAP, IABP use, and mean E/(EaxSa) index were found to be significant predictors of post-CABG AF development. However, only the mean E/(EaxSa) index was found to be a significant predictor of post-CABG AF development in the multivariate analysis (OR: 2.19 95% CI 1.01-5.96; P = .045).

Objective This research tested associations between trait mindfulness and mental health factors related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Methods Two studies (Study 1 N = 248 college students;Study 2 N = 300 U.S adults) assessed trait mindfulness, perceived stress and anxiety, worry about the coronavirus, and anticipated negative affect of a coronavirus diagnosis. Additionally, Study 2 assessed depressive symptoms and coping with the coronavirus. Results In both studies, findings indicated that individuals higher in trait mindfulness reported less stress and anxiety. Higher mindfulness in both studies was also associated with less worry about the virus and anticipating less negative affect if one gets the virus. In Study 2, trait mindfulness was negatively related to depression, and numerous associations between mindfulness and coping emerged, showing higher trait mindfulness was associated with healthier strategies in coping with coronavirus. Conclusions These data are consistent with research that has revealed that those who think and act more mindfully are less stressed and anxious. By revealing these associations with mindfulness in the context of a real-world, novel stressor, this research makes an important contribution to the literature.","Dillard, Amanda J.; Meier, Brian P.",Personality and Individual Differences,300,20

Flagellar motility is seen in various parasitic protozoans, and morphological changes in flagella during the parasite life cycle have been observed. We studied the impact of these changes on motility across life cycle stages, and how such changes might serve to facilitate human infection. We used holographic microscopy to image swimming cells of different Leishmania mexicana life cycle stages in three dimensions. We find that the human-infective (metacyclic promastigote) forms display 'run and tumble' behaviour in the absence of stimulus, reminiscent of bacterial motion, and that they specifically modify swimming direction and speed to target host immune cells in response to a macrophage-derived stimulus. Non-infective (procyclic promastigote) cells swim more slowly, along meandering helical paths. These findings demonstrate adaptation of swimming phenotype and chemotaxis towards human cells.","Findlay, Rachel C; Osman, Mohamed; Spence, Kirstin A; Kaye, Paul M; Walrad, Pegine B; Wilson, Laurence G",eLife (Cambridge),300,33

The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be falsified.","Romana, Ignacio Escanuela",,300,29

The aim of this study was to compare patient-performed testing based on a morning saliva sample with the current standard testing method, healthcare worker-collected sampling via a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). METHODS: This was a prospective single center study which recruited 217 asymptomatic adult male participants in a COVID-19 quarantine center who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 8-10 days prior isolation. Paired NPS and saliva specimens were collected and processed within 5 hours of sample collection. Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting Envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes was performed and the results were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 160 of the 217 (74%) participants tested positive for Covid-19 based on saliva, NPS, or both testing methods. The detection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was higher in saliva compared to NPS testing (93.1%, 149/160 vs 52.5%, 84/160, p<0.001). The concordance between the two tests was 45.6% (virus was detected in both saliva and NPS in 73/160), while 47.5% were discordant (87/160 tested positive for one while negative for the other). The Ct values for E and RdRp genes were significantly lower in saliva specimens compared to NP swab specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that saliva is a better alternative specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Taking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could enable self-collection for an accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing.","Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Zain, Rozainanee; Hashim, Rohaidah; Amran, Fairuz; Kok, Huey Tean; Samad, Md Anuar Abd; Ahmad, Norazah",Clin Infect Dis,300,16

METHODS: The study obtained epidemiological indicators for COVID-19, factors about medical resources and population movement as parameters for the SEIR model and utilized the model to predict the maximum number of infections on a single day at different control levels in Beijing, simulated as an epidemic spreading city and an epidemic outbreak city respectively. The modified two-step floating catchment area method under ArcGIS 10.6 environment was used to analyze spatial accessibility to fever clinics services for the patients in Beijing. RESULTS: According to the results of the SEIR model, the highest number of infections in a single day in Beijing simulated as an epidemic spreading city at low, medium and high levels of prevention and control were 8 514, 183, and 68 cases, the highest number of infections in a single day in Beijing simulated as an outbreak city was 22 803, 10 868 and 3 725 cases, respectively. The following result showed that Beijing was simulated as an epidemic spreading city: among the 585 communities in Beijing, under the low level of prevention and control, there were 17 communities (2.91%) with excellent accessibility to fever clinics, and that of 41 communities (7.01%) with fever clinics was good. Spatial accessibility of fever clinics in 56 communities (9.57%) was ranked average, and 62 communities' (10.60%) accessibility was fair and 409 communities (69.91%) had poor accessibility;at the medium level of prevention and control, only the west region of Fangshan District and Mentougou District, the north region of Yanqing District, Huairou District and Miyun District had poor accessibility;under the high level of prevention and control, 559 communities' (95.56%) had excellent accessibility. The accessibility in 24 communities (4.10%) was good and in 2 communities (0.34%) was average. In brief, the existing fever clinics could meet the common demand. Beijing was simulated as an outbreak city: under the low level of prevention and control, only 1 community (0.17%) had excellent accessibility to fever clinics, and 5 communities (0.86%) had good accessibility. The accessibility of fever clinics in 10 communities (1.71%) was average and in 12 communities (2.05%) was fair. The accessibility of fever clinics in 557 communities (95.21%), nearly all areas of Beijing, was poor;under the middle and high level of prevention and control, the accessibility of ecological conservation areas was also relatively poor. CONCLUSION: The distribution of fever clinic resources in Beijing is uneven. When Beijing is simulated as an epidemic spreading city: under the high level of prevention and control, the number of fever clinics can be appropriately reduced to avoid cross-infection;at the medium level of prevention and control, the fever clinics can basically meet the needs of patients with fever in Beijing, but the accessibility of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas is insufficient, and priority should be given to the construction of fever clinics in public hospitals above the second level in the ecological conservation areas. When the level of prevention and control is low, the accessibility of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas is poor. Priority should be given to the construction of fever clinics in ecological conservation areas, and temporary fever sentinels can be established to relieve the pressure of fever clinics. When Beijing is simulated as an outbreak city and has low prevention and control, due to a large number of infections, it is necessary to upgrade the prevention and control level to reduce the flow of people to curb the development of the epidemic.","Zhang, J.

A general information questionnaire and a stress perception scale were used to investigate and analyze the influencing factors of perceived stress among participants. Perceived stress was at the intermediate level or above for 54.1% (133) of the sample. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that hospital department, living styles, physical conditions, and the proportion of negative (eg, increased deaths and infections) information received about the epidemic (eg, via media and/or face-to-face) influenced perceived stress. Thus, the overall level of perceived stress among clinical pediatric nurses was medium. Nursing managers should pay more attention to and conduct timely assessment interventions for staff to reduce stress levels and promote physical and mental health.","Yan, Mengwei; Xie, Anwei; Cheng, Fangfang; Zhou, Weifang; Tian, Jianmei; Xu, Yunqiu",Holist Nurs Pract,300,16

Smallpox comeback would be possible. Orthomyxoviruses relicts (genus Isavirus) were possibly connected with Ichthya (Silurian - 500-410 million years ago), and then close interaction with Aves (the Cretaceous, 125-110 million years ago) with the division of genera and respiratory transmission (epidemics) between humans (10-2 thousand BC).

These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID-19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID-19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID-19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in 'clean' sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale-up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase. The model discussed is also broadly applicable to providing surgical services during any viral pandemic.","Kasivisvanathan, Ramanathan; Tilney, Henry S; Jhanji, Shaman; O039,; Mahony, Michelle; Gruber, Pascale; Nicol, David; Morgan, Dominic; Kipps, Emma; Rasheed, Shahnawaz",Int. j. health plann. manage,300,23

Drug repurposing could be a promising strategy how to find an appropriate molecule: rapamycin could be one of them. The authors performed a systematic literature review of available studies on the research describing rapamycin in association with COVID-19 infection. Only peer-reviewed English-written articles from the world's acknowledged databases Web of Science, PubMed, Springer and Scopus were involved. Five articles were eventually included in the final analysis. The findings indicate that rapamycin seems to be a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. In addition, it may represent a better candidate for COVID-19 therapy than commonly tested antivirals. It is also likely that its efficiency will not be reduced by the high rate of viral RNA mutation.","Patocka, Jiri; Kuca, Kamil; Oleksak, Patrik; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Valis, Martin; Novotny, Michal; Klimova, Blanka",,300,5

The lack of specific antiviral drugs and the need to develop adequate research for new antiviral drugs capable of treating this new form of the disease undertook three different research paths quickly. The first one is aimed to test antiviral molecules already present in therapeutic use, with a mechanism of an action directed towards viral proteins functional to replication or adsorption; the second one, it is the repositioning of molecules with known pharmacological activity for which various chemistry studies have been prepared in an attempt to find new and specific viral targets; the third, it is the search for molecules of natural origin for which to demonstrate a specific anti-coronavirus activity. Many databases of natural and synthetic substances have been used for the identification of potent inhibitors of various viral targets. The field of computer-aided drug design seems to be promising and useful for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors; hence, different structure- and ligand-based computational approaches have been used for their identification. This review analyzes in-depth and critically the most recent publications in the field of applied computational chemistry to find out molecules of natural origin with potent antiviral activity.

One reason for this is the rapidly increasing number of new infections. On the other hand, the high sickness rates of doctors and nurses, particularly in ENT medicine, are aggravating the situation. Telemedicine can be a useful tool to reduce the number of physician-patient contacts. This could break infection chains and minimize the risk of infection for physicians. METHODS: To prepare the review, a selective literature search was conducted at www.pubmed.com using the relevant English technical terms for telemedicine and ENT. In addition, research was conducted at www.news.google.com on current developments of the COVID-19 pandemic with the search terms ""telemedicine"" and ""COVID-19."" RESULTS: Telemedicine can be helpful in direct contact with patients as well as in the conciliar support of general practitioners. The available studies show that, on average, more than 50% of medical consultations could be carried out telemedically. Both physicians and patients rate the use of telemedicine positively. Neither image quality nor the handling of the technology are relevant obstacles to a reliable diagnosis. Patients indicated that the telemedical consultation did not last longer than a traditional consultation. Patients also highlighted the faster and better availability of medical care through telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine can make a decisive contribution to coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the establishment of telemedicine can help us to become better prepared for future pandemics.","Hagge, Daniel; Knopf, Andreas; Hofauer, Benedikt",HNO,300,24

RESULTS: The pilot test had 43 participants, and the main study had 507. The item content validity index scores ranged from 0.81-1.00, and the scale content validity index for 20 items was 0.95. The factor analysis revealed a three-factor solution. The overall Cronbach's alpha for the final (19-item) version of the tool after item deletion was 0.76. The reliabilities for Subscales 1, 2, and 3 were 0.83, 0.67, and 0.51, respectively.","Albarwani, Saada; Almaskari, Mohammed A; Alalawi, Salwa Saleh; Almaskari, Turkiya Saleh; Alshidi, Amal Said",,300,16

When the epidemic is ongoing, the population can reduce interactions between individuals in order to decrease the rate of transmission of the disease, and thus limit the epidemic. However, this effort comes at a cost for the population. Therefore, the government can put into place incentive policies to encourage the lockdown of the population. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. We provide numerical examples, as well as an extension to a stochastic SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latency period of the COVID-19 disease. The numerical results confirm the relevance of a tax and testing policy to improve the control of an epidemic. More precisely, if a tax policy is put into place, even in the absence of a specific testing policy, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions, thus limiting the spread of the disease. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, so individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.","Hubert, Emma; Mastrolia, Thibaut; Possamai, Dylan; Warin, Xavier",,300,1

First, we derived the basic reproduction number, R0, and estimated the effective reproduction Reff for each country. Second, we were interested in the merits of interventions, either by distancing or by treatment. Results revealed that total and partial containment is effective in reducing the transmission. However, its duration may be long to eradicate the disease (104 days for France). By setting the end of containment as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients). Further, results pointed out that the effective reproduction number remains large after containment. Therefore, testing and isolation are necessary to stop the disease.","Arcede, Jayrold P.; Caga-Anan, Randy L.; Mentuda, Cheryl Q.; Mammeri, Youcef",Math. Model. Nat. Phenom.,300,26

METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a multicentre, observational, nationwide survey to collect data on admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at Italian CCUs throughout a 1 week period during the COVID-19 outbreak, compared with the equivalent week in 2019. We observed a 48.4% reduction in admissions for AMI compared with the equivalent week in 2019 (P < 0.001). The reduction was significant for both ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI; 26.5%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 21.7-32.3; P = 0.009] and non-STEMI (NSTEMI; 65.1%, 95% CI 60.3-70.3; P < 0.001). Among STEMIs, the reduction was higher for women (41.2%; P = 0.011) than men (17.8%; P = 0.191). A similar reduction in AMI admissions was registered in North Italy (52.1%), Central Italy (59.3%), and South Italy (52.1%). The STEMI case fatality rate during the pandemic was substantially increased compared with 2019 [risk ratio (RR) = 3.3, 95% CI 1.7-6.6; P < 0.001].

SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain entry to host cells in the respiratory tract epithelium. Clinical features post viral infection include symptoms of viral pneumonia, fever, cough, chest discomfort, and in severe cases dyspnea and bilateral lung infiltration. Adults with any age are at risk of getting COVID-19, however co-morbidities like hypertension, COPD, smoking, type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity etc. increase infection susceptibility. Modern day therapeutics to control aforementioned health conditions include angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEi), and anti-inflammatory drugs such as dexamethasone and hydroxychloroquine. Since binding of viral spike protein with receptor ACE2 initiates viral entry in the host, hence ACE2 has been one of the main candidates to understand the mechanism of viral infection. In this study our aim was to investigate if ACE2 expression levels can be modulated with therapeutic interventions. Methods: In an in vitro model of monolayer cultures, human airway epithelial (1HAEo-) cell lines were treated with losartan and telmisartan (ARB), captopril (ACEi), and hydroxychloroquine at half-log concentrations from 1 to 100 μM, and fluticasone, ciclesonide, and dexamethasone (steroids) at half-log concentrations from 0.3 to 10 μM. Whole cell lysates were obtained at 24hr post-treatment to quantify ACE2 expression via western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison test. Results: The in vitro experiments have shown that total ACE2 protein expression in 1HAEo-cells is modulated in response to certain drugs. Compared to untreated control cells, losartan treatment showed ∼45 % significant increase in ACE2 expression at both 3 μM and 10 μM concentrations (p&lt; 0.01), whereas dexamethasone showed ∼ 40% significant increase at 10 μM dose (p&lt; 0.001). Captopril treatment showed ∼35% decrease at 30 and 100 μM (p&lt;0.01), whereas ciclesonide treatment demonstrated statistically significant decrease in ACE2 expression with all tested concentrations. No difference in ACE2 expression was observed with telmisartan and hydroxychloroquine treatments. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that daily medications like losartan, captopril, dexamethasone and ciclesonide for certain pre-existing conditions may modulate ACE2 protein levels in airway epithelium hence possibly priming for COVID19 infections if exposed. This affect susceptibility for COVID19 infection and severity of illness in vulnerable populations. Hence basic understanding of mechanism of action for daily standard of care prophylactic therapies can reduce or prevent SAR-CoV-2 infection in at-risk individuals.","Singhera, G.

Method: The conceptual model and framework categorize informatics solutions that could be used by stakeholders (e.g., government, academic institutions, healthcare providers and payers, life science companies, employers, citizens) to address public health challenges across the prepare, respond, and recover phases of a pandemic, building on existing models for public health operations and response. Results: Mapping existing solutions, technology assets, and ideas to the framework helped identify public health informatics solution requirements and gaps in responding to COVID-19 in areas such as applied science, epidemiology, communications, and business continuity. Two examples of technologies used in COVID-19 illustrate novel applications of informatics encompassed by the framework.

Many inpatients with COVID-19 have shown clinical symptoms related to sepsis, which will aggravate the deterioration of patients' condition. We aim to diagnose Viral Sepsis Caused by SARS-CoV-2 by analyzing laboratory test data of patients with COVID-19 and establish an early predictive model for sepsis risk among patients with COVID-19. Methods: This study retrospectively investigated laboratory test data of 2,453 patients with COVID-19 from electronic health records. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was employed to build four models with different feature subsets of a total of 69 collected indicators. Meanwhile, the explainable Shapley Additive ePlanation (SHAP) method was adopted to interpret predictive results and to analyze the feature importance of risk factors. Findings: The model for classifying COVID-19 viral sepsis with seven coagulation function indicators achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.9213 (95% CI, 89.94-94.31%), sensitivity 97.17% (95% CI, 94.97-98.46%), and specificity 82.05% (95% CI, 77.24-86.06%). The model for identifying COVID-19 coagulation disorders with eight features provided an average of 3.68 (±) 4.60 days in advance for early warning prediction with 0.9298 AUC (95% CI, 86.91-99.04%), 82.22% sensitivity (95% CI, 67.41-91.49%), and 84.00% specificity (95% CI, 63.08-94.75%). Interpretation: We found that an abnormality of the coagulation function was related to the occurrence of sepsis and the other routine laboratory test represented by inflammatory factors had a moderate predictive value on coagulopathy, which indicated that early warning of sepsis in COVID-19 patients could be achieved by our established model to improve the patient's prognosis and to reduce mortality.","Tang, Guoxing; Luo, Ying; Lu, Feng; Li, Wei; Liu, Xiongcheng; Nan, Yucen; Ren, Yufei; Liao, Xiaofei; Wu, Song; Jin, Hai; Zomaya, Albert Y; Sun, Ziyong",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,300,1

Many countries started to take different measures of precautions. The Kingdom of Bahrain COVID team (National Taskforce for Combating the Coronavirus) has introduced different protocols for different categories. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to; determine the efficiency of the recent National Taskforce for Combating the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Protocol 5-day nasopharyngeal swab from diagnosis; by evaluating the period of time needed for a patient to retain a negative polymerase chain reaction result and to determine the number of patients who failed to retain a negative result. In addition to, evaluating the cycle threshold values of persistent positive and its relation to current evidence in literature. This study also aims to determine the number of patients that needed urgent medical care [i.e. shifting to an intensive care unit (ICU) facility] in that time frame. MATERIALS & METHODS: Data were collected from the daily index master sheets present in the facility from medical database systems; ALCARE by Royal Medical Services and ORACLE Reports by iSEHA. Search engines used were PubMed/MEDLINE, Oxford Academic Database, Cochrane Database system. The duration of study was from 1-July 2020 to 31-August 2020.

Effective accumulation of activatable photosensitizers (PSs) in phagocytes to realize selective imaging and on-demand photodynamic ablation of bacteria is of great scientific and practical interests for precise bacteria diagnosis and treatment. Herein, HClO-activatable theranostic nanoprobes, DTF-FFP NPs, for image-guided bacterial ablation in phagocytes are introduced. DTF-FFP NPs are prepared by nanoprecipitation of an HClO-responsive near-infrared molecule FFP and an efficient PS DTF with aggregation-induced emission characteristic using an amphiphilic polymer Pluronic F127 as the encapsulation matrix. As an energy acceptor, FFP can quench both fluorescence and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of DTF, thus eliminating the phototoxicity of DTF-FFP NPs in normal cells and tissues. Once delivered to the infection sites, DTF-FFP NPs light up with red fluorescence and efficiently generate ROS owing to the degradation of FFP by the stimulated release of HClO in phagocytes.

One possible explanation is that given previous exposure to angina and ischemia/reperfusion injury these patients, may be already 'naturally preconditioned'. The role of RIPC in a context of isolated valve intervention, both surgical and particularly transcatheter is less clear and remains under investigated, with few high-quality studies. METHODS: A systematic literature review identified 8 candidate studies that met the meta-analysis criteria. We analyzed outcomes of 610 subjects (312 RIPC and 298 SHAM) with random effects modeling. Each study was assessed for heterogeneity. The primary outcome was the extent of periprocedural myocardial injury, as reflected by the area under the curve for serum troponin concentration. Secondary endpoints included relevant intra- and post-operative outcomes; sensitivity and high-quality subgroup analysis was also carried out. RESULTS: Six and two studies reported the effect of RIPC in surgical and transcatheter valve intervention. There was a significant difference between-group in terms of periprocedural Troponin release (standardized mean difference (SMD: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.52; 0.95], pâ¯=â¯0.02) with no heterogeneity (&#967;2 2.40, I2 0%, pâ¯=â¯0.88). RIPC was not associated with any improvement in post-operative outcomes. No serious adverse RIPC related events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: RIPC seems to elicit overall periprocedural cardioprotection in patients undergoing valvular intervention, yet with no benefit on early clinical outcomes.","Moscarelli, Marco; Angelini, Gianni D; Emanueli, Costanza; Suleiman, Saadeh; Pepe, Martino; Contegiacomo, Gaetano; Punjabi, Prakash P",Int. j. cardiol,300,2

The primary purpose of the study is to identify priorities for local health development programs. The urgency of solving this problem is that the pandemic has revealed the unprecedented unpreparedness of the health care system to respond effectively to challenges;also, hidden problems accumulated during the last decades, which increase the emerging risks. The study is carried out in the following logical sequence: 1) collection, processing, and analysis of statistical data;2) conducting a cluster analysis for group regions by vulnerability to different classes of diseases;3) conducting correlation and regression analysis to compare the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (cases and deaths) and the state of the region;4) selection of the most significant features of the vulnerability of the region;5) designing the matrix of the choice of priorities for financing targeted programs in the field of health care. Methodological tools of the study were methods of correlation and regression analysis, cluster analysis, testing for autocorrelation by Darbin - Watson method, sigma limited parameterization to identify the most significant coefficients. The method is tested for 25 regions of Ukraine (including Kyiv), as they can serve as pilots for other regions with similar demographic and economic characteristics. The article presents the results of an empirical analysis of the readiness of regions for critical conditions, such as COVID-19. Identifying such readiness and appropriate distribution of regions by disease classes allows to make decisions in financing and budgeting and improve the quality of health care.","Kuzmenko, O.; Kashcha, M.; Shvindina, H.; Hakimova, Y.; Tagiyeva, N.; Shyian, O.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,300,1

RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the outcomes of critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to a network of hospitals in New Orleans, Louisiana, and what is an evidence-based protocol for care associated with improved outcomes? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study of ICUs in four hospitals in New Orleans, Louisiana, we collected data on adults admitted to an ICU and tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between March 9, 2020 and April 14, 2020. The exposure of interest was admission to an ICU that implemented an evidence-based protocol for COVID-19 care. The primary outcome was ventilator-free days. RESULTS: The initial 147 patients admitted to any ICU and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 constituted the cohort for this study. In the entire network, exposure to an evidence-based protocol was associated with more ventilator-free days (25 days; 0-28) compared with non-protocolized ICUs (0 days; 0-23, P = .005), including in adjusted analyses (P = .02). Twenty patients (37%) admitted to protocolized ICUs died compared with 51 (56%; P = .02) in non-protocolized ICUs. Among 82 patients admitted to the academic safety net hospital's ICUs, the median number of ventilator-free days was 22 (interquartile range, 0-27) and mortality rate was 39%. INTERPRETATION: Care of critically ill COVID-19 patients with an evidence-based protocol is associated with increased time alive and free of invasive mechanical ventilation.

Here, we updated the meta-analysis with more studies and additional assessments that include adults and children within the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Sixteen articles (22 studies) were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using three genetic models (allele, recessive and dominant), in which ARDS patients were compared with non-ARDS patients (A1) and healthy controls (A2). Mortality outcomes were also assessed (A3). The influence of covariates was examined by meta-regression. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple pooled associations. Subgroup analyses based on ethnicity (Asians, Caucasians) and life stage (adults, children) were conducted. Heterogeneity was addressed with outlier treatment. RESULTS: This meta-analysis generated 68 comparisons, 21 of which were significant. Of the 21, four A1 and three A3 highly significant (Pa = 0.00001-0.0008) outcomes withstood Bonferroni correction. For A1, allele and recessive associations were found in overall (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.39-0.61), Caucasians (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35-0.61) and children (ORs 0.49-0.66, 95% CI 0.33-0.84) analyses. For A3, associations were found in overall (dominant: OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29-0.68) and Asian subgroup (allele/ dominant: ORs 0.31-0.39, 95% CIs 0.18-0.63) analyses. These outcomes were either robust, or statistically powered or both and uninfluenced by covariates. CONCLUSIONS: Significant associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism with the risk of ALI/ARDS were indicated in Caucasians and children as well as in Asians in mortality analysis. These findings were underpinned by high significance, high statistical power and robustness. ACE genotypes may be useful for ALI/ARDS therapy for patients with COVID-19.","Pabalan, Noel; Tharabenjasin, Phuntila; Suntornsaratoon, Panan; Jarjanazi, Hamdi; Muanprasat, Chatchai",Infect Genet Evol,300,16

Computed tomography (CT) plays a vital role in the diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the pulmonary CT changes and distributions of COVID-19 infection in regard to different age groups. METHODS: Chest CT scan of 104 symptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection, from 7 Iraqi isolation centers were retrospectively analyzed between March 10th and April 5th, 2020. Patients were sub-classified according to their ages to three groups (young adult:20-39years, middle age:40-59years and old age:60- 90years). RESULTS: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities (GGO) (92.3%, followed by consolidation (27.9%), bronchovascular thickening (15.4%), and crazy-paving (12.5%). Less commonly, there were tree-inbud (6.7%), pulmonary nodules (5.8%), bronchiectasis (3.8%), pleural effusion (1.9%), and cavitation (1%). There were no hallo sign, reversed hallo sign, nor mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary changes were unilateral in 16.7% and bilateral in 83.3%, central in 14.6%, peripheral in 57.3%, and diffuse (central and peripheral) in 28.1%. Most cases showed multi-lobar changes (70.8%), while the lower lobe was more commonly involved (17.7%) than middle lobe/lingula (8.3%) and upper lobe (3.1%). In unilateral involvement, changes were more on the right (68.8%) than left (31.2%) side.

However, the role and mechanism of microRNA (miRNA, miR) in AKI-CKD transition are elusive. In this study, a murine model of renal ischemia/reperfusion was established to investigate the repairing effect and mechanism of miR-101a-3p on renal injury. The pathological damage of renal tissue was observed by hematoxylin and eosin and Masson staining. The levels of miR-101, profibrotic cytokines, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were analyzed using Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and/or immunofluorescence. MiR-101 overexpression caused the downregulation of &#945;-smooth muscle actin, collagen-1, and vimentin, as well as upregulation of E-cadherin, thereby alleviating the degree of renal tissue damage. MiR-101 overexpression mitigated hypoxic HK-2 cell damage. Collagen, type X, alpha 1 and transforming growth factor ß receptor 1 levels were downregulated in hypoxic cells transfected with miR-101 mimic.

Lung ultrasound has a high accuracy for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases; however, there are few prospective studies demonstrating that lung ultrasound can predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesized that lung ultrasound score (LUS) at hospital admission could predict outcomes of COVID-19 patients. This is a prospective cohort study conducted from 14 March through 6 May 2020 in the emergency department (ED) of an urban, academic, level I trauma center. Patients aged 18 years and older and admitted to the ED with confirmed COVID-19 were considered eligible. Emergency physicians performed lung ultrasounds and calculated LUS, which was tested for correlation with outcomes. This protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee number 3.990.817 (CAAE: 30417520.0.0000.0068). RESULTS: The primary endpoint was death from any cause. The secondary endpoints were ICU admission and endotracheal intubation for respiratory failure. Among 180 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were enrolled (mean age, 60 years; 105 male), the average LUS was 18.7 ± 6.8. LUS correlated with findings from chest CT and could predict the estimated extent of parenchymal involvement (mean LUS with < 50% involvement on chest CT, 15 ± 6.7 vs. 21 ± 6.0 with > 50% involvement, p < 0.001), death (AUC 0.72, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.21; p < 0.001), endotracheal intubation (AUC 0.76, OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.26; p < 0.001), and ICU admission (AUC: 0.71, OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.21; p < 0.001).

He is a 37-year old Latin-American male who had been treated with radiation, CyBorD regimen, AHCT and bortezomib therapy before being referred to our service. It was decided to administer daratumumab therapy and subsequently perform the transplant. Placement of central venous access, fluid infusion, conditioning regimen with melphalan and previously cryopreserved autograft infusion were carried out in an outpatient basis. Following second AHCT, the patient demonstrated clinical, VEGF, hematological response and remains SARS-CoV-2 infection-free and in POEMS remission with excellent quality-of-life at last follow up (6 months). We evidenced that thanks to an outpatient transplant program, the best therapeutic modalities can be offered to patients with hematologic malignancies in the context of present or future pandemics. Finally, high-complexity patients with HIV infection should have access to the same treatment strategies as non-infected patients. A second AHCT in the outpatient setting is feasible, safe and highly effective to treat patients with relapsed POEMS syndrome.","Hernández-Coronado, Marcela; Jaime-Pérez, José Carlos; Villarreal-Martínez, Alejandra; Ocampo-Candiani, Jorge; Gómez-Almaguer, David",Transpl Immunol,300,24

However, regional anesthesia is slowly finding viable applications in this field. This review aims at providing an update on the current practice of regional anesthesia techniques outside of the operating theatre. RECENT FINDINGS: Some anesthetic departments have implemented the use of regional anesthesia in novel applications outside of the operating room. In most cases, it remains an adjunct to general anesthesia but is sometimes used as the sole anesthetic technique. The use of the paravertebral block during radiofrequency ablation of different tumors is a recent application in interventional radiology. In emergency medicine, regional anesthesia is gaining traction in analgesia for trauma patients. SUMMARY: Regional anesthesia is finding its way into broader applications every day, offering a range of potential benefits in anesthetic care. Its implementation in NORA is promising and may aid in decreasing patient morbidity. However, great care should be taken in applying the recommended safety precautions for regional anesthesia in any setting.","Faddoul, Annibal; Bonnet, Francis",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,300,16

In the United States these orders were not coordinated at the national level during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which creates an opportunity to use spatial and temporal variation to measure the policies' effect. Here, we combine data on the timing of stay-at-home orders with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities at the county level during the first seven weeks of the outbreak in the United States. We estimate the association between stay-at-home orders and alterations in COVID-19 cases and fatalities using a difference-in-differences design that accounts for unmeasured local variation in factors like health systems and demographics and for unmeasured temporal variation in factors like national mitigation actions and access to tests. Compared to counties that did not implement stay-at-home orders, the results show that the orders are associated with a 30.2 percent (11.0 to 45.2) average reduction in weekly incident cases after one week, a 40.0 percent (23.4 to 53.0) reduction after two weeks, and a 48.6 percent (31.1 to 61.7) reduction after three weeks. Stay-at-home orders are also associated with a 59.8 percent (18.3 to 80.2) average reduction in weekly fatalities after three weeks. These results suggest that stay-at-home orders might have reduced confirmed cases by 390,000 (170,000 to 680,000) and fatalities by 41,000 (27,000 to 59,000) within the first three weeks in localities that implemented stay-at-home orders.","Fowler, James H; Hill, Seth J; Levin, Remy; Obradovich, Nick",PLoS One,300,16

Drawing on existing literature on VTs pre-Covid-19, we explore what current (and future) VTs might look like and what this means for leadership in this new context with an emphasis on how leadership, or e-leadership, can be exercised to help the leaders of traditional, physically collocated teams that had to transition into VTs. These new e-leaders need to come to grips with a variety of new challenges in order to create high-performing and sustainable VTs. Following a semi-systematic, state-of-the-art literature review, we: (a) identify key themes and explain with a theoretical model how existing knowledge can lead to new insights for newly transitioned e-leaders;(b) discuss what future information systems (IS) researchers should focus on given the reconfiguration and new characteristics of VTs in the Covid-19 context;and (c) ‘translate’ the findings of our synthesis of the existing literature into prescriptive advice that can be used to inform practitioners.","Chamakiotis, Petros Panteli Niki Davison Robert M.",International Journal of Information Management,300,1

BACKGROUND: Synthetic vaccines can cause production of neutralizing antibodies only in case if short peptides form the same secondary structure as fragments of full-length proteins. The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm was designed to check stability of alpha helices, beta strands, and random coils using several propensity scales obtained during analysis of 1730 3D structures of proteins. OBJECTIVE: The algorithm has been tested in the three peptides known to keep the secondary structure of the corresponding fragments of full-length proteins: the NY25 peptide from the Influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin, the SF23 peptide from the diphtheria toxin, the NQ21 peptide from the HIV1 gp120; as well as in the CC36 peptide from the human major prion protein. METHOD: Affine chromatography for antibodies against peptides accompanied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to check the predictions of the algorithm. RESULT: Immunological experiments showed that all abovementioned peptides are more or less immunogenic in rabbits. The fact that antibodies against the NY25, the SF23, and the NQ21 form stable complexes with corresponding full-length proteins has been confirmed by affine chromatography. The surface of SARS CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain interacting with hACE2 has been shown to be unstable according to the results of the PentaFOLD 3.0. CONCLUSION: The PentaFOLD 3.0 algorithm (http://chemres.bsmu.by/PentaFOLD30.htm) can be used with the aim to design vaccine peptides with stable secondary structure elements.","Khrustalev, Vladislav Victorovich",,300,15

Along with the rest of India, lockdowns (of varying degrees) have been in effect in Mumbai since March 25, 2020. Given the large economic toll on the country from the lockdown and the related restrictions on mobility of people and goods, swift opening of the economy especially in a financial hub such as Mumbai becomes critical. In this report, we use the IISc-TIFR agent based simulator to develop long term projections for Mumbai under realistic scenarios related to Mumbai's opening of the workplaces, or equivalently, the economy, and the associated public transportation through local trains and buses. These projections were developed taking into account a possible second wave if the economy and the local trains are fully opened either on November 1, 2020 or on January 1, 2021. The impact on infection spread in Mumbai if the schools and colleges open on January first week 2021 is also considered. We also try to account for the increased intermingling amongst the population during the Ganeshotsav festival as well as around the Navratri/Dussehra and Diwali festival. Our conclusion, based on our simulations, is that the impact of fully opening up the economy on November 1 is manageable provided reasonable medical infrastructure is in place. Further, schools and colleges opening in January do not lead to excessive increase in infections. The report also explores the relative effectiveness of contact tracing vs containment zones, and also includes very rudimentary results of the effect of vaccinating the elderly population in February 2021.","Harsha, Prahladh; Juneja, Sandeep; Mittal, Daksh; Saptharishi, Ramprasad",,300,26

Patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia who underwent a computed tomography pulmonary artery (CTPA) scan for suspected APE were retrospectively studied. Laboratory data and CTPA images were collected. Imaging characteristics were analyzed descriptively. Laboratory data were analyzed and compared between patients with and without APE. A series of 25 COVID-19 patients who underwent CTPA between January 2020 and February 2020 were enrolled. The median D-dimer level founded in these 25 patients was 6.06 µg/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 1.90-14.31 µg/mL). Ten (40%) patients with APE had a significantly higher level of D-dimer (median, 11.07 µg/mL; IQR, 7.12-21.66 vs median, 2.44 µg/mL; IQR, 1.68-8.34, respectively, P = .003), compared with the 15 (60%) patients without APE. No significant differences in other laboratory data were found between patients with and without APE. Among the 10 patients with APE, 6 (60%) had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, while 4 had a unilateral embolism. The thrombus-prone sites were the right lower lobe (70%), the left upper lobe (60%), both upper lobe (40%) and the right middle lobe (20%). The thrombus was partially or completely absorbed after anticoagulant therapy in 3 patients who underwent a follow-up CTPA. Patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia have a risk of developing APE during the disease. When the D-dimer level abnormally increases in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, CTPA should be performed to detect and assess the severity of APE.","Chen, Jianpu; Wang, Xiang; Zhang, Shutong; Lin, Bin; Wu, Xiaoqing; Wang, Yanfang; Wang, Xiaoqi; Yang, Ming; Sun, Jianqing; Xie, Yuanliang",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,300,16

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies that reported fatalities in COVID-19 patients with cancer. A comprehensive meta-analysis that assessed the overall case fatality rate and associated risk factors was performed. Using individual patient data, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for each variable with outcomes. RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 3019 patients, of which 1628 were men; 41.0% were from the UK and Europe, followed by the USA and Canada (35.7%) and Asia (China, 23.3%). The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with cancer measured 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.3% to 28.0%). Univariate analysis revealed age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.80 to 7.06), male (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.13), and comorbidity (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.85) were associated with increased risk of severe events (defined as the individuals being admitted to the intensive care unit, or requiring invasive ventilation, or death).

While injury prevention is currently only recognised in the SDG agenda via two road safety targets, the relevance of the SDGs for injury prevention is much broader. In this State of the Art Review, we illustrate how unintentional injury prevention efforts can be advanced substantially within a broad range of SDG goals and advocate for the integration of safety considerations across all sectors and stakeholders. This review uncovers injury prevention opportunities within broader global priorities such as urbanisation, population shifts, water safeguarding and corporate social responsibility. We demonstrate the relevance of injury prevention efforts to the SDG agenda beyond the health goal (SDG 3) and the two specific road safety targets (SDG 3.6 and SDG 11.2), highlighting 13 additional SDGs of relevance.

CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 has been reported to be important in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. We hypothesized that visfatin, an adipocytokine, could play a role in hepatic fibrosis via CCL20. We investigated the effect of visfatin on CCL20 in THP-1 human promonocytic cells and examined the molecular mechanisms involved. Following treatment of THP-1 cells with visfatin, CCL20 expression and secretion were assessed. We assessed the intracellular signaling molecules IKK/NF-&#954;B, JAK2/STAT3, MAPKs, and MKK3/6 by western blotting. We treated THP-1 cells with visfatin and signaling inhibitors, and examined CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. To investigate the effect of visfatin-induced CCL20 expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), LX-2 cells were co-cultured with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells with or without anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibodies, and fibrosis markers were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. In THP-1 cells, visfatin increased the CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. visfatin increased the activities of the NF-&#954;B, p38, and MLK3/6 signaling pathways but not those of the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK pathways. Visfatin treatment together with an NF-&#954;B, p38, or MLK3 inhibitor reduced the mRNA and protein levels of CCL20. The visfatin-induced CCL20 increased the expression of fibrosis markers and CCR6 in HSCs. Following neutralization of CCL20, the levels of fibrosis markers and CCR6 were decreased. Visfatin increases the expression of CCL20 via the NF-&#954;B and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways in macrophages, and visfatin-induced CCL20 expression promotes the fibrosis markers in HSCs.","Heo, Yu Jung; Choi, Sung-E; Lee, Nami; Jeon, Ja Young; Han, Seung Jin; Kim, Dae Jung; Kang, Yup; Lee, Kwan Woo; Kim, Hae Jin",Mol.

We also investigate impacts of the opening of four new light rail stations in 2016 and of increased community-based policing starting in late 2018. Our statistical analyses of reclassified crimes-larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property-and non-reclassified ones are based on publicly available reported crime data from 2006 to 2019. These analyses examine reported crime at various levels: city-wide, within eight neighborhoods, and within a 450-meter radius of the new transit stations. Monthly reported reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. Reported non-reclassified crimes fell overall by approximately 9%. Areas surrounding two new train stations, including Downtown, saw significant increases in reported crime after train service began. While reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, non-reclassified crimes, for the most part, decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 may have impacted reported crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new community-based policing measures. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be challenging due to the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions. While our research detects changes in reported crime, it does not provide causative explanations. Our work, along with other considerations relevant to public utility, respect for human rights, and existence of socioeconomic disparities, may be useful to law enforcement and policymakers to assess the overall effect of Proposition 47.","Crodelle, Jennifer; Vallejo, Celeste; Schmidtchen, Markus; Topaz, Chad M; D039,; Orsogna, Maria R",PLoS One,300,1

As part of this, utilising biomarkers to risk stratify patients has become increasingly popular. During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of D-dimer has increased due to the evidence of COVID-19 induced thrombo-embolic disease. We evaluated the use of D-dimer on all hospital admissions during the peak of the pandemic and evaluated its sensitivity in diagnosing pulmonary embolic disease (PE). Patients without COVID-19 infection were as likely to have evidence of PE as their COVID-positive counterparts. However, the sensitivity of a D-dimer was higher in COVID-positive patients at a lower D-dimer level (>1,500 µg/L, sensitivity 81%, specificity 70%) than in those without clinical, immunological or radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection (D-dimer >2,000 µg/L, sensitivity 80%, specificity 76%).

Transfection agents are widely considered to be necessary to protect mRNA and enhance transfection, but they add expense and raise concerns regarding quality control and safety. We found that such complex mRNA delivery systems can be avoided when transfecting epithelial cells by aerosolizing the mRNA into micron-sized droplets. In an equine in vivo model, we demonstrated that the translation of mRNA into a functional protein did not depend on the addition of a polyethylenimine (PEI)-derived transfection agent. We were able to safely and effectively transfect the bronchial epithelium of foals using naked mRNA (i.e., mRNA formulated in a sodium citrate buffer without a delivery vehicle). Endoscopic examination of the bronchial tree and histology of mucosal biopsies indicated no gross or microscopic adverse effects of the transfection. Our data suggest that mRNA administered by an atomization device eliminates the need for chemical transfection agents, which can reduce the cost and the safety risks of delivering mRNA to the respiratory tract of animals and humans.","Legere, Rebecca M; Cohen, Noah D; Poveda, Cristina; Bray, Jocelyne M; Barhoumi, Rola; Szule, Joseph A; de la Concha-Bermejillo, Andrés; Bordin, Angela I; Pollet, Jeroen",Sci Rep,300,24

The transmission rate is reported to be high for this novel strain of coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as compared to its predecessors. Major strategies in terms of clinical trials of medicines and vaccines, social distancing, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and so on are being implemented in order to control the spread. The current study concentrates on lockdown and social distancing policy followed by the Indian Government and evaluates its effectiveness using Bayesian probability model (BPM). The change point analysis (CPA) done through the above approach suggests that the states which implemented the lockdown before the exponential rise of cases are able to control the spread of the disease in a much better and efficient way. The analysis has been done for states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi as union territory. The highest value of &#916; (delta) is reported for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with a value of 9.6 weeks, while the lowest value is 4.7, evidently for Maharashtra which is the worst affected. All of the states indicate a significant correlation (p < 0.05, tstat > tcritical) for &#916;, i.e., the difference in the time period of CPA and lockdown with cases per population (CPP) and cases per unit area (CPUA), while weak correlation (p < 0.1 and tstat < tcritical) is exhibited by delta and cases per unit population density (CPD). For both CPP and CPUA, tstat > tcritical indicating a significant correlation, while Pearson's correlation indicates the direction to be negative. Further analysis in terms of identification of high-risk areas has been studied from the Voronoi approach of GIS based on the inputs from BPM. All the states follow the above pattern of high population, high case scenario, and the boundaries of risk zones can be identified by Thiessen polygon (TP) constructed therein. The findings of the study help draw strategic and policy-driven response for India, toward tackling COVID-19 pandemic.","Bherwani, Hemant; Anjum, Saima; Kumar, Suman; Gautam, Sneha; Gupta, Ankit; Kumbhare, Himanshu; Anshul, Avneesh; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ Dev Sustain,300,24

HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (Transformation/translation domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.","Tapias, Alicia; Lázaro, David; Yin, Bo-Kun; Rasa, Seyed Mohammad Mahdi; Krepelova, Anna; Kelmer Sacramento, Erika; Grigaravicius, Paulius; Koch, Philipp; Kirkpatrick, Joanna; Ori, Alessandro; Neri, Francesco; Wang, Zhao-Qi",eLife (Cambridge),300,6

Caseins, whey proteins, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), mucins, tryptophan, and growth factors are among milk-borne elements that are directly important in the control of mucosa development and protection. Consequently, breastfeeding is associated with the low incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation and with the decrease in respiratory diseases during postnatal period. The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin II-converting enzyme (ACE2) on the cell membrane, allowing virus entrance, replication, and host commitment. ACE2 is expressed by different cell types, which include ciliated cells in the lungs and enterocytes in the intestine. Such cells are highly active in metabolism, as they internalize molecules to be processed and used by the organism. The disruption of ACE2 impairs leads to intestinal inflammation and decreased synthesis of serotonin, affecting motility. By reviewing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts in infants, and gut responses to breastfeeding interruption, we suggest that it is important to maintain breastfeeding during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it might be essential to protect newborns from gastrointestinal-associated disorders and relieve disease symptoms.","Vasques da Costa, Aline; Purcell Goes, Carolina; Gama, Patrícia",Physiol Rep,300,16

By releasing these small molecular weight peptides, the source cells can influence numerous intracellular processes in the target cells, including the secretion of other cytokines downstream. However, there are no readily available bioinformatic resources that can model cytokine - cytokine interactions. In this effort, we built a communication map between major tissues and blood cells that reveals how cytokine-mediated intercellular networks form during homeostatic conditions. We collated the most prevalent cytokines from literature, and assigned the proteins and their corresponding receptors to source tissue and blood cell types based on enriched consensus RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas database. To assign more confidence to the interactions, we integrated literature information on cell - cytokine interactions from two systems immunology databases, immuneXpresso and ImmunoGlobe. From the collated information, we defined two metanetworks: a cell-cell communication network connected by cytokines; and a cytokine-cytokine interaction network depicting the potential ways in which cytokines can affect the activity of each other. Using expression data from disease states, we then applied this resource to reveal perturbations in cytokine-mediated intercellular signalling in inflammatory and infectious diseases (ulcerative colitis and COVID-19, respectively). For ulcerative colitis, with CytokineLink we demonstrated a significant rewiring of cytokine-mediated intercellular communication between non-inflamed and inflamed colonic tissues. For COVID-19, we were able to identify inactive cell types and cytokine interactions that may be important following SARS-CoV-2 infection when comparing the cytokine response with other viruses capable of initiating a cytokine storm. Such findings have potential to inform the development of novel, cytokine-targeted therapeutic strategies.

The first diagnosis in Italy was on February 20, 2020, followed by the establishment of a light and a tight lockdown on February 23 and on March 8, 2020, respectively. The virus spread rapidly, particularly in the North of the country in the 'Padan Plain' area, known as one of the most polluted regions in Europe. Air pollution has been recently hypothesized to enhance the clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, acting through adverse effects on immunity, induction of respiratory and other chronic disease, upregulation of viral receptor ACE-2, and possible pathogen transportation as a virus carrier. We investigated the association between air pollution and subsequent COVID-19 mortality rates within two Italian regions (Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). We estimated ground-level nitrogen dioxide through its tropospheric levels using data available from the Sentinel-5P satellites of the European Space Agency Copernicus Earth Observation Programme before the lockdown. We then examined COVID-19 mortality rates in relation to the nitrogen dioxide levels at three 14-day lag points after the lockdown, namely March 8, 22 and April 5, 2020. Using a multivariable negative binomial regression model, we found an association between nitrogen dioxide and COVID-19 mortality.

As effective COPD diagnosis may involve all levels of primary care clinic staff, the CAPTURE validation study included workflow reviews, patient opinion surveys, staff questionnaires, clinician focus groups and case-based vignettes to cohesively form a robust real-world practice assessment of COPD case-finding readiness. We employed this multi-method qualitative sub-aim approach to guide CAPTURE's longitudinal quantitative assessments and to inform strategies for practice implementation of the CAPTURE tool after study completion.Methods: 196 adults without diagnosis of COPD from 82 US practices;and, 114 primary care clinic staff evenly enrolled in the CAPTURE study from 7 US practice-based research networks (PBRNs) that serve rural and urban locales. Sitespecific practice information, clinician questionnaires, and patient responses populated focus group themes. Analyses of clinician and patient responses including frequencies and correlations by clinician level and practice were assessed. 10 practices participated in clinician focus groups that investigated salience, patterning, and contexts of key discourse items. Responses were assigned a priori codes as relevant for CAPTURE implementation planning, COPD diagnosis, CAPTURE intra-office clinical communication, and COPD and CAPTURE education preference, as well as COPD assessment options before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Patients strongly agreed (&gt;90%) the CAPTURE tool was easy to read and understand, without response difference to questions via verbal versus written administration. Despite lack of COPD staff knowledge reflecting known national primary care education need, clinicians agreed (&gt; 90%) the CAPTURE tool would aid COPD casefinding and aligned with patients (&gt;90%) that CAPTURE could be implemented and completed as part of routine health screening within 5 minutes. Despite most clinicians reporting a lack of reliable on-site pulmonary function capability, physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, medical assistants uniformly strongly agreed (&gt;90%) that the peak flow testing (PEF) component of CAPTURE could aid respiratory assessment. All practices agreed they'd consider alternate PEF strategies as part of in-person or telehealth assessments if pandemic public health concerns persisted. Conclusions: Thorough qualitative review of CAPTURE in primary care practice demonstrates readiness for this COPD case-finding tool's implementation into US primary care. With CAPTURE operating characteristic validation underway among 5000 patients in practices with wide demographic and geographic variability, this qualitative methodology 1) offered critical in-study information guiding protocol adjustment impacted by unforeseen events (e.g. the COVID crisis);and, 2) clearly outlined COPD diagnosis processes preferred for real-world primary care use.

Our research is based on the qualitative analysis of comparing the impact of the global financial crisis and strategic recovery recession plans of the top five GDP countries in the European Union-particularly Germany, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy to draw some similarities between a recession and COVID-19 pandemic in terms of the economy. The findings indicate that the great recession had a devastating impact on the entire economy, and the world can learn valuable lessons. It notes that out of the selected five EU countries, Germany was the first to recover and bounce back by 2011, but Italy and Spain were severely hit and took longer to recover only partially. The recession recovery strategies demonstrate some similarities in economic and employment measures and differences concerning tax reforms and financial support packages initiated by all five countries. There needs to be a mechanism in which each country must prepare for untimely recessions. Thus, a developmental model has been created to enable countries to be more prepared when faced with recessions in the future years. © 2021 Mythili Kolluru et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Kolluru, M.; Hyams-Ssekasi, D.; Madhu Sudhana Rao, K.

Immune cell activation via pattern recognition receptors has been implicated as a driver of the hyperinflammatory response seen in COVID-19. However, our understanding of the specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 remains limited. Mast cells (MCs) and eosinophils are innate immune cells that play pathogenic roles in many inflammatory responses. Here we report MC-derived proteases and eosinophil-associated mediators are elevated in COVID-19 patient sera and lung tissues. Stimulation of viral-sensing toll-like receptors in vitro and administration of synthetic viral RNA in vivo induced features of hyperinflammation, including cytokine elevation, immune cell airway infiltration, and MC-protease production-effects suppressed by an anti-Siglec-8 monoclonal antibody which selectively inhibits MCs and depletes eosinophils. Similarly, anti-Siglec-8 treatment reduced disease severity and airway inflammation in a respiratory viral infection model. These results suggest that MC and eosinophil activation are associated with COVID-19 inflammation and anti-Siglec-8 antibodies are a potential therapeutic approach for attenuating excessive inflammation during viral infections.","Gebremeskel, Simon; Schanin, Julia; Coyle, Krysta M; Butuci, Melina; Luu, Thuy; Brock, Emily C; Xu, Alan; Wong, Alan; Leung, John; Korver, Wouter; Morin, Ryan D; Schleimer, Robert P; Bochner, Bruce S; Youngblood, Bradford A",Front Immunol,300,0

It shows how the experience of parental care leads to the discovery of new ways of human interaction and expressions of personhood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Framed within literary-cultural age studies, the article shows how humanities-based inquiry can illuminate important aspects of aging and care of the oldest old, which are significant and revealing, but often hidden under the dark shadow of dementia. RESULTS: Newly discovered ways of communication challenge the notion of the loss of agency as they demonstrate that the body itself has the power of creative and intentional capacities and self-expression. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Care-related narratives offer new insights into aging, dementia and subjectivity that can help pursue a better analysis of the 'deep' old age, strengthen collective solidary and manage increasing ageism, especially pronounced during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Stoncikaite, Ieva",GerontologistGerontologist,300,15

The multiple pathways of exposure included hand contact via contaminated surfaces and an HCW's fingers with droplets, droplet spray, and inhalation of inspirable and respirable particles. We assumed a scenario of medium contact time (MCT) and long contact time (LCT) over 1 day of care by an HCW. SARS-CoV-2 in the particles emitted by coughing, breathing, and vocalization (only in the LCT scenario) by the patient were considered. The contribution of the risk of infection of an HCW by SARS-CoV-2 from each pathway to the sum of the risks from all pathways depended on virus concentration in the saliva of the patient. At a virus concentration in the saliva of 101-105 PFU mL-1 concentration in the MCT scenario and 101-104 PFU mL-1 concentration in the LCT scenario, droplet spraying was the major pathway (60%-86%) of infection, followed by hand contact via contaminated surfaces (9%-32%). At a high virus concentration in the saliva (106-108 PFU mL-1 in the MCT scenario and 105-108 PFU mL-1 in the LCT scenario), hand contact via contaminated surfaces was the main contributor (41%-83%) to infection. The contribution of inhalation of inspirable particles was 4%-10% in all assumed cases. The contribution of inhalation of respirable particles increased as the virus concentration in the saliva increased, and reached 5%-27% at the high saliva concentration (107 and 108 PFU mL-1) in the assumed scenarios using higher dose-response function parameter (0.246) and comparable to other pathways, although these were worst and rare cases. Regarding the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions, the relative risk (RR) of an overall risk for an HCW with an intervention vs. an HCW without intervention was 0.36-0.37, 0.02-0.03, and <4.0 × 10-4 for a face mask, a face shield, and a face mask plus shield, respectively, in the likely median virus concentration in the saliva (102-104 PFU mL-1), suggesting that personal protective equipment decreased the infection risk by 63%->99.9%. In addition, the RR for a face mask worn by the patient, and a face mask worn by the patient plus increase of air change rate from 2 h-1 to 6 h-1 was <1.0 × 10-4 and <5.0 × 10-5, respectively in the same virus concentration in the saliva. Therefore, by modeling multiple pathways of exposure, the contribution of the infection risk from each pathway and the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19 were indicated quantitatively, and the importance of the use of a face mask and shield was confirmed.","Mizukoshi, Atsushi; Nakama, Chikako; Okumura, Jiro; Azuma, Kenichi",Environ Int,300,33

The purpose of this article is to describe the impact of clinical nurse specialist practice on COVID-19 preparation at a military hospital. ENVIRONMENT OF CARE CHANGES: The pandemic required facilities to develop expansion plans to facilitate a potential surge of COVID-19 patients. Clinical nurse specialists collaborated to develop a plan to expand care capacity and streamline testing while designating specific critical care and medical-surgical areas for COVID-19 patients. STAFFING CONSIDERATIONS: To capitalize on the expanded bed capacity, clinical nurse specialists identified and trained outpatient nursing staff to serve as nurse extenders. DISCUSSION: Early in the pandemic, a lack of strong evidence-based interventions to mitigate transmission and treatment necessitated the development of innovative solutions. The clinical nurse specialist team established designated transport routes for COVID-19 patients, leveraged technology to improve methods of care, and cultivated a culture of innovation by providing on-the-spot meaningful recognition to staff. CONCLUSION: As leaders in healthcare, clinical nurse specialists are change agents that work to maintain high-quality, safe patient care even during a global pandemic.","Lucciola, Megan E; Nelson, Nicole M; Rea, Jessica M; Boudreaux, Allan J; Fedderson, Daniel J; Hodge, Nancy S",Clin Nurse Spec,300,1

This study assessed the importance of PPI < TCL as a successful target for atypical flutter ablation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 177 ablation procedures were investigated. Surface electrocardiograms (ECGs) were evaluated and combined activation and entrainment mapping were performed to choose ablation sites. Each entrainment sequence immediately preceding static radiofrequency delivery at the same site was analysed. A total of 545 entrainment sequences were analysed. dPPI < 0 ms was observed in 45.3% (247/545) sequences. Ablation resulted in tachycardia termination more often at sites with dPPI < 0 (27.8% vs. 14.5%, P < 0.001) and with a progressively increasingly inverse correlation between dPPI duration and ablation success [odds ratio (OR): 0.974; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.960-0.988; P < 0.001]. Tachycardia termination or cycle length prolongation also occurred more often at sites with dPPI < 0 (50.6% vs. 33.2%, P < 0.001) and with a similar inverse correlation with dPPI duration (OR: 0.972; 95% CI 0.960-0.984; P < 0.001). Twelve-lead synchronous isoelectric intervals were observed in 64.4% (163/253) flutter ECGs and were associated with a dPPI < 0 (75.3% vs. 55.8%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: When combined with activation mapping, a negative dPPI is a more effective parameter for identifying a target for successful ablation compared to a dPPI = 0-30 ms. Its occurrence is associated with a critical small narrow slow-conducting isthmus at the target site.","Dall039,; Aglio, Pietro Bernardo; Johner, Nicolas; Namdar, Mehdi; Shah, Dipen C",Europace,300,33

An EMA-study on daily affect and parenting,19.03164,4.024933,2020,"The emergence of biomedical sensor devices, wireless communication, and innovation in other technologies for healthcare applications result in the evolution of a new area of research that is termed as Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). WBAN originates from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are used for implementing many healthcare systems integrated with networks and wireless devices to ensure remote healthcare monitoring. WBAN is a network of wearable devices implanted in or on the human body. The main aim of WBAN is to collect the human vital signs/physiological data (like ECG, body temperature, EMG, glucose level, etc.) round-the-clock from patients that demand secure, optimal and efficient routing techniques. The efficient, secure, and reliable designing of routing protocol is a difficult task in WBAN due to its diverse characteristic and restraints, such as energy consumption and temperature-rise of implanted sensors. The two significant constraints, overheating of nodes and energy efficiency must be taken into account while designing a reliable blockchain-enabled WBAN routing protocol. The purpose of this study is to achieve stability and efficiency in the routing of WBAN through managing temperature and energy limitations. Moreover, the blockchain provides security, transparency, and lightweight solution for the interoperability of physiological data with other medical personnel in the healthcare ecosystem. In this research work, the blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR) protocol for WBAN is proposed. Temperature rise, energy consumption, and throughput are the evaluation metrics considered to analyze the performance of ATEAR for data transmission. In contrast, transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization are used to investigate the outcome of the blockchain system. Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the blockchain system in terms of CPU utilization, memory, and memory utilization. The results show that by preserving residual energy and avoiding overheated nodes as forwarders, high throughput is achieved with the ultimate increase of the network lifetime. Castalia, a simulation tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, and its comparison is made with Multipath Ring Routing Protocol (MRRP), thermal-aware routing algorithm (TARA), and Shortest-Hop (SHR). Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed protocol performs significantly better in balancing of temperature (to avoid damaging heat effect on the body tissues) and energy consumption (to prevent the replacement of battery and to increase the embedded sensor node life) with efficient data transmission achieving a high throughput value.","Shahbazi, Zeinab; Byun, Yung-Cheol",,300,16

METHODS: Serum samples (n = 114) from 34 COVID-19 patients with mild to critical clinical manifestations were examined. The presence and titers of IgG antibody for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were determined by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) using Alinity i SARS-CoV-2 IgG and by an immunochromatographic (IC) IgM/IgG antibody assay using the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Test. RESULTS: IgG was detected by the CMIA in 40%, 88%, and 100% of samples collected within 1 week, 1-2 weeks, and 2 weeks after symptom onset in severe and critical cases, and 0%, 38%, and 100% in mild/moderate cases, respectively. In severe and critical cases, the positive IgG detection rate with the IC assay was 60% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks. In mild/moderate cases, the positive IgG rate was 17% within one week and 63% between one and two weeks; IgM was positive in 80% and 75% of severe and critical cases, and 42% and 88% of mild/moderate cases, respectively. On the CMIA, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected in COVID-19 outpatients with mild symptoms within 10 days from onset, whereas 50% of samples from severe inpatients were IgG-positive in the same period.

Moreover, NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of acute viral infections, including those caused by the dengue virus (DV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, excessive NET formation (NETosis) is associated with disease severity in patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2-induced multiple organ injuries. Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and other members of C-type lectin family (L-SIGN, LSECtin, CLEC10A) have been reported to interact with viral glycans to facilitate virus spreading and exacerbates inflammatory reactions. Moreover, spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)-coupled C-type lectin member 5A (CLEC5A) has been shown as the pattern recognition receptor for members of flaviviruses, and is responsible for DV-induced cytokine storm and Japanese encephalomyelitis virus (JEV)-induced neuronal inflammation. Moreover, DV activates platelets via CLEC2 to release extracellular vesicles (EVs), including microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes (EXOs). The DV-activated EXOs (DV-EXOs) and MVs (DV-MVs) stimulate CLEC5A and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), respectively, to enhance NET formation and inflammatory reactions. Thus, EVs from virus-activated platelets (PLT-EVs) are potent endogenous danger signals, and blockade of C-type lectins is a promising strategy to attenuate virus-induced NETosis and intravascular coagulopathy.","Sung, Pei-Shan; Hsieh, Shie-Liang",J Biomed Sci,300,24

Performance of an RPD primarily depends on how well the protective device fits the wearer. Therefore, quantitative fit testing of particulate respirators is crucial for achieving the intended protection level. Millions of fit tests are conducted every year using a US OSHA-accepted standard protocol involving a PortaCount® (TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA) which measures a respirator fit factor. Recently, several alternative fit testing instruments have been developed and introduced to the market. Among them is an AccuFIT 9000 (Kanomax-Japan Inc., Suita-city, Osaka, Japan), which, like the PortaCount®, utilizes the condensation particle counting principle, but features an advanced saturation chamber design allowing for a longer residence time and greater flow stability. It is also claimed to have a more cost-efficient assembly than its predecessors. In this study, the novel AccuFIT apparatus was extensively evaluated against the PortaCount® (the reference instrument) using the traditional standard fit testing protocol and following the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard (Z88.10-2010 Annex A2). The evaluation was performed with three types of respirators, N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR), P100 FFR, and half-mask elastomeric facepiece, of different models and manufacturers donned on 25 subjects. The comparative testing and analysis showed that the AccuFIT 9000 is capable of identifying an inadequate fit of the tested respirators with a sensitivity 0.95 and specificity of 0.97, which meets the ANSI requirement of &#8805;0.95. The other ANSI requirements/recommendations were also met. It was concluded that the novel fit testing apparatus demonstrated an acceptable performance and, thus, can be successfully deployed for the quantitative respirator fit testing.","Grinshpun, Sergey A; Yermakov, Michael; Kano, Minoru",Ann.

We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.

However, the patient was continuously treated with the extracorporeal multi-organ- ""ADVanced Organ Support"" (ADVOS) device (ADVITOS GmbH, Munich, Germany). During eight 24h-treatment-sessions blood flow (100-300 mL/min), dialysate flow (160-320 mL/min) and dialysate pH (7.6-9.0) were adapted to optimize arterial PaCO2 and pH. Effective CO2 removal and correction of acidosis could be demonstrated by mean arterial- versus post-dialyzer values of pCO2 (68.7 ± 13.8 vs. 26.9 ± 11.6 mmHg; p < 0.001). The CO2-elimination rate was 48 ± 23mL/min. The initial vasopressor requirement could be reduced in parallel to pH-normalization. Interruptions of ADVOS-treatment repeatedly resulted in reversible deteriorations of paCO2 and pH. After 95 h of continuous extracorporeal decarboxylating therapy the patient had markedly improved circulatory parameters compared to baseline. In the context of secondary pulmonary infection and progressive liver failure, the patient had a sudden cardiac arrest. In accordance with the presumed patient will, we decided against mechanical resuscitation.

Line by line interpreting allows Eye to describe the execution and not only the current state. We also conduct experiments to evaluate the efficacy of Eye for debugging and comprehending a new piece of code. Our findings show that it becomes faster and less frustrating to debug certain problems using this tool, and also makes understanding new code a much more pleasant experience.","Bansal, Aman; Shah, Preey; Shah, Sahil",,300,25

Using 2013-18 deidentified electronic health record data from US primary care practices, we found that provider teams outperformed solo providers, irrespective of team composition. Among solo providers, physicians and nonphysicians exhibited little meaningful difference in performance. As policy makers contemplate scope-of-practice changes, they should consider the effects of not only provider type but also team-based care on outcomes.

The infrared absorbance (IRA) effect of SHAs in active area of the thermopile device is clearly analyzed by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The prototypes are manufactured by the 0.35 µm 2P4M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor micro-electro-mechanical-systems (CMOS-MEMS) process in Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company (TSMC). The measurement results of those prototypes are similar to their simulation results. Based on the simulation technology, more sub-wavelength hole structural effects for IRA of such thermopile device are discussed. It is found from simulation results that the results of SHAs arranged in a hexagonal shape are significantly better than the results of SHAs arranged in a square and the infrared absorption efficiencies (IAEs) of specific asymmetric rectangle and elliptical hole structure arrays are higher than the relatively symmetric square and circular hole structure arrays. The overall best results are respectively up to 3.532 and 3.573 times higher than that without sub-wavelength structure at the target temperature of 60 °C when the minimum structure line width limit of the process is ignored. Obviously, the IRA can be enhanced when the SHAs are considered in active area of the thermopile device and the structural optimization of the SHAs is absolutely necessary.","Chen, Chi-Feng; Shen, Chih-Hsiung; Yeh, Yun-Ying",Sensors (Basel),300,1

The epidermal cells were elongated in shape, the mesophyll cells were thicker and the vascular bundle was not very developed. In somatic embryo-derived leaves the cuticle was thinner than in other leaves and epicuticular wax was present but poorly deposited. In in vitro cultured plants, the deposition of epicuticular wax on the leaves was irregular while in the greenhouse plants it was regular and abundant.

As these drugs are being used in varied regimens and dosages, it is important to enable synthesis of existing safety data from clinical trials. However, availability of safety information is limited by a lack of timely reporting of overall clinical trial results on public registries or through academic publication. We aimed to analyse the evidence gap in this data by conducting a rapid review of results posting on ClinicalTrials.gov and in academic publications to quantify the number of trials missing results for drugs potentially being repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for 19 drugs that have been identified as potential treatments for COVID-19. Relevant clinical trials for any prior indication were listed by identifier (NCT number) and checked for results and for timely result reporting (within 395 days of the primary completion date). Additionally, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify publications of results not listed on the registry. A second, blinded search of 10% of trials was conducted to assess reviewer concordance. RESULTS: Of 3754 completed trials, 1516 (40.4%) did not post results on ClinicalTrials.gov or in the academic literature. Tabular results were available on ClinicalTrials.gov for 1172 (31.2%) completed trials. A further 1066 (28.4%) had published results in the academic literature, but did not report results on ClinicalTrials.gov . Key drugs missing clinical trial results include hydroxychloroquine (37.0% completed trials unreported), favipiravir (77.8%) and lopinavir (40.5%). CONCLUSIONS: There is an important evidence gap for the safety of drugs being repurposed for COVID-19. This uncertainty could cause unnecessary additional morbidity and mortality during the pandemic. We recommend caution in experimental drug use for non-severe disease and urge clinical trial sponsors to report missing results retrospectively.","Rodgers, Florence; Pepperrell, Toby; Keestra, Sarai; Pilkington, Victoria",Trials,300,16

Although PCS significantly recovered by 3-month postinjury, a number of patients still experienced persistent PCS for >1 year. As few researchers investigated long-term PCS endorsement, the present study thus aims to show the latent structure of long-term PCS and further uncover its associating factors. METHODS: In total, 110 patients with MTBI and 32 healthy participants were prospectively enrolled. PCS was evaluated at 2 weeks and long-term evaluations (mean = 2.90 years) after MTBI. In addition, cognitive functions, which include memory, executive function, and information processing, and emotional disturbances, which include depression, anxiety, and irritability, were also examined at 2-week postinjury. RESULTS: Patients reported significantly more PCS at 2-week postinjury than healthy participants did, but PCS significantly improved at long-term evaluations when comparing with PCS at acute stage after MTBI. Both of PCS at 2 weeks and long-term evaluations can be further subdivided into subgroups based on the severity of PCS, in which specific PCS (e.g., fatigue, loss of energy, insomnia, slowness of information processing, irritability, and blurred vision) can be well differentiated among subgroups at long-term evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: This study directly showed the characteristics of long-term PCS and associating factors. It further evidenced that specific physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms might be determinant to identify the subgroups of patients with long-term PCS endorsement.","Hsu, Huan-Hsuan; Lai, Wen-Hsuan; Yu, Hsiu-Ting; Xiao, Sheng-Huang; Tsai, Yi-Hsin; Wang, Kuo-Chuan; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Yang, Chi-Cheng",Arch. clin. neuropsychol,300,2

Mostly, these NMs act effectively against CoVs, thanks to the NMs' fundamental anti-viral structures like reactive oxygen species (ROS), and photo-dynamic and photo-thermal abilities. Particularly, the antiviral activity of AgNMs is clarified under three inhibitory mechanisms including viral entry limitation, attachment inhibition, and viral replication limitation. It is believed that nanobiocide with other possible materials such as TiO2, silica and, carbon NMs exclusively nano-graphene materials can emerge as a more effective disinfectant for long-term stability with low toxicity than common disinfectants. Nanobiocides also can be applied for the prevention and treatment of viral infections specifically against COVID-19.","Khoshnevisan, Kamyar Maleki Hassan Baharifar Hadi",Nanoscale research letters,300,23

Mild illness has been reported, but whether illness severity correlates with infectivity is unknown. We describe the public health investigation of a mildly ill, nonhospitalized COVID-19 case who traveled to China. METHODS: The case was a Maricopa County resident with multiple severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive specimens collected on 22 January 2020. Contacts were persons exposed to the case on or after the day before case diagnostic specimen collection. Contacts were monitored for 14 days after last known exposure. High-risk contacts had close, prolonged case contact (&#8805; 10 minutes within 2 m). Medium-risk contacts wore all US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-recommended personal protective equipment during interactions. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected from the case and high-risk contacts and tested for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Paired case NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing at 11 time points. In 8 pairs (73%), &#8805; 1 specimen tested positive or indeterminate, and in 3 pairs (27%) both tested negative. Specimens collected 18 days after diagnosis tested positive. Sixteen contacts were identified; 11 (69%) had high-risk exposure, including 1 intimate contact, and 5 (31%) had medium-risk exposure. In total, 35 high-risk contact NP/OP specimens were collected for SARS-CoV-2 testing; all 35 pairs (100%) tested negative. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause mild illness and result in positive tests for up to 18 days after diagnosis, without evidence of transmission to close contacts. These data might inform public health strategies to manage individuals with asymptomatic infection or mild illness.","Scott, Sarah E; Zabel, Karen; Collins, Jennifer; Hobbs, Katherine C; Kretschmer, Melissa J; Lach, Mitchell; Turnbow, Katie; Speck, Lindsay; White, Jessica R; Maldonado, Keila; Howard, Brandon; Fowler, Jeanene; Singh, Sonia; Robinson, Susan; Pompa, Alexandra Peterson; Chatham-Stephens, Kevin; Xie, Amy; Cates, Jordan; Lindstrom, Stephen; Lu, Xiaoyan; Rolfes, Melissa A; Flanagan, Marcy; Sunenshine, Rebecca",Clin Infect Dis,300,16

Some studies suggest that listening to music promotes sleep and improves its quality. These studies usually used music standardised at the frequency of 440 Hz. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of listening to music tuned to 440 Hz and music tuned to 432 Hz on sleep in patients with spinal cord injuries. METHODS: Double-blind cross-over pilot study in a single Italian Spinal Unit. 12 patients with spinal injuries were provided with mp3 players loaded with their favourite music tuned to 440 Hz or 432 Hz. They were invited to listen to music for 30 minutes each day, in the two periods of the study. ""Sleep Scale for Medical Study"" modified for this study, and the ""Perceived Stress Scale"" were chosen. RESULTS: The participants were eight males (mean age =58.12, SD ±13.62), and four females (mean age =56.25, SD ±14.17). Five were quadriplegics and seven were paraplegics. Listening times and wash-out periods were variable. The stress decreased, but not significantly, with listening to music at both frequencies. After listening to music at 432 Hz there was a significant improvement in sleep scores (+3.6, p=0.02), while there was no improvement in sleep scores listening to music at 440 Hz (-1.50, p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that further studies on music interventions at 432 Hz should be performed.

It is them who will have to identify and solve global issues regarding transformation and development of the state and society in the future. Great difficulties can arise with a change in the teaching time and regime for students of higher educational institutions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, having moved from classrooms to isolated flats or houses, students were left without a direct, open opportunity to communicate with their peer sand teachers. They had to spend a lot of time at a computer and lead a passive lifestyle, having dramatically changed their usual conditions to self-isolation. Methodology: The current study has been conducted using methods of pedagogical observation, a questionnaire and an online testing. The experimental platform for the study was the physical training (PT) classes at the Russian University of Transport in Moscow. The pedagogical experiment was conducted from September 2019 till May 2020. Results: The conducted online testing has shown a significant decline in the indicators of anxiety in the experimental group (P &lt;0.01) compared with the control group. The results of the current study showed that the students of the experimental group, being trained according to the methodology developed by the authors of the current paper, significantly reduced the indicators of situational anxiety on 32.3%, and personal anxiety on 33.3%. The indicators of situational and personal anxiety among students of the control group were moderate (mean). Conclusions: The effect of the combination of volleyball and oriental health-improving practices on the psycho-emotional state of a person allowed students to reduce the indicators of their situational and general anxiety, which has confirmed a positive effect of oriental health-improving practices combined with sports games on health.","Olga, P.; Irina, S.",Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development,300,24

The aim of this study was to observe clinical characteristics and explore risk factors in COVID-19 patients with liver injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 40 confirmed COVID-19 patients with normal alanine transaminase (ALT) on admission were divided into a group of normal ALT patients whose ALT was always less than 40 U/l during hospitalization and a group of elevated ALT patients whose ALT was at least once more than 40 U/l after admission. Clinical data, especially virus-induced inflammatory parameters, were analyzed for risk factors and predictive value. The Mann-Whitney U test and t test for comparing means and logistic regression were performed for analysis of risk factors. Area under the ROC curve was used for predictive values. RESULTS Sixteen of 40 (40.0%) patients developed elevated ALT, many of them with more severe COVID-19. The highest ALT level was 101 U/l. The risk factors for liver injury were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CD8+T cell count, and severity of disease, and CRP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.045-1.222, p=0.002) was the independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS Liver injury in COVID-19 patients was mild and associated with inflammatory markers, especially CRP, which suggests that liver injury may be induced by virus-mediated inflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Dali; Zhu, Zhenyu; Bi, Jingfeng; Feng, Danni; Zhang, Lijuan; Liu, Hongling; Gao, Yinjie",Med Sci Monit,300,16

This is the case during the current pandemic of COVID-19. This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, resulting in pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This results in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. Due to the overload of the health services, portable X-ray devices are recommended during the pandemic, preventing the spread of the disease. However, these devices entail different complications (such as capture quality) that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more difficult and suggest the necessity for computer-aided diagnosis methodologies despite the scarcity of samples available to do so. To solve this problem, we propose a methodology that allows to adapt the knowledge from a well-known domain with a high number of samples to a new domain with a significantly reduced number and greater complexity. We took advantage of a pre-trained segmentation model from brain magnetic resonance imaging of a unrelated pathology and performed two stages of knowledge transfer to obtain a robust system able to segment lung regions from portable X-ray devices despite the scarcity of samples and lesser quality. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy of 0.9761 ± 0.0100 for patients with COVID-19, 0.9801 ± 0.0104 for normal patients and 0.9769 ± 0.0111 for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.","Vidal, Plácido L; Moura, Joaquim; Novo, Jorge; Ortega, Marcos",Expert Syst Appl,300,23

Developed countries, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, had their highly efficient medical infrastructure greatly stressed and suffered from high death tolls. Similarly, Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken South Asian country, is losing its battle against the pandemic, but mainly because of its incompetent healthcare system. The casualties are escalating and public sufferings are becoming unimaginable. On this backdrop, this perspective piece discusses the healthcare crisis in Bangladesh during the pandemic. This article also identifies three responsible issues for the country's deteriorating health care: 1) poor governance and increased corruption, 2) inadequate healthcare facilities, and 3) weak public health communication.","Al-Zaman, Md Sayeed",Am J Trop Med Hyg,300,16

The purpose of this study is to estimate national hospital reimbursement and net income losses owing to elective surgical procedure cancellation during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample and the Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample were used to identify all elective surgical procedures performed in the inpatient setting and in hospital-owned outpatient surgery departments throughout the United States. Total cost, reimbursement, and net income was determined for all elective surgical procedures. RESULTS: The estimated total annual cost of elective inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures in the United States was $147.2 billion, and estimated total hospital reimbursement was $195.4 to $212.2 billion. This resulted in a net income of $48.0 to $64.8 billion per year to the US hospital system. Cancellation of all elective procedures would result in estimated losses of $16.3 to $17.7 billion per month in revenue and $4 to $5.4 billion per month in net income to US hospitals. CONCLUSION: Cancellation of elective procedures during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has a substantial economic impact on the US hospital system.","Best, Matthew J; McFarland, Edward G; Anderson, Gerard F; Srikumaran, Uma",Surgery,300,1

Efficacy and safety of TMPRSS2 inhibitors in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have not been evaluated in randomized trials. Methods: We conducted an investigator-initiated, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial in patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 4, to December 31, 2020. Within 48 h of admission, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat mesilate 200 mg three times daily for 5 days or placebo. The primary outcome was time to discharge or clinical improvement measured as &#8805;2 points improvement on a 7-point ordinal scale. Other outcomes included 30-day mortality, safety and change in oropharyngeal viral load. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04321096. EudraCT Number: 2020-001,200-42. Findings: 137 patients were assigned to receive camostat mesilate and 68 to placebo. Median time to clinical improvement was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 3 to 7) in the camostat group and 5 days (IQR, 2 to 10) in the placebo group (P = 0·31). The hazard ratio for 30-day mortality in the camostat compared with the placebo group was 0·82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0·24 to 2·79; P = 0·75). The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. Median change in viral load from baseline to day 5 in the camostat group was -0·22 log10 copies/mL (p <0·05) and -0·82 log10 in the placebo group (P <0·05). Interpretation: Under this protocol, camostat mesilate treatment was not associated with increased adverse events during hospitalization for Covid-19 and did not affect time to clinical improvement, progression to ICU admission or mortality.","Gunst, Jesper D; Staerke, Nina B; Pahus, Marie H; Kristensen, Lena H; Bodilsen, Jacob; Lohse, Nicolai; Dalgaard, Lars S; Brønnum, Dorthe; Fröbert, Ole; Hønge, Bo; Johansen, Isik S; Monrad, Ida; Erikstrup, Christian; Rosendal, Regitze; Vilstrup, Emil; Mariager, Theis; Bove, Dorthe G; Offersen, Rasmus; Shakar, Shakil; Cajander, Sara; Jørgensen, Nis P; Sritharan, Sajitha S; Breining, Peter; Jespersen, Søren; Mortensen, Klaus L; Jensen, Mads L; Kolte, Lilian; Frattari, Giacomo S; Larsen, Carsten S; Storgaard, Merete; Nielsen, Lars P; Tolstrup, Martin; Sædder, Eva A; Østergaard, Lars J; Ngo, Hien T T; Jensen, Morten H; Højen, Jesper F; Kjolby, Mads; Søgaard, Ole S",EClinicalMedicine,300,6

To date, no structure of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nsp7:nsp8 complex has been published. The current understanding of this complex is based on structures from truncated constructs, with missing electron densities, or from related CoV species where SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 share upward of 90% sequence identity. Despite available structures solved using crystallography and cryo-EM representing detailed static snapshots of the nsp7:nsp8 complex, it is evident that the complex has a high degree of structural plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the conformational dynamics of the individual proteins and how they complex to interact with other nsps. Here, the solution-based structural proteomic techniques, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS), illuminate the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 full-length nsp7 and nsp8 proteins and the nsp7:nsp8 protein complex. Results presented from the two techniques are complementary and validate the interaction surfaces identified from the published three-dimensional heterotetrameric crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 truncated nsp7:nsp8 complex. Furthermore, mapping of XL-MS data onto higher-order complexes suggests that SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 do not assemble into a hexadecameric structure as implied by the SARS-CoV full-length nsp7:nsp8 crystal structure. Instead, our results suggest that the nsp7:nsp8 heterotetramer can dissociate into a stable dimeric unit that might bind to nsp12 in the RTC without significantly altering nsp7-nsp8 interactions.","Courouble, Valentine V; Dey, Sanjay Kumar; Yadav, Ruchi; Timm, Jennifer; Harrison, Jerry Joe E K; Ruiz, Francesc X; Arnold, Eddy; Griffin, Patrick R",J Am Soc Mass Spectrom,300,22

Faculty and students encountered many challenges to ensure the integrity and continuity of the medical education process. Going completely online seemed unachievable. There are still many Schools of Medicine worldwide with the traditional curriculum where live lectures are the center of the instruction. In the USA most of the schools of medicine have moved to a more integrated curriculum, some of them have stopped given lectures and others moved to video-casted lectures. Many courses in the preclinical medical curriculum were easier to transition to Virtual learning in the majority of the universities. Good examples are physiology, histology and pathology. Unfortunately, in the other hand Anatomy presented more difficulties everywhere. Outside the USA most Universities had to stop dissections and prosections. Instructors had to rapidly adapt to the changes. This crisis has highlighted the necessity to have the medical educators trained to use the technology available and the creation of their own multimedia teaching materials. The schools which were already using more technology and having access to a reliable internet connection were much prepared to succeed. Remarkably few universities were able to use prosections and allowed the students to review them taking all the necessary precautions. Nevertheless to achieve this the instructors have to prepare 3 or more times the prosections needed in a normal year. Unfortunately, only during the clerkships especially in the course of surgical rotations we will know the consequences of missing the opportunity to have dissected a body.

Using a methodology based on modified age-stratified transmission dynamics model, we estimated the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children (individuals 0-11 years) in Ontario, Canada when a large proportion of individuals eligible for vaccination (age 12 and above) are vaccinated to achieve herd immunity among this subpopulation, or the effective herd immunity with additional physical distancing measures (hence effective herd immunity). We describe the relationship between this attack ratio among children, the time to remove infected individuals from the transmission chain and the children-to-children daily contact rate, while considering the increased transmissibility of virus variants (using the Delta variant as an example). We further illustrate the generality and applicability of the methodology established by performing an analysis of the attack ratio of COVID-19 among children in the Canadian population. The clinical attack ratio, the number of symptomatic infections over the total population can be informed from the attack ratio, and both can be reduced substantially via a combination of higher vaccine coverage in the vaccine eligible population, reduced social mixing among children, and rapid testing and isolation.","Wu, Jianhong; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Scarabel, Francesca; McCarthy, Zachary; David, Jummy; Group, - LIAMADERSIM COVID-19 Reopening and Recovery Modeling",,300,20

METHODS: Multiple databases from 1 January 2019 to 3 December 2020 were searched for observational studies evaluating the association between vitamin D deficiency and severity of COVID-19 infection. Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data for the review. The main outcomes of interest were mortality, hospital admission, length of hospital stay and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: Seventeen observational studies with 2756 patients were included in the analyses. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with significantly higher mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 2.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-4.05; 12 studies; hazard ratio [HR]: 4.11, 95% CI: 2.40-7.04; 3 studies), higher rates of hospital admissions (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.48-3.21; 3 studies) and longer hospital stays (0.52 days; 95% CI: 0.25-0.80; 2 studies) as compared to nonvitamin D deficient status.

Care Quality Commission's care quality ratings are given to all English care homes and could be used to identify whether care homes are at risk of COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: An audit was performed, April 2020, of Liverpool care homes to identify associations between COVID-19 status and care quality ratings from the Care Quality Commission. Univariable logistic regression was performed to identify whether the Care Quality Commissions ratings were associated with a care home experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak, or a home having asymptomatic cases. FINDINGS: Over half of the care homes (53.2%, n=41), had laboratory-confirmed clinical cases and 39 (95.1%) of these were reported as outbreaks. A small number of care homes (10.4%, n=8) had asymptomatic cases and over a third had no clinical or asymptomatic cases (36.4%, n=28). There was no significant difference between the overall Care Quality Commission rating of Liverpool and English care homes (p=0.57). There was no significant association between any of the Care Quality Commission rating domains and the presence of COVID-19 outbreaks and/or asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, Care Quality Commission ratings were not associated with COVID-19 outbreaks or asymptomatic cases in care homes. Infection prevention and control components of Care Quality Commission ratings need to be strengthened to identify care homes at a potential risk of infectious disease outbreaks that may require targeted support.

The researchers conducted a political discourse analysis on 239 transcripts from the press briefings of President Trump and seven U.S. governors to determine the extent to which the research subjects used effective crisis leadership and communication. These results suggest that President Trump and Governors DeSantis, DeWine, Ducey, and Ivey are particularly vulnerable to political fallout for their handling of COVID-19 because stakeholders might view them as inattentive to the crisis and ineffective in their policy responses. Governors Cuomo, Newsom, and Whitmer may be in a better position to avoid fallout due to their information-seeking, hands-on approaches, which some will deem as competent and appropriate to the threat (although others may see their efforts as over-controlling). The research demonstrated how discourse analysis could predict political behaviors and blame assignment for crisis responses. © 2021 The Author(s).

The purpose of this study was to summarize the clinical experiences and explore the risk factors for post-operative recurrence through a retrospective analysis to develop better clinical strategies for pediatric DTC. METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed children and adolescents with DTC who were treated between January 1999 and December 2014 at the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Clinicopathological results and outcomes were collected. A log-rank test of Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox regression model were used to determine the factors associated with recurrence. RESULTS: Data of 150 patients were collected in this study. During the follow-up, there was only one disease-related death. The recurrence rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 13.6%, 18.7%, and 28.6%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the rate of recurrence according to age (Pâ<â0.001), extrathyroidal extension (Pâ<â0.001), lymph node metastasis (Pâ=â0.023), and invasion of the trachea and esophageal wall (Pâ=â0.004). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that age (Pâ=â0.006) and extrathyroidal extension (Pâ=â0.013) were significant dependent factors of post-operative recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of DTC in children and adolescents is favorable. A close follow-up is recommended because of the high recurrence rate. A comparatively higher recurrence rate was observed in the younger age group, and new age-based divisions may be needed to conveniently evaluate the possibility of recurrence.","Wang, Xing; Wang, Xiao-Lei",Chin Med J (Engl),300,20

The pandemic is accelerating the use of remote psychotherapy (ie, psychotherapy provided via telephone or the internet). However, some psychotherapists have expressed reservations regarding remote psychotherapy. As psychotherapists are the individuals who determine the frequency of use of remote psychotherapy, the potential of enabling mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with the protective measures to fight COVID-19 can be realized only if psychotherapists are willing to use remote psychotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the experiences of psychotherapists with remote psychotherapy in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria (between March 24 and April 1, 2020). METHODS: Austrian psychotherapists were invited to take part in a web-based survey. The therapeutic orientations of the psychotherapists (behavioral, humanistic, psychodynamic, or systemic), their rating of the comparability of remote psychotherapy (web- or telephone-based) with face-to-face psychotherapy involving personal contact, and potential discrepancies between their actual experiences and previous expectations with remote psychotherapy were assessed. Data from 1162 psychotherapists practicing before and during the COVID-19 lockdown were analyzed. RESULTS: Psychotherapy conducted via telephone or the internet was reported to not be totally comparable to psychotherapy with personal contact (P<.001). Psychodynamic (P=.001) and humanistic (P=.005) therapists reported a higher comparability of telephone-based psychotherapy to in-person psychotherapy than behavioral therapists. Experiences with remote therapy (both web- and telephone-based) were more positive than previously expected (P<.001). Psychodynamic therapists reported more positive experiences with telephone-based psychotherapy than expected compared to behavioral (P=.03) and systemic (P=.002) therapists. In general, web-based psychotherapy was rated more positively (regarding comparability to psychotherapy with personal contact and experiences vs expectations) than telephone-based psychotherapy (P<.001); however, psychodynamic therapists reported their previous expectations to be equal to their actual experiences for both telephone- and web-based psychotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotherapists found their experiences with remote psychotherapy (ie, web- or telephone-based psychotherapy) to be better than expected but found that this mode was not totally comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy with personal contact. Especially, behavioral therapists were found to rate telephone-based psychotherapy less favorably than therapists with other theoretical backgrounds.","Humer, Elke; Stippl, Peter; Pieh, Christoph; Pryss, Rüdiger; Probst, Thomas",J Med Internet Res,300,16

This deadly virus is infecting people rapidly and has targeted 4.93 million people across the world, with 227â¯K people being infected only in Italy. Cases of nCOV are quickly increasing whereas the number of nCOV test kits available in hospitals are limited. Under these conditions, an automated system for the classification of patients into nCOV positive and negative cases, is a much needed tool against the pandemic, helping in a selective use of the limited number of test kits. In this research, Convolutional Neural Network-based models (one block VGG, two block VGG, three block VGG, four block VGG, LetNet-5, AlexNet, and Resnet-50) have been employed for the detection of Corona-virus and SARS_MERS infected patients, distinguishing them from the healthy subjects, using lung X-ray scans, which has proven to be a challenging task, due to overlapping characteristics of different corona virus types. Furthermore, LSTM model has been used for time series forecasting of nCOV cases, in the following 10 days, in Italy. The evaluation results obtained, proved that the VGG1 model distinguishes the three classes at an accuracy of almost 91%, as compared to other models, whereas the approach based on the LSTM predicts the number of nCOV cases with 99% accuracy.","Younis, Mohammed Chachan",Comput Med Imaging Graph,300,1

Here, we report hematite, an earth-abundant material, to be highly effective and thermally stable to catalyze methane combustion at low temperatures (<500 °C) with a low light-off temperature of 230 °C and 100% selectivity to CO2. The reported performance is impressive and comparable to those of precious-metal-based catalysts, with a low apparent activation energy of 17.60 kcal·mol-1. Our theoretical analysis shows that the excellent performance stems from a tetra-iron center with an antiferromagnetically coupled iron dimer on the hematite (110) surface, analogous to that of the methanotroph enzyme methane monooxygenase that activates methane at ambient conditions in nature. Isotopic oxygen tracer experiments support a Mars van Krevelen redox mechanism where CH4 is activated by reaction with a hematite surface oxygen first, followed by a catalytic cycle through a molecular-dioxygen-assisted pathway. Surface studies with in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the evolution of reaction intermediates from a methoxy CH3-O-Fe, to a bridging bidentate formate b-HCOO-Fe, to a monodentate formate m-HCOO-Fe, before CO2 is eventually formed via a combination of thermal hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) and proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. The elucidation of the reaction mechanism and the intermediate evolutionary profile may allow future development of catalytic syntheses of oxygenated products from CH4 in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.","He, Yulian; Guo, Facheng; Yang, Ke R; Heinlein, Jake A; Bamonte, Scott M; Fee, Jared J; Hu, Shu; Suib, Steven L; Haller, Gary L; Batista, Victor S; Pfefferle, Lisa D",j. am. chem. soc,300,1

During January-May 2020, 1,253 patients suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited for testing. Simultaneously, based on retrospective contact tracings, PHCs investigated the infection sources and transmission routes of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and tested 928 contacts. Consequently, 69 cases were confirmed during March 31 - May 4, 58 (84.1%; 95% confidence interval 75.5-92.7) of whom were found from contacts. The spread of infection was triggered by cases harboring epidemiological links outside of Yamagata. Then, the number of cases increased rapidly. However, PHCs identified epidemiological links in 61 (88.4%; 95% confidence interval 80.8-96.0) of the 69 cases and transmission chains up to the fifth generation. Finally, the spread of infection ended after approximately one month. Our results indicate that the identification of infection sources and active case finding from contacts based on retrospective contact tracing was likely to be an effective strategy to end the first wave of COVID-19 in Yamagata.","Seto, Junji; Aoki, Yoko; Komabayashi, Kenichi; Ikeda, Yoko; Sampei, Mika; Ogawa, Naomi; Uchiumi, Yumiko; Fujii, Shunji; Chiba, Masami; Suzuki, Emiko; Takahashi, Tatsuya; Yamada, Keiko; Otani, Yoshiko; Ashino, Yoshihiro; Araki, Kyoko; Kato, Takeo; Ishikawa, Hitoshi; Ikeda, Tatsuya; Abe, Hideaki; Ahiko, Tadayuki; Mizuta, Katsumi",Jpn. j. infect. dis,300,23

This offers excellent opportunities to learn more about the influence of children's sociocultural environments on their development and mental health. A particular challenge when studying risk factors across cultures and populations is that the risk associated with a particular exposure may depend on its prevalence: rarity tends to aggravate impact. This phenomenon complicates not only comparisons across cultures, but also those across subpopulations and time periods within a population. Moreover, it may counteract the effectiveness of risk-reducing public health efforts. On the bright side, the extent to which the impact of a risk factor is determined by its rarity provides researchers with valuable tools to deepen and sharpen theories about the nature and working mechanisms of that risk factor, with prevention and treatment strategies that also benefit youth in exceptional conditions as a likely consequence.","Oldehinkel, Albertine J",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,300,28

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary academic center. A national survey of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was administered. Descriptive analyses were performed to determine how telehealth was employed in otolaryngologists' practices. Results: A total of 184 surveys were completed. Telehealth technology was used by 50% of otolaryngologists surveyed. Regions with the largest percentage of physicians using telehealth were the Mid-Atlantic region (84%) and West Coast (67%). Most otolaryngologists indicated that they were familiar with telehealth or any of its components and how it is used in practice (52-83%), they had heard of telehealth or any of its components but were unsure what the terms specifically entailed (17-42%); 53% were satisfied with their current use of telehealth and electronic medical record (EMR); and 72% were comfortable utilizing smart devices for patient care. Most otolaryngologists (65%) indicated reimbursement as the biggest limitation to implementing telehealth, and 67% believed that typing was a hindrance to EMR utility. Conclusion: Half of the surveyed otolaryngologists used some form of telehealth at the time of the survey. The most commonly cited obstacle to physician adoption of telehealth was reimbursement. Although the adoption of telehealth technology was still limited in the field of otolaryngology based on this study, we are now seeing significant change due to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, James C; Elson, Nora C; Epperson, Madison V; Doarn, Charles R; Altaye, Mekibib; Tabangin, Meredith E; Patil, Reena Dhanda; Patil, Yash J",Telemed. j. e. health,300,24

Stress occurs and has potential of negative effects on tasks, teamwork, prioritization processes and cognitive control. Stress is not exclusively dictated by the situation-the individuals rate the situation of having the necessary skills that a particular situation demands. There are different occupational groups in the emergency medical services in Germany. Training, tasks and legal framework of these groups vary. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify professional group-specific stressors for emergency medical services. These stress situations can be used to design skills building tools to enable individuals to cope with these stressors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The participants were invited to the study via posters and social media. An expert group (minimum 6 months of experience) developed a set of items via a two-step online Delphi survey. The experts were recruited from all professional groups represented in the German emergency medical service. We evaluated the resulting parameters for relevance and validity in a larger collective. Lastly, we identified stress factors that could be grouped in relevant scales. In total 1017 participants (paramedics, physicians) took part in the final validation survey. RESULTS: After validation, we identified a catalogue of stressors with 7 scales and 25 items for EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) paramedics (KMO [Kayser-Meyer-Olkin criterion] 0.81), 6 scales and 24 items for advanced paramedics (KMO 0.82) and 6 scales and 24 items for EMS (Emergency Medical Service) physicians (KMO 0.82). For the professional group of EMT basic, the quality parameters did not allow further processing of the items. Professional group-specific scales for EMT paramedics are ""professional limitations"", ""organizational framework"", ""expectations"" and ""questions of meaning"". For advanced paramedics ""appreciation"", ""exceptional circumstances"" and ""legal certainty"" were identified. The EMT physicians named ""handling third parties"", ""tolerance to ambiguity"", ""task management"" and ""pressure to act"". A scale that is representative for all professional groups is ""teamwork"". Organizational circumstances occur in all groups. The item ""unnecessary missions"" for EMT paramedics and ""legal concerns with the application of methods"" for advanced paramedics are examples. DISCUSSION: Different stressors are relevant for the individual professional groups in the German emergency medical service. The developed catalogue can be used in the future to evaluate the subjective stress load of emergency service professionals. There are stressors that are inherent in the working environment (e.g. pressure to act) and others that can be improved through training (teamwork). We recommend training of general resistance as well as training of specific items (e.g., technical, nontechnical skills). All professionals mentioned items with respect to organizational factors. The responsible persons can identify potential for improvement based on the legal and organizational items. The EMT basic requires further subdivision according to task areas due to its variable applicability.","Eismann, Hendrik; Sieg, Lion; Palmaers, Thomas; Hagemann, Vera; Flentje, Markus",Anaesthesist,300,29

In this work, we develop a microfluidic chip formed by HGPS-SMCs generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), to study their vulnerability to flow shear stress. HGPS-iPSC SMCs cultured under arterial flow conditions detach from the chip after a few days of culture; this process is mediated by the upregulation of metalloprotease 13 (MMP13). Importantly, double-mutant LmnaG609G/G609GMmp13-/- mice or LmnaG609G/G609GMmp13+/+ mice treated with a MMP inhibitor show lower SMC loss in the aortic arch than controls.

In our department, remote consultations have taken in the form of telephone consultations. In this paper, we set out to study a group of Irish psychiatrists' experience of these consultations. METHODS: We identified recurrent themes in the existing literature on doctors' experience of telephone consultations with a view to determining the applicability of these themes to a group of Irish psychiatrists. A questionnaire was developed based on themes in the literature. This was sent to all psychiatrists working in a busy psychiatric service in Dublin. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 72% (n = 26/35). Diagnostic challenges, the effect of phone consultation on the therapeutic alliance, challenges associated with the use of technology and ethical concerns were identified as issues. Flexibility in the working day and convenience were identified as possible benefits to telephone consultations. CONCLUSIONS: The group that participated in this research study identified a number of challenges to carrying out successful phone consultations. This study highlights the need at our clinical site for interventions to address the issues identified by staff. The findings also highlight the requirement for larger studies with stronger methodologies to determine the generalisability of our results.","Olwill, C; Mc Nally, D; Douglas, L",Ir J Psychol Med,300,16

They are involved in various physiological events, such as protein degradation, development, and host defense. However, the characterization and functional roles of aspartic proteinases remain to be elucidated in crustaceans. Here, we characterized a fragment of cathepsin D-like cDNA from red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii (Pc-cathepsin D-like). The open reading frame of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene contained 1152 bp, encoding a protein of 383 amino acid residues. We also evaluated the immunological role of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene in vivo. Spatial distribution analysis revealed that the Pc-cathepsin D-like mRNA was high in the hepatopancreas, followed by the gut, gills, and hemocytes of P. clarkii. The expression levels of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene increased following challenge with viral (polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid) and bacterial (lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycan) PAMPs compared with PBS injection. The suppression of the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene by RNA interference significantly increased the expression of immune-associated genes. These results showed that the Pc-cathepsin D-like gene has an essential biological role in innate immune responses because it regulates the expression of immune-associated genes.","Huang, Long; Wu, Ben-Li; He, Ji-Xiang; Zhang, Ye; Chen, Jing; Chen, Xia-Jun",Genome,300,23

The effect of these changes is yet to be fully understood. Here, we analysed highly detailed data on 169 participants for two to six months, before and during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Israel. We extracted 12 well-being indicators from sensory data of smartwatches and from self-reported questionnaires, filled daily using a designated mobile application. We found that, in general, lockdowns resulted in significant changes in mood, sleep duration, sport duration, social encounters, resting heart rate and number of steps. Examining subpopulations, we found that younger participants (aged 20-40 years) suffered from a greater decline in mood and number of steps than older participants (aged 60-80 years). Likewise, women suffered from a higher increase in stress and reduction in social encounters than men. Younger early chronotypes did not increase their sleep duration and exhibited the highest drop in mood. Our findings underscore that while lockdowns severely impacted our well-being and physiology in general, greater damage has been identified in certain subpopulations. Accordingly, special attention should be given to younger people, who are usually not in the focus of social support, and to women.","Oved, Shay; Mofaz, Merav; Lan, Anat; Einat, Haim; Kronfeld-Schor, Noga; Yamin, Dan; Shmueli, Erez",J R Soc Interface,300,16

DESIGN: the study introduces a SEIR compartmental model, taking into account the region-specific fraction of undetected cases, the effects of mobility restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature. RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions. Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection, determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed and manageable one.

On one hand, viruses completely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of host cells to propagate and have evolved various mechanisms to redirect the host's ribosomes toward their viral mRNAs. On the other hand, the host rewires its translation program in an attempt to contain and suppress the virus early on during infection; the antiviral program includes specific control on protein synthesis to translate several antiviral mRNAs involved in quenching the infection. As the infection progresses, host translation is in turn inhibited in order to limit viral propagation. We have learnt of very diverse strategies that both parties utilize to gain or retain control over the protein synthesis machinery. Yet novel strategies continue to be discovered, attesting for the importance of mRNA translation in virus-host interaction. This review focuses on recently described translation strategies employed by both hosts and viruses.

The secondary goal was to reach 100% documentation of telemedicine consent. The tertiary goal was to analyze patient satisfaction scores. An additional goal was to estimate CO2 emissions prevented from being produced. The period from 3/16/2020-4/15/2020 was targeted. The initial intervention involved transitioning surveillance visits. A second intervention, with nursing and advanced-practice-provider support, included transitioning additional visit types, and distributing a note template. The Telehealth Satisfaction Survey (TeSS) was administered to patients. Descriptive statistics and run charts were used to analyze and depict results. Within four weeks, there were 408 encounters; 217 were telemedicine (53.2%). Following the second intervention, 13 of 15 days (86.7%) reached the 50% telemedicine target and consent was documented in 96.6% of the telemedicine encounters. The TeSS had a 74.8% response-rate. Patients rated the following aspects of the telemedicine encounter as good or excellent: call quality (96.5%), personal comfort (92.9%), length-of-visit (94.7%), treatment explanation (93.8%), overall experience (88.5%). Moreover, 82.3% of patients would use telemedicine again. Additionally, 6.25 metric tons of CO2 emissions from travel were prevented from being produced. A GynOnc clinic can rapidly implement telemedicine systems. With multidisciplinary team planning and standardized note templates, transitioning 50% of encounters to telemedicine and achieving high rates of consent documentation were accomplished in four weeks. This increase in telemedicine represented a measurable decrease in the amount of CO2 emissions. Additionally, patients were overwhelmingly satisfied.","Mojdehbakhsh, Rachel P; Rose, Stephen; Peterson, Megan; Rice, Laurel; Spencer, Ryan",Gynecol Oncol Rep,300,33

This is particularly important in high-risk procedures like dental treatment. The present randomized control trial evaluated the efficacy of three commercial mouth-rinse viz. povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), in reducing the salivary SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients compared with water. METHODS: A total of 36 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were recruited, of which 16 patients were randomly assigned to four groups-PI group (n = 4), CHX group (n = 6), CPC group (n = 4) and water as control group (n = 2). Saliva samples were collected from all patients at baseline and at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h post-application of mouth-rinses/water. The samples were subjected to SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Comparison of salivary Ct values of patients within each group of PI, CHX, CPC and water at 5 min, 3 h and 6 h time points did not show any significant differences. However, when the Ct value fold change of each of the mouth-rinse group patients were compared with the fold change of water group patients at the respective time points, a significant increase was observed in the CPC group patients at 5 min and 6 h and in the PI group patients at 6 h. CONCLUSION: The effect of decreasing salivary load with CPC and PI mouth-rinsing was observed to be sustained at 6 h time point. Within the limitation of the current study, as number of the samples analyzed, the use of CPC and PI formulated that commercial mouth-rinses may be useful as a pre-procedural rinse to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

METHODS: Paediatric oncology, infectious diseases and emergency medicine health-care workers and parent/carers were surveyed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on home-based FN care. Online surveys were distributed nationally to health-care workers involved in care of children with FN and to parents or carers of children with cancer. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 78 health-care workers and 32 parents/carers. Overall, 95% of health-care workers had confidence in the safety of home-based FN care, with 35% reporting changes at their own hospitals in response to the pandemic that made them more comfortable with this model. Compared to pre-pandemic, >50% of parent/carers were now more worried about attending the hospital with their child and >80% were interested in receiving home-based FN care. Among both groups, increased telehealth access and acceptance of home-based care, improved patient quality of life and reduced risk of nosocomial infection were identified as programme enablers, while re-direction of resources due to COVID-19 and challenges in implementing change during a crisis were potential barriers. CONCLUSION: There is strong clinician and parent/carer support for home-based management of low-risk FN across Australia.

The USA has the highest recognized number of Covid19 infections globally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 has not been well characterized in large samples of PwMS to date. The MS patient perspective on COVID-19 would complement the physician-reported cases of MS and COVID-19 in the literature. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of adult PwMS was performed online, using the U.S.-based patient-powered iConquerMS&#8482; platform, in April 2020. RESULTS: There were 1,145 respondents (response rate: 20%). 1,019 had a diagnosis of MS and responded completely (average age: 54.2 years, range: 20-81; 79% female; 64% relapsing remitting, 22% secondary progressive, 12% primary progressive; 88% in the USA). 748 (73%) used a DMT in the last year, primarily higher-efficacy therapies: ocrelizumab (n=238), dimethyl fumarate (n=85), fingolimod (n=80). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (41%), hypertension (26%), and asthma (12%). Women were more worried than men about COVID-19 (p=0.001); non-white-identifying PwMS believed it was a greater danger to their health than white-identifying PwMS (p=0.002). Through the continuum of symptoms to care, 61% of PwMS (n=617) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, 39% (n=395) knew someone exposed to COVID-19, 4% (n=38) were aware of a personal COVID-19 exposure, 13% (n=128) wanted testing for COVID-19 but could not access it, and 4% (n=43) were tested. Specific to their MS care, 64% (n=650) canceled a medical visit, 22% (n=222) canceled a neurologist visit, 11% (n=112) canceled an MRI, 21% (n=212) canceled a laboratory test, and 10% (n=98) changed their DMT in some way due to COVID19 including 65 delaying at least one dose. 37% (n=382) had a telehealth visit due to COVID-19. 37% of PwMS (n=374) experienced employment changes, most commonly working from home (n=194) and having work hours reduced (n=65) while 32 lost their jobs. Of the 7 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 (<1% of participants) (5 female; age range: 29-64 years), DMTs included dimethyl fumarate (n=2), ocrelizumab (n=1), rituximab (n=1), and a clinical trial drug (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of people with MS reported interruptions to their MS care along the MS care pathway alongside limited access to COVID-19 testing. Postponements and delays in care were common with 10% of participants reporting a change in their DMT administration. Less than 1% of this self-referred convenience online cohort had a positive test for COVID-19 although more than half reported symptoms that are associated with COVID-19.","Vogel, Andre C; Schmidt, Hollie; Loud, Sara; McBurney, Robert; Mateen, Farrah J",Mult Scler Relat Disord,300,26

A mask manufacturer often receives a large amount of orders that are beyond its capability. Therefore, it is of critical importance for the manufacturer to schedule mask production tasks as efficiently as possible. However, existing scheduling methods typically require a considerable amount of computational resources and, therefore, cannot effectively cope with the surge of orders. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end neural network for scheduling real-time production tasks. The neural network takes a sequence of production tasks as inputs to predict a distribution over different schedules, employs reinforcement learning to optimize network parameters using the negative total tardiness as the reward signal, and finally produces a high-quality solution to the scheduling problem. We applied the proposed approach to schedule emergency production tasks for a medical mask manufacturer during the peak of COVID-19 in China. Computational results show that the neural network scheduler can solve problem instances with hundreds of tasks within seconds. The objective function value (i.e., the total weighted tardiness) produced by the neural network scheduler is significantly better than those of existing constructive heuristics, and is very close to those of the state-of-the-art metaheuristics whose computational time is unaffordable in practice.","Wu, Chen-Xin; Liao, Min-Hui; Karatas, Mumtaz; Chen, Sheng-Yong; Zheng, Yu-Jun",,300,16

It is necessary to find a molecular signature that differentiates between low-risk and high-risk individuals. Pathogens, including viruses of the upper respiratory tract, utilize mucin proteins to enter into host cells. Mucins are critical components of innate immunity and also play important roles in infectious disease progression. Their expression is regulated by different cytokines during infection and inflammation. A comparison of mucin signatures between an asymptomatic versus symptomatic and between patients with mild versus severe symptoms could help identify other important proteins involved in the pathology of this new virus. Recent studies on the pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 have found receptors that help its entry into the cells. In this review, we present an overview of how mucins are connected to the pathogenicity of the virus and propose that studying the glycome and mucin signature may lead to the development of a biomarker in predicting the susceptibility, progression, and response to therapy in COVID-19 patients.","Bose, Mukulika; Mitra, Bhaskar; Mukherjee, Pinku",Physiol Rep,300,24

To overcome these challenges the development of synthetic nanocarriers has been widely explored for brain tumor treatment but unfortunately with no clinical translation until date. The use of cell-derived nanocarriers or biomimetic nanocarriers has been studied in the last few years, considering their innate bio-interfacing properties. The ability to carry therapeutic agents and a higher selectivity towards brain tumors would bring new hope for the development of safe and effective treatments. In this review, we explore the biological barriers that need to be crossed for effective delivery in brain tumors, and the types and properties of cell-based nanocarriers (extracellular vesicles and cell-membrane coated nanocarriers) currently under investigation.","Mendanha, D; Vieira de Castro, J; Ferreira, H; Neves, N M",J Control Release,300,1

Statins have anti-inflammatory effects and may attenuate the severity of COVID-19. Methods and Results An observational study of all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to a single center located in Bronx, New York, was conducted from March 1, 2020, to May 2, 2020. Patients were grouped as those who did and those who did not receive a statin, and in-hospital mortality was compared by competing events regression. In addition, propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting were used in survival models to examine the association between statin use and death during hospitalization. A total of 4252 patients were admitted with COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus modified the association between statin use and in-hospital mortality. Patients with diabetes mellitus on a statin (n=983) were older (69±11 versus 67±14 years; P<0.01), had lower inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, 10.2; interquartile range, 4.5-18.4 versus 12.9; interquartile range, 5.9-21.4 mg/dL; P<0.01) and reduced cumulative in-hospital mortality (24% versus 39%; P<0.01) than those not on a statin (n=1283). No difference in hospital mortality was noted in patients without diabetes mellitus on or off statin (20% versus 21%; P=0.82). Propensity score matching (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83-0.94; P<0.01) and inverse probability treatment weighting (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84-0.92; P<0.01) showed a 12% lower risk of death during hospitalization for statin users than for nonusers. Conclusions Statin use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings, if validated, may further reemphasize administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 era.","Saeed, Omar; Castagna, Francesco; Agalliu, Ilir; Xue, Xiaonan; Patel, Snehal R; Rochlani, Yogita; Kataria, Rachna; Vukelic, Sasa; Sims, Daniel B; Alvarez, Chikezie; Rivas-Lasarte, Mercedes; Garcia, Mario J; Jorde, Ulrich P",J Am Heart Assoc,300,11

METHODS: The Greek version of the MSTS for the lower extremity and TESS questionnaires was developed using previously reported methods. Included were 100 patients with musculoskeletal sarcoma who underwent limb salvage surgery. The test-retest reliability [interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between 2 different time points], internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), construct validity (Kaiser's criteria, Eigenvalue > 1 rule), and external validity (Short form-36, Spearman's Rho) were assessed. RESULTS: The test-retest reliability (ICC was 0.99 for MSTS-LE and 1 for TESS) and internal consistency were high (Cronbach's alpha was 0.763 for MSTS-LE and 0.924 for TESS) for both questionnaires. Based on the Scree plot, the number of factors retained was 1 for MSTS-LE and 2 for TESS. The TESS showed a strong correlation with SF-36 (Spearman's rho = 0.714, p < 0.001), but the correlation between MSTS for lower extremity and SF-36 was weak (Spearman's Rho = 0.313, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The Greek version of both the MSTS for lower extremity and TESS questionnaire showed sufficient reliability, internal consistency and good performance using the loading factor analysis when used postoperatively in Greek patients who underwent surgical resection of lower extremity sarcoma. However, only the TESS showed strong correlation with the SF-36, indicating that MSTS for lower extremity was not as powerful for the evaluation of the global health status of these patients.","Bolia, Ioanna K; Savvidou, Olga D; Kang, Hyunwoo P; Chatzichristodoulou, Nikolaos; Megaloikonomos, Panayiotis D; Mitsiokapa, Evanthia; Mavrogenis, Andreas F; Papagelopoulos, Panayiotis J",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,300,16

This approach is potentially flawed because symptomatic asthma can occur without corticosteroid responsive type-2 (T2)-driven eosinophilic inflammation, and inappropriately high-dose corticosteroid treatment might have little therapeutic benefit with increased risk of side-effects. We compared a biomarker strategy to adjust corticosteroid dose using a composite score of T2 biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FENO], blood eosinophils, and serum periostin) with a standardised symptom-risk-based algorithm (control). METHODS: We did a single-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial in adults (18-80 years of age) with severe asthma (at treatment steps 4 and 5 of the Global Initiative for Asthma) and FENO of less than 45 parts per billion at 12 specialist severe asthma centres across England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Patients were randomly assigned (4:1) to either the biomarker strategy group or the control group by an online electronic case-report form, in blocks of ten, stratified by asthma control and use of rescue systemic steroids in the previous year. Patients were masked to study group allocation throughout the entirety of the study. Patients attended clinic every 8 weeks, with treatment adjustment following automated treatment-group-specific algorithms: those in the biomarker strategy group received a default advisory to maintain treatment and those in the control group had their treatment adjusted according to the steps indicated by the trial algorithm. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with corticosteroid dose reduction at week 48, in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary outcomes were inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose at the end of the study; cumulative dose of ICS during the study; proportion of patients on maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) at study end; rate of protocol-defined severe exacerbations per patient year; time to first severe exacerbation; number of hospital admissions for asthma; changes in lung function, Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 score, Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score, and T2 biomarkers from baseline to week 48; and whether patients declined to progress to OCS. A secondary aim of our study was to establish the proportion of patients with severe asthma in whom T2 biomarkers remained low when corticosteroid therapy was decreased to a minimum ICS dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02717689 and has been completed. FINDINGS: Patients were recruited from Jan 8, 2016, to July 12, 2018. Of 549 patients assessed, 301 patients were included in the ITT population and were randomly assigned to the biomarker strategy group (n=240) or to the control group (n=61). 28·4% of patients in the biomarker strategy group were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 compared with 18·5% of patients in the control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·71 [95% CI 0·80-3·63]; p=0·17). In the per-protocol (PP) population (n=121), a significantly greater proportion of patients were on a lower corticosteroid dose at week 48 in the biomarker strategy group (30·7% of patients) compared with the control group (5·0% of patients; aOR 11·48 [95% CI 1·35-97·83]; p=0·026). Patient choice to not follow treatment advice was the principle reason for loss to PP analysis. There was no difference in secondary outcomes between study groups and no loss of asthma control among patients in the biomarker strategy group who reduced their corticosteroid dose. INTERPRETATION: Biomarker-based corticosteroid adjustment did not result in a greater proportion of patients reducing corticosteroid dose versus control. Understanding the reasons for patients not following treatment advice in both treatment strategies is an important area for future research. The prevalence of T2 biomarker-low severe asthma was low.

Although most prominently associated with pulmonary manifestations, COVID-19 is increasingly implicated in neuropsychiatric complications, including delirium and psychosis. There is a potential causal link between COVID-19 infection and psychotic symptoms; however, case reports to date have been incomplete, as the patients described had known psychiatric histories or other plausible medical causes for altered mental status. We present a longitudinal case of COVID-19 psychosis in a patient who underwent comprehensive diagnostic evaluation. This case is a contribution to the inchoate characterization of neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 infection. CASE REPORT: We present a case of late-onset psychosis in a middle-aged man with no psychiatric history who tested positive for COVID-19 on admission following a recently resolved upper respiratory illness. His acute presentation-characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thought and behavior, for which he required inpatient medical admission and subsequent inpatient psychiatric hospitalization-was successfully treated. During his hospitalization, he underwent comprehensive medical and neurological workup (including neuroimaging; electroencephalography; and serum and cerebrospinal fluid testing) that was grossly unremarkable. DISCUSSION: Despite myriad potential causes of the patient's psychosis, this patient's diagnostic workup was largely unrevealing, apart from his nasopharyngeal SARS-2-CoV reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. As such, psychosis secondary to COVID-19 infection emerged as the presumptive diagnosis.","Parker, Catherine; Slan, Aaron; Shalev, Daniel; Critchfield, Adam",J Psychiatr Pract,300,16

Many patient-related factors, such as pre-existing comorbidities, affect disease severity and can be used to aid this prediction. OBJECTIVE: Because rapid automated profiling of peripheral blood samples is widely available, we aimed to investigate how data from the peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 can be used to predict clinical outcomes. METHODS: We investigated clinical data sets of patients with COVID-19 with known outcomes by combining statistical comparison and correlation methods with machine learning algorithms; the latter included decision tree, random forest, variants of gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and deep learning methods. RESULTS: Our work revealed that several clinical parameters that are measurable in blood samples are factors that can discriminate between healthy people and COVID-19-positive patients, and we showed the value of these parameters in predicting later severity of COVID-19 symptoms. We developed a number of analytical methods that showed accuracy and precision scores >90% for disease severity prediction. CONCLUSIONS: We developed methodologies to analyze routine patient clinical data that enable more accurate prediction of COVID-19 patient outcomes. With this approach, data from standard hospital laboratory analyses of patient blood could be used to identify patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk of mortality, thus enabling optimization of hospital facilities for COVID-19 treatment.","Aktar, Sakifa; Ahamad, Md Martuza; Rashed-Al-Mahfuz, Md; Azad, Akm; Uddin, Shahadat; Kamal, Ahm; Alyami, Salem A; Lin, Ping-I; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Quinn, Julian Mw; Eapen, Valsamma; Moni, Mohammad Ali",JMIR Med Inform,300,1

BACKGROUND: Many nursing homes in Germany provide Dementia Special Care Units. Existing definitions often do no justice to the complexity of their context. In this study, we define context as structural and organizational variables. It is necessary to define an empirical based set of indicators to characterize care units with respect to dementia care. DESIGN: Observational survey study with a cross-sectional design. METHODS: We will use a stratified random nationwide sample of 160 German nursing homes. Stratification variables are federal state and the existence of a Dementia Special Care Unit. The sampling frame from which the participating nursing homes are selected is a list with the total population of German nursing homes (n = 11.658). Data will be gathered on the level of the nursing homes and one of their care units via computer-assisted telephone interviews with a standardized questionnaire. The distribution of the assessed variables (contextual characteristics) will be described in absolute and relative frequencies for the whole sample in the first step in order to describe dementia-specific care structures. In the second step, factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) with hierarchical clustering (HC) will be applied to analyze relationships between variables. The study was ethically approved in October 2018. DISCUSSION: The typology can be used in future studies to define the context of care units in nursing homes. This may improve the interpretation of findings from future studies that investigated interventions in nursing homes. IMPACT: The typology will visualize and describe the complexity of contextual characteristics of several care units.","Hoffmann, Anna Louisa; Bergmann, Johannes Michael; Mueller-Widmer, René; Palm, Rebecca",J. adv. nurs,300,16

It has been shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may trigger the presentation or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. Crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN) has rarely been reported in patients with Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We present rare two cases with AAV after a recent diagnosis of COVID-19. The first case was 26-year-old male patient, who was presented with acute kidney injury after COVID-19. Serum creatinine increased and active urine sediment was seen. Serological evaluation showed anti-myeloperoxidase antibody was at a level of 80.6 U/mL. Kidney biopsy showed necrotizing GN with cellular crescents. Methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide and plasma exchange were administered. He was discharged with hemodialysis. Second case was a 36-year-old female who was hospitalized because of fever, cough and dyspnea. After she was diagnosed with COVID-19, she had total hearing loss, with cavitary lesions on bilateral lung parenchyma and an acute kidney injury. Serological evaluation showed an elevated anti-proteinase-3 with a level of 1:32. Kidney biopsy showed necrotizing GN with cellular crescents. Renal function improved after methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide treatment. With a systematic review of the literature, we found four cases of new-onset AAV due to COVID-19.

The development of rice varieties with enhanced nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) will require a thorough understanding of the molecular basis of a plant's response to low nitrogen (N) availability. The global expression profiles of root tissues collected from low and high N treatments at different time points in two rice genotypes, Pokkali and Bengal, with contrasting responses to N stress and contrasting root architectures were examined. Overall, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Pokkali (indica) was higher than in Bengal (japonica) during low N and early N recovery treatments. Most low N DEGs in both genotypes were downregulated whereas early N recovery DEGs were upregulated. Of these, 148 Pokkali-specific DEGs might contribute to Pokkali's advantage under N stress. These DEGs included transcription factors and transporters and were involved in stress responses, growth and development, regulation, and metabolism. Many DEGs are co-localized with quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to root growth and development, chlorate-resistance, and NUE. Our findings suggest that the superior growth performance of Pokkali under low N conditions could be due to the genetic differences in a diverse set of genes influencing N uptake through the regulation of root architecture.","Subudhi, Prasanta K; Garcia, Richard S; Coronejo, Sapphire; Tapia, Ronald",,300,32

Delayed presentation for medical emergencies has been noted by the medical community. There has been limited reporting on the impact for the care for emergent surgical conditions. We sought to describe the effect of the global pandemic on the presentation and outcomes for the most common urgent general surgery disease process, acute appendicitis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients admitted to the United States Naval Hospital Okinawa during the COVID-19 pandemic, from January 2020 to May 2020 (COVID cohort), and compared them to a historical cohort (pre-COVID cohort) over the prior 2 years. Demographics, clinical presentation data, and interventions were collected. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients with appendicitis, 20% presented perforated. Most patients were male (71%), presented with 1 day of symptoms and had a length of stay of 1 to 2 days. Comparing groups, 13% of the pre-COVID group vs. 31% of the COVID cohort presented perforated (P = .04), with a symptom duration of 1.6 vs. 2.7 days before presentation (P = .075), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and the global systematic response has impacted unrelated medical and surgical conditions. At our overseas military hospital with minimal disease burden, we observed a delay in presentation for acute appendicitis with a higher incidence of perforation. Patients should be empowered to continue to seek care for urgent and emergent medical and surgical conditions so that they are not harmed by fear of COVID-19 rather than by COVID-19 itself.","Wang, Andrew W; Prieto, James; Ikeda, Daniel S; Lewis, Paul R; Benzer, Emily M; Van Gent, Jan-Michael",Mil. med,300,28

Finger pointing, blame games and scapegoating are associated with creation of binaries that identify agency as good or bad, right or wrong, moral or immoral. The scapegoat is expectedly always bad, wrong and immoral, commonly black evil. The detrimental effects of the COVID-19 blame games are seen in a lack of cohesion and coherence in the anti-COVID-19 solving strategies.

Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense compounds composed of a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking. METHODS: Five PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5'-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method using a 48 h PPMO treatment time. Viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays from experiments where cells received a 5 h PPMO treatment time. RESULTS: PPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5' terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titres by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 h post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that PPMO have the ability to potently and specifically suppress SARS-CoV-2 growth and are promising candidates for further preclinical development.","Rosenke, Kyle; Leventhal, Shanna; Moulton, Hong M; Hatlevig, Susan; Hawman, David; Feldmann, Heinz; Stein, David A",J. antimicrob. chemother,300,23

As many as 2491 cases in Indonesia, there were 192 patients recovered (including those treated, so they have natural antibodies in the end) while the total who died was 209 people. It is assumed that around 13% of the total cases have natural antibodies. This is also the case with SARS-CoV-2 and may explain why some individuals (perhaps those most recently able to recover from seasonal coronavirus infections) have asymptomatic infections. Finally, the theoretical concept of increasing herd immunity in pandemic and epidemic cases in Indonesia which aims to control COVID-19 still needs to be reviewed because it is seen from the mortality data that CFR COVID-19 is predicted to be around 8.39% of the population in Indonesia where the risk of death still available.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, an even greater need for remote monitoring exists. Mobile tools enhance the ability to monitor patients virtually by enabling remote monitoring of VA and Amsler grid findings. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter reliability analysis. METHODS: Participants: Patients (N = 108) with near corrected VA better than 20/200 and a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or healthy patients without retinal disease (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] of 20/32 or better). INTERVENTION: participants were tested using the Checkup, reference VA, and Amsler tests, with the order of testing (Checkup or reference) randomized. Patients monitored their vision using Checkup at least twice a week at home between office visits. Main outcome measurements were near corrected VA and Amsler grid test results. RESULTS: Agreement was strong between Checkup and reference tests for VA (r = 0.86) and Amsler grid (sensitivity: 93%; specificity: 92%). Home versus clinic testing showed excellent agreement (r = 0.96). Patients reported successful home use. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations. Patients rated the usability of Checkup to be excellent. CONCLUSIONS: There was good agreement between Checkup and in-clinic test results for VA and Amsler grid. The low variance of Checkup testing, agreement between in-clinic and home results, and excellent usability support Checkup as a reliable method for monitoring retinal pathology in clinic and home settings.","Khurana, Rahul N; Hoang, Carol; Khanani, Arshad M; Steklov, Nikolai; Singerman, Lawrence J",Am J Ophthalmol,300,22

We investigated if the association of diabetes and COVID-19 severity may be mediated by inflammation. We also hypothesized that this increased risk may extend to prediabetes. Hospitalized patients in Singapore with COVID-19 were subdivided into three groups in a retrospective cohort: normoglycemia (HbA1c: &#8804;5.6%), prediabetes (HbA1c: 5.7%-6.4%) and diabetes (HbA1c: &#8805;6.5%). The primary outcome of severe COVID-19 was defined by respiratory rate &#8805;30, SpO2 &#8804;93% or intensive care unit admission. The association between clinical factors on severe COVID-19 outcome was analyzed by cox regression. Adjusted mediation analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) on the relationship between diabetes and severe COVID-19 was performed. Of 1042 hospitalized patients, mean age 39 ± 11 years, 13% had diabetes, 9% prediabetes and 78% normoglycemia. Severe COVID-19 occurred in 4.9% of subjects. Compared to normoglycemia, diabetes was significantly associated with severe COVID-19 on both univariate (hazard ratio [HR]: 9.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.54-17.84; p < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR: 3.99; 95% CI: 1.92-8.31; p < .001), while prediabetes was not a risk factor (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.22-4.03; p = .929). CRP, a biomarker of inflammation, mediated 32.7% of the total association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 outcome. In conclusion, CRP is a partial mediator of the association between diabetes and severe COVID-19 infection, confirming that inflammation is important in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 in diabetes.","Koh, Huilin; Moh, Angela Mei Chung; Yeoh, Ester; Lin, Yi; Low, Serena Kiat Mun; Ooi, Say Tat; Tan, Seng Kiong; Lin, Jaime Hui Xian; Hoong, Caroline Wei Shan",J. med. virol,300,16

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted almost every aspect of the provision and management of cancer care worldwide. The time-critical nature of COVID-19 diagnosis and the large number of patients requiring hospitalisation necessitated the rerouting of already limited resources available for cancer services and programmes to the care of COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, the stringent social distancing, restricted in-hospital visits and lockdown measures instituted by various governments resulted in the disruption of the oncologic continuum including screening, diagnostic and prevention programmes, treatments and follow-up services as well as research and clinical trial programmes. Materials and Methods: We searched several databases from October 2020 to January 2021 for relevant studies published in English between 2020 and 2021 and reporting on the impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care continuum. This narrative review paper describes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cancer patient care continuum from screening and prevention to treatments and ongoing management of patients. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted cancer care and the management of cancer services and patients. Nevertheless, the oncology healthcare communities worldwide have done phenomenal work with joint and collaborative efforts, utilising best available evidence-based guidelines to continue to give safe and effective treatments for cancer patients while maintaining the safety of patients, healthcare professionals and the general population. Nevertheless, several healthcare centres are now faced with significant challenges with the management of the backlog of screening, diagnosis and treatment cases. It is imperative that governments, leaders of healthcare centres and healthcare professionals take all necessary actions and policies focused on minimising further system-level delays to cancer screening, diagnosis, treatment initiation and clearing of all backlogs cases from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to mitigate the negative impact on cancer outcomes. © The Author(s), 2021.

A total of 94 patients were enrolled, and 831 samples were obtained. Analysis using mixed effects models for repeated measures with adjustment for age and sex showed that serum SDC-1 levels measured the day before significantly affected several outcomes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), creatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), antithrombin III, fibrin degradation products, and D-dimer. Moreover, serum SDC-1 levels of the prior day significantly modified the effect between time and several outcomes, including AST, ALT, CRE, and BUN. Additionally, increasing serum SDC-1 level was a significant risk factor for mortality. Serum SDC-1 may be a useful biomarker for daily monitoring to detect early signs of kidney, liver and coagulation system dysfunction, and may be an important risk factor for mortality in critically ill patients.","Suzuki, Keiko; Okada, Hideshi; Sumi, Kazuyuki; Tomita, Hiroyuki; Kobayashi, Ryo; Ishihara, Takuma; Kakino, Yoshinori; Suzuki, Kodai; Yoshiyama, Naomasa; Yasuda, Ryu; Kitagawa, Yuichiro; Fukuta, Tetsuya; Miyake, Takahito; Okamoto, Haruka; Doi, Tomoaki; Yoshida, Takahiro; Yoshida, Shozo; Ogura, Shinji; Suzuki, Akio",Sci Rep,300,30

The disease epidemic is caused by a novel coronavirus, called COVID-19, which has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide. With a death toll approaching that of China's SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 and 2003, 2019-nCoV has contributed to an international emergency in public health, placing all health organizations on high alert. Such large numbers of infected and deceased people require an urgent need for reliable, inexpensive, and cheap drugs to control and reduce the outbreak. Objective: To systematically review and evaluate the pattern of COVID-19 and the treatment plans. Methods: This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The articles were searched from databases like PubMed, the Cochrane Library, ScienceDirect, and the Health Research and Development Information Network (HERDIN) combining MeSH and free-text terms. Results: This analysis highlights the agent of COVID-19 and the possible transmission. The current research taking place to overcome this complex disease and the urgent need to develop improved therapeutics are also discussed. Conclusion: Herein, we present an epidemiological overview of the currently available information on the treatment claimed to have helped to bring the situation under control.","T K, Sivabakya; G, Srinivas",Z Gesundh Wiss,300,23

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed observational data from SARS-CoV-2-positive adults in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a multicenter, longitudinal U.S. cohort (January 2018-February 2021), with a prescription for GLP1-RA, SGLT2i, or DPP4i within 24 months of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. The primary outcome was 60-day mortality, measured from positive SARS-CoV-2 test date. Secondary outcomes were total mortality during the observation period and emergency room visits, hospitalization, and mechanical ventilation within 14 days. Associations were quantified with odds ratios (ORs) estimated with targeted maximum likelihood estimation using a super learner approach, accounting for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: The study included 12,446 individuals (53.4% female, 62.5% White, mean ± SD age 58.6 ± 13.1 years). The 60-day mortality was 3.11% (387 of 12,446), with 2.06% (138 of 6,692) for GLP1-RA use, 2.32% (85 of 3,665) for SGLT2i use, and 5.67% (199 of 3,511) for DPP4i use. Both GLP1-RA and SGLT2i use were associated with lower 60-day mortality compared with DPP4i use (OR 0.54 [95% CI 0.37-0.80] and 0.66 [0.50-0.86], respectively). Use of both medications was also associated with decreased total mortality, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Among SARS-CoV-2-positive adults, premorbid GLP1-RA and SGLT2i use, compared with DPP4i use, was associated with lower odds of mortality and other adverse outcomes, although DPP4i users were older and generally sicker.","Kahkoska, Anna R; Abrahamsen, Trine Julie; Alexander, G Caleb; Bennett, Tellen D; Chute, Christopher G; Haendel, Melissa A; Klein, Klara R; Mehta, Hemalkumar; Miller, Joshua D; Moffitt, Richard A; Stürmer, Til; Kvist, Kajsa; Buse, John B",Diabetes care,300,0

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multisystemic disease known for developing many types of skin lesions. However, little is known about post-COVID-19 manifestations. A previous healthy male patient, 43 years old, with resistant mediastinal Hodgkin's lymphoma stage II diagnosed in 2019, without treatment at the moment, developed monomorphic flaccid bullae on the trunk 40 days after testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although he had risk factors for IgA and paraneoplastic pemphigus, there were no elements for these diseases. The investigation confirmed a pemphigus vulgaris (PV). PV had a good response to treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg per day, and methotrexate 15 mg subcutaneously was added per week. The patient was discharged with oral methotrexate and prednisolone at the same dose. Prednisolone was decreased by 20 mg per day during the follow-up. Viruses such as herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and varicela zoster can act as triggers for PV. This process is not immediate after the infection because it depends on the change in antibodies initially produced against the virus that start to identify antigens present in the skin's anchoring structures. SARS-CoV-2 can induce autoimmunity, as seen in Guillán-Barré syndrome and in Kawasaki disease. It is a highly immunogenic virus that is the perfect agent for triggering PV. This case can be considered a cutaneous autoimmune post-COVID-19 manifestation.","De Medeiros, Vanessa Lucilia Silveira; Monteiro-Neto, Antônio Urbano; França, David Duarte Timponi; Castelo Branco, Rebecca; de Miranda Coelho, Érika Oliveira; Takano, Daniela Mayumi",SN Compr Clin Med,300,16

However, their modulation and effect in osteoclastogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-346-3p in regulating the osteoclast differentiation from RAW264.7 cells. We used the miRNA microarray assay, miR-346-3p mimic transfection, tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bone resorption assay, qRT-PCR, and western blot. Our results showed that the expression of miR-346-3p was significantly upregulated during osteoclast differentiation. Further, by transfecting cells with miR-346-3p mimic, we observed an increased number of TRAP-positive multinucleated cells, increased pit area caused by bone resorption, and enhanced expression of osteoclast-specific genes and proteins. Conversely, miR-346-3p inhibition attenuated the osteoclast differentiation and function. Software-mediated prediction and validation using luciferase reporter assay showed that TRAF3, a negative regulator of osteoclast differentiation, was inhibited by miR-346-3p overexpression. Our results showed that miR-346-3p directly targeted TRAF3 mRNA via binding to its 3'-UTR and inhibited the expression of TRAF3 protein. Taken together, our results revealed that miR-346-3p promotes the regulation of osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the TRAF3 gene. In conclusion, miR-346-3p could be a novel therapeutic target for bone loss-related pathogenesis.","Mao, Yingji; Chen, Yu; Fu, Yingxiao; Guan, Jingjing; Liang, Mengxiang; Zhu, Yansong; Yang, Fugen; Li, Feixiang; Zhang, Zhe; Wan, Chuanfeng; Zhou, Pinghui","In vitr. cel. dev. biol., Anim",300,5

In pigs, conventional DCs (cDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) have been described in blood and tissues. Different pathogens, such as viruses, could infect these cells, and in some cases, compromise their response. The understanding of the interaction between DCs and viruses is critical to comprehend viral immunopathological responses. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the most important respiratory pathogen in the global pig population. Different reports support the notion that PRRSV modulates pig immune response in addition to their genetic and antigenic variability. The interaction of PRRSV with DCs is a mostly unexplored area with conflicting results and lots of uncertainties. Among the scarce certainties, cDCs and pDCs are refractory to PRRSV infection in contrast to moDCs. Additionally, response of DCs to PRRSV can be different depending on the type of DCs and maybe is related to the virulence of the viral isolate. The precise impact of this virus-DC interaction upon the development of the specific immune response is not fully elucidated. The present review briefly summarizes and discusses the previous studies on the interaction of in vitro derived bone marrow (bm)- and moDCs, and in vivo isolated cDCs, pDCs, and moDCs with PRRSV1 and 2.","Hernández, Jesús; Li, Yanli; Mateu, Enric",Front Immunol,300,1

The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

This review evaluates CPT in COVID-19 and other viral respiratory diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. PubMed and Google scholar databases were used to collect eligible publications until 8 December 2020. Meta-analysis used Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and pooled analysis for individual patient data with inverse variance weighted average. The study is registered at PROSPERO with the number of CRD4200270579. Forty-four studies with 36,716 participants were included in the pooled analysis and 20 studies in the meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed reduction of mortality (RR 0.57, 95% CI [0.43, 0.76], z = 3.86 [p < 0.001], I2 = 44% [p = 0.03]) and higher number of discharged patients (RR 2.53, 95% CI [1.72, 3.72], z = 4.70 [p < 0.001], I2 = 3% [p = 0.39]) in patients receiving CPT compared to standard care alone. A possible mechanism of action is prompt reduction in viral titre. Serious transfusion-related adverse events were reported to be less than 1% of cases, suggesting the overall safety of CPT; nevertheless, the number of patients participating in the studies was still limited. It is also important to notice that in all the studies, the majority of patients were also given other medications, such as antivirals, antibiotics and corticosteroid; furthermore, randomized controlled studies involving more patients and in combination with other treatment modalities are urgently needed.","Aviani, Jenifer Kiem; Halim, Danny; Soeroto, Arto Yuwono; Achmad, Tri Hanggono; Djuwantono, Tono",Rev. med. virol,300,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional follow-up study is a sequel to a study by Biadsee et al. Among the previous study population of 128 non-hospitalized patients, positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), 97 patients participated in a survey designed for this study. Information and data regarding loss of smell and taste, rate of recovery, xerostomia, and additional symptoms; (Cough, Myalgia, Weakness, Rhinorrhea, Nasal congestion) were collected. RESULTS: A total of 43 men and 54 women were included. Mean age was 37.5 years (range 19-74). Mean follow-up was 229 days (range 191-253). Sixty-five patients reported gustatory dysfunction during the disease of which 61.5% reported full recovery, 38.5% partial recovery. Of 65 patients who reported olfactory impairment during the disease, 52% had full recovery and 48% reported partial recovery of olfactory function. Complete recovery of olfactory function was positively associated with full recovery of gustatory function (p = 0.01). Gender did not significantly affect the recovery of OD and GD (p = 0.45, p = 0.90, respectively). Patients who experienced olfactory dysfunction as an initial symptom had lower rates of olfactory complete recovery (p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: After a mean follow-up of 229 days, complete recovery of smell and taste functions occurred in 52% and 61.5%, respectively. However, dysfunction persisted in 48%-38.5% of patients.","Biadsee, Ameen; Dagan, Or; Ormianer, Zeev; Kassem, Firas; Masarwa, Shchada; Biadsee, Ameer",Am J Otolaryngol,300,6

At the time of writing Italy is ranking first among countries both in terms of number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and in terms of number of deaths. Such a wide spread of COVID-19 has led to concern among workers who are facing the risk of becoming infected during the execution of their duties. We believe it is useful to remark on the need for professional expertise in the field of Occupational Hygiene in this emergency context, in which the indications provided by national and international bodies, the available scientific literature and the legal provisions are constantly and rapidly evolving. It is of fundamental importance that there is an effective analysis of expert inputs, to provide essential guidance to Health, Safety and Environmental managers and other prevention managers in workplaces. In this regard, not only a constant update of the regulatory framework is needed, but also a development and circulation of operational guidance to all the stakeholders to translate general indications into clear operating procedures and implementation tools to be adopted in the workplaces. We believe that the scientific associations in the field of Occupational Hygiene play a crucial role in guiding and assisting prevention professionals. There is considerable expertise in the occupational hygiene and exposure science communities that can help employers and workers to contain and delay the spread of COVID-19. For this reason, the Italian Association of Industrial Hygienists (AIDII-Associazione Italiana degli Igienisti Industriali) published documents containing operational guidelines to provide correct and constantly updated information for: (i) workers employed in essential activities (with low and medium risk of contagion), (ii) health workers and other workers at high or very high risk of contagion, and (iii) for the correct use and handling of personal protective equipment for workers and for the population in general. It is worth pointing out that the documents produced are not intended to replace those produced by authoritative bodies, but to comply with and complete them by reporting an effective summary and further indications about the measures that should be taken in practice under the light of the Italian legislation. At present, the challenge is to produce scientifically sound knowledge, appropriate tools, and effective methodologies, by coordinating the initiatives of different scientific associations, with the final aim to effectively transfer them to employers and workers.","Spinazzè, Andrea; Cattaneo, Andrea; Cavallo, Domenico M",Ann Work Expo Health,300,16

The pandemic has resulted in a number of recent cyberattacks on hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the World Health Organization and its partners, and others. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify key cybersecurity challenges, solutions adapted by the health sector, and areas of improvement needed to counteract the recent increases in cyberattacks (eg, phishing campaigns and ransomware attacks), which have been used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in technology and people introduced through changes to working practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted by searching two major scientific databases (PubMed and Scopus) using the search formula ""(covid OR healthcare) AND cybersecurity."" Reports, news articles, and industry white papers were also included if they were related directly to previously published works, or if they were the only available sources at the time of writing. Only articles in English published in the last decade were included (ie, 2011-2020) in order to focus on current issues, challenges, and solutions. RESULTS: We identified 9 main challenges in cybersecurity, 11 key solutions that health care organizations adapted to address these challenges, and 4 key areas that need to be strengthened in terms of cybersecurity capacity in the health sector. We also found that the most prominent and significant methods of cyberattacks that occurred during the pandemic were related to phishing, ransomware, distributed denial-of-service attacks, and malware. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified the most impactful methods of cyberattacks that targeted the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges in cybersecurity, solutions, and areas in need of improvement. We provided useful insights to the health sector on cybersecurity issues during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics that may materialize in the future.","He, Ying; Aliyu, Aliyu; Evans, Mark; Luo, Cunjin",J Med Internet Res,300,16

Through the apps, a passenger not only seeks a path from origin to destination, but a satisfactory path that caters to the passenger's preferences at the desired time of travel. Essentially, apps attempt to provide a means of personalized PT service. As the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic take form and infiltrate human and environmental interactions, passenger preference personalization will likely include avoiding risks of infection or contagious contact. The personal preferences are enabled by multiple attributes associated with alternative PT routes. For instance, preferences can be connected to attributes of time, cost, and convenience. This work establishes a personalized PT service, as an adjustment to current design frameworks, by integrating user app experience with operators’ data sources and operations modeling. The work proceeds to focus on its key component: the personalized route guidance methodology. In addition to using the existing shortest path or k-weighted shortest path method, this study develops a novel, lexicographical shortest path method, considering a just noticeable difference (JND). The method adopts lexicographical ordering to capture passenger preferences for different PT attributes following Ernst Weber's law of human perception threshold. However, a direct application of Weber's law violates the axiom of transitivity required for an implementable algorithm, and thus, a revised method is developed with proven algorithms for ranking different paths. The differences between the three route-guidance methods and the effects of the JND perception threshold on the order of the alternative PT routes are demonstrated with an example. The developments were examined in a case study by simulation on the Copenhagen PT network. The results show that using the JND method reduces the value/cost of the most important attributes. Identical robust results are attained when JND parameters are not specified and default values are used. The latter may apply for the future with a mixture of specified and default preference input values. Finally, the computation time indicates a favorable potential for real-life applications. It is believed that the consideration of human threshold perception will encourage decision makers to establish new criteria to comply with this.","Ceder, Avishai; Jiang, Yu",Transp. Res.

Recent findings show that MYSO accretion bursts cause flares of these masers. Thus, maser monitoring can be used to identify such bursts. Burst-induced SED changes provide valuable information on a very intense phase of high-mass star formation. In mid-January 2019, a maser flare of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 was reported. ALMA and SMA imaging resolved the core of the star forming region and proved the association of the masers with the brightest continuum source MM1. However, no significant flux rise of the (sub)mm dust continuum was found. Thus, we performed NIR imaging with GROND and IFU spectroscopy with FIFI-LS aboard SOFIA to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)mm sources, and compare their photometry to archival measurements. The comparison of pre-burst and burst SEDs is of crucial importance to judge whether a luminosity increase due to the burst is present and if it triggered the maser flare. The FIR fluxes of MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which clearly confirms the presence of an accretion burst. The second epoch data, taken about 16 months later, still show increased fluxes. Our RT modeling yielded major burst parameters and suggests that the MYSO features a circumstellar disk which might be transient. From the multi-epoch SEDs, conclusions on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of the burst-induced maser relocation have been explored. The verification of the accretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that Class II methanol maser flares represent an alert for such events. The few events known to date already indicate that there is a broad range in burst strength and duration as well as environmental characteristics. The G358 event is the shortest and least luminous MYSO accretion burst so far.","Stecklum, B.; Wolf, V.; Linz, H.; Garatti, A.

PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 during Humphrey Visual field testing in a real-world scenario. METHODS: A particle counter was placed within the bowl of Humphrey Visual Field Analyser before and after turning on the machine to ascertain the effect of the air current produced by the ventilation system on aerosols. A second experiment was run where the particle counter was placed in the bowl and recorded particulates, in the air, as a 24-2 SITA standard was performed by a mock patient and then again immediately after the patient had moved away. We measured aerosol particle counts sized &#8804;0.3âµm, >0.3 &#8804;0.5âµm, >0.5 &#8804;1âµm, >1 &#8804;2.5âµm, >2.5&#8804;5âµm and >5&#8804;10âµm. RESULTS: Particulates of all sizes were shown to be significantly reduced within the bowl after turning the machine on, demonstrating that the air current produced by the Humphrey visual field analyser pushes air out of the bowl and it cannot stagnate. There was no significant difference in measurement of aerosol while there was a patient performing the test and immediately after they had moved away, suggesting that aerosols breathed out by the patient are not able to remain in suspension in the bowl due to the ventilation current. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference between aerosol count in the bowl of a Humphrey visual field analyser before, during and after testing. This suggests the risk of airborne transmission of COVID-19 is low between subsequent patients. This is in keeping with manufacturer's guidance on Humphrey visual field testing.","Jain, Nikhil; Kaur, Simerdip; Kopsachilis, Nick; Zia, Rashid",J. glaucoma,300,1

Our results revealed a functional relationship between photosynthetic genes and their conserved neighboring genes observed by 'Phylo score', indicating their functions could be inferred from the genome neighborhood profile. Therefore, we created a new method for extracting patterns based on the genome neighborhood network (GNN) and applied them for the photosynthetic protein classification using ML algorithms.

Early studies suggest that patients can deteriorate quickly after admission to hospital. The aim of this study was to model changes in vital signs for patients hospitalised with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to one acute hospital trust in the UK (CV) and a cohort of patients admitted to the same hospital between 2013-2017 with viral pneumonia (VI). The primary outcome was the start of continuous positive airway pressure/non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, ICU admission or death in hospital. We used non-linear mixed-effects models to compare changes in vital sign observations prior to the primary outcome. Using observations and FiO2 measured at discharge in the VI cohort as the model of normality, we also combined individual vital signs into a single novelty score. RESULTS: There were 497 cases of COVID-19, of whom 373 had been discharged from hospital. 135 (36.2%) of patients experienced the primary outcome, of whom 99 died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was over 4-times higher in the CV than the VI cohort (26.5% vs 6%). For those patients who experienced the primary outcome, CV patients became increasingly hypoxaemic, with a median estimated FiO2 (0.75) higher than that of the VI cohort (estimated FiO2 of 0.35). Prior to the primary outcome, blood pressure remained within normal range, and there was only a small rise in heart rate. The novelty score showed that patients with COVID-19 deteriorated more rapidly that patients with viral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who deteriorate in hospital experience rapidly-worsening respiratory failure, with low SpO2 and high FiO2, but only minor abnormalities in other vital signs. This has potential implications for the ability of early warning scores to identify deteriorating patients.","Pimentel, Marco A F; Redfern, Oliver C; Hatch, Robert; Young, J Duncan; Tarassenko, Lionel; Watkinson, Peter J",Resuscitation,300,20

Though many methods have been proposed for this issue, it is a challenging task because of infections of various size appearing in different lobe zones. To tackle these issues, we propose a Graph-based Pyramid Global Context Reasoning (Graph-PGCR) module, which is capable of modeling long-range dependencies among disjoint infections as well as adapt size variation. We first incorporate graph convolution to exploit long-term contextual information from multiple lobe zones. Different from previous average pooling or maximum object probability, we propose a saliency-aware projection mechanism to pick up infection-related pixels as a set of graph nodes. After graph reasoning, the relation-aware features are reversed back to the original coordinate space for the down-stream tasks. We further construct multiple graphs with different sampling rates to handle the size variation problem. To this end, distinct multi-scale long-range contextual patterns can be captured. Our Graph-PGCR module is plug-and-play, which can be integrated into any architecture to improve its performance.

Using the Computational Thinking Taxonomy within the informal education setting of a STEM outreach program, a curriculum was developed to introduce middle school students to epidemiological concepts while developing their problem-solving skills, a subset of their computational thinking and mathematical thinking practices, in a contextually rich environment. The informal education setting at a Research I Institution provides avenues to connect diverse learners to visually engaging computational thinking and data science curricula to understand emerging teaching and learning approaches.

We aimed to assess the prevalence of the disease in the country and provide a model for &#945;-thal newborn screening in Bangladesh. We collected umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples from 413 unrelated newborns in Bangladesh. Demographic information, blood indices, osmotic fragility, serum iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) levels were evaluated for all the subjects. All subjects underwent a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis for &#945;-thal status, followed by a multiplex gap-PCR-based identification of the deletion type present. Sixty-seven subjects had at least one &#945;-thal deletion (16.22%). We observed that -&#945;3.7 (rightward), - -SEA (Southeast Asian), -&#945;4.2 (leftward), - -MED (Mediterranean) and - -THAI (Thailand) deletions were the most common &#945;-globin deletions present in the country, with the -&#945;3.7 (n = 37) and - -SEA (n = 18) being most prevalent. The osmotic fragility test (OFT) could predict the presence of &#945;-thal deletions with over 98.0% sensitivity. Complete UCB count analysis revealed significant differences between healthy subjects and subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. Although the iron level was almost the same (108.0 vs. 105.7 µg/dL), a reduced level of Zn (98.6 vs. 71.8 µg/dL, p < 0.01) was observed in the cord blood-derived serum of the subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. Moreover, parental age at the time of delivery, gestational period, and birth weight was lower in the subjects with &#945;-thal deletions. This study provides partial information on the epidemiology of &#945;-thal in Bangladesh and describes a model for &#945;-thal newborn screening in the country.","Anwar, Saeed; Taslem Mourosi, Jarin; Hasan, Md Kamrul; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir; Miah, Md Faruque",Hemoglobin,300,10

Estimates for the number of present-day infections that will, at a later date, prove to be fatal are derived through a nowcasting model, which relates the day of death of each deceased patient to the corresponding day of registration of the infection. Our district-level modelling approach for fatal infections disentangles spatial variation into a global pattern for Germany, district-specific long-term effects and short-term dynamics, while also taking the age and gender structure of the regional population into account. This enables to highlight areas with unexpectedly high disease activity. The analysis of death counts contributes to a better understanding of the spread of the disease while being, to some extent, less dependent on testing strategy and capacity in comparison to infection counts.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional observational study of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19. A control group was used to compare the cumulative incidence and case fatality rate (CFR). The main outcomes of the study were cumulative incidence, defined as number of patients with active epilepsy and COVID-19 admitted in emergency department divided by the total number of patients with epilepsy at risk; and CFR based on the number of deaths during the enrolment period. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors for fatality in patients with active epilepsy. RESULTS: Of the 1537 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 21 (1.3%) had active epilepsy. The cumulative incidence (95% CI) of COVID-19 in epilepsy patients was higher (1.2% [0.6-2.4]) compared to population without epilepsy (0.5% [0.5-0.5]). In RT-PCR positive patients there were no significant differences in CFR in patients with active epilepsy compared to patients without epilepsy (33.3% vs. 8.3%; p =0.266). Of the 21 active epilepsy patients, 5 (23%) died. In multivariate analysis, the factor associated with fatality in patients with active epilepsy was hypertension (OR [95%CI], 2.8 [1.3-21.6]). In other model age (OR [95%CI], 1.0 [1.0-1.1]) and epilepsy (OR [95%CI], 5.1 [1.3-24.0]) were associated with fatality during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cumulative incidence were higher in patients with active epilepsy. Epilepsy was associated with fatality during hospitalization.

(Special Issue: COVID-19: supporting scientific surge.),18.570295,3.882132,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in the number of patients presenting with acute appendicitis was observed. It is unclear whether this caused a shift towards more complicated cases of acute appendicitis. We compared a cohort of patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic with a 2019 control cohort. METHODS: We retrospectively included consecutive adult patients in 21 hospitals presenting with acute appendicitis in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (March 15 - April 30, 2020) and a control cohort (March 15 - April 30, 2019). Primary outcome was the proportion of complicated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes included prehospital delay, appendicitis severity, and postoperative complication rates. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic cohort comprised 607 patients vs. 642 patients in the control cohort. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis was seen (46.9% vs. 38.5%; p = 0.003). More patients had symptoms exceeding 24 h (61.1% vs. 56.2%, respectively, p = 0.048). After correction for prehospital delay, presentation during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was still associated with a higher rate of complicated appendicitis. Patients presenting > 24 h after onset of symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were older (median 45 vs. 37 years; p = 0.001) and had more postoperative complications (15.3% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of acute appendicitis was slightly lower during the first wave of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, more patients presented with a delay and with complicated appendicitis than in a corresponding period in 2019. Spontaneous resolution of mild appendicitis may have contributed to the increased proportion of patients with complicated appendicitis. Late presenting patients were older and experienced more postoperative complications compared to the control cohort.","Scheijmans, Jochem C G; Borgstein, Alexander B J; Puylaert, Carl A J; Bom, Wouter J; Bachiri, Said; van Bodegraven, Eduard A; Brandsma, Amarins T A; Ter Brugge, Floor M; de Castro, Steve M M; Couvreur, Roy; Franken, Lotte C; Gaspersz, Marcia P; de Graaff, Michelle R; Groenen, Hannah; Kleipool, Suzanne C; Kuypers, Toon J L; Martens, Milou H; Mens, David M; Orsini, Ricardo G; Reneerkens, Nando J M M; Schok, Thomas; Sedee, Wouter J A; Tavakoli Rad, Shahzad; Volders, José H; Weeder, Pepijn D; Prins, Jan M; Gietema, Hester A; Stoker, Jaap; Gisbertz, Suzanne S; Besselink, Marc G H; Boermeester, Marja A",BMC Emerg Med,300,23

Although the exact pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully understood, thrombosis is clearly a highly important in the prognosis and outcome of COVID-19. As such, there is a need for diagnostic analysis and quantification of the coagulation potential in these patients, both at diagnosis and follow-up. Global coagulation assays like thrombin generation (TG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) might be suitable in estimating COVID-19 associated coagulopathy and thrombosis risk. Therefore, we aimed at validating both assays for samples with high levels of fibrinogen and in the presence of anticoagulant heparins, such as commonly observed for COVID-19 ICU patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Calibrated Automated Thrombography (CAT) was optimized to assess plasma thrombin generation in the presence of heparins. The final conditions with either 10 µg/mL Ellagic acid (EA) or PPP Reagent HIGH (high tissue factor; HPPH) were validated according to the EP5 protocol for within-run and between-run variability. Overall variability was well below 10%. To estimate the influences of heparins and high fibrinogen levels, CAT was performed on spiked plasma aliquots from 13 healthy volunteers. Comparable to the CAT method, tPA-ROTEM was used to validate the effect of high fibrinogen and heparins on clotting time, clot firmness and clot lysis parameters. RESULTS: Our adjusted COVID-19 assay showed a heparin dose dependent decrease in peak height and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) for both EA and HPPH triggered variants. High fibrinogen did not alter the inhibitory effect of either LMWH or UFH, nor did it influence the peak height or ETP in any of the conditions. The tPA-ROTEM showed a significant prolongation in clotting time with the additions of heparin, which normalized with the addition of high fibrinogen. MCF was markedly increased in all hyperfibrinogenemic conditions. A trend towards increased lysis time and, thus, decreased fibrinolysis was observed. CONCLUSION: Thrombin generation and tPA-ROTEM protocols for measurements in the COVID-19 populations were adjusted and validated. The adjusted thrombin generation assay shows good sensitivity for measurements in heparin spiked plasma. High levels of fibrinogen did not alter the assay or the effectiveness of heparins as measured in this assay. t-PA ROTEM was effective in measurement of both high fibrinogen and heparins spiked samples and was sensitive to the expected relevant coagulant changes by these conditions. No clear fibrinolytic effect was observed in different conditions.","van de Berg, Tom W; Hulshof, Anne-Marije M; Nagy, Magdolna; van Oerle, Rene; Sels, Jan-Willem; van Bussel, Bas; Ten Cate, Hugo; Henskens, Yvonne; Spronk, Henri M H",Thromb Res,300,26

A strong rational groundwork was made keeping the focus on current development of therapeutic agents and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. Among the proposed therapeutic regimen, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, remdisevir, azithromycin, toclizumab and cromostat mesylate have shown promising results, and limited benefit was seen with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19. Early development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine started based on the full-length genome analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Several subunit vaccines, peptides, nucleic acids, plant-derived, recombinant vaccines are under pipeline. This article concludes and highlights ongoing advances in drug repurposing, therapeutics and vaccines to counter COVID-19, which collectively could enable efforts to halt the pandemic virus infection.","Gudadappanavar, Anupama M; Benni, Jyoti",J. basic clin. physiol. pharmacol,300,1

RESULTS: The older group had more patients with dyspnea and fewer patients with fever and muscle pain. Older patients had more underlying diseases, secondary infection, myocardial injury, renal dysfunction, coagulation dysfunction, and immune dysfunction on admission. More older patients received immunoglobulin therapy and mechanical ventilation. The proportions of patients with multiple organ injuries, critically ill patients and death increased significantly with age. The older groups had higher cumulative death risk than the younger group. Hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, comorbidities, acute cardiac injury, shock and complications are independent predictors of death. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of the elderly patients were more atypical, with more comorbidities, secondary infection, organ injuries, immune dysfunction and a higher risk of critical illness. Older age was an important risk factor for mortality. METHODS: 1000 patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 from January 1, 2020 to February 14, 2020 were enrolled.

With tens of thousands of adults and children in more than 200 immigration detention centers across the United States, immigration detention centers are likely to experience COVID-19 outbreaks and add substantially to the population of those infected.Despite compelling evidence indicating a heightened risk of infection among detainees, state and federal governments have done little to protect the health of detained im-migrants. An evidence-based public health framework must guide the COVID-19 response in immigration detention centers.We draw on the hierarchy of controls framework to demonstrate how immigration detention centers are failing to implement even the least effective control strategies. Drawing on this framework and recent legal and medical advocacy efforts, we argue that safely releasing detainees from immigration detention centers into their communities is the most effective way to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks in immigration detention settings. Failure to do so will result in infection and death among those detained and deepen existing health and social inequities. (Am J Public Health.

Vitamin D serves functions in bone health and has been recently reported to exert protective effects against respiratory infections. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency and a poor prognosis of COVID­19; this is alarming as vitamin D deficiency is a global health problem. In Latin America, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is unknown, and currently, this region is in the top 10 according to the number of confirmed COVID­19 cases.

We study three specific COVID-19 epidemic control models: the susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered (SEIR) model with vaccination control; the SEIR model with shield immunity control; and the susceptible, un-quarantined infected, quarantined infected, confirmed infected (SUQC) model with quarantine control. We express the control requirement in metric temporal logic (MTL) formulas (a type of formal specification languages) which can specify the expected control outcomes such as ""the deaths from the infection should never exceed one thousand per day within the next three months"" or ""the population immune from the disease should eventually exceed 200 thousand within the next 100 to 120 days"". We then develop methods for synthesizing control strategies with MTL specifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to systematically synthesize control strategies based on the COVID-19 epidemic models with formal specifications. We provide simulation results in three different case studies: vaccination control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; shield immunity control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Lombardy, Italy; and quarantine control for the COVID-19 epidemic with model parameters estimated from data in Wuhan, China. The results show that the proposed synthesis approach can generate control inputs such that the time-varying numbers of individuals in each category (e.g., infectious, immune) satisfy the MTL specifications. The results also show that early intervention is essential in mitigating the spread of COVID-19, and more control effort is needed for more stringent MTL specifications. For example, based on the model in Lombardy, Italy, achieving less than 100 deaths per day and 10000 total deaths within 100 days requires 441.7% more vaccination control effort than achieving less than 1000 deaths per day and 50000 total deaths within 100 days.","Xu, Zhe; Wu, Bo; Topcu, Ufuk",PLoS One,300,32

MATERIAL AND METHODS The records of 1206 eligible patients were reviewed. Age groups were divided according to their quarantine status. We recorded the reasons for patient presentation to the ED, the average number of patients in age groups according to quarantine days, and the problems reported by patients who presented to the ED according to quarantine days. RESULTS We enrolled 3016 of 3123 patients. The mean age was 36.4±17.3 years in 2019 and 37.8±16.4 years during the pandemic period (P=0.031). While 73.1% of the ED presentations were due to ocular trauma in 2019, it decreased to 70.7% in 2020. The proportion of those who presented to the ED during the weekend was 30.6% in 2019, but decreased to 23.9% in 2020 (<0.001). While 84.8% of trauma patients were ages 19-64 years in 2019, this rate increased to 88.9% during the pandemic (P=0.067). Non-trauma emergencies were more common than trauma emergencies in both periods in those over the age of 65 years.

Moreover, in this common female patient population, there is markedly high prevalence of multiple cardio-metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, which may significantly increase the risk for adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. This strong overlap of risk factors for both worse PCOS cardio-metabolic manifestations and severe COVID-19 should be highlighted for the clinical practice, particularly since women with PCOS often receive fragmented care from multiple healthcare services. Comprehensively informing women with PCOS regarding the potential risks from COVID-19 and how this may affect their management is also essential. CONCLUSION: Despite the immense challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak to the healthcare systems in affected countries, attention should be directed to maintain a high standard of care for complex patients such as many women with PCOS and provide relevant practical recommendations for optimal management in the setting of this fast moving pandemic.","Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil; Robbins, Tim; Chatha, Kamaljit; Drenos, Fotios; Randeva, Harpal S",BMC Med,300,24

Anaesthetists may be at particular risk and this is further increased for women anaesthetists due to biases and inequities within the specialty. However, gender-related risk factors for and experiences of burnout and poor mental health remain under-researched and under-reported. This negatively impacts individual practitioners, the anaesthesia workforce and patients and carries significant financial implications. We discuss the impact of anaesthesia and gender on burnout and mental health using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example illustrating how women and men differentially experience stressors and burnout. COVID-19 has further accentuated the gendered effects of burnout and poor mental health on anaesthetists and brought further urgency to the need to address these issues.

We conducted a study to compare clinical and prognostic features between hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without CKD. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with stage 3-5 CKD and propensity score-matched fifty-six patients without CKD were included in the study. Patients were followed-up at least fifteen days or until death after COVID-19 diagnosis. The endpoints were death from all causes, development of acute kidney injury (AKI) or cytokine release syndrome or respiratory failure, or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESULTS: All patients were reviewed retrospectively over a median follow-up of 44 days (IQR, 36-52) after diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with CKD had higher intensive care unit admission and mortality rates than the patients without CKD, but these results did not reach statistical significance (16 vs. 19; p = 0.54 and 11 vs. 16, p = 0.269, respectively). The frequency of AKI development was significantly higher in predialysis patients with CKD compared to the other group (8 vs. 5; p < 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of cytokine release syndrome (13 vs. 8; p = 0.226), follow-up in the ICU (19 vs. 16; p = 0.541), and respiratory failure (25 vs. 22, p = 0.566). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that respiratory failure and AKI were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The mortality rates of COVID-19 patients with CKD had higher than COVID-19 patients without CKD.

DISCUSSION: The reduction in global activity in pediatric emergencies is not only explained by the decrease in contagious diseases. The decrease in inadequate demand and inappropriate income may have contributed. The availability of pediatric beds would make the reduction of programmed surgical activity unnecessary and would allow the redistribution of resources to areas with greater healthcare pressure.","Martínez-Navarro, Gorka; Lozano-Zafra, Cristina; Caballero-Chabrera, Francesc; Modesto-Alapont, Vicente; Oltra-Benavent, Manuel",,300,33

In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase. A review is presented in this article of the cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Figueroa Triana, Juan Francisco; Salas Márquez, Diego Alfredo; Cabrera Silva, Juan Sebastián; Alvarado Castro, Cristian Camilo; Buitrago Sandoval, Andrés Felipe",Rev.

While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is bestowed with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, involving the vital organs, the respiratory system transpires as the main route of entry for SARS-CoV-2, with the lungs being its primary target. Of those infected, up to 20% require hospitalization on account of severity, while the majority of patients are either asymptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms. Exacerbation in the disease severity and complications of COVID-19 infection have been associated with multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and chronic lung disease. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated the pulmonary and gut microbiomes as potential modulators for altering the course of COVID-19, potentially via the microbiome-immune system axis. While the relative concordance between microbes and immunity has yet to be fully elucidated with regards to COVID-19, we present an overview of our current understanding of COVID-19-microbiome-immune cross talk and discuss the potential contributions of microbiome-related immunity to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and COVID-19 disease progression.","Cyprian, Farhan; Sohail, Muhammad Umar; Abdelhafez, Ibrahim; Salman, Salma; Attique, Zakria; Kamareddine, Layla; Al-Asmakh, Maha",Int J Infect Dis,300,25

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 can spill over into outdoor environments and impose transmission risks to surrounding people and communities. In this study, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in 118 samples from outdoor environment of three hospitals in Wuhan. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in soils (205-550 copies/g), aerosols (285-1,130 copies/m3) and wastewaters (255-18,744 copies/L) in locations close to hospital departments receiving COVID-19 patients or in wastewater treatment sectors. These findings revealed a significant viral spillover in hospital outdoor environments that was possibly caused by respiratory droplets from patients or aerosolized particles from wastewater containing SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in other areas or on surfaces with regular disinfection implemented. Soils may behave as viral warehouse through deposition and serve as a secondary source spreading SARS-CoV-2 for a prolonged time. For the first time, our findings demonstrate that there are high-risk areas out of expectation in hospital outdoor environments to spread SARS-CoV-2, calling for sealing of wastewater treatment unit and complete sanitation to prevent COVID-19 transmission risks.","Zhang, Dayi Zhang Xian Yang Yunfeng Huang Xia Jiang Jingkun Li Miao Ling Haibo Li Jing Liu Yi Li Guanghe Li Weiwei Yi Chuan Zhang Ting Jiang Yongzhong Xiong Yan He Zhenyu Wang Xinzi Deng Songqiang Zhao Peng Qu Jiuhui",Journal of Hazardous Materials Letters,300,5

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed quality, and extracted the data (PROSPERO registration #CRD42020182363). A total of 17 observational studies were included. The findings suggest that there was a reduction in the vaccination coverage and decline in total number of vaccines administered, which led to children missing out on their vaccine doses. An approximately fourfold increase was also observed in polio cases in polio endemic countries. Factors contributing to low vaccine coverage included fear of being exposed to the virus at health care facilities, restriction on city-wide movements, shortage of workers, and diversion of resources from child health to address the pandemic. As the world re-strategizes for the post-2020 era, we should not let a crisis go to waste as they provide an opportunity to establish guidelines and allocate resources for future instances.

These questions were investigated using the mandatory reporting data in Frankfurt am Main and the extensive testing of contact persons (CP) in schools and daycare centers after the occurrence of an index case. Method: The reporting data were taken from SurvStat. The index cases from daycare centers and schools were isolated and the CPs were offered PCR testing for SARS-CoV­2 on a voluntary basis, regardless of whether symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV­2 had occurred or not. Deep nasal/pharyngeal swabs were collected by paramedics on behalf of the public health department of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and tested according to established standards at two accredited institutes. Results: From March to 31 December 2020, 22,715 COVID-19 cases were reported in Frankfurt, including 1588 (7.6%) SARS-CoV­2 detections in children 14 years and younger. Thus, approximately half as many SARS-CoV­2 detections were reported in children up to 14 years of age than would have corresponded to their proportion in the population. In autumn 2020, the increase in incidence in children over the weeks followed the increase in incidence in the general population, the age-related incidence of children remained below the incidence in the general population.From week 35 to week 52, index cases were reported from 143 daycare centers and 75 schools. As a result, 7915 CPs were tested. In daycare centers, SARS-CoV­2 was detected in 4.5% of adult CPs and 2.5% of child CPs and in schools SARS-CoV­2 was detected in 0.9% of adult CPs and 2.5% of student CPs tested. On average, less than 1 CP tested positive per index case. The rate of positive findings increased with increasing incidence in the overall population. No major outbreak occurred. Discussion: Regarding the level and timing of age-related incidences among children in Frankfurt am Main, there was no evidence that children were the drivers of the pandemic. Only a small percentage of the examined CPs in schools and daycare centers tested positive for SARS-CoV­2. In the absence of evidence of intense transmission in the facilities, CP attendance can/should continue under hygiene conditions and there is no need to close entire groups, classes, or even facilities.","Heudorf, Ursel; Steul, Katrin; Walczok, Antoni; Gottschalk, Rene",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,300,15

The status of pandemic increased the risks of isolated hypothyroxinemia in first and second trimesters (OR = 1.547, 95%CI = 1.251,1.913, p < 0.001) and first trimester (OR = 1.651, 95%CI = 1.289,2.114, p < 0.001) when adjusting for the covariates. However, these associations disappeared in the women with positive TPOAb (p > 0.05). Additionally, we found associations between daily reported new case of COVID-19 and maternal FT4 for single-day lag1, lag3 and multi-day lag01 and lag04 when adjusting for the covariates (each p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mass confinement as a primary community control strategy may have a significant cost to public health resources. Access to health service systems and adequate medical resources should be improved for pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hua, Jing; Shen, Jiajin; Zhang, Jiajia; Zhou, Yingchun; Du, Wenchong; Williams, Gareth J",Psychoneuroendocrinology,300,21

[...]a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue-based test is needed to establish the diagnosis of COVID-19 and guide management of the patient. Potential regional or temporal heterogeneity in viral genomic sequence due to genetic selection or drift may play a similar role, impacting the ability of existing targeted PCR assays to detect the virus in specimens from patients with COVID-19. Because formalin fixation can impact the quality and integrity of nucleic acid, sensitivity for the detection of microorganisms by PCR or other techniques may also be limited.","Roden, Anja C.; Vrana, Julie A.; Koepplin, Justin W.; Hudson, Angela E.; Norgan, Andrew P.; Jenkinson, Garrett Yamaoka Satoko Ebihara Hideki Monroe Robert Szabolcs Matthias J.; Majumdar, Ramanath Moyer Ann M.; García, Joaquin J.; Kipp, Benjamin R.",Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine,300,16

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review is to summarize the available studies which have compared the respective effectiveness of surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirators for the prevention of infections caused by viruses that are transmitted by the respiratory tract. METHODS: The relevant scientific literature was identified by querying the PubMed database with a combination of search strings. The narrower search string ""(surgical mask *) AND (respirator OR respirators)"" included all the relevant articles retrieved using broader search strategies. Of all the relevant articles found, seven systematic reviews were selected and examined. RESULTS: The currently available scientific evidence seems to suggest that surgical masks and N95 respirators/FFP2 confer an equivalent degree of protection against airborne viral infections. DISCUSSION: Since surgical masks are less expensive than N95 respirators but seem to be as effective in protecting against airborne infection and they are also more comfortable for the user, requiring less respiratory work, they should be the standard protective device for health care workers and especially for workers who carry out non-medical jobs. Filtering facepiece respirators, whose extended use is less comfortable for the wearer, may be preferred for procedures which require greater protection for a shorter time.","Violante, Tommaso; Violante, Francesco Saverio",Med Lav,300,16

However, the quality of available evidence is generally low, and regulatory frameworks have focused on apps with medical purposes only, overlooking apps with significant interactions with patients that may require stronger oversight.Areas covered: To support this expanded evidence generation process, we identified the reasons that distinguish mHealth apps compared to medical devices at large and that should differentially feature their assessment. mHealth apps are characterized by the iterative nature of the corresponding interventions, frequent user interactions with a non-linear relationship between technology usage, engagement and outcomes, significant organizational implications, as well as challenges associated with genericization, their broad diagnostic potential, and price setting.Expert Opinion: The renewed reliance experienced during the pandemic and the unprecedented injection of resources through recovery instruments can further boost the development of apps. Only robust evidence of the benefits of mHealth apps will persuade health-care professionals and beneficiaries to systematically deploy them. Regulatory bodies will need to question their current approaches by adopting comprehensive evaluation processes that adequately consider the specific features of mHealth apps.","Tarricone, Rosanna; Petracca, Francesco; Ciani, Oriana; Cucciniello, Maria",Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,300,26

This has led to an increase in the demand for palliative care beyond what can be provided by most existing programs. We developed a scalable model to enable continued provision of high-quality palliative care during a pandemic for hospitals without a palliative care unit or existing dedicated palliative care beds. METHODS: A COVID-19 consultation service working group (CWG) was convened with stakeholders from palliative care, emergency medicine, critical care, and general internal medicine. The CWG connected with local palliative care teams to ensure a coordinated response, and developed a model to ensure high-quality palliative care provision. RESULTS: Our 3-step scalable model included: (1) consultant model enhanced by virtual care; (2) embedded model; and (3) cohorted end-of-life unit for COVID-19 positive patients. This approach was enabled through tools and resources to ensure specialist palliative care capacity and rapid upskilling of all clinicians to deliver basic palliative care. Enabling tools and resources included a triage tool for in-person versus virtual care, new medication order sets and guidelines to facilitate prescribing for common symptoms, and lead advance care planning and goals of care discussions. A redeployment plan of generalist physicians and psychiatrists was created to ensure seamless provision of serious illness care. CONCLUSION: This 3-step, scalable approach enables rapid upscaling of palliative care in collaboration with generalist physicians, and may be adapted for future pandemics or natural disasters.","Kaya, Ebru; Lewin, Warren; Frost, David; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,300,28

An Assessment of Resources Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic,18.976753,4.075587,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of lockdown during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic on daily all-cause admissions, and by age and diagnosis subgroups, and the odds of all-cause mortality in a hospital in rural KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). DESIGN: Observational cohort. SETTING: Referral hospital for 17 primary care clinics in uMkhanyakude District. PARTICIPANTS: Data collected by the Africa Health Research Institute on all admissions from 1 January to 20 October: 5848 patients contributed to 6173 admissions. EXPOSURE: Five levels of national lockdown in South Africa from 27 March 2020, with restrictions decreasing from levels 5 to 1, respectively. OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes and trends in daily all-cause admissions and risk of in-hospital mortality before and at each stage of lockdown, estimated by Poisson and logistic interrupted time series regression, with stratification for age, sex and diagnosis. RESULTS: Daily admissions decreased during level 5 lockdown for infants (incidence rate ratio (IRR) compared with prelockdown 0.63, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.90), children aged 1-5 years old (IRR 0.43, 95% CI 028 to 0.65) and respiratory diagnoses (IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.90). From level 4 to level 3, total admissions increased (IRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28), as well as for men >19 years (IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.92) and respiratory diagnoses (IRR 4.26, 95% CI 2.36 to 7.70). Among patients admitted to hospital, the odds of death decreased during level 5 compared with prelockdown (adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.83) and then increased in later stages. CONCLUSIONS: Level 5 lockdown is likely to have prevented the most vulnerable population, children under 5 years and those more severely ill from accessing hospital care in rural KZN, as reflected by the drop in admissions and odds of mortality. Subsequent increases in admissions and in odds of death in the hospital could be due to improved and delayed access to hospital as restrictions were eased.","McIntosh, Amy; Bachmann, Max; Siedner, Mark J; Gareta, Dickman; Seeley, Janet; Herbst, Kobus",BMJ Open,300,29

The primordium of the adenohypophysis as well as the primordium of the hypothalamus in amphibians is of neural origin as shown in other vertebrates, and both are closely associated with each other at the earliest stage of development. Metamorphosis progresses via the interaction of thyroid hormone and adrenal corticosteroids, of which secretion is enhanced by thyrotropin and corticotropin, respectively. However, unlike in mammals, the hypothalamic releasing factor for thyrotropin is not thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), but corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and the major releasing factor for corticotropin is arginine vasotocin (AVT). Prolactin, the release of which is profoundly enhanced by TRH at the metamorphic climax, is another pituitary hormone involved in metamorphosis. Prolactin has a dual role: modulation of the metamorphic speed and the development of organs for adult life. The secretory activities of the pituitary cells containing the three above-mentioned pituitary hormones are elevated toward the metamorphic climax in parallel with the activities of the CRF, AVT, and TRH neurons.","Kikuyama, Sakae; Hasunuma, Itaru; Okada, Reiko",Mol Cell Endocrinol,300,20

However, numerous uncertainties exist regarding the pros and cons of vaccination, especially in patients with (immune-mediated) kidney diseases on immunosuppressive drugs. Here, members of the Immunonephrology Working Group (IWG) of the European Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association (ERA-EDTA) discuss thirteen frequently-asked questions regarding safety and efficacy of the most promising vaccine candidates. Post-marketing surveillance should be performed to estimate the rate of vaccine response (humoral and cellular) of different vaccine platforms, and surveillance of disease activity following administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Some of the candidates induce signaling pathways which also promote autoimmune kidney diseases, e.g. type I interferons in systemic lupus erythematosus. Efficacy estimates would thus far favor the use of selected COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 or Gam-COVID-Vac. Humoral immune response after vaccination should be monitored using appropriate assays. Even in the absence of neutralizing antibodies patients might be protected by a sufficient cellular immune response capable to reduce severity of COVID-19. A reduced vaccine response after the use of CD20-depleting agents is anticipated, and it is particularly important to discuss strategies to improve vaccine response with these patients. Distancing and shielding measures remain important as not all vaccines fully protect from coronavirus infection. In-depth information about the most pressing vaccine questions is essential to reduce vaccine hesitancy of patients.","Kronbichler, Andreas; Anders, Hans-Joachim; Fernandez-Juárez, Gema Maria; Floege, Jürgen; Goumenos, Dimitrios; Segelmark, Mårten; Tesar, Vladimir; Turkmen, Kultigin; van Kooten, Cees; Bruchfeld, Annette",Nephrol. dial. transplant,300,16

Conflicting results have been reported about the response to coronavirus infection and COVID-19 outcomes in men and women. Understanding predictors of intensive care unit admission might be of help for future planning and management of the disease. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We designed a cross-sectional observational multicenter nationwide survey in Italy to understand gender-related clinical predictors of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19. We analyzed information from 2378 charts of Italian patients certified for COVID-19 admitted in 26 hospitals. Three hundred ninety-five patients (16.6%) required ICU admission due to COVID19 infection, more frequently men (74%), with a higher prevalence of comorbidities (1,78±0,06 vs 1,54±0,03 p<0.05). In multivariable regression model main predictors of admission to ICU are male gender (OR 1,74 95% CI 1,36-2,22 p<0.0001) and presence of obesity (OR 2,88 95% CI 2,03-4,07 p<0.0001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1,588; 95%, 1,036-2,434 p<0,05) and hypertension (OR: 1,314; 95% 1,039-1,662; p<0,05). In gender specific analysis, obesity, chronic kidney disease and hypertension are associated with higher rate of admission to ICU among men, whereas in women, obesity (OR: 2,564; 95% CI 1,336-4.920 p<0.0001) and heart failure (OR: 1,775 95% CI: 1,030-3,057) are associated with higher rate of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that gender is the primary determinant of the disease's severity among COVID-19. Obesity is the condition more often observed among those admitted to ICU within both genders.

Little is known about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity, and neutralization antibody response in patients with COVID-19. Two groups of patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study: 12 severely ill patients in intensive care units who needed mechanical ventilation and 11 mildly ill patients in isolation wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory detection. Results showed that most of the severely ill patients had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20-40 days after onset of disease (8/12, 66.7%), while the majority of mildly ill patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract and had no detectable virus RNA 10 days after onset (9/11, 81.8%). Mildly ill patients showed significantly lower IgM response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses were detected in most patients in both the severe and mild groups at 9 days after onset, and remained at a high level throughout the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected in patients with COVID-19 but not in patients with MERS. High levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after about 10 days after onset in both severely and mildly ill patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization test with authentic virus showed consistent results. Sera from patients with COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry. Sera from convalescent patients with SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) did not. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and N IgG levels exhibited a moderate correlation with neutralization titers in patients' plasma.

A pandemia tem se configurado como uma crise humanitária, uma vez que tanto a doença quanto as medidas de contenção desta geram efeitos socioeconômicos persistentes. Nesse contexto, a categoria trabalho assume um papel relevante, seja pela viabilidade de manutenção do distanciamento social e das condições de vida permitidas pelo vínculo de trabalho, seja pela impossibilidade de adoção das estratégias de proteção devido à precarização do trabalho.

We find a strong theoretical relation between the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of the time spent on distracting activities and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of home office labor. We also analyze the effect that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of home office labor has on the marginal productivity of effective labor and the growth rate of production.","Nilmar de Oliveira, José Orrillo Jaime Gamboa Franklin",International Journal of Economic Theory,300,33

In many areas it has been moved from the more traditional ECT suites to general surgical theatres for a number of reasons, most notably being the need to ensure adequate ventilation. The introduction of the need for PPE to be worn throughout ECT and for general hospital operating procedures to be adhered to has also been a big change. The change in the required infection control procedures has had an impact on treatment capacity and has led many areas to reduce, relocate or centralise their ECT provisions which has had a knock on effect on training.This study assesses the perceived impact COVID-19 has had on the provision of training and learning in ECT for core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West as well as their perceived competence levels.MethodViews were sought through surveys and focus groups from September to December 2020, participants were core and higher psychiatry trainees in the North West. Participants were recruited via email, the total population size was 87, 21 Core trainees responded and 14 higher trainees. From the survey respondents, 5 participants agreed to attend a focus group.ResultResults show that the provision of ECT training has been poor during the COVID-19 outbreak. Almost 81% of core trainees surveyed and 92.86% of higher trainees had participated in no ECT sessions from the start of the COVID-19 outbreak to the time of data collection eight to ten months later.81% of core trainees and 85.71% of higher trainees had received no teaching in any form about ECT over the period studied.When considering the competencies required in ECT for a core trainee, one (4.76%) felt they were fully competent, 3 (14.29%) nearly competent, 7(33.33%) needs some improvement, 10 (47.62%) not yet competent. Only one higher trainee felt they met the RCPsych competencies, 5 (35.71%) were nearly competent, 6 (42.86%) need some improvement and 2 (14.29%) were not yet competent.ConclusionThis study indicates a clear lack of provision of training which is very concerning ,and possibly pre dates the COVID outbreak, particularly in the case of specialty trainees who may well be consultants in a number of months and will not have the time to make up for the lost training. In order for ECT provision to continue it is crucial that we are able to adequately train the future workforce.","Webb, Cara",BJPsych Open,300,29

As endoribonuclease activity seems to be responsible for the interference with the innate immune response, Nsp15 emerges as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Here we report the first structures with bound nucleotides and show how the enzyme specifically recognizes uridine moiety. In addition to a uridine site we present evidence for a second base binding site that can accommodate any base. The structure with a transition state analog, uridine vanadate, confirms interactions key to catalytic mechanisms. In the presence of manganese ions, the enzyme cleaves unpaired RNAs. This acquired knowledge was instrumental in identifying Tipiracil, an FDA approved drug that is used in the treatment of colorectal cancer, as a potential anti-COVID-19 drug. Using crystallography, biochemical, and whole-cell assays, we demonstrate that Tipiracil inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by interacting with the uridine binding pocket in the enzyme's active site.

This pandemic is characterized by a high variability in death rate (defined as the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of infected people) across world countries. Several possible explanations have been proposed, but it is not clear whether this variability is due to a single predominant factor or instead to multiple causes. Here we addressed this issue using multivariable regression analysis to test the impact of the following factors: the hospital stress (defined as the ratio between the number of infected cases and the total number of hospital beds), the population median age, and the quality of the National Health System (NHS). For this analysis, we chose countries of the world with over 3000 infected cases as of April 1, 2020. Hospital stress was found to be the crucial factor in explaining the variability of death rate, while the others had negligible relevance. Different procedures for quantifying cases of infection and death for COVID-19 could affect the variability in death rate across countries. We therefore applied the same statistical approach to Italy, which is divided into 20 Regions that share the same protocol for counting the outcomes of this pandemic. Correlation between hospital stress and death rate was even stronger than that observed for countries of the world. Based on our findings and the historical trend for the availability of hospital beds, we propose guidelines for policy-makers to properly manage future pandemics.","Bigiani, Lorenzo; Bigiani, Stefano; Bigiani, Albertino",Int. j. health policy manag,300,16

There is a high frequency of increased BMI in patients admitted to intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 infection with a major severity in patients with an excess of visceral adiposity. Patients at risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory syndrome are characterised by the high prevalence of pre-existing diseases (high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer), most of them typically present in severely obese patients. Indeed, the biological role of adipose tissue in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely elucidated. SUMMARY: The forced isolation due to pandemic containment measures abruptly interrupted the rehabilitation programs to which many patients with severe obesity were enrolled. People affected by obesity, and especially those with severe obesity, should continue clinical rehabilitation programs, taking extra measures to avoid COVID-19 infection and reinforcing the adoption of preventive procedures. In this review, the available data on obesity and COVID-19 are discussed along with evidence-based strategies for maintaining the necessary continuous rehabilitation programs. Key Messages: Greater attention is needed for obese and severely obese patients in the face of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which represents a huge challenge for both patients and healthcare professionals. The adoption of new strategies to guarantee adequate and continuous multidisciplinary nutritional rehabilitation programs will be crucial to control the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations as well as the worsening of obesity-linked complications. Health authorities should be urged to equip hospitals with tools for the diffusion of telemedicine to maintain physician-patient communication, which is fundamental in chronic and complicated obese patients.","De Amicis, Ramona; Cancello, Raffaella; Capodaglio, Paolo; Gobbi, Michele; Brunani, Amelia; Gilardini, Luisa; Castenuovo, Gianluca; Molinari, Enrico; Barbieri, Valerio; Mambrini, Sara Paola; Battezzati, Alberto; Bertoli, Simona",Obes Facts,300,26

DESIGN: A mixed methods survey including questions about exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation service provision, programme diversity, patient complexity, technology use, barriers to using technology, and safety. SETTING: International survey of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals working in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes worldwide. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of programmes that continued providing exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation and which technologies had been used to deliver home-based cardiac rehabilitation. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty eligible responses were received; 89.7% were from the UK. Approximately half (49.3%) of respondents reported that cardiac rehabilitation programmes were suspended due to COVID-19. Of programmes that continued, 25.8% used technology before the COVID-19 pandemic. Programmes typically started using technology within 19 days of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic. 48.8% did not provide cardiac rehabilitation to high-risk patients, telephone was most commonly used to deliver cardiac rehabilitation, and some centres used sophisticated technology such as teleconferencing. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid adoption of technology into standard practice is promising and may improve access to, and participation in, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation beyond COVID-19. However, the exclusion of certain patient groups and programme suspension could worsen clinical symptoms and well-being, and increase hospital admissions.

From March 22 to April 25, it implemented a national lockdown that, apparently, allowed the country to keep a low incidence and mortality rate up to mid-May. Forced by the economic losses, the government then opened many commercial activities, which was followed by an increase in cases and deaths. This paper presents a critical analysis of the Colombian surveillance data in order to identify strengths and pitfalls of the control measures. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of PCR-confirmed cases between March and July 25 was performed. Data were described according to the level of measurement. Incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were estimated by age, sex, and geographical area. Sampling rates for suspected cases were estimated by geographical area, and the potential for case underestimation was assessed using sampling differences. RESULTS: By July 25, Colombia (population 50 372 424) had reported 240 745 cases and 8269 deaths (case fatality rate of 3.4%). A total of 1 370 271 samples had been analyzed (27 405 samples per million people), with a positivity rate of 17%. Sampling rates per million varied by region from 2664 to 158 681 per million, and consequently the incidence and mortality rates also varied. Due to geographical variations in surveillance capacity, Colombia may have overlooked up to 82% of the actual cases. CONCLUSION: Colombia has a lower case and mortality incidence compared to other South American countries. This may be an effect of the lockdown, but may also be attributed, to some extent, to geographical differences in surveillance capacity. Indigenous populations with little health infrastructure have been hit the hardest.","De la Hoz-Restrepo, Fernando; Alvis-Zakzuk, Nelson J; De la Hoz-Gomez, Juan Fernando; De la Hoz, Alejandro; Gómez Del Corral, Luz; Alvis-Guzmán, Nelson",Int J Infect Dis,300,16

[...]many scholars critically regarded remote teaching as an equivalent to distance education or online learning, and official guidelines set by the Brazilian Ministry of Education for educational activities during and after the pandemic mentioned 'longdistance activities' and 'classes via digital media' indistinctly. Other designations for offsite education during the pandemic highlight different aspects of these experiences, such as the use of technological resources or synchronism: 'online teaching', 'online learning', 'online education', 'online classes', 'online classroom', 'classes via digital media' and 'teleclasses'. According to an essay published by Daros (2020) on Portal Desafios da Educacao [Education Challenges Website] in the early days of the Brazilian response to the pandemic, DE is not a proper definition or identifier for remote activities because ""remote activities means using the Internet to conduct pedagogical activities in a temporary, one-time fashion, with the goal of minimizing crisis impacts on learners forced to shift from their original in-person classes.""","Saldanha, Luís Cláudio Dallier",Journal of Higher Education Theory and Practice,300,12

Clinics have undergone a prolonged and unforeseen lockdown, and patients are finding it extremely difficult to cope with their regular checkups and appointments. Advances in material sciences, simulation software, and 3D printing have enabled aligners to offer treatment solutions for complicated orthodontic problems. An orthodontist can use virtual simulations to plan out the entire treatment on a computerized three-dimensional model, and then order aligners using these simulations. Patient compliance is one of the principal issues with clear aligner therapy and at a time when branded aligners are facing issues with regard to shipping, the entire process has become very expensive. For these reasons, it would be a good idea to consider using in-house fabricated aligners. In-house aligners can be easily fabricated using thermoformed plastic which is adapted to complex three-dimensional tooth surfaces that have a bearing on the deflection of the aligner on placement. They hold advantages over traditional commercially available aligners in terms of cost effectiveness and time required for fabrication and delivery. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Is a routine procedure necessary?,18.993435,3.9722183,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is still a world-class challenge. Inflammation, especially its severe form with excess release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) which is a life-threatening condition, is among the most important suspects involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It has been shown that cytokine storm could cause notable morbidities such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which leads to hypoxia which is significantly associated with mortality of patients with COVID-19. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) which activates following ARDS-induced hypoxia plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of cytokine storm. The expression of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin 1 ß (IL-1ß), and IL-6 which are key elements of cytokine storm are by nuclear factor &#954;ß (NF&#954;B). Interestingly, during the hypoxia, HIF-1&#945; activates NF&#954;B to induce expression of pro-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory factors. These released factors starts a autocrine/paracrine loop and causes deterioration of their etiological pathways of expression: cytokine storm and ARDS. To sum up, it seems HIF-1&#945; is an important target to hit to ameliorate the mentioned pathways. Herein, we suggest perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which are among the organofluorine compounds as a possible co-treatment to reduce hypoxemia and then hypoxia. These substances are known for their high gas solving potential that make them able to be used as a synthetic artificial blood product. Due to the potential of PFCs to affect the fountain of important physiopathological pathway such as inflammation a hypoxia through affecting NF&#954;B, they could be considered as multi-target co-treatment for ARD individuals with COVID-19. It is highly suggested to evaluate this hypothesis in following researches.","Moasefi, Narges; Fouladi, Mehdi; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein; Yarani, Reza; Rahmani, Adibeh; Mansouri, Kamran",Inflamm Res,300,16

There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements. Low-fidelity surgical simulation appears to be an alternative for surgical training. The educational benefits of repeating ossiculoplasty simulations under a microscope have never been evaluated. With this study we aimed to evaluate the differences in performance scores and on a global rating scale before and after training on an ossiculoplasty simulator. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental, prospective, single-centre, before-after study with blinded rater evaluation, residents performed five microscopic ossiculoplasty tasks with a difficulty gradient (sliding beads onto rods, the insertion of a partial prosthesis, the insertion of a total prosthesis, and the insertion of a stapedotomy piston under microscopic or endoscopic surgery) before and after training on the same simulator. Performance scores were defined for each task, and total performance scores (score/min) were calculated. All data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Six out of seven intermediate residents and 8/9 novices strongly agreed that the simulator was an effective training device and should be included in the ENT residency program. The mean effect of training was a significant increase in the total performance score (+ 0.52 points/min, [95 % CI, 0.40-0.64], p < 0.001), without a significant difference between novice and intermediate residents. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that techniques for middle-ear surgery can be acquired using a simulator, avoiding any risk for patients, even under lockdown measures.","Fieux, Maxime; Gavoille, Antoine; Subtil, Fabien; Bartier, Sophie; Tringali, Stéphane",BMC Med Educ,300,24

METHODS: The LitCovid database was systematically reviewed for ophthalmology-focused COVID-19 articles. The quality of the evidence was assessed for articles investigating conjunctivitis in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 21,364 articles in LitCovid on June 12, 2020, of which 215 (1%) were ophthalmology-focused. Of articles on COVID-19 transmission, 3.3% were ophthalmology-focused. Ophthalmology-focused articles were published in 68 journals and originated from 25 countries. The top five countries publishing ophthalmology-focused articles (China, India, United States of America, Italy, and United Kingdom) produced 145/215 (67%) articles. A total of 16 case reports/series from eight countries reported that conjunctivitis can be the initial or the only symptom of COVID-19 infection. Conjunctivitis may occur in the middle phase of COVID-19 illness. A total of 10 hospital-based cross-sectional studies reported that between 0% and 31.6% of COVID-19 patients have conjunctivitis or other ocular conditions, with a pooled prevalence of 5.5% reported in a meta-analysis. Viral RNA was detected in conjunctival swabs of patients with and without ocular manifestations, after resolution of conjunctivitis, after nasopharyngeal swabs turned negative and in retina of deceased COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Within 3 months of declaring the COVID-19 pandemic, 215 ophthalmology-focused articles were published in PubMed, concentrating on disease manifestations and transmission. The reported presence of conjunctivitis or other ocular conditions in COVID-19 patients is varied. Clinicians should be alert for ocular involvement in COVID-19 infections and possible ocular transmission even in patients without ocular symptoms.","Jin, Ya-Ping; Trope, Graham E; El-Defrawy, Sherif; Liu, Elin Y; Buys, Yvonne M",Eur J Ophthalmol,300,1

We have also shown that exosomes secreted from MSCs preirradiated with 2 Gy are quantitatively, functionally and qualitatively different from the exosomes secreted from nonirradiated mesenchymal cells, and also that proteins, exosomes and microvesicles secreted by MSCs suffer a significant change when the cells are activated or nonactivated, with the amount of protein present in the exosomes of the preirradiated cells being 1.5 times greater compared to those from nonirradiated cells. This finding correlates with a dramatic increase in the antitumor activity of the radiotherapy when is combined with MSCs or with preirradiated mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs*). After the proteomic analysis of the load of the exosomes released from both irradiated and nonirradiated cells, we conclude that annexin A1 is the most important and significant difference between the exosomes released by the cells in either status. Knowing the role of annexin A1 in the control of hypoxia and inflammation that is characteristic of acute respiratory-distress syndrome (ARDS), we designed a hypothetical therapeutic strategy, based on the transplantation of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells stimulated with radiation, to alleviate the symptoms of patients who, due to pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, require to be admitted to an intensive care unit for patients with life-threatening conditions.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats received vapourized THC (10â¯mg of THC vapourized for four adolescent rats) or vehicle every other day (from post-natal day (PND) 28-42) and had continuous voluntary access to ethanol (10% volume/volume) in adolescence. Alcohol intake was measured during the exposure period to assess the acute effects of THC on alcohol consumption. In adulthood (PND 56+), rats underwent behavioural testing. Adolescent rats showed higher alcohol preference, assessed using the two-bottle choice test, on days on which they were not exposed to THC vapour. In adulthood, rats that drank alcohol as adolescents exhibited short-term memory deficits and showed decreased alcohol preference; on the other hand, rats exposed to THC vapour showed learning impairments in a delay-discounting task. Vapourized THC, alcohol or their combination had no effect on anxiety-like behaviours in adulthood. Our results show that although adolescent THC exposure acutely affects alcohol drinking, adolescent alcohol and cannabis co-use may not produce long-term additive effects.","Hamidullah, Shahnaza; Lutelmowski, Claudia D; Creighton, Samantha D; Luciani, Karling R; Frie, Jude A; Winters, Boyer D; Khokhar, Jibran",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,300,1

The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events.

This study aims to assess the frequency of infections, community and hospital-acquired infections, and risk factors for infections and mortality during severe COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective single-center study including consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe COVID-19. Competing-risk analyses were used to assess cumulative risk of infections. Time-dependent Cox and fine and gray models were used to assess risk factors for infections and mortality. Propensity score matching was performed to estimate the effect of dexamethasone. RESULTS: We included 100 patients including 34 patients with underlying malignancies or organ transplantation. First infectious event was bacterial for 35 patients, and fungal for one. Cumulative incidence of infectious events was 27% [18-35] at 10 ICU-days. Prevalence of community-acquired infections was 7% [2.8-13.9]. Incidence density of hospital-acquired infections was 125 [91-200] events per 1000 ICU-days. Risk factors independently associated with hospital-acquired infections included MV. Patient's severity and underlying malignancy were associated with mortality. Dexamethasone was associated with increased infections (36% [20-53] vs. 12% [4-20] cumulative incidence at day-10;p = 0.01). After matching, dexamethasone was associated with hospital-acquired infections (35% [18-52] vs. 13% [1-25] at 10 days, respectively, p = 0.03), except in the subset of patients requiring MV, and had no influence on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of COVID-19 patients with high prevalence of underlying immune defect, a high risk of infections was noted.

METHOD: This is a case report describing the novel use of VAC (Vacuum-Assisted Closure Device) in the successful closure of a wound defect with cochlear implant hardware exposure post soft tissue infection during the Covid-19 pandemic. RESULTS: While the VAC system was initiated for temporary wound coverage, it was observed at each dressing change to be successfully decreasing the soft tissue defect for our patient. This resulted in complete epithelisation of the soft tissue defect at Day 35 and avoidance of a surgical procedure. The patient was able to restart wearing her device on Day 50 and Cochlear MAPping performed on Day 58 showed minimal changes in patient's current requirements compared to her settings pre-infection.

Drawing DNA restriction map is a particularly important technology in genetic biology. The simplified partial digestion method (SPDP), a biological method, has been widely used to cut DNA molecules into DNA fragments and obtain the biological information of each fragment. In this work, we propose an algorithm based on 0-1 planning for the location of restriction sites on a DNA molecule, which is able to solve the problem of DNA fragment reconstruction just based on data of fragments' length. Two specific examples are presented in detail. Furthermore, based on 1000 groups of original DNA sequences randomly generated, we define the coincidence rate and unique coincidence rate between the reconstructed DNA sequence and the original DNA sequence, and then analyze separately the effect of the number of fragments and the maximum length of DNA fragments on the coincidence rate and unique coincidence rate as defined. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proved. Besides, based on the existing optimization solution obtained, we simulate and discuss the influence of the error by computation method. It turns out that the error of position of one restriction site does not affect other restriction sites and errors of most restriction sites may lead to the failure of sequence reconstruction. Matlab 7.1 program is used to solve feasible solutions of the location of restriction sites, derive DNA fragment sequence and carry out the statistical analysis and error analysis. This paper focuses on basic computer algorithm implementation of rearrangement and sequencing rather than biochemical technology. The innovative application of the mathematical idea of 0-1 planning to DNA sequence mapping construction, to a certain extent, greatly simplifies the difficulty and complexity of calculation and accelerates the process of 'jigsaw' of DNA fragments.","Fang, Ningyuan; Wang, Kaifa; Tong, Dali",Interdiscip Sci,300,29

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in four universities in Guangdong Province (China) based on purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire was given to College students (CSs) to measure the supportive attitude towards an outbreak control strategy and adoption of NPIs in respondents. RESULTS: A total of 44,446 CSs participated between 31 January and 10 February 2020; 92.7% of respondents supported the outbreak control strategy. The proportion of respondents who avoided public places, wore a facemask, avoid gatherings, and washed hands more frequently than usual was 94.8, 92.8, 91.2 and 86.9%. respectively. A total of 76.5% respondents adopted all four measures. A supportive attitude was associated with NPI adoption. Students who were female, postgraduate, anxious, and not depressed tended to have a higher supportive attitude and higher chance of NPI adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Higher supportiveness towards the disease control strategy for the Chinese public may lead to higher adoption rate of NPIs. Psychosocial factors were related to a supportive attitude and adoption of the NPI. We believe that our findings could aid policymakers to create NPIs to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.

Rhinoviruses (RVs) and Enteroviruses (EVs) are recognized as leading causes of ARI. OBJECTIVES: The present study describes the molecular epidemiology of RVs and EVs in Cameroon over a 3‐year surveillance period. METHODS: From September 2011 to October 2014, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients with influenza‐like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). Two sub‐genomic regions of the EVs and RVs were targeted for molecular characterization. These included the most conserved 5′‐untranslated region (5′UTR) and the viral protein 4/viral protein 2 transition region (VP4/VP2). RESULTS: A total of 974 samples were collected. Children ≤5 years accounted for 85.7% (835/974) of all participants. Among them, 160 (16.4%) were positive for RVs and/or EVs. RVs and/or EVs were significantly more identified in ILI compared to SARI patients (P = .015). Both viruses co‐circulated all year long with a marked increase of occurrence during rainy and cold season. All RV species were found to circulate in Cameroon, with 6, 10 and 6 virus types belonging to the RV‐A, RV‐B and RV‐C, respectively. EV species identified comprised EV‐A (1 Coxsackie virus A5), EV‐B (1 Coxsackie virus A9 and 2 Coxsackie virus B1) and EV‐C (1 EV‐C117). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a strong year‐round occurrence of EV and RV associated respiratory infections in Cameroon. Molecular characterization identified a wide variety of RVs and EVs in patients with ARI in Cameroon.","Kenmoe, Sebastien; Sadeuh‐Mba, Serge Alain; Vernet, Marie‐Astrid; Penlap Beng, Véronique; Vabret, Astrid; Njouom, Richard",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,300,16

Objectives: We estimated the association between patients characteristics and COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome in Mexico. Methods: This retrospective case series used a publicly available nation-level dataset released on May 31, 2020 by the Mexican Ministry of Health, with patients classified as suspected cases of viral respiratory disease. Patients with COVID-19 were laboratory-confirmed. Their profile was stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis or not. Differences among COVID-19 patients based on two separate clinical endpoints, hospitalization and adverse outcome, were examined. Multivariate logistic regressions examined the associations between patient characteristics and hospitalization and adverse outcome. Results: Overall, 236,439 patients were included, with 89,756 (38.0%) being diagnosed with COVID-19. COVID-19 patients were disproportionately older, males and with increased prevalence of one or more comorbidities, particularly diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity and having one or more comorbidities were independently associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers were 23% less likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. Of all COVID-19 patients, 34.8% were hospitalized and 13.0% experienced an adverse outcome. Male gender, older age, having one or more comorbidities, and chronic renal disease, diabetes, obesity, COPD, immunosuppression and hypertension were associated with hospitalization and adverse outcome. Current smoking was not associated with adverse outcome. Conclusion: This largest ever case series of COVID-19 patients identified risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization and adverse outcome.

Vaccination against COVID‐19 is especially important in these patients, but whether they develop an immune response following vaccination is unknown. We studied serologic responses to the BNT162b2 vaccine in this population. A lower proportion of patients were seropositive following vaccination (75%) than in a comparison group (99%; p < 0.001), and median (interquartile range [IQR]) antibody titers in patients were lower (90 [12.4–185.5] and 173 [133–232] AU/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase, and number of treatment lines correlated with lower seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers, while absolute lymphocyte count, globulin level, and time from last treatment to vaccination correlated with higher seropositivity likelihood and antibody titers. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients had the lowest seropositivity rate followed by indolent lymphoma.

In this study, we analyze the characteristics, evaluation, treatment, and in-hospital outcomes of patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. METHODS: Get With The Guidelines-Stroke is a national registry of adults with stroke in the United States. Using this registry, we identified patients with a diagnosis of AIS before (n=39 113; November 1, 2019–February 3, 2020) and after (n=41 971; February 4, 2020–June 29, 2020) the first reported case of COVID-19 in the registry. Characteristics, treatment patterns, quality metrics, and in-hospital outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Stroke presentations decreased by an average of 15.3% per week in the during COVID-19 time period when compared with similar months in 2019. Compared with patients with AIS in the pre-COVID-19 era, patients in the COVID-19 time period had similar rates of intravenous alteplase and endovascular therapy, and similar door to computed tomography, door to needle, and door to endovascular therapy times. In adjusted models, inpatient mortality was similar between those presenting with AIS pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 (4.8% versus 5.2%; odds ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.97–1.13]).

However, bleeding risk is also significant, causing difficulty in initiating and adjusting anticoagulation therapy in case of suspected thrombi. Cardiac masses can be challenging to be identified properly in the context of this disease. The use of bedside contrast echocardiography (CE) can be of a great value in this situation decreasing procedure-related risk and allowing proper diagnosis and management of a cardiac mass. CASES SUMMARY: We present two cases who were admitted with severe COVID-19 infection. Both cases had additional risk factors for hypercoagulability. Un-enhanced echocardiography was performed and revealed right ventricular (RV) dysfunction with a suspected RV mass. The use of bedside CE could confirm a RV thrombus in the first case and exclude it in the second case. Hence, anticoagulation therapy could be adjusted accordingly in both patients. DISCUSSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 infection is associated with peripheral thrombo-embolism and cardiac thrombi. Given the critical condition of many patients affected by COVID-19, imaging for thrombo-embolic events is often restricted. With the use of bedside CE, cardiac masses may be correctly identified, aiding proper adjustment of anticoagulation therapy.","Botrous, Christina; Bioh, Gabriel; Patel, Ashish; Hampson, Reinette; Senior, Roxy",Eur Heart J Case Rep,300,7

Reports of decreased emergency department (ED) visits in non-epicenters of the outbreak have raised concerns that patients with non-COVID-19 emergencies are delaying or avoiding seeking care. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on ED visits at an academic tertiary care center. METHODS: We conducted an observational health records review between January 1–April 22, 2020, comparing characteristics of all ED visits between pre- and post-pandemic declaration by the World Health Organization. Measures included triage acuity, presenting complaints, final diagnoses, disposition, and mortality. We further examined three time-sensitive final diagnoses: stroke; sepsis; and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). RESULTS: In this analysis, we included 44,497 ED visits. Average daily ED visits declined from 458.1 to 289.0 patients/day (−36.9%). For the highest acuity triaged patients there was a drop of 1.1 patients/day (−24.9%). Daily ED visits related to respiratory complaints increased post-pandemic (+14.1%) while ED visits for many other complaints decreased, with the greatest decline in musculoskeletal (−52.5%) and trauma (−53.6%). On average there was a drop of 1.0 patient/day diagnosed with stroke (−17.6%); a drop of 1.6 patients/day diagnosed with ACS (−49.9%); and no change in patients diagnosed with sepsis (pre = 2.8 patients/day; post = 2.9 patients/day). CONCLUSION: Significant decline in ED visits was observed immediately following formal declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, with potential for delayed/missed presentations of time-sensitive emergencies. Future research is needed to better examine long-term clinical outcomes of the decline in ED visits during pandemics.","Kwok, Edmund S.H.; Clapham, Glenda; Calder-Sprackman, Samantha",West J Emerg Med,300,1

Since, the side effects of plant-derived compounds will be lower compared to synthetic/chemical drugs. The Main protease (3CL(pro) or NSP5) and endoribonuclease (NSP15) proteins are necessity for viral replication and its survival in the host cell. In the present study, in-silico approach of drug development was used to search for potential antiviral plant-derived compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins. Eight plant-derived compounds of which the antiviral activity was known and available, and two reported drugs against SARS-CoV-2 selected for the molecular docking analysis. The docking results suggested that bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, scutellarin, quercetin and myricetin showed least binding energy, i.e., greater than −6.5 Kcal/mol against 3CL(pro) and endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS‐CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease.

One example is their over-representation in early pregnancy and parenting. This paper presents findings from a study of care leaver early parenting in the Australian state of Victoria. Sixteen service provider staff working with care leavers who had become young parents were asked, via focus groups and interviews, for their perspectives on the factors that influence the high prevalence of early parenting amongst care leavers, and the key support services that are available and necessary to assist both care leavers and their children. Service providers raised multiple issues common to the existing leaving care literature concerning the lack of support provided to young people being exited from state care as potentially leading to both early parenting and parenting challenges. Service providers also expressed concern about what many studies of care leaver early parenting have termed ‘surveillance bias’. There was a clear consensus that young people transitioning from care face unique challenges and social isolation due to their difficult experiences pre-care, in-care and post-care. Those experiences place them at risk of disadvantages that impede their ability to demonstrate the practical, physical and financial means to safely raise children. At the same time, they are under greater scrutiny than other parents by being known to child protection already.

The comparison drawn between the proposed model and the existing models shows that the proposed ensemble model gives better accuracy in the case of all the four-disease datasets.","Sharma, Nonita; Dev, Jaiditya; Mangla, Monika; Wadhwa, Vaishali Mehta; Mohanty, Sachi Nandan; Kakkar, Deepti",New Gener Comput,300,26

At the same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights – as well as the possibility of controlling the system – may be compromised. Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic, we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models, considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models according to their structural identifiability and observability under the different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge and measurements.","Massonis, Gemma; Banga, Julio R.; Villaverde, Alejandro F.",Annu Rev Control,300,16

As it is generally the case with other versions of Traditional Medicine, rather than a coherent research program Traditional Chinese Medicine constitutes an array of various techniques and practices coupled with a diversity of very different speculative doctrines regarding the physiological structure of certain body parts as well as the purported etiology of disease and malfunction. This chapter starts off by describing some of the theoretical assumptions on which TCM relies with the aim of casting light on whether they, alongside the clinical techniques TCM encompasses, can significantly be considered as a scientific theory comparable with that of conventional medicine. In so doing the chapter examines a plurality of demarcation criteria between science and non-science coming from various existing philosophical frameworks old and new. While, as will be shown, a wealth of research based on RCTs (randomized control trials) points out that TCM´s degree of effectiveness is low, that is not the point this paper intends to make. Instead of such an empirical criticism, the author sustains a comparably stronger epistemic contention, namely: even if the clinical results of TCM fared better than they actually do, that observation alone would not be a good reason to consider this branch of traditional medicine as a scientifically respectable endeavor.","de Felipe, Íñigo Ongay",Sci Educ (Dordr),300,1

We therefore investigated their perceived usefulness, adherence and their predictors in representative online samples in eight countries (France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, U.K., U.S.). Of the 7,658 participants, 77.4% rated governmental measures (highest: Germany, lowest: France) as useful and 91.7% reported adherence to them. Adherence was lowest in Russia and Poland, where people felt particularly left alone and not well supported, and in the U.S. and Sweden, where governments showed ambivalent attitudes towards the measures. The highest adherence was reported in countries with very high mortality (U.K., Spain, France) or very positively perceived government communication (Germany). Female gender, higher age, belonging to a risk group, being affected physically and mentally, perception of governmental communication as guided by the interests of people, feeling of being well informed and the level of positive mental health positively predicted both outcomes, while being affected economically negatively predicted both outcomes. Country-specific results are considered in the light of the protection motivation theory and the theory of planned behavior together with potential ways to improve active participation of the population. Overall, we recommend the governments and authorities to stress that each individual can contribute to the control of the COVID-19 situation by adherence to the measures in the public communication. Moreover, they should emphasize the risk of unconscious infection of older individuals by younger people, as well as the importance of physical activity for the protection of mental and physical health especially during the pandemic.","Margraf, Jürgen; Brailovskaia, Julia; Schneider, Silvia",PLoS One,300,5

With the continuous development of the epidemic, it has become a national public health crisis and calls for urgent antiviral treatments or vaccines. The spike protein on the coronavirus envelope is critical for host cell infection and virus vitality. Previous studies showed that 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to human SARS-CoV and attaches host cells though the binding of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) domain to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). However, the molecular mechanisms of 2019-nCoV binding to human ACE2 and evolution of 2019-nCoV remain unclear. In this study, we have extensively studied the RBD-ACE2 complex, spike protein, and free RBD systems of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV using protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It was shown that the RBD-ACE2 binding free energy for 2019-nCoV is significantly lower than that for SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that 2019-nCoV is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of 2019-nCoV shows a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that 2019-nCoV is more stable and able to survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This may also provide insights into the evolution of 2019-nCoV because SARS-like coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats that are known to have a higher body-temperature than humans. It was also revealed that the RBD of 2019-nCoV is much more flexible especially near the binding site and thus will have a higher entropy penalty upon binding ACE2, compared to the RBD of SARS-CoV. That means that 2019-nCoV will be much more temperature-sensitive in terms of human infection than SARS-CoV. With the rising temperature, 2019-nCoV is expected to decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV, and get controlled more easily. The present findings are expected to be helpful for the disease prevention and control as well as drug and vaccine development of 2019-nCoV.","He, Jiahua; Tao, Huanyu; Yan, Yumeng; Huang, Sheng-You; Xiao, Yi",bioRxiv,300,28

The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka’s health system. METHODS: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R(0) values after lifting lockdown restrictions. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population at risk; number of identified and recovered cases; percentage identified; infectious period; R(0) or doubling time; percentage critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. RESULTS: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0 = 3.32, 95% CI 1.85–5.41) and from Day 18–30 (R = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.93–1.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lifting lockdown restrictions, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days, signaled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15–22) on Day 14 after lifting lockdown restrictions. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lifting lockdown restrictions, transmission should not exceed R = 1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.","Ediriweera, Dileepa Senajith; de Silva, Nilanthi Renuka; Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika; de Silva, Hithanadura Janaka",PLoS One,300,32

A few reports from the literature suggest that Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVSTs) may be a direct complication of COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical and radiological presentation of COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed with CVST. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, retrospective study of patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 reviewed from March 1, 2020 to November 8, 2020. We evaluated their clinical presentations, risk factors, clinical management, and outcome. We reviewed all published cases of CVST in patients with COVID-19 infection from January 1, 2020 to November 13, 2020. RESULTS: There were 8 patients diagnosed with CVST and COVID-19 during the study period at 7 out of 31 participating centers. Patients in our case series were mostly female (7/8, 87.5%). Most patients presented with non-specific symptoms such as headache (50%), fever (50%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (75%). Several patients presented with focal neurologic deficits (2/8, 25%) or decreased consciousness (2/8, 25%). D-dimer and inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated relative to reference ranges in patients with available laboratory data. The superior sagittal and transverse sinuses were the most common sites for acute CVST formation (6/8, 75%). Median time to onset of focal neurologic deficit from initial COVID-19 diagnosis was 3 days (interquartile range 0.75–3 days). Median time from onset of COVID-19 symptoms to CVST radiologic diagnosis was 11 days (interquartile range 6–16.75 days). Mortality was low in this cohort (1/8 or 12.5%).

In the ICD-10 definition of ATPD, episodes are short-term, lasting from days to three months, followed by complete remission. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports the case of a 37-year-old woman with stress-induced new-onset psychosis instigated by fear of coronavirus infection. METHOD: Physical examinations, paraclinical testing, and neuroimaging excluded an organic cause of symptoms. A thorough anamnestic investigation excluded the presence of other concomitant stress factors as the trigger of the patient’s psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: In response to the COVID-19 lockdown, the patient developed excessive concern about coronavirus infection and, consequently, sleeping difficulties. Symptoms intensified, and she was admitted to the psychiatric ward, presenting with hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech, and disorientation. The clinical picture fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of an Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder. After one week of antipsychotic treatment, her symptoms had remitted, and the patient was discharged. Albeit, four months after treatment discontinuation, her psychotic symptoms re-emerged, and she was readmitted. The patient recovered from symptoms within 48 hours of treatment initiation with antipsychotics. She later reported to have been stressed and anxious while awaiting her coronavirus test result and, following, had doubted the negative result. CONCLUSION: The present case supports previous reports describing the COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on population mental health; the psychological stress caused by the fear of infection can lead to the debut of psychotic manifestations and ATPD.","Loehde, Linda Wolfgang; Novakovic, Mina",European journal of psychotraumatology,300,18

The risk communication pillar of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre is responding to the pandemic by facilitating correct and consistent information to enable the adoption of behaviours to prevent and control COVID-19. This study explored awareness, perception and practice of COVID-19 prevention among residents in Rivers State, Nigeria, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic response. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey among 1294 adult residents across all districts of the state. It employed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of their hands were categorised as adopting correct handwashing practice. Regression modelling was employed to determine predictors of knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention with p=0.05. RESULTS: The respondents were aged 18-80 y with an average age of 39.6 (SD=11.9) y. A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. The most common sources of information about COVID-19 were radio jingles (1102; 86.7%) and television adverts (940; 74.0%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had a poor knowledge of COVID-19. About 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely to contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of respondents washed all the critical parts of their hands correctly.

Here, we studied the response of PDs and applicants to virtual interviews. Virtual interviews could decrease both financial and time commitments. OBJECTIVE: To determine if most applicants and PDs believed that virtual interviews should be used more widely in the future. DESIGN: After the 2020 cardiothoracic fellowship match, an e-mail survey was sent to 66 program directors and 107 applicants using the Qualtrics platform. SETTING: During the 2020 cardiothoracic fellowship interview cycle, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down travel for in-person interviews. This forced a transition to virtual interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Of 107 applicants emailed, 46 (44%) participated with a completion rate of 87%. 66 PDs were contacted and of those, 36 (55%) participated with a 92% survey completion rate. EXPOSURE: All survey participants were participants in the 2020 cardiothoracic match.

RESULTS: 46 applicants (44% participation rate) and 36 PDs (55% participation rate) participated in the survey. 79% of program directors and 55% of applicants either agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews should be offered in the future. However, just 15% of PDs and 20% of applicants either agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews should be offered without the option of an in-person interview. 25% of PDs and applicants agreed or strongly agreed that virtual interviews negatively impacted their chance of matching one of their top applicants/programs. The median cost of an in-person interview was $600 (IQR 500-725). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most applicants and PDs agree that virtual interviews should be offered in the future. 25% of participants reported that they believed virtual interviews negatively impacted their match.

Main outcome measures: Having received the first dose of a vaccine against COVID-19 by 15 March 2021. We calculated vaccination rates and estimated unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression models. Results: By 15 March 2021, 93.2% of people living in England aged 70 years and over had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. While vaccination rates differed across all factors considered apart from sex, the greatest disparities were seen between ethnic and religious groups. The lowest rates were in people of Black African and Black Caribbean ethnic backgrounds, where only 67.2% and 73.9% had received a vaccine, with adjusted odds of not being vaccinated at 5.01 (95% CI 4.86 - 5.16) and 4.85 (4.75 - 4.96) times greater than the White British group. The proportion of individuals self-identifying as Muslim and Buddhist who had received a vaccine was 79.1% and 84.1%, respectively. Older age, greater area deprivation, less advantaged socio-economic position (proxied by living in a rented home), being disabled and living either alone or in a multi-generational household were also associated with higher odds of not having received the vaccine.

These initiatives included the deployment of a transport safety officer, a receiving clean team for select interfacility transports, and modifications in personal protective equipment. RESULTS: From February 29, 2020, to August 29, 2020, there were 1,041 transports of persons under investigation, 660 (63.4%) of whom were ultimately found to be COVID-19 positive. Approximately one third were ground transports, 11 (1.1%) were by air, and the remainder were intrahospital transports. There were 0 documented staff exposures or illnesses during the study period. CONCLUSION: The adaptation of these safety measures resulted in 0 staff exposures or illnesses while maintaining a high-volume, high-acuity critical care transport program.

In China’s fight against COVID-19, the community is at the front line of joint prevention and control of the disease, yet it faces the problem of insufficient resilience. We explored the manifestations and formation mechanism of the problem of insufficient resilience in community public health crisis governance, based on the complex adaptive system theory, which emphasizes interaction among subjects and between subjects and the environment to improve the adaptability to the environment. Questionnaires and in-depth interviews were conducted in 28 counties (districts) of 14 cities of 7 provinces in China; 2345 questionnaires and 71 interview data were collected, and we conducted descriptive statistical analysis on questionnaire data. It is found that some communities faced insufficient resilience problems such as “simply isolating households and communities”, “blindly setting limits”, “layer-by-layer law”, and “rejecting and repelling all individuals from or even related to Hubei”. These problems are due to the fact that the community have a non-interactive relationship, which is a one-dimensional linear governance model to some extent. The legal content of the building of a “comprehensive disaster-reduction demonstration community” implemented by the Chinese government is compelled to stay at the level of system design to some extent, with its existence playing an ornamental role but lacking a substantial one. In this regard, this study suggests that a resilient governance model of community pluralistic cooperation be established based on the theoretical framework of complex adaptive system. This model is designed to increase the resilience of community public health crisis governance. The authoritative role of central and local policies is expected to be truly developed and played in dealing with the grassroots community public health crisis.","Wang, Chao; Dong, Xuan; Zhang, Yan; Luo, Yiwen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,300,30

Here, we show that clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 preferred the cell-surface TMRRSS2 to endosomal cathepsins for cell entry, similar to HCoV-229E. In addition, the cell-culture-adapted HCoV-OC43 lost the ability to infect and replicate in air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells.

Diabetic pregnancies clearly need special care, but clinical implications as well as the complex interplay of diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 are currently unknown. We summarized the evidence on SARS-CoV-2 in diabetic pregnancies, including the identification of novel potential pathophysiological mechanisms and interactions as well as clinical outcomes and features, screening, and management approaches. METHODS: We carried out a systematic scoping review in MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science Core Collection in September 2020. RESULTS: We found that the prognosis of pregnant women with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19 may be associated with potential underlying mechanisms such as a simplified viral uptake by ACE2, a higher basal value of pro-inflammatory cytokines, being hypoxemic as well as platelet activation, embolism, and preeclampsia. In the context of “trans-generational programming” and COVID-19, life-long consequences may be “programmed” during gestation by pro-inflammation, hypoxia, over- or under-expression of transporters and enzymes, and epigenetic modifications based on changes in the intra-uterine milieu. COVID-19 may cause new onset diabetes mellitus, and that vertical transmission from mother to baby might be possible. CONCLUSIONS: Given the challenges in clinical management, the complex interplay between COVID-19 and diabetic pregnancies, evidence-based recommendations are urgently needed. Digital medicine is a future-oriented and effective approach in the context of clinical diabetes management. We anticipate our review to be a starting point to understand and analyze mechanisms and epidemiology to most effectively treat women with SARS-COV-2 and diabetes in pregnancy.

Using SAILA, spherical and non-aggregated PCL particles, with average sizes between 0.2 and 1.2 μm, were produced. Then, coprecipitation experiments were performed: PCL/EUG and PCL/ALA particles with an average size of 0.99 ± 0.34 μm and 0.99 ± 0.18 μm, respectively, were produced, with entrapment efficiencies up to 90 %, considerably higher than results reported in the literature. EUG and ALA coprecipitates showed complete release kinetics in a maximum time of 2 days respect to dissolution time of about 4 h and 5 h of unprocessed EUG and ALA, respectively. Furthermore, the antioxidant power of the used compounds was preserved in the obtained co-precipitates.","Palazzo, I.; Trucillo, P.; Campardelli, R.; Reverchon, E.",,300,1

In 2007-2008, three outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea occurred in adult cows at three dairy farms in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. BToV was the only enteric pathogen detected in these outbreaks, as determined by electron microscopy, reverse transcription-PCR, bacteria and parasite tests of fecal samples, and antibody tests with paired sera. The epidemiological features of the three outbreaks were similar to those of bovine coronavirus infection, except for the absence of bloody diarrhea, with diarrhea spreading among most adult cows, but not in calves, within several days and diarrhea lasting for 3-5 days with anorexia. Decreased milk production and mild respiratory symptoms were also observed in two of the outbreaks. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the BToV nucleocapsid, spike, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) genes revealed a close relatedness among the detected BToV strains from each outbreak and those of Japanese BToV strain Aichi/2004. Furthermore, we isolated a BToV strain, designated Niigata (TC), from a fecal sample using a human rectal tumor cell line. Sequence analysis of this isolate and Aichi/2004 indicated that both strains have truncated HE genes with deletions in the 3′ region that occurred through cell culture-adaptation. The short projections that are believed to be formed by the HE protein on virus particles were not observed in these cultured strains by electron microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that BToV causes epidemic diarrhea in adult cows and should be included in the differential diagnosis of diarrhea in adult cows. In addition, our findings indicate that the HE protein of BToV may not be necessary for viral replication.","Aita, Tsunehiko; Kuwabara, Masaki; Murayama, Kazunori; Sasagawa, Yuri; Yabe, Shizuka; Higuchi, Ryohei; Tamura, Tsutomu; Miyazaki, Ayako; Tsunemitsu, Hiroshi",Arch Virol,300,1

While an emerging body of research has described experiences conducting remote interviews, less attention has been paid to focus group discussions (FGDs). Herein, we present experiences conducting remote FGDs (n=9) with healthcare workers and caretakers of small children in the Philippines. We used ‘Facebook Messenger Room’ (FBMR), the preferred platform of participants. Despite some success, we generally encountered considerable challenges in terms of recruiting, retaining and moderating remote FGDs, particularly among caretakers of small children. Finding a quiet, private place proved unfeasible for many participants, who were juggling family demands in tight, locked down quarters. Connectivity issues and technological missteps compromised the flow of FGDs and minimised the ability to share and compare opinions. For the research team, remote FGDs resulted in a dramatic role shift for notetakers—from being passive observers to active tech supporters, chatbox referees and co-moderators (when audio disruptions occurred). Finally, we note that remote FGDs via FBMR are associated with ethical complexities, particularly as participants often chose to use their personal Facebook accounts, which can compromise anonymity. We developed and continuously refined strategies to mitigate challenges, but ultimately decided to forgo FGDs. We urge fellow researchers with more successful experiences to guide the field in terms of capturing high-quality data that respond to research questions, while also contending with privacy concerns, both in online spaces, as well as physical privacy despite lockdowns in tight quarters.","Aligato, Mila F; Endoma, Vivienne; Wachinger, Jonas; Landicho-Guevarra, Jhoys; Bravo, Thea Andrea; Guevarra, Jerric Rhazel; Landicho, Jeniffer; McMahon, Shannon A; Reñosa, Mark Donald C",Fam Med Community Health,300,5

Diarrhea in the immunocompromised host, traveler’s diarrhea, and diarrhea in the hospitalized patient are also discussed. Most episodes of acute diarrhea are self-limited, and investigations should be performed only if the results will influence management and outcome. After an adequate history and physical examination, the clinician should be able to classify the acute diarrheal illness, assess the severity, and determine whether investigations are needed. Most patients do not require specific therapy. Therapy should mainly be directed at preventing dehydration. Various home remedies frequently suffice in mild, self-limited diarrhea. However, in large-volume, dehydrating diarrhea, oral rehydration solutions should be used, as they are formulated to stimulate sodium and water absorption. Antidiarrheal agents can be useful in reducing the number of bowel movements and diminishing the magnitude of fluid loss. The most useful agents are opiate derivatives and bismuth subsalicylate. Antibiotic therapy is not required in most patients with acute diarrheal disorders. Guidelines for their use are presented.","Aranda-Michel, Jaime; Giannella, Ralph A",Am J Med,300,1

Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the catalytic efficiency of FhePrx is similar to other 2-Cys peroxiredoxins; the enzyme displayed saturable enzyme Michaelis–Menten type kinetics with hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide, and is sensitive to concentrations of hydrogen peroxide above 0.5 mM. Like the 2-Cys peroxiredoxins from a related helminth, Schistosoma mansoni, steady-state kinetics indicate that FhePrx exhibits a saturable, single displacement-like reaction mechanism rather than non-saturable double displacement (ping–pong) enzyme substitution mechanism common to other peroxiredoxins. However, unlike the schistosome Prxs, FhePrx could not utilise reducing equivalents supplied by glutathione or glutathione reductase.","Sekiya, Mary; Mulcahy, Grace; Irwin, Jane A.; Stack, Colin M.; Donnelly, Sheila M.; Xu, Weibo; Collins, Peter; Dalton, John P.",FEBS Lett,300,1

The Jordanian government was one of those countries that implemented a complete nation-wide lockdown which lasted for 3 months during the peak months of 2020. The aim of this study is to shed the light on the impact of this lockdown on the surgical emergency practice at a tertiary referral center in Amman, the capital of Jordan. METHODS: A retrospective review of the medical records of the patients who were admitted to the hospital through the emergency department over the lock-down months in 2020 and compare them to the records of the patients admitted within the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients were admitted in the 2020 group, compared to 201 patients in the 2019 group, marking a 28% reduction in admission rate. The average duration of symptoms before the ER visit was significantly longer in the 2020 period compared to 2019 (95.32 ± 148.62 min, 57 ± 64.4 min respectively, p = 0.01) which resulted in a Significant increase in the ICU admission in the same period (P=.00001). As for the type of management, there was no difference between the two groups with similar percentage of surgeries performed in the two periods (p = 0.333). Additionally, the average length of stay did not also differ (p = 0.141). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the health care systems around the world to the point of collapse in some countries. This study has demonstrated its effects on the emergency surgery practice at our institution which was mainly related to the delay in getting medical care caused by the strict lock-down laws implemented in the country.

This article presents a case study of an innovation hub developing such programming.

The program is administered and taught by instructional design personnel in the CIDL, a university innovation hub outside of a traditional academic unit. The article offers insight into the development and alignment of external programming as well as specific insights from the learners, instructors, and the program leaders: (1) the importance of having practitioners as faculty in digital transformation programs; (2) the role of practitioner-faculty in professional community development; and (3) the organizational advantages and impact.

DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional household survey. SETTING: Urban, semiurban and rural communities of the Wakiso and Hoima districts in Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: A total of N=2014 males aged 13–80 years participated in the survey. The current study included males who reported having ever been in a sexual union and responded to the IPV questions (N=1314). MEASURES: Data were collected face-to-face from May 2018 to July 2019 using an interviewer-mediated questionnaire. Lifetime IPV perpetration was measured as ‘no physical and/or sexual IPV’, ‘physical’ versus ‘sexual violence only’, and ‘physical and sexual violence’. Past-year food insecurity was measured through the Food Insecurity Experience Scale and categorised into ‘none’, ‘low’ and ‘high’. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine the crude and adjusted relative risk ratios (aRRRs) of IPV perpetration in relation to self-reported food insecurity, adjusting for sociodemographic and health risk behaviours. RESULTS: The prevalence of self-reported lifetime IPV perpetration was 14.6% for physical and 6.5% for sexual violence, while 5.3% reported to have perpetrated both physical and sexual IPV. Most (75.7%) males reported no food insecurity, followed by low (20.7%) and high (3.6%) food insecurity. In adjusted models, food insecurity was associated with increased risk of having perpetrated both physical and sexual violence (aRRR=2.57, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.32). IPV perpetration was also independently associated with having had more than one lifetime sexual partner and drinking alcohol, but not with education level or religion. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that food insecurity is associated with male IPV perpetration, and more efforts are needed to prevent and mitigate the expected worsening of this situation as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Awungafac, George; Mugamba, Stephen; Nalugoda, Fred; Sjöland, Carl Fredrik; Kigozi, Godfrey; Rautiainen, Susanne; Malyabe, Robert Bulamba; Ziegel, Leo; Nakigozi, Gertrude; Nalwoga, Grace Kigozi; Kyasanku, Emmanuel; Nkale, James; Watya, Stephen; Ekström, Anna Mia; Kågesten, Anna",BMJ Open,300,26

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: With millions of operations cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic, pressure is mounting to reopen and increase surgical activity. The risk of admitting patients who have silent SARS-Cov-2 infection to surgery is not well investigated, but surgery on patients with COVID-19 is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to model the risk of operating on nonsymptomatic infected individuals and associated risk of perioperative adverse outcomes and death. METHODS: We developed 2 sets of models to evaluate the risk of admitting silent COVID-19-infected patients to surgery. A static model let the underlying infection rate (R rate) and the gross population-rate of surgery vary. In a stochastic model, the dynamics of the COVID-19 prevalence and a fixed population-rate of surgery was considered. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 90% uncertainty limits. The modelling was applied for high-income regions (eg, United Kingdom (UK), USA (US) and European Union without UK (EU27), and for the World (WORLD) based on the WHO standard population. RESULTS: Both models provided concerning rates of perioperative risk over a 24-months period. For the US, the modelled rates were 92,000 (UI 68,000–124,000) pulmonary complications and almost 30,000 deaths (UI 22,000–40·000), respectively; for Europe, some 131,000 patients (UI 97,000–178,000) with pulmonary complications and close to 47,000 deaths (UI 34,000–63,000) were modelled. For the UK, the model suggested a median daily number of operations on silently infected ranging between 25 and 90, accumulating about 18,700 (UI 13,700–25,300) perioperative pulmonary complications and 6400 (UI 4600–8600) deaths. In high-income regions combined, we estimated around 259,000 (UI 191,000–351,000) pulmonary complications and 89,000 deaths (UI 65,000–120,000). For the WORLD, even low surgery rates estimated a global number of 1.2 million pulmonary complications and 350,000 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The model highlights a considerable risk of admitting patients with silent COVID-19 to surgery with an associated risk for adverse perioperative outcomes and deaths. Strategies to avoid excessive complications and deaths after surgery during the pandemic are needed.","Soreide, Kjetil; Yaqub, Sheraz; Hallet, Julie; Kvaløy, Jan Terje; Kleppe, Tore Selland",Ann Surg,300,20

Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients develop serious respiratory illness requiring ventilator management. In the early phase of this pandemic, the risk of disease spread lead to the development of conservative guidelines which advocated delaying tracheostomy at least two to three weeks from intubation and, preferably, with negative COVID-19 testing. The morbidly obese patient population, however, presents a unique scenario in which early tracheostomy may be beneficial. In this article, we discuss our institution’s current practices along with clinical outcomes with reference to intensive care literature and propose that early tracheotomy in COVID-19 patients should be considered on a case by case basis.","Caputo, Mathew P; Aziz, Steven; Mifsud, Matthew",Cureus,300,21

This study analyzes nationwide data on stroke admissions and management in the Czech Republic during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We compared the early COVID-19 pandemic (March–May 2020) with the pre-pandemic period (January–February 2020 and March–May 2019): (a) the National Register of Reimbursed Health Services provided volume of all admissions for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and ischemic stroke (IS), and volume of recanalization treatments (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] and mechanical thrombectomy [MT]); (b) Registry of Stroke Care Quality provided door-to-needle time (DNT), onset-to-door time (ODT), and stroke severity at admission (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, NIHSS) for IS. RESULTS: During the pandemic (March–May 2020), the peak number of COVID-19 patients treated in Czech hospitals was 39 per million. In March–May 2020 versus March–May 2019, hospital admissions decreased as follows: stroke overall by 14% (p < 0.001), IS by 14% (p < 0.001), SAH by 15% (p = 0.07), and ICH by 7% (p = 0.17). The mean age was 74 years versus 74 years (p = 0.33), and 52% versus 51% were men (p = 0.34). The volumes of IVT and MT decreased by 14% (p = 0.001) and 19% (p = 0.01), respectively. The proportions of all IS patients receiving IVT or MT remained unchanged, with, respectively, 17% versus 17% receiving IVT (p = 0.86) and 5% versus 5% receiving MT (p = 0.48). DNT and ODT were 24 versus 25 min (p = 0.58) and 168 versus 156 min (p = 0.23), respectively. NIHSS at admission did not differ (6 vs. 6; p = 0.54). CONCLUSION: Even with a low burden of COVID-19 during the first wave and no change in organization and logistics of stroke services, stroke admissions and volume of recanalization treatments decreased. Public health communication campaigns should encourage people to seek emergency medical care for stroke symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sedova, Petra; Brown Jr., Robert D.; Bryndziar, Tomas; Jarkovsky, Jiri; Tomek, Ales; Sramek, Martin; Skoda, Ondrej; Sramkova, Tereza; Littnerova, Simona; Mikulik, Robert",Cerebrovasc Dis,300,24

However, the condition can deteriorate quickly and some may develop serious hypoxia with relatively few symptoms. Early identification of deterioration allows effective management with oxygen and steroids. Telemonitoring of symptoms and physiological signs may facilitate this. OBJECTIVE: To design, implement and evaluate a telemonitoring system for people with COVID-19 self-managing at home considered at significant risk of deterioration. METHODS: A multi-disciplinary team developed a telemonitoring protocol using a commercial platform to record symptoms, pulse oximetry and temperature. If symptoms or physiological measures breached targets, patients were alerted asking them to phone an ambulance (red) or for advice (amber). Patients attending COVID assessment centres, considered fit for discharge but at risk of deterioration, were shown how to use a pulse-oximeter and the monitoring system which they were to use twice daily for two weeks. Patients could interact by app, SMS or touch-tone phone. Written guidance on alerts was also provided. Following consent, patient data on telemonitoring usage and alerts were linked to data on service resource use. Subsequently, patients who had both used and not used the telemonitoring service, including those who had not followed advice to seek help, agreed to brief telephone interviews to explore their views on and how they had interacted with the telemonitoring system. Interviews were recorded and analysed thematically. Professionals involved in the implementation were sent an online questionnaire asking them about their perceptions of the service. RESULTS: We investigated the first 116 patients who used the service. Of these 71 (61%) submitted data, the remainder chose to self-monitor without electronic support. Of the 71 patients who submitted data, 35 received 151 alerts during their two-week observation. Sixty-seven 'red' alerts were for oxygen saturation (Sa02) levels &#8804;93% and 15 because they recorded severe breathlessness. Nineteen were admitted to hospital (average stay 3.4 days). Of the 45 who used written guidance alone, eight were admitted to hospital (average stay 5.3 days) and one died. Some patients who were advised to seek help did not do so, some because parameters improved on re-testing, others because they felt no worse than before. All patients found self-monitoring reassuring. Most professionals who used the system (n=11) found it easy to use and useful. Five professionals considered the system 'very safe', three thought it 'could be safer', and three wished more experience before deciding. Two felt SaO2 trigger thresholds were too high. CONCLUSIONS: Supported self-monitoring of patients with COVID-19 at home is reassuring to patients acceptable to clinicians and can detect important signs of deterioration. Worryingly, some patients, because they felt well, occasionally ignored important signs of deterioration. It is important therefore to emphasise the importance of the early investigation and treatment of asymptomatic hypoxia at the time when patients are initiated and in the warning messages that are sent to patients.

Re-Du-Ning injection (RDN) is a tradition Chinese medicine preparation which has been clinically used for treatment of respiratory diseases including COVID-19. PURPOSE: To elucidate the potential mechanisms of RDN for the treatment of ALI. METHODS: Female C57BL/6J mice were used to establish ALI model by intraperitoneal injection 10 mg/kg LPS, and RDN injection was intraperitoneally administered with the dose of 5 and 10 mL/kg. The cytokines were measured by ELISA and qPCR. The data related to NETs were analyzed by ELISA, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and network pharmacological approach. RESULTS: RDN robustly alleviated LPS-induced ALI. Meanwhile, RDN downregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Specifically, RDN treatment inhibited the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and remarkably suppressed the protein of PAD4. The active compound from RDN decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that RDN ameliorates LPS-induced ALI through suppressing MAPK pathway to inhibit the formation of NETs.","Yang, Chenxi; Song, Chenglin; Liu, Yitong; Qu, Jiao; Li, Haibo; Xiao, Wei; Kong, Lingdong; Ge, Huiming; Sun, Yang; Lv, Wen",Phytomedicine,300,22

Yet, secondary bacterial infection is uncommon. However, as epithelium is injured and barrier function is lost, bacterial products entering the circulation might contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: We studied 19 adults, severely ill patients with COVID-19 infection, who were admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 13th March and 17th April 2020. Blood samples on days 1, 3, and 7 of enrollment were analyzed for endotoxin activity assay (EAA), (1 → 3)-β-d-glucan (BG), and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the circulating bacteriome. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, 13 were in intensive care and 10 patients received mechanical ventilation. We found 8 patients with high EAA (≥ 0.6) and about half of the patients had high serum BG levels which tended to be higher in later in the illness. Although only 1 patient had a positive blood culture, 18 of 19 patients were positive for 16S rRNA gene amplification. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum. The diversity of bacterial genera was decreased overtime. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial DNA and toxins were discovered in virtually all severely ill COVID-19 pneumonia patients. This raises a previously unrecognized concern for significant contribution of bacterial products in the pathogenesis of this disease.","Sirivongrangson, Phatadon; Kulvichit, Win; Payungporn, Sunchai; Pisitkun, Trairak; Chindamporn, Ariya; Peerapornratana, Sadudee; Pisitkun, Prapaporn; Chitcharoen, Suwalak; Sawaswong, Vorthon; Worasilchai, Navaporn; Kampunya, Sarinya; Putcharoen, Opass; Thawitsri, Thammasak; Leelayuwatanakul, Nophol; Kongpolprom, Napplika; Phoophiboon, Vorakamol; Sriprasart, Thitiwat; Samransamruajkit, Rujipat; Tungsanga, Somkanya; Tiankanon, Kanitha; Lumlertgul, Nuttha; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Sriphojanart, Tueboon; Tantawichien, Terapong; Thisyakorn, Usa; Chirathaworn, Chintana; Praditpornsilpa, Kearkiat; Tungsanga, Kriang; Eiam-Ong, Somchai; Sitprija, Visith; Kellum, John A.; Srisawat, Nattachai",Intensive Care Med Exp,300,1

The rapid online spread of case reports was followed by online interim guidelines, discussions, and worldwide online searches for further information. The impact of global online search trends and online discussion on local approaches to coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between online search trends using Google Trends and the rate of appropriate venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a tertiary hospital in Ireland. METHODS: A retrospective audit of anticoagulation therapy and VTE prophylaxis among patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a tertiary hospital was conducted between February 29 and May 31, 2020. Worldwide Google search trends of the term “COVID-19” and anticoagulation synonyms during this time period were determined and correlated against one another using a Spearman correlation. A P value of <.05 was considered significant, and analysis was completed using Prism, version 8 (GraphPad). RESULTS: A statistically significant Spearman correlation (P<.001, r=0.71) was found between the two data sets, showing an increase in VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19 with increasing online searches worldwide. This represents a proxy for online searches and discussion, dissemination of information, and Google search trends relating to COVID-19 and clotting risk, in particular, which correlated with an increasing trend of providing thromboprophylaxis and anticoagulation therapy to patients with COVID-19 in our tertiary center. CONCLUSIONS: We described a correlation of local change in clinical practice with worldwide online dialogue and digital search trends that influenced individual clinicians, prior to the publication of formal guidelines or a local quality-improvement intervention.","Worrall, Amy P; Kelly, Claire; O'Neill, Aine; O'Doherty, Murray; Kelleher, Eoin; Cushen, Anne Marie; McNally, Cora; McConkey, Samuel; Glavey, Siobhan; Lavin, Michelle; de Barra, Eoghan",JMIR Form Res,300,20

However, the true burden of systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 remains unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database to identify studies that reported the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy using established criteria in patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome was the prevalence of systemic coagulopathy (disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC] and/or sepsis-induced coagulopathy [SIC]). Pooled prevalences and 95% confidence intervals [CIs] were calculated using random-effects model. A total of 5 studies including 1210 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The pooled prevalence of systemic coagulopathy was 7.1% (95%CI: 3.2%,15.3%, I(2) = 93%). The pooled prevalence of DIC (N = 721) and SIC (N = 639) were 4.3% (95%CI 1.7%, 10.4%, I(2) = 84%) and 16.2% (95%CI: 9.3%, 26.8%, I(2) = 74%), respectively. Only 2 studies reported the prevalence of elevated D-dimer levels with the pooled prevalence of 84.6% (95%CI: 52.0%,96.5%, I(2) = 94%). Average D-dimer and fibrinogen levels were remarkably increased, while platelet counts, PT, and aPTT ratios were minimally affected in COVID-19. The estimated prevalence of systemic coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 was low despite D-dimer elevation in most patients. Relatively low systemic coagulopathy in COVID-19 may contribute to the high incidence of thrombosis rather than bleeding in patients with COVID-19.","Uaprasert, Noppacharn; Moonla, Chatphatai; Sosothikul, Darintr; Rojnuckarin, Ponlapat; Chiasakul, Thita",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,300,24

For the first time, an Ebola epidemic of exceptional magnitude dramatically engulfed several countries in West Africa since December 2013. Major failures of implementing measures to prevent human-to-human transmissions are the main cause of this large-scale Ebola outbreak. After about one-week incubation period, the Ebola virus disease is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever leading to multiple hemorrhages and to widespread organ failure. Several bat species constitute the main reservoirs of Ebola viruses. Human contamination would occur either directly from bats, widely consumed by the local populations, or through animal species susceptible to Ebola infection, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Alongside this “natural cycle”, an “epidemic cycle” involving domestic animals living in villages such as dogs or pigs, is seriously suggested. Thus, according to the diversity of concerned animals and their clinical infection form, modalities of human contamination can be multiple and are still largely unknown. In this context, all efforts that could be made to unravel the mystery of the Ebola virus emergence in humans and clarify modalities of the virus transmission, would allow for predicting or for anticipating the future occurrence of epidemics. This review aims to provide an exhaustive inventory of the Ebola ecology to highlight events governing the virus transmission to humans that still remain unsolved.","Leroy, Éric Maurice",Bull Acad Natl Med,300,21

Anxiety related to infection, stress and stigma caused by the forced changes in daily life have reportedly increased the incidence and symptoms of depression, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Under such circumstances, telepsychiatry is gaining importance and attracting a great deal of attention. However, few large pragmatic clinical trials on the use of telepsychiatry targeting multiple psychiatric disorders have been conducted to date. Methods The targeted study cohort will consist of adults (>18 years) who meet the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for either (1) depressive disorders, (2) anxiety disorders, or (3) obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Patients will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either a “telepsychiatry group” (at least 50% of treatments to be conducted using telemedicine, with at least one face-to-face treatment [FTF] within six months) or an “FTF group” (all treatments to be conducted FTF, with no telemedicine). Both groups will receive the usual treatment covered by public medical insurance. The study will utilize a master protocol design in that there will be primary and secondary outcomes for the entire group regardless of diagnosis, as well as the outcomes for each individual disorder group. Discussion This study will be a non-inferiority trial to test that the treatment effect of telepsychiatry is not inferior to that of FTF alone. This study will provide useful insights into the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the practice of psychiatry.

Reporting artefacts and missing data about asymptomatic spreaders, imply considerable margins of uncertainty for model-based predictions. Epidemiological models can however also be used to investigate the consequences of measures to control the pandemic, reflected in changes to parameter values. We present a SIR-based, SUIR model in which the influence of testing and a reduction of contacts is studied by distinguishing 'Unidentified' and 'Identified' spreaders of infections. The model uses four ordinary differential equations and is kept deliberately simple to investigate general patterns occurring from testing and contact restrictions. The model goes beyond other efforts, by introducing time dependent parameter curves that represent different strategies in controlling the pandemic. Our analysis reveals the effect of 'pro-active' testing for the design of contact restriction measures. By pro-active testing we mean testing beyond those people who show symptoms. The simulations can explain why the timing of contract restrictions and pro-active testing is important. The model can also be used to study the consequence of different strategies to exit from lockdown. Our SUIR model is implemented in Python and is made available through a Juypter Notebooks. This an extensive documentation of the derivation and implementation of the model, as well as transparent and reproducible simulation studies. Our model should contribute to a better understanding of the role of testing and contact restrictions.","Bej, S.; Wolkenhauer, O.",,300,24

Materials and methods The study population included all patients admitted following major trauma between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020 with CT including the lungs (n=523). Major trauma patients admitted pre-COVID-19 from 1–31 January and 1–31 March 2019 comprised a control group (n=252). The assessing radiologists, blinded to the time period, used double reading with consensus to determine if the patient had CT signs of COVID-19. Lung appearances were classified as no evidence of COVID-19; minor signs; or major signs. The proportion of patients with incidental COVID-19 changes was recorded over the study period, and the percentage of the population who had been affected by COVID-19 by the end of April 2020 estimated. Results CT appearances consistent with COVID-19 began to exceed a background pre-COVID rate in the second week of February and did not decline until 2 weeks after lockdown. By the end of April 2020, approximately 45% of the population had been infected. Conclusions CT of major trauma patients can be used to monitor the spread of COVID-19. This novel technique could be used retrospectively or prospectively anywhere where trauma scans are available, to monitor the disease in the local population.","Adam, E. J.; Grubnic, S.; Jacob, T.

Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from SARS-CoV-2- and non-SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects were collected for metabolomic/lipidomic, cytokines, soluble CD14 (sCD14), and ACh, and CD14 and CD36-expressing monocyte/macrophage subpopulation analyses. Transcriptome reanalysis of pulmonary biopsies was performed by assessing coexpression, differential expression, and biological networks. Correlations of lipid mediators, sCD14, and ACh with glucocorticoid treatment were evaluated. This study enrolled 190 participants with Covid-19 at different disease stages, 13 hospitalized non-Covid-19 patients, and 39 healthy-participants. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased blood levels of arachidonic acid (AA), 5-HETE, 11-HETE, sCD14, and ACh but decreased monocyte CD14 and CD36 expression. 5-HETE, 11-HETE, cytokines, ACh, and neutrophils were higher in BAL than in circulation (fold-change for 5-HETE 389.0; 11-HETE 13.6; ACh 18.7, neutrophil 177.5, respectively). Only AA was higher in circulation than in BAL samples (fold-change 7.7). Results were considered significant at P<0.05, 95%CI. Transcriptome data revealed a unique gene expression profile associated with AA, 5-HETE, 11-HETE, ACh, and their receptors in Covid-19. Glucocorticoid treatment in severe/critical cases lowered ACh without impacting disease outcome. We first report that pulmonary inflammation and the worst outcomes in Covid-19 are associated with high levels of ACh and lipid mediators. Glucocorticoid therapy only reduced ACh, and we suggest that treatment may be started early, in combination with AA metabolism inhibitors, to better benefit severe/critical patients.","Perez, M.

This report provides a summary of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination as of April 30, 2021. METHODS: Adverse events following immunization are notifiable by medical doctors to the Korea Immunization Management System (KIMS) under the national surveillance system. We analyzed all adverse events reports following COVID-19 vaccination to the KIMS from February 26 to April 30, 2021. RESULTS: In total, 16,196 adverse events following 3,586,814 administered doses of COVID-19 vaccines were reported in approximately 2 months (February 26 to April 30, 2021). Of these, 15,658 (96.7%) were non-serious adverse events, and 538 (3.3%) were serious adverse events, including 73 (0.5%) deaths. The majority of adverse events (n=13,063, 80.7%) were observed in women, and the most frequently reported adverse events were myalgia (52.2%), fever (44.9%), and headache (34.9%). Of the 73 deaths following the COVID-19 vaccination, none were related to the vaccines.

Since there is no therapy available that is proven as fully protective against COVID-19, a vaccine to protect against deadly COVID-19 is urgently needed. Nucleocapsid protein (N protein), is one of the most abundant proteins in coronaviruses and is a potential target for both vaccine development and point of care diagnostics. The variable mass of N protein (45 to 60 kDa), suggests the presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs), and it is critical to clearly define these PTMs to gain the structural understanding necessary for further vaccine research. There have been several reports suggesting that the N protein is phosphorylated but lacks glycosylation. Our comprehensive glycomics and glycoproteomics experiments confirm that the N protein is highly O-glycosylated and also contains significant levels of N-glycosylation. We were able to confirm the presence of O-glycans on seven sites with substantial glycan occupancy, in addition to less abundant O-glycans on four sites. We also detected N-glycans on two out of five potential N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, we were able to confirm one phosphorylation site. Recent studies have indicated that the N protein can serve as an important diagnostic marker for coronavirus disease and a major immunogen by priming protective immune responses. Thus, detailed structural characterization of the N protein may provide useful insights for understanding the roles of glycosylation on viral pathogenesis and also in vaccine design and development.","Supekar, Nitin T.; Shajahan, Asif; Gleinich, Anne S.; Rouhani, Daniel; Heiss, Christian; Azadi, Parastoo",bioRxiv,300,18

METHODS: We measured the expression levels of MAN1A1, MAN1A2, MAN1B1, and MAN1C1 in cell lines HepG2.2.15, HepN10, HepAD38 and HepG2 by Western blot. Viral antigens (HBsAg and HBeAg) in the culture medium were measured using the chemiluminescence method. HBV DNA quantification assays were performed using a commercial real-time PCR kit. Protein levels of human liver tissue α-1,2-mannosidases were also evaluated by Western blot. Plasmids containing seven individual viral genes of HBV (PTT22-HBx, PTT22-HBs, PTT22-preS2, PTT22-preS1, PTT22-HBc, PTT22-HBe, and PTT22-HBp) or control plasmids (PTT22-vector) were transfected into HepG2 cells. MK886 (PPARα) and GW9662 (PPARγ) inhibitors were used to explore the effects of HBV on α-1,2-mannosidase expression after the PPARα and PPARγ pathways were blocked. RESULTS: We showed that the expression of α-1,2-mannosidases was higher in stably transfected HBV cells than in controls. The expression levels of α-1,2-mannosidase were higher in AD38 cells than those in ND10 cells, which were in turn greater than those in G2.2.15 cells, and positively correlated with the expression of HBsAg in all the cell lines. Levels of α-1,2-mannosidase in non-tumorous liver tissues of HBV-related HCC patients were also higher than in the tissues from non-HBV-related HCC patients. Moreover, transfecting HepG2 cells with a component of the HBV viral envelope also increased the expression of α-1,2-mannosidases. However, this envelope protein component could not induce MAN1C1 expression in the presence of a PPARα inhibitor, MK886. We also found that MK886 did not affect the expression of MAN1C1 in AD38 cells without tetracycline in the culture medium. This phenomenon was not observed in the case of GW9662. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that HBV increases the expression of α-mannosidases both in vitro and in vivo via activation of the PPARα pathway by its envelope protein.","Hu, Song; Jiang, Li-Bin; Zou, Xiao-Jing; Yi, Wei; Tian, De-Ying",World J Gastroenterol,300,26

The adoption of accurate, rapid and inexpensive methods to identify infected subjects in the general population is of paramount relevance for the control of the disease. We evaluated one of the available serological tests, the Prima Lab Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Tests, on 739 volunteers. We first assessed the test's reproducibility by administering it twice on the same day on 104 subjects obtaining and overall score of 93 percent. Since the intensity of the color in the test line regions varies depending on the concentration of Covid-19 antibodies in each sample and that the determination of the positivity depends strictly on the subjective assessment by the reader, after excluding the subjects whose color intensity was too tenuous to be deemed unquestionably positive by the reader the reproducibility increased to 96%. The test would not perform properly for 6 subjects for a very limited overall technical failure of 0.83%. For 138 subjects information was available regarding a previous Real Time PCR nasopharyngeal swab test performed elsewhere. The correspondence of positive results between the two tests was 90.58% (125/138). In spite of some limitation owing especially to the choice of a self selected population sample, we conclude that Prima Lab Covid-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test represents a low-cost, easily applicable and reproducible tool in detecting SARS-Cov-2 diffusion in the general population.","Di Lorenzo, G.; Toniolo, P.; Lurani, C.; Foresti, L.; Carrisi, C.",,300,20

During the COVID-19 pandemic, management strategies were reassessed and the number of visits to the emergency department dropped down, which may be associated with delayed diagnoses and complications. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the pandemic on children with acute appendicitis. METHODS: Analytical, retrospective, comparative study of pediatric patients with acute appendicitis in the 5 months of COVID-19 lockdown versus the same period in the previous year. Incidence, clinical data, stage, surgical approach, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of appendicitis cases went down by 25% (n = 67 versus n = 50 in 2020). The mean time to consultation was 24 hours in both periods (p = 0.989). The incidence of peritonitis was 44% (n = 22) versus 37% (n = 22) (p = 0.22) in 2019. No differences were observed in terms of appendicitis stage based on surgery reports. In 2019, all surgeries were laparoscopic; while in 2020, only 42% (n = 21). The incidence of complications was 6% versus 7.5% in the previous period (p = 0.75). One patient was COVID-19 positive. CONCLUSION: Although in our population the number of appendicitis cases dropped down, consultation was not delayed. The greater impact was associated with the reformulation of management strategies, in which the laparoscopic approach is avoided to reduce virus transmission.","Percul, Carolina; Cruz, Marion; Curiel Meza, Alejandra; González, Germán; Lerendegui, Luciana; Malzone, María C; Liberto, Daniel; Lobos, Pablo; Imach, Benjamín E; Moldes, Juan M; Llera, Julián",Arch Argent Pediatr,300,16

It is essential to also understand generational differences in psychosocial impacts to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviors, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of COVID-related concerns during Wave 1 of COVID-19 in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed data from 2 Canadian population-based data sets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (N = 4,627; March 29 to April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians—Your Mental Health (N = 45,989; April 24 to May 11, 2020). MEASURES: We categorized generational age group. Participants self-reported changes in behaviors and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: There are generational differences in behavioral responses to the pandemic. Adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were comparable across groups, while changes in maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger age groups, particularly Millennials (15 to 34 years old). COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X (35 to 54 years old) exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behavior. Results also revealed that the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety is among Millennials (36.0%; severe anxiety = 15.7%), and the younger generations have the highest rates of COVID-related concerns. CONCLUSION: These early data are essential in understanding at-risk groups given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its potential long-term implications.","El-Gabalawy, Renée; Sommer, Jordana L.",Can J Psychiatry,300,26

METHODS: Data collection was carried out in two moments: at baseline and after six months. An online questionnaire was applied to nurses to assess the frequency of use of some mental health promotion strategies and their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (through the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales – short version (DASS-21)). RESULTS: The anxiety and stress symptoms significantly decreased over time. The physical activity increased, and a decrease was observed in the remote social contacts after six months. The stress, anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in nurses who frequently or always used all strategies compared to participants who never or rarely used them, except for one strategy (rejecting information about COVID-19 from unreliable sources). CONCLUSIONS: Mental health promotion strategies, such as physical activity, relaxation activity, recreational activity, healthy diet, adequate water intake, breaks between work shifts, maintenance of remote social contacts, and verbalization of feelings/emotions, are crucial to reduce nurses’ stress, anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Pinho, Lara; Correia, Tânia; Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia; Lopes, Manuel; Fonseca, César",Environ Res,300,1

Studies are required to assess the relative performance of different assays. Here, we compared the performance of two commercial assays, the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics) and Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid®) tests, and a laboratory developed RT-PCR test adapted for use on the Hologic® Panther Fusion® (Hologic®) instrument as well as Bio-Rad and QIAGEN real-time PCR detection systems.

All assays detect the pan-Sarbecovirus E (envelope structural protein) gene plus a SARS-CoV-2-specific target. The limit of detection for the E gene target varied from ∼2 copies/reaction to >30 copies/reaction. Due to assay-specific differences in sample processing and nucleic acid extraction, the overall analytical sensitivity ranged from 24 copies/mL specimen to 574 copies/mL specimen. Despite these differences, there was 100% agreement between the commercial and laboratory developed tests.

Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) is a typical cognitive behavioral therapy targeting trauma-related psychological disorders and may be an effective intervention. Methods: A total of 111 COVID-19 patients near the discharge stage with positive screening results for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either the study group or the control group. The study group received NET and personalized psychological intervention, while the control group only received personalized psychological intervention. PTSS, depression, anxiety and sleep quality were measured pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the effect of NET. This trial was registered with the International Standard Randomized Clinical Trial Registry (No. ChiCTR2000039369). Results: NET participants showed a significantly greater PTSS reduction in comparison with the control group after the intervention. Improvement in sleep quality, anxiety and depression after the intervention were pronounced but not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Limitations: The assessors weren't blinded for the convenience of measurement and protection of participants’ psychological security. Conclusions: NET likely had a positive impact on PTSS of COVID-19 patients. Clinical staff should consider applying NET to improve the psychological well-being of patients who have experienced an epidemic such as COVID-19.","Fan, Ying; Shi, Yuxin; Zhang, Jun; Sun, Dingwen; Wang, Xuefei; Fu, Gaizhi; Mo, Daorong; Wen, Juan; Xiao, Xuexia; Kong, Lingai",J Affect Disord,300,28

We performed analytical and clinical validations of these kits. METHODS: PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), and UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) were evaluated. Limits of detection (LOD) with 95% probability values were estimated by testing 16 replicates of upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) RNA transcripts. Specificity was estimated by using 28 nasopharyngeal swabs that were positive for other respiratory viruses. Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using 18 lower respiratory specimens. The sensitivity test panel and the high inhibition panel were composed of nine specimens each, including eight and six specimens that were positive for MERS-CoV, respectively. RESULTS: The LODs for upE ranged from 21.88 to 263.03 copies/reaction, and those for ORF1a ranged from 6.92 to 128.82 copies/reaction. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses was found. All six kits correctly identified 8 of 8 (100%) positive clinical specimens. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, PowerChek and AccuPower were the least sensitive to the presence of PCR inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The overall sensitivity and specificity of all six assay systems were sufficient for diagnosing MERS-CoV infection. However, the analytical sensitivity and detection ability in specimens with PCR inhibition could be improved with the use of appropriate internal controls.","Kim, Mi-Na; Ko, Young Jin; Seong, Moon-Woo; Kim, Jae-Seok; Shin, Bo-Moon; Sung, Heungsup",Ann Lab Med,300,19

This virus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV was linked to a zoonotic origin from rhinolophid bats in 2005. Since then, numerous studies have described novel bat CoVs, including close relatives of the newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. In this paper we discuss CoV genomic properties and compare different taxonomic approaches in light of the technical difficulties of obtaining full genomic sequences directly from bat specimens. We first present an overview of the available studies on bat CoVs, with details on their chiropteran hosts, then comparatively analyze the increase in bat CoV studies and novel genomic sequences obtained since the SARS pandemic. We then conduct a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the genera Alpha- and Betacoronavirus, to show that bats harbour more CoV diversity than other mammalian hosts and are widely represented in most, but not all parts of the tree of mammalian CoVs. We next discuss preliminary evidence for phylogenetic co-segregation of CoVs and bat hosts encompassing the Betacoronavirus clades b and d, with an emphasis on the sampling bias that exists among bat species and other mammals, then present examples of CoVs infecting different hosts on the one hand and viruses apparently confined to host genera on the other. We also demonstrate a geographic bias within available studies on bat CoVs, and identify a critical lack of information from biodiversity hotspots in Africa, Asia and Latin America. We then present evidence for a zoonotic origin of four of the six known human CoVs (HCoV), three of which likely involved bats, namely SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E; compare the available data on CoV pathogenesis in bats to that in other mammalian hosts; and discuss hypotheses on the putative insect origins of CoV ancestors. Finally, we suggest caution with conclusions on the zoonotic potential of bat viruses, based only on genomic sequence data, and emphasize the need to preserve these ecologically highly relevant animals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Twitter hashtags # ACSCC20 and # CNCirugia2020 were studied to determine tweets, retweets, users and impressions. The data on the accounts with the greatest influence and the historical evolution of the congresses between 2015 and 2020 were analyzed. We used the symplur software to collect and analyze the data. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017 there was a consistent increase in the number of tweets, participants and impressions. Between 2018 and 2020, the ACS maintains the number of impressions with the fewest number of tweets. However, the CNC continues to grow and achieves its best metrics in 2020.

However, stability and delivery of RNAi molecules have presented serious obstacles for reaching therapeutic efficacy. For this reason, RNA modifications and formulation of nanoparticles have proven useful for non-viral delivery of RNAi molecules.

The main aim of this study was to investigate the psychological adjustment of healthcare professionals during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluating differences according to working or not with patients affected by COVID-19 and in areas with a more severe spread of this pandemic. Healthcare professionals’ attitudes toward psychological support were analyzed. The levels of anxiety, depression, psychological stress, and professional quality of life (compassion satisfaction, burnout, and compassion fatigue) and attitudes toward psychological support were measured among 627 Italian healthcare workers (mean age = 40.55 years; SD = 11.49; range: 27–72). Significantly higher levels of stress, burnout, secondary trauma, anxiety, and depression were observed among professionals working with COVID-19 patients. Higher levels of stress and burnout and lower levels of compassion satisfaction were detected in professionals working in areas with higher rates of contagion. No interaction effects were found between working (or not) with patients affected by COVID-19 and working (or not) in areas with a more severe diffusion of this pandemic. Finally, in the group of professionals who worked with COVID-19 patients, the percentage of professionals who thought to ask for psychological support was twice that of the group that did not work with COVID-19 patients.

The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. Methods: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. Results: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. Discussion: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic. Conclusions: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public mental health. In a pandemic or crisis situation, real-time data could be monitored and content-analysed for authorities to promptly address public concerns.","Leung, Janni; Chung, Jack Yiu Chak; Tisdale, Calvert; Chiu, Vivian; Lim, Carmen C.

Attempts to control the growth of the virus using masks and social-distancing, and, recently, double-masking as well, continue to be difficult to maintain, in part due to the extent of asymptomatic cases. Analyses of large datasets consisting of 219,075 individual cases in Ontario, indicated that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are substantial in number. Large numbers of cases in children aged 0–9 were asymptomatic or had only one symptom (35.0% and 31.4% of total cases, respectively) and resulted in fever as the most common symptom (30.6% of total cases). COVID-19 cases in children were more likely to be milder symptomatic with cough not seen as frequently as in adults aged over 40, and past research has shown children to be index cases in familial clusters. These findings highlight the importance of targeting asymptomatic and mild infections in the continuing effort to control the spread of COVID-19. The Pearson correlation coefficient between test positivity rates and asymptomatic rates of −0.729 indicates that estimates of the asymptomatic rates should be obtained when the test positivity rates are lowest as the best approach.","Snider, Brett; Patel, Bhumi; McBean, Edward",Infect Dis Rep,300,11

Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the COVID-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of scientific consensus on the virus’s spread and containment, or on the long-term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of cell phone towers, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders, and wide-scale defiance of scientifically sound public mandates such as those to wear masks and practice social distancing, countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of rumors and conspiracy theories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling these stories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.","Shahsavari, Shadi; Holur, Pavan; Wang, Tianyi; Tangherlini, Timothy R.; Roychowdhury, Vwani",J Comput Soc Sci,300,18

The underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and there is a scarcity of information regarding the contribution of the innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against infections. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of advancing age on plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC) function because they are critical in generating a robust antiviral response via the secretion of interferons (IFN). Our results indicate that PDCs from the aged are impaired in their capacity to secrete IFN-I in response to influenza virus and CPG stimulation. Additionally, we observed a severe reduction in the production of IFN-III, which plays an important role in defense against viral infections at respiratory mucosal surfaces. This reduction in IFN-I and IFN-III were a result of age-associated impaired phosphorylation of transcription factor, IRF-7. Furthermore, aged PDCs were observed to be impaired in their capacity to induce perforin and granzyme in CD8 T cells. Comparison of the antigen-presenting capacity of aged PDC with young PDC revealed that PDCs from aged subjects display reduced capacity to induce proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion in CD4 and CD8 T cells as compared with PDCs from young subjects. In summary, our study demonstrates that advancing age has a profound effect on PDC function at multiple levels and may therefore, be responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections in the elderly.","Sridharan, Aishwarya; Esposo, Marc; Kaushal, Khushboo; Tay, Jia; Osann, Kathyrn; Agrawal, Sudhanshu; Gupta, Sudhir; Agrawal, Anshu",Age (Dordr),300,30

Development and high-throughput screening of efficacious drugs is therefore critical. However, currently there remains a lack of such a safe system. Here, the generation and characterization of the first selectable, SARS–coronavirus (SARS–CoV)-based replicon cell line which can be used for screening is described. Partial SARS–CoV cDNAs and antibiotic resistance/reporter gene DNA were generated and assembled in vitro to produce the replicon transcription template, which was then transcribed in vitro to generate the replicon RNA. The latter was introduced into a mammalian cell line and the transfected cells were selected for by antibiotic application. For the antibiotic-resistant cell lines thus generated, the expression of reporter gene was ensured by continued monitoring using fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. The suitability of this replicon cell line in drug screening was demonstrated by testing the inhibitory effect of several existing drugs and the results demonstrate that the SARS–CoV replicon cell lines provide a safe tool for the identification of SARS–CoV replicase inhibitors. The replicon cell lines thus developed can be applied to high-throughput screening for anti-SARS drugs without the need to grow infectious SARS–CoV.","Ge, Feng; Luo, Yonghu; Liew, Pei Xiong; Hung, Eugene",Virology,300,24

Since several lines of evidence also attest that Lombardy region has an extraordinarily high level of environmental pollution, we aimed to explore the potential epidemiological association between the number of cases of COVID-19 and environmental pollution in Italy. Data on environmental pollution in Italy were retrieved from the 2019 annual report of the organization Legambiente (League for the Ambient). The adjusted correlation between the number of days in which environmental pollutants exceeded established limits and the overall number of COVID-19 cases reveals the existence of a highly significant positive association (r=0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.79; p<0.001).

Despite there being a common goal that should have unified resources and efforts, there have been an overwhelmingly large number of clinical trials that have been registered that are of questionable methodological quality. As the final paper of this Series, we discuss how the medical research community has responded to COVID-19. We recognise the incredible pressure that this pandemic has put on researchers, regulators, and policy makers, all of whom were doing their best to move quickly but safely in a time of tremendous uncertainty. However, the research community's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prominently highlighted many fundamental issues that exist in clinical trial research under the current system and its incentive structures. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only re-emphasised the importance of well designed randomised clinical trials but also highlighted the need for large-scale clinical trials structured according to a master protocol in a coordinated and collaborative manner. There is also a need for structures and incentives to enable faster data sharing of anonymised datasets, and a need to provide similar opportunities to those in high-income countries for clinical trial research in low-resource regions where clinical trial research receives considerably less research funding.","Park, Jay J H; Mogg, Robin; Smith, Gerald E; Nakimuli-Mpungu, Etheldreda; Jehan, Fyezah; Rayner, Craig R; Condo, Jeanine; Decloedt, Eric H; Nachega, Jean B; Reis, Gilmar; Mills, Edward J",Lancet Glob Health,300,18

To ensure availability of donor cells on the scheduled date of infusion, many sites now collect cryopreserved grafts before the start of pretransplantation conditioning. Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (ptCY) is an increasingly used approach for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, but the impact of graft cryopreservation on the outcomes of allo-HCT using ptCY is not known. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database, we compared the outcomes of HCT using cryopreserved versus fresh grafts in patients undergoing HCT for hematologic malignancy with ptCY. We analyzed 274 patients with hematologic malignancy undergoing allo-HCT between 2013 and 2018 with cryopreserved grafts and ptCY. Eighteen patients received bone marrow grafts and 256 received peripheral blood stem cell grafts. These patients were matched for age, graft type, disease risk index (DRI), and propensity score with 1080 patients who underwent allo-HCT with fresh grafts. The propensity score, which is an assessment of the likelihood of receiving a fresh graft versus a cryopreserved graft, was calculated using logistic regression to account for the following: disease histology, Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), HCT Comorbidity Index, conditioning regimen intensity, donor type, and recipient race. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), non-relapse mortality (NRM), relapse/progression and disease-free survival (DFS). Because of multiple comparisons, only P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. The 2 cohorts (cryopreserved and fresh) were similar in terms of patient age, KPS, diagnosis, DRI, HCT-CI, donor/graft source, and conditioning intensity. One-year probabilities of OS were 71.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.3% to 73.8%) with fresh grafts and 70.3% (95% CI, 64.6% to 75.7%) with cryopreserved grafts (P = .81). Corresponding probabilities of OS at 2 years were 60.6% (95% CI, 57.3% to 63.8%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 51.9% to 65.4%) (P = .62). In matched-pair regression analysis, graft cryopreservation was not associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for cryopreserved versus fresh, 1.05; 95% CI, .86 to 1.29; P = .60). Similarly, rates of neutrophil recovery (HR, .91; 95% CI, .80 to 1.02; P = .12), platelet recovery (HR, .88; 95% CI, .78 to 1.00; P = .05), grade III-IV acute GVHD (HR, .78; 95% CI, .50 to 1.22; P = .27), NRM (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, .86 to 1.55; P = .32) and relapse/progression (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, .97 to 1.50; P = .09) were similar with cryopreserved grafts versus fresh grafts. There were somewhat lower rates of chronic GVHD (HR, 78; 95% CI, .61 to .99; P = .04) and DFS (HR for treatment failure, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.29; P = .04) with graft cryopreservation that were of marginal statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Overall, our data indicate that graft cryopreservation does not significantly delay hematopoietic recovery, increase the risk of acute GVHD or NRM, or decrease OS after allo-HCT using ptCY.","Hamadani, Mehdi; Zhang, Mei-Jie; Tang, Xiao-Ying; Fei, Mingwei; Brunstein, Claudio; Chhabra, Saurabh; D'Souza, Anita; Milano, Filippo; Phelan, Rachel; Saber, Wael; Shaw, Bronwen E.; Weisdorf, Daniel; Devine, Steven M.; Horowitz, Mary M.",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,300,16

Using the Migraine Buddy smartphone application, we assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on migraine in users residing in the United States. METHODS: Migraine Buddy is a smartphone application by individuals to record their migraine headache episodes, characteristics, and coping mechanisms. For this study, anonymized self-reported data from 163,176 adult Migraine Buddy users in the United States between January 2020 and May 2020, were analyzed for migraines associated with stress. A stress-related migraine is defined as one in which stress or anxiety was reported as a trigger or symptom. A questionnaire on the impact of COVID-19 on migraine and its management was also completed by 923 users from the United States in the app between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS: 88% of the Migraine Buddy database extract and 84% of the respondents are female, with a mean age of 36.2 years. The proportion of stress-related migraine attacks peaked at 53% on March 21 to 23, although the number of migraine attacks decreased. This followed the declaration of the COVID-19 national emergency on March 13 and a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases in the United States. Questionnaire respondents felt that the following added more stress: social isolation (22.6%), information overdose (21.2%), access to essentials (food, medication, etc.) (18.7%), and financial concerns (17.8%). To help manage migraine during COVID-19, respondents suggested stress and diet coaching programs and resources (medical articles, etc.) (34.0%), having the option for home delivery of medication (30.6%) and tele-consulting (25.5%). CONCLUSION: Here, we report the change in the proportion of self-reported stress-related migraine in relation to evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact of migraine management. Our data will help increase the understanding of patients’ needs and help with planning and execution of mitigating strategies.","Kato, Yuji; Poh, Weijie; Horvath, Zsolt; Cadiou, François; Shimazu, Tomokazu; Maruki, Yuichi",BMC Neurol,300,4

Methods This was a multicenter, observational, prospective, and longitudinal study of 156 patients undergoing maintenance HD from 15 dialysis units conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assigned patients to receive dietary counseling through a phone call, according to their biochemical and nutritional parameters. Dry weight, intradialytic weight gain percentage (%IDWG), body mass index, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, calcium/phosphorus product, normalized protein catabolic rate, albumin, and hemoglobin were recorded at baseline and one month after nutrition counseling. Results The prevalence of hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia decreased significantly after dietary advice. A statistically significant reduction in serum potassium and phosphorus levels was observed in patients receiving counseling for hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. In addition, there was a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of hypophosphatemia. We also observed a significant decrease in %IDWG, although no statistically significant differences were detected in patients with high %IDWG. The data demonstrated statistically significant differences in potassium and phosphorus values when the person making the phone contact was the patient or the caregiver. The main statistically significant differences in hypophosphatemia %IDWG were only observed when contact was made directly with the patient. No differences were observed when the contact was made through nursing homes. Conclusion Our results suggest that telehealth-delivered dietary interventions can improve the clinical and nutritional parameters of HD patients. Consequently, this strategy may be effective for promoting continuous nutritional monitoring in these patients, in particular when conducting a face-to-face option is not crucial.","Valente, A.; Jesus, J.; Breda, J.; Dinis, A.; Correia, A.; Godinho, J.; Oliveira, T.; Garagarza, C.",J Ren Nutr,300,23

A proper waste management is urgently required to mitigate the spread of the disease, minimize the environmental impacts, and take their potential advantages for further utilization. This work provides a prospective review on the possible thermochemical treatments for those COVID-19 related medical wastes (CMW), as well as their possible conversion to fuels. The characteristics of each waste are initially analyzed and described, especially their potential as energy source. It is clear that most of CMWs are dominated by plastic polymers. Thermochemical processes, including incineration, torrefaction, pyrolysis, and gasification, are reviewed in terms of applicability for CMW. In addition, the mechanical treatment of CMW into sanitized refuse-derived fuel (SRDF) is also discussed as the preliminary stage before thermochemical conversion. In terms of material flexibility, incineration is practically applicable for all types of CMW, although it has the highest potential to emit the largest amount of CO(2) and other harmful gasses. Furthermore, gasification and pyrolysis are considered promising in terms of energy conversion efficiency and environmental impacts. On the other hand, carbonization faces several technical problems following thermal degradation due to insufficient operating temperature.","Purnomo, Chandra Wahyu; Kurniawan, Winarto; Aziz, Muhammad",Resour Conserv Recycl,300,26

These include research kits approved under emergency use authorization through simplified process to stabilize the supply of the reagents. Although these research kits have been increasingly used in clinical practice, limited data is available for the diagnostic performance in clinical settings. METHODS: We compared sensitivity, specificity, and cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained by NAATs using 10 kits approved in Japan including eight kits those receiving emergency use authorization using 69 frozen-stored clinical samples including 23 positive samples with various Ct values and 46 negative samples. RESULTS: Viral copy number of the frozen-stored samples determined with LightMix E-gene test ranged from 0.6 to 84521.1 copies/μL. While no false-positive results were obtained by any of these tests (specificity: 100% [95% CI, 88.9%-100%]), sensitivity of the nine tests ranged from 68.2% [95% CI, 45.1%-86.1%] to 95.5% [95% CI, 77.2%-99.9%] using LightMix E-gene test as the gold standard. All tests showed positive results for all samples with ≥100 copies/μL. Significant difference of Ct values even among tests amplifying the same genetic region (N1-CDC, N2) was also observed. CONCLUSION: Difference in the diagnostic performance was observed among NAATs approved in Japan. Regarding diagnostic kits for emerging infectious diseases, a system is needed to ensure both rapidity of reagent supply and accuracy of diagnosis. Ct values, which are sometimes regarded as a marker of infectivity, are not interchangeable when obtained by different assays.","Mizoguchi, Miyuki; Harada, Sohei; Okamoto, Koh; Higurashi, Yoshimi; Ikeda, Mahoko; Moriya, Kyoji",PLoS One,300,1

METHODS: After performing PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2, we additionally tested for the presence of RTI‐causing viruses to check for coinfection. Subsequently, we identified the specific coexisting respiratory viruses and calculated the coinfection rate. In addition, based on the coinfection status, we compared the Ct values obtained from RT‐PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2 in patients who tested positive for COVID‐19 PCR. RESULTS: Of 13,717 patients, 123 had positive results on COVID‐19 PCR testing and six tested positive for an RTI‐causing virus. Thus, the coinfection rate was 4.9%.

Baseline enrollment was done from August 2015 to March 2017. The study protocol was amended in April 2020 to allow COVID-19 incidence and seroprevalence studies. A total of 290 households including 1598 participants were enrolled and followed from April to October 2020 in four study sites. When a participant showed respiratory illness symptoms, a serum sample and a nasal and an oropharyngeal swab were obtained. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. If positive, the subject was followed and swabs collected on days three, six, nine, and 14 after the first swab day and a serum sample obtained on day 14. All subjects residing with the index case were swabbed following the same sampling schedule. Sera were collected from cohort participants in October 2020 to assess seroprevalence. Swabs were tested by RT-PCR. Sera were tested by Microneutralization Assay to measure the neutralizing antibody titer. Incidence of COVID-19, household secondary attack rate, and seroprevalence in the cohort were determined. The incidence of COVID-19 was 6.9% and the household secondary attack rate was 89.8%. Transmission within households occurred within two-days of confirming the index case. Infections were asymptomatic or mild with symptoms resolving within 10 days. The majority developed a neutralizing antibody titer by day 14 post onset. The overall seroprevalence among cohort participants was 34.8%. These results suggest that within-household transmission is high in Egypt. Asymptomatic or mild illness is common.

Public debates question its impact compared to reliance on individual responsibility. We study how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics and interacts with policies. We first assess the value of lockdown in terms of mortality compared to a counterfactual scenario that incorporates self-protection efforts; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when public regulations change. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Physical distancing effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions of the epidemics and average distancing effort in the population. Rational distancing effort is computed as a Nash Equilibrium. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to daily incidence of hospitalization in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that a business-as-usual benchmark yields an overestimation of the number of deaths by a factor of 10 compared to benchmarks with equilibrium efforts. However, lockdown saves nearly twice as many lives as individual efforts alone. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts. Communication that increases risk salience is more effective.","Aubert, Cécile; Augeraud-Véron, Emmanuelle",PLoS One,300,16

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis Eligibility criteria: Studies enrolling consecutive COVID-19 patients (probable or confirmed) presenting with neurological manifestations. Data sources: PubMed, Medline, Cochrane library, clinicaltrials.gov and EMBASE from 31st December 2019 to 15th December 2020. Data extraction and analysis: Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts retrieved by literature search. Risk of bias was examined using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed, and pooled prevalence and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated for neurological manifestations. Odds ratio (OR) and 95%CI were calculated to determine the association of neurological manifestations with disease severity and mortality. Presence of heterogeneity was assessed using I-square, meta-regression, and subgroup analyses. Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: Of 2,455 citations, 350 studies were included in this review, providing data on 145,634 COVID-19 patients, 89% of whom were hospitalized. Forty-one neurological manifestations (24 symptoms and 17 diagnoses) were identified. Pooled prevalence of the most common neurological symptoms included: fatigue (32%), myalgia (20%), taste impairment (21%), smell impairment (19%) and headache (13%). A low risk of bias was observed in 85% of studies; studies with higher risk of bias yielded higher prevalence estimates. Stroke was the most common neurological diagnosis (pooled prevalence- 2%). In COVID-19 patients aged >60, the pooled prevalence of acute confusion/delirium was 34% and the presence of any neurological manifestations in this age group was associated with mortality (OR 1.80; 95%CI 1.11 to 2.91). Conclusions: Up to one-third of COVID-19 patients analysed in this review experienced at least one neurological manifestation. One in 50 patients experienced stroke. In those over 60, more than one-third had acute confusion/delirium; the presence of neurological manifestations in this group was associated with near doubling of mortality.

Are we learning something new from COVID-19 pandemic?,18.596972,4.0202746,2021-01-23,"ABSTRACT: The current global demand for novel anti-TB drugs has drawn urgent attention on the discovery of natural product compounds with anti-TB activity. Lots of efforts have emphasized on environmental samples from unexplored or underexplored natural habits and identified numerous rare actinomycete taxa producing structurally diverse bioactive natural products. Herein, we report a survey of the rare actinobacteria diversity in Xinjiang region together with the discovery of anti-TB active natural products from these strains. We have collected 17 soil samples at different sites with different environmental conditions, from which 39 rare actinobacteria were identified by using a selective isolation strategy with 5 media variations. Among those isolated strains, XJ31 was identified as a new Nocardia sp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis. Through one strain-many compounds (OSMAC) strategy combined with anti-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin bioassay-guided isolation, two groups of compounds were identified. They were twelve siderophores (nocardimicins, 1-12) and two anthraquinones (brasiliquinones, 13 and 14) and ten of them were identified as new compounds. The structures of the purified compounds were elucidated using HR-ESI-MS, 1D NMR, and 2D NMR techniques. The anti-TB bioassays revealed that the two benz[α]anthraquinones have potent activity against BCG (MICs = 25 μM), which can be used as a promising start point for further anti-TB drug development. KEY POINTS: • Ten new natural products were identified from Nocardia sp. XJ31. • Brasiliquinones 13 and 14 showed moderate anti-BCG activity.

Unlike typical respiratory viruses, SARS-CoV-2 frequently causes systemic infection by breaking the boundaries of the respiratory systems. The development of animal models recapitulating the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is of utmost importance not only for the development of vaccines and antivirals but also for understanding the pathogenesis. However, there has not been developed an animal model for systemic infection of SARS-CoV-2 representing most aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with systemic symptoms. Here we report that a hamster strain of Phodopus roborovskii SH101, a laboratory inbred hamster strain of P. roborovskii, displayed most symptoms of systemic infection upon SARS-CoV-2 infection as in the case of the human counterpart, unlike current COVID-19 animal models. P. roborovskii SH101 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2 represented most clinical symptoms of COVID-19 such as snuffling, dyspnea, cough, labored breathing, hunched posture, progressive weight loss, and ruffled fur, in addition to high fever following shaking chills. Histological examinations also revealed a serious right-predominated pneumonia as well as slight organ damages in the brain and liver, manifesting systemic COVID-19 cases. Considering the merit of a small animal as well as its clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human, this hamster model seems to provide an ideal tool to investigate COVID-19. Author summary Although the current animal models supported SARS-CoV-2 replication and displayed varying degrees of illness after SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infections of SARS-CoV-2 were mainly limited to the respiratory systems of these animals, including hACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, ferrets, fruit bats, guinea pigs, African green monkey, Rhesus macaques, and Cynomolgus macaques. While these animal models can be a modest model for the respiratory infection, there is a clear limit for use them in the study of COVID-19 that also displays multiple systemic symptoms. Therefore, the development of an animal model recapitulating COVID-19-specific symptoms such as the right-predominated pneumonia would be the utmost need to overcome the imminent threat posed by COVID-19. We identified a very interesting hamster strain, Phodopus roborovskii SH101, which mimics almost all aspects of the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unlike the current animal models, SARS-CoV-2-infected P. roborovskii SH101 not only displayed the symptoms of respiratory infection but also clinical manifestations specific to human COVID-19 such as high fever following shaking chills, serious right-predominated pneumonia, and minor organ damages in the brain and liver.","Zhai, Chongkai; Wang, Mingda; Chung, Hea-Jong; Hassan, Md.

More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mOR's ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","Vo, Quynh; Mahinthichaichan, Paween; Shen, Jana; Ellis, Christopher",Res Sq,300,1

This virus is prevalent in herds throughout the world and continues to pose a significant threat as newer and more virulent disease phenotypes emerge. In this report we describe the full-length nucleotide sequence of a Canadian PRRSV isolate, designated PA8. A consecutive sequence of 15,411 nucleotides was obtained from a set of overlapping cDNA clones. In order to determine the extent of genetic variation among isolates recovered from swine in Canada and the US, as well as to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the evolution of PRRSV, the full-length sequence of PA8 was compared with that of two US isolates, VR2332 and 16244B. The genomic sequence of PA8 shared 98.2% and 99.2% identity with 16244B and VR2332, respectively. The untranslated regions (UTR) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome were very well conserved. Notable exceptions include an eight nucleotide difference at the 5′ end of the 5′ UTR of VR2332 relative to PA8 and 16244B and a two nucleotide difference in the 3′ UTR of PA8 relative to VR2332 and 16244B. In contrast to PA8 and VR2332, 16244B possessed two nucleotide differences within the RNA pseudoknot structure of the ribosomal frameshift region between open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b. Amino acid differences were distributed throughout the genome, however they appeared to be most extensive in Nsp1β and ORF5 of the nonstructural and structural coding regions, respectively, suggesting that the evolutionary pressure to conserve these viral genes is somewhat lower.","Wootton, S.; Yoo, D.; Rogan, D.",Arch Virol,300,24

Similar to that in SARS-CoV, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 is the critical to the virus infection. Recently multiple species (human, Chinese chrysanthemum, Malay pangolin and cat) have been reported to be susceptible to the virus infection. However, the binding capacity and the detailed binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 of these species remains unexplored. Herein free energy calculations with MM-GBSA and Potential of Mean Forces together reveal that the Human-SARS-CoV-2 has a higher stability tendency than Human-SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, we uncover that SARS-CoV-2 has an enhanced ability to bind with the ACE2 in humans, pangolins and cats compared to that in bats. Analysis of key residues with energy decomposition and residue contact maps reveal several important consensus sites in ACE2s among the studied species, and determined the more favourable specified residues among the different types of amino acids. These results provide important implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 host range which will make it possible to control the spread of the virus and use of animal models, targeted drug screening and vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Ma, Shaojie; Li, Hui; Yang, Jun; Yu, Kunqian",Biochimie,300,1

OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes in hospitalized adults with severe COVID‐19 treated with standard prophylactic versus intermediate dose enoxaparin. METHODS: We conducted a multi‐center, open‐label, randomized controlled trial comparing standard prophylactic dose versus intermediate dose enoxaparin in adults who were hospitalized with COVID‐19 and admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or had laboratory evidence of coagulopathy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive standard prophylactic dose enoxaparin or intermediate weight‐adjusted dose enoxaparin. The primary outcome was all‐cause mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes included arterial or venous thromboembolism and major bleeding. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients (99 males and 77 females) underwent randomization. In the intention‐to‐treat population, all‐cause mortality at 30 days was 15% for intermediate dose enoxaparin and 21% for standard prophylactic dose enoxaparin (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.30–1.45; P = .31 by Chi‐square test). Unadjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated no significant difference in mortality between intermediate and standard dose enoxaparin (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.33–1.37; P = .28). Arterial or venous thrombosis occurred in 13% of patients assigned to intermediate dose enoxaparin and 9% of patients assigned to standard dose enoxaparin.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The knowledge that COVID-19 subjects can be asymptomatic and still shed virus, producing infectious droplets during breathing, suggests that health care workers (HCWs) should assume every patient is potentially infectious during this pandemic. Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. Guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (glove, gowns, masks, shield, and/or powered air purifying respiratory) during high-risk procedures are essential and should be considered for use with lower risk procedures such as administration of uncontaminated medical aerosols. Bioaerosols generated by infected patients are a major source of transmission for SARS CoV-2, and other infectious agents. In contrast, therapeutic aerosols do not add to the risk of disease transmission unless contaminated by patients or HCWs.","Fink, James B.; Ehrmann, Stephan; Li, Jie; Dailey, Patricia; McKiernan, Paul; Darquenne, Chantal; Martin, Andrew R.; Rothen-Rutishauser, Barbara; Kuehl, Philip J.; Häussermann, Sabine; MacLoughlin, Ronan; Smaldone, Gerald C.; Muellinger, Bernhard; Corcoran, Timothy E.; Dhand, Rajiv",J Aerosol Med Pulm Drug Deliv,300,28

The atomic structure of M(pro) in complex with an α-ketoamide inhibitor (Lig13b) is available (PDB ID:6Y2G). Using 6Y2G and the prior knowledge that protease inhibitors could eradicate COVID-19, we designed a computational study aimed at identifying FDA-approved drugs that could interact with M(pro). We searched the DrugBank and PubChem for analogs and built a virtual library containing ∼33000 conformers. Using high-throughput virtual screening and ligand docking, we identified Isavuconazonium, a ketoamide inhibitor (α-KI) and Pentagastrin as the top three molecules (Lig13b as the benchmark) based on docking energy. The ΔG(bind) of Lig13b, Isavuconazonium, α-KI, Pentagastrin was -28.1, -45.7, -44.7, -34.8 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulation revealed that these ligands are stable within the M(pro) active site. Binding of these ligands is driven by a variety of non-bonded interaction, including polar bonds, H-bonds, van der Waals and salt bridges. The overall conformational dynamics of the complexed-M(pro) was slightly altered relative to apo-M(pro). This study demonstrates that three distinct classes molecules, Isavuconazonium (triazole), α-KI (ketoamide) and Pentagastrin (peptide) could serve as potential drugs to treat patients with COVID-19.","Achilonu, Ikechukwu; Iwuchukwu, Emmanuel Amarachi; Achilonu, Okechinyere Juliet; Fernandes, Manuel Antonio; Sayed, Yasien",J Mol Graph Model,300,24

Physical performance is a central component of health. However, its relationship with isolation and loneliness is not well understood. We therefore assessed the relationship between loneliness, different aspects of social isolation, and physical performance over time. 8,780 participants from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, assessed three times over 8 years of follow-up, were included. Measures included physical performance (Short Physical Performance Battery), loneliness (modified UCLA Loneliness Scale), and isolation considered in three ways (domestic isolation, social disengagement, low social contact). Fixed effects regression models were used to estimate the relationship between changes in these parameters. Missing data were imputed to account for variable response and ensure a representative sample. Loneliness, domestic isolation and social disengagement were longitudinally associated with poorer physical performance when accounting for both time-invariant and time-variant confounders (loneliness: coef = − 0.06, 95% CI − 0.09 to − 0.02; domestic isolation: coef = − 0.32, 95% CI − 0.46 to − 0.19; social disengagement: coef = − 0.10, 95% CI − 0.12 to − 0.07).

This notion is supported by preclinical animal models, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), as well as approved disease modifying therapies (DMTs) that suppress clinical relapse and are designed to impede infiltration of activated lymphocytes into the CNS. Nonetheless, emerging evidence demonstrates that the innate immune response e.g., neutrophils can amplify white matter damage through a variety of different mechanisms.

The numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths are increasing across the globe. In many countries lockdown has been imposed at local, regional as well as national level to combat with this global pandemic that caused the improvement of air quality. In India also lockdown was imposed on 25th March, 2020 and it was further extended in different phases. The lockdown due to outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic has showed substantial reduction of PM(2.5) concentrations across the cities of India. The present study aims to assess concentration of PM(2.5) across 12 cities located in different spatial segments Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). The result showed that there was substantial decrease of PM(2.5) concentrations across the cities located in IGP after implementation of lockdown. Before 30 days of lockdown, average PM(2.5) across cities was 65.77 µg/m(3) that reached to 42.72 µg/m(3) during lockdown periods (decreased by 35%). Maximum decrease of PM(2.5) concentrations has been documented in Lower Gangetic Plain (LGP) cities (57%) followed by Middle Gangetic Plain (MGP) cities (34%) and Upper Gangetic Plain (UGP) cities (27%) respectively. Among all the cities of IGP, maximum decrease of PM(2.5) concentrations was recorded in Kolkata (64%) (LGP) followed by Muzaffarpur (53%) (MGP), Asansol (51%) (LGP), Patna (43%) (MGP) and Varanasi (33%) (MGP).Therefore, this study has an immense potentiality to understand the impact of lockdown on a physical region (Ganga River Basin) and it may be also helpful for planners and policy makers to implement effective measures at regional level to control air pollution.","Das, Manob; Das, Arijit; Sarkar, Raju; Saha, Sunil; Mandal, Ashis",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,300,21

How aging influences CDN efficacy is unclear. We examined the vaccine efficacy of 3′,5′-cyclic diguanylic acid (cyclic di-GMP, CDG), the founding member of CDNs, in 1-year-old (middle-aged) and 2-year-old (aged) C57BL/6J mice. We found that 1- and 2-year-old C57BL/6J mice are defective in CDG-induced memory T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses and high-affinity serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G, mucosal IgA production. Next, we generated two novel tumor necrosis factor (TNF) fusion proteins that target soluble TNF (solTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) to monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) to enhance CDG vaccine efficacy in 1- and 2-year-old mice. The moDC-targeting TNF fusion proteins restored CDG-induced memory Th1, Th17, and high-affinity IgG, IgA responses in the 1- and 2-year-old mice. Together, the data suggested that aging negatively impacts CDG vaccine adjuvanticity. MoDC-targeting TNF fusion proteins enhanced CDG adjuvanticity in the aging mice.","Gogoi, Himanshu; Mansouri, Samira; Katikaneni, Divya S.; Jin, Lei",Front Immunol,300,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients with solitary pulmonary lesion from three hospitals in China were enrolled from January 18, 2020 to March 18, 2020. The clinical feature and laboratory findings at first visit, as well as characteristics and dynamic evolution of chest CT images were analyzed. Among them, the CT score evaluation was the sum of the lung involvement in five lobes (0–5 points for each lobe, with a total score ranging from 0 to 25). RESULTS: 22 COVID-19 patients (11 males and 11 females, with an average age of 40.7 ± 10.3) developed a solitary pulmonary lesion within 4 days after the onset of symptoms, the peak time of CT score was about 11 days (with a median CT score of 6), and was discharged about 19 days. The peak of CT score was positively correlated with the peak time and the discharge time (p < 0.001, r = 0.793; p < 0.001, r = 0.715). Scan-1 (first visit): 22 cases (100%) showed GGO and one lobe was involved, CT score was 1.0/1.0 (median/IQR). Scan-2 (peak): 15 cases (68%) showed crazy-paving pattern, 19 cases (86%) showed consolidation, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/12.0. Scan-3 (before discharge): ten cases (45%) showed linear opacities, none had crazy-paving pattern, and 2.5 lobes were involved, CT score was 6.0/11.0. Scan-4 (after discharge): three cases (19%) showed linear opacities and one lobe was involved, CT score was 2.0/5.0. CONCLUSION: The chest CT features are related to the course of COVID-19 disease, and dynamic chest CT scan are helpful to monitor disease progress and patients’ condition. In recovered patients with COVID-19, the positive CT manifestations were found within 4 days, lung involvement peaking at approximately 11 days, and discharged at about 19 days. The patients with more severe the lung injury was, the later the peak time appeared and the longer the recovery time was. Although the lesion was resolved over time, isolation and reexamination were required after discharge.","Zhuang, Yuandi; Lin, Liaoyi; Xu, Xunhua; Xia, Tianyi; Yu, Huili; Fu, Gangze; Yang, Yunjun; Wang, Meihao; Sun, Houzhang",Jpn J Radiol,300,10

For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS: We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions. RESULTS: For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13–59)%. With 2 days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55–85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to 4 and 3 days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64–88)% and 93 (91–97)%, respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5–17)% for a 2-day isolation policy and by 14 (5–26)% for 14 days. A 4-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52–64)%, while a 3-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79–83)%. In both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended post-fever isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days of isolation instead of one.","Burns, Adam A.C.; Gutfraind, Alexander",PeerJ,300,1

In this article, we present a model of health impact that transforms that assumption. We argue that UBI can affect higher level social determinants of health down to individual determinants of health and on to improvements in public health that lead to a number of economic returns on investment. Given that no trial has been designed and deployed with that impact in mind, we present a methodological framework for assessing prospective costs and returns on investment through modelling to make the case for that trial. We begin by outlining the pathways to health in our model of change in order to present criteria for establishing the size of transfer capable of promoting health. We then consider approaches to calculating cost in a UK context to estimate budgetary burdens that need to be met by the state. Next, we suggest means of modelling the prospective impact of UBI on health before asserting means of costing that impact, using a microsimulation approach. We then outline a set of fiscal options for funding any shortfall in returns. Finally, we suggest that fiscal strategy can be designed specifically with health impact in mind by modelling the impact of reform on health and feeding that data cyclically back into tax transfer module of the microsimulation.","Johnson, Matthew Thomas; Johnson, Elliott Aidan; Webber, Laura; Friebel, Rocco; Reed, Howard Robert; Lansley, Stewart; Wildman, John",Health Serv Outcomes Res Methodol,300,28

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a critical component of the viral antigen presentation pathway and plays essential roles in conferring differential viral susceptibility and severity of diseases. However, the association between HLA gene polymorphisms and risk for COVID‐19 has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HLA genotypes might impact on the differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID‐19 across countries. METHODS: We conducted in silico analyses and examined an association of HLA gene polymorphisms with prevalence and mortality of COVID‐19 by using publicly available databases. RESULTS: We found that a possible association between HLA‐A*02:01 and an increased risk for COVID‐19. HLA‐A*02:01 had a relatively lower capacity to present SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens compared with other frequent HLA class I molecules, HLA‐A*11:01 or HLA‐A*24:02. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that individuals with HLA‐A*11:01 or HLA‐A*24:02 genotypes may generate efficiently T‐cell‐mediated antiviral responses to SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with HLA‐A*02:01. The differences in HLA genotypes may potentially alter the course of the disease and its transmission.","Tomita, Yusuke; Ikeda, Tokunori; Sato, Ryo; Sakagami, Takuro",Immun Inflamm Dis,300,21

The present study examines the relationship between the probability of temporary extinction and the age-dependent next-generation matrix, focusing on the impact of assortativity. Preferred mixing captures as a good approximation the assortativity of a heterogeneously mixing population. We show that the contribution of a nonmaintenance host (i.e., a host type which cannot sustain transmission on its own) to the risk of a major epidemic is greatly diminished as mixing patterns become more assortative, and in such a scenario, a higher proportion of non-maintenance hosts among index cases elevates the probability of extinction. Despite the presence of various other epidemiological factors that undoubtedly influenced the delay between first importations and the subsequent epidemic, these results suggest that the dominance of adults among imported cases represents one of the possible factors explaining the delays in geographic spread observed during the recent pandemic.","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Cook, Alex R.; Cowling, Benjamin J.",Interdiscip Perspect Infect Dis,300,33

This approach can also spare reagents and plasticware, which have experienced a shortage during the initial waves of the pandemic, reducing the overall testing costs. Methods : This study evaluated the performance of extraction-free protocols based on simple dilution of the specimen in sterile RNAse free water (with or without a heating step) in comparison to standard RNA extraction protocols, using two commercial kits for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 (Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 assay and Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay) in nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS). Results : Compared with conventional protocols, extraction-free protocols based on sample dilution without a heating step exhibited a lower analytical sensitivity: 74% and 82% with the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 assay (tested with 139 NPS samples) and the Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2/FluA/FluB/RSV assay (tested with 69 NPS samples), with a mean increase of Ct values of +2.04 and +1.32, respectively. Most false negative results were observed with sampled of low viral load. Including a step of heath exposure did not improve but actually decreased the analytical sensitivity of the assay. Conclusions : Results confirmed that extraction-free protocols could be a faster and cheaper approach to SARS-CoV-2 detection in NPS samples, that could improve processivity of diagnostic platforms.","Morecchiato, Fabio; Coppi, Marco; Baccani, Ilaria; Maggini, Niccolò; Ciccone, Nunziata; Antonelli, Alberto; Rossolini, Gian Maria",Int J Infect Dis,300,1

MPAL are at higher risk of induction failure. Lineage switch (B to M or vice versa) or persistence of only the lymphoid or myeloid clone is frequently observed in biphenotypic/bilineal cases, highlighting their lineage plasticity. The prognosis of MPAL remains bleak, with an event-free survival (EFS) of less than 50% in children. A lymphoid-type therapeutic approach appears to be more effective but failures to achieve complete remission (CR) remain significant. KMT2A fusions account for 75-80% of leukemia in infants under one year of age and remains a major pejorative prognostic factor in the Interfant-06 protocol with a 6 years EFS of only 36%. The search for other therapeutic approaches, in particular immunotherapies that are able to eradicate all MPAL clones, is a major issue. We describe here the feasibility and tolerance of the combination of two targeted immunotherapies, blinatumomab and Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin, in a 4-year-old infant with a primary refractory KTM2A-rearranged MPAL. Our main concern was to determine how to associate these two immunotherapies and we describe how we decided to do it with the parents’ agreement. The good MRD response on the two clones made it possible to continue the curative intent with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant at 9 months of age. Despite a relapse at M11 post-transplant because of the recurrence of a pro-B clone retaining the initial lymphoid phenotype, the child is now 36 months old, in persistent negative MRD CR2 for 12 months after a salvage chemotherapy and an autologous CAR T cells infusion, with no known sequelae to date. This case study can thus lead to the idea of a sequential combination of two immunotherapies targeting two distinct leukemic subclones (or even a single biphenotypic clone), as a potential one to be tested prospectively in children MPAL and even possibly all KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL.","Brethon, Benoît; Lainey, Elodie; Caye-Eude, Aurélie; Grain, Audrey; Fenneteau, Odile; Yakouben, Karima; Roupret-Serzec, Julie; Le Mouel, Lou; Cavé, Hélène; Baruchel, André",Front Oncol,300,20

We detail innovative technologic solutions inspired by the pandemic-related restrictions that augmented neurosurgical education and care delivery. Methods Several digital-health and audio-visual innovations were implemented, including use of remote video technology to facilitate inpatient consultations and outpatient ambulatory virtual visits, optimize our regional hospital neurosurgical coverage, expand our interdisciplinary patient management conferences (i.e. Tumor Board), and further enhance our neurosurgical resident education program. Enterprise patient-experience data was queried to evaluate patient satisfaction following the switch to virtual visits. Results Between January 2020 and April 2021 utilization of virtual visits more than doubled in the department of Neurosurgery. A survey of 10,772 patients following ambulatory visits showed that virtual visitation was equal if not better in providing satisfactory patient care than in-person visitation. After switching our interdisciplinary spine tumor board to virtual, we increased surgeon participation and attendance by 49.29%.

Resilience is a process that incorporates many of the core skills and abilities which may enable people to address stigma and discrimination. The current study aimed to develop and pilot an intervention to strengthen individual and family resilience against leprosy-related discrimination. METHODOLOGY: We used a quasi-experimental, before-after study design with a mixed methods approach. The 10-week family-based intervention was designed to strengthen the resilience of individuals and families by enhancing their protective abilities and capacity to overcome adversity. The study was conducted in two sites, urban areas in Telangana state, and in rural areas in Odisha state, India. Persons affected and their family members were included using purposive sampling. Two questionnaires were used pre-and post-intervention: the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC, maximum score 100, with high scores reflecting greater resilience) and the WHOQOL-BREF (maximum score of 130, with higher scores reflecting higher quality of life). In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted post-intervention. Data were collected at baseline, a few weeks after completion of the intervention, and in the Odisha cohort again at six months after completion. Paired t-tests measured differences pre- and post- intervention. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. FINDINGS: Eighty participants across 20 families were included in the study (23 persons affected and 57 family members). We found a significant increase in CD-RISC scores for persons affected and family members from Odisha state (baseline 46.5, first follow-up 77.0, second follow-up 70.0), this improvement was maintained at six-month follow-up. There was no increase in CD-RISC scores post-intervention among participants from Telangana state. WHOQOL-BREF scores were significantly higher at follow-up for persons affected in both states, and for family members in Odisha state. No families dropped out of the study. In the qualitative feedback, all participants described drawing benefit from the programme. Participants especially appreciated the social dimensions of the intervention. CONCLUSION: This pilot study showed that the 10-week family-based intervention to strengthen resilience among persons affected by leprosy and their family members was feasible, and has the potential to improve resilience and quality of life. A large-scale efficacy trial is necessary to determine the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention.","van’t Noordende, Anna T.; Bakirtzief da Silva Pereira, Zoica; Biswas, Pritha; Ilyas, Mohammed; Krishnan, Vijay; Parasa, Jayaram; Kuipers, Pim",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,300,16

Agonists to TLR7 are attractive therapeutic agents as they have the potential of activating both innate and acquired immunity against viral infections. Imiquimod, a specific TLR7 agonist, has been successfully used for the topical treatment of genital/perianal warts in immunocompetent individuals. Here we examined the anti-HIV effect of imiquimod in primary human macrophages and demonstrated that TLR7 activation by imiquimod could effectively inhibit infection of the cells by different strains of HIV. Further mechanistic studies revealed that while imiquimod had little effect on interferons expression, its treatment of macrophages resulted in the increased production of the CC chemokines, the natural ligands of the HIV entry co-receptor CCR5, and decreased expression of CD4 and CCR5. These findings are clinically important and indicate that activating the intracellular antiviral immunity by imiquimod has the potential for developing TLR7 agonist-based therapy for HIV infection. ABSTRACT: The Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 is a viral sensor for detecting single-stranded ribonucleic acid (ssRNA), the activation of which can induce intracellular innate immunity against viral infections. Imiquimod, a synthetic ligand for TLR7, has been successfully used for the topical treatment of genital/perianal warts in immunocompetent individuals. We studied the effect of imiquimod on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary human macrophages and demonstrated that the treatment of cells with imiquimod effectively inhibited infection with multiple strains (Bal, YU2, and Jago) of HIV. This anti-HIV activity of imiquimod was the most potent when macrophages were treated prior to infection. Infection of macrophages with pseudotyped HIV NL4-3-ΔEnv-eGFP-Bal showed that imiquimod could block the viral entry. Further mechanistic studies revealed that while imiquimod had little effect on the interferons (IFNs) expression, its treatment of macrophages resulted in the increased production of the CC chemokines (human macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α), MIP-1β, and upon activation regulated normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES)), the natural ligands of HIV entry co-receptor CCR5, and decreased the expression of CD4 and CCR5. The addition of the antibodies against the CC chemokines to macrophage cultures could block imiquimod-mediated HIV inhibition.

It is logical to predict that pregnant women infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) might be at higher risk for severe illness, morbidity, or mortality compared with non-pregnant women. However, a review of the literature indicates that pregnant women are not more likely to be seriously ill than other healthy non-pregnant women if they develop coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This observation begs the question: “Why does pregnancy not increase the risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection, nor does it worsen the clinical course of COVID-19 compared with non-pregnant individuals?” Herein, we try to explain our observations when considering whether the immunologic changes of pregnancy and other physiologic adaptations of pregnancy affect the virulence and course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Selim, Mohamed; Mohamed, Sherif; Abdo, Manal; Abdelhaffez, Azza",Cureus,300,16

Relationship between angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) polymorphism and the prognosis of local Chinese patients with ALI was investigated; meanwhile, the mechanisms involved were explored. METHODS: 101 ALI patients, 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy blood donors were enrolled. ACE I/D polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction, then ACE genotype (II, ID, DD) and allele (I, D) frequencies were compared. Clinical data of ALI patients was calculated. Also, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy volunteers with different ACE genotypes. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ACE gene mRNA expression and ACE activity was measured. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was higher in DD subgroup than in II subgroup (19.7 ± 8.7 and 15.6 ± 6.2; P < 0.05). The 28-day mortality was significantly different (17.4%, 26.8%, and 64.3% for II, ID, and DD; P = 0.013). DD genotype was the independent prognostic factor for 28-day outcome. Furthermore, LPS-induced ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity from PBMC in DD genotype subgroup were both significantly higher than those in the other two subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: ACE I/D polymorphism is a prognostic factor for ALI. Patients with the DD genotype have higher mortality of ALI. Polymorphism influences the expression of ACE gene in LPS-stimulated PBMC, DD genotype leads to higher level of mRNA and enzyme activity. It may be one of the mechanisms involved.","Lu, Xiao-Min; Chen, Guang-Jian; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Hai-Bo",Respir Med,300,1

Developing nations have had to tackle this unanticipated crisis in the midst of various other healthcare delivery issues and resource constraints. As a tertiary level cancer care provider located in an eastern Indian city, a COVID-19 hotspot, we share our experience from the perspective of haematology and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) services. The primary challenges related to infection control included infection screening and decreasing exposure among patients and healthcare workers. Logistic challenges include maintaining essential patient care services, personnel redeployment, blood bank inventory constraints and maintaining the supply chain for a continuum of care. Clinical management challenges were dealt with by rationalising treatment delivery by modification of treatment regimens, risk-based deferral of HSCT, management of COVID-19 in patients, and staggering the follow-up schedules in survivors and those on maintenance therapies, among other strategies. These challenges were compounded by the restrictions imposed by a countrywide lockdown in the initial period of the pandemic, which also affected the socio-economic aspects of treatment delivery. As a training institution, this period also impacted academics and research activities. This overview details our response to these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has many unknowns.","Radhakrishnan, Vivek S; Nair, Reghu K Sukumaran; Goel, Gaurav; Ramanan, Venkatraman; Chandy, Mammen; Nair, Reena",Ecancermedicalscience,300,1

The overall mental health of the DCT improved with increased scores seen in all areas of personal life. Leisure activity/hobbies increased as well as positive behaviours which resulted in anxiety levels decreasing significantly. There was an overall reduction in all stressors except ‘workload/responsibilities’, which increased from 40 to 80%. Dissatisfaction with senior support which was not in line with what the DCT wanted or needed. Responses still showed that ‘family/friends health’ continues to be of higher importance than ‘personal health’.

Ni(0.4)Cu(0.2)Zn(0.4)Fe(2)O(4) ferrites nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation assisted with ultrasonic irradiation produced by ultrasonic cleaner with 20 kHz frequency using chlorinated salts and KOH as initial materials. The effects of ultrasonic power (0, 40W, 60W, 80W) and reaction temperature on the microstructure and magnetic properties of ferrite nanoparticles were investigated. The structure analyses via XRD revealed the successful formation of pure (NiCuZn)Fe(2)O(4) ferrites nanospinel without any impurity. The crystallites sizes were less than 40 nm and the lattice constant was near 8.39Å. The TEM showed ferrite particle polygonal. M-H analyses performed the saturation magnetization and coercivity of ferrite nanoparticles obtained at the reaction temperature of 25℃ were higher than at 50℃ with same power. The samples exhibited the highest values of Ms 55.67 emu/g at 25℃ and 47.77 emu/g at 50℃ for 60W and the lowest values of Hc 71.23 Oe at 25℃ for 40W and 52.85 Oe at 50℃ for 60W. The squareness ratio (SQR) were found to be lower than 0.5, which revealed the single magnetic domain nature (NiCuZn)Fe(2)O(4) nanoparticles.

METHODS: Randomised controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18–29 years. Participants completed two (with and without a cloth face mask) maximal cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) on a treadmill following the Bruce protocol. Blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, exertion and shortness of breath were measured. Descriptive data and physical activity history were collected pretrial; perceptions of wearing face masks and experiential data were gathered immediately following the masked trial. RESULTS: The final sample included 31 adults (age=23.2±3.1 years; 14 women/17 men). Data indicated that wearing a cloth face mask led to a significant reduction in exercise time (−01:39±01:19 min/sec, p<0.001), maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2)max) (−818±552 mL/min, p<0.001), minute ventilation (−45.2±20.3 L/min), maximal heart rate (−8.4±17.0 beats per minute, p<0.01) and increased dyspnoea (1.7±2.9, p<0.001). Our data also suggest that differences in SpO(2) and rating of perceived exertion existed between the different stages of the CPET as participant’s exercise intensity increased. No significant differences were found between conditions after the 7-minute recovery period. CONCLUSION: Cloth face masks led to a 14% reduction in exercise time and 29% decrease in VO(2)max, attributed to perceived discomfort associated with mask-wearing. Compared with no mask, participants reported feeling increasingly short of breath and claustrophobic at higher exercise intensities while wearing a cloth face mask. Coaches, trainers and athletes should consider modifying the frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise when wearing a cloth face mask.","Driver, Simon; Reynolds, Megan; Brown, Katelyn; Vingren, Jakob L; Hill, David W; Bennett, Monica; Gilliland, Taylor; McShan, Evan; Callender, Librada; Reynolds, Erin; Borunda, Nate; Mosolf, John; Cates, Casey; Jones, Alan",Br J Sports Med,300,16

While these measures are warranted in order to minimize the spread of the virus they may have detrimental effects on various behaviors, including physical activity (PA). The present study examined PA and sitting time in 14 to18-year-old Austrian high school students prior to and during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. Data was collected via an online questionnaire during fall/winter 2020/21. Questions were based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, which examined frequency and duration of PA and sitting time. A total of 221 high school students provided valid data. Participants reported significantly lower moderate and vigorous PA during the lockdown while sitting time increased (p < 0.01). The frequency of walking (days/week) also decreased during COVID-19 lockdown, which also contributed to a significant decline in total walking time (p < 0.01). Further, the decline in PA was more pronounced in boys, while girls reported a greater decline in walking. These differences were due to higher PA and walking in boys and girls, respectively, prior to the lockdown. During the lockdown sex differences in PA and sitting time were limited. Taken together, these results highlight the impact of COVID-19 policies on PA in adolescents and emphasize the importance to promote an active lifestyle even in times of home confinement.","Greier, Klaus; Drenowatz, Clemens; Bischofer, Theresa; Petrasch, Gloria; Greier, Carla; Cocca, Armando; Ruedl, Gerhard",AIMS Public Health,300,20

Reports of patients presenting with syncope and pre-syncope, as well as hypoxemia without symptoms of dyspnea (“silent hypoxemia”), have led researchers to speculate whether SARS-CoV-2 can alter autonomic nervous system function. As viral infections are commonly reported triggers of altered autonomic control, we must consider whether SARS-CoV-2 can also interfere with autonomic activity, at least in some patients. As we are still in the early stages of understanding COVID-19, we still do not know whether syncope and silent hypoxemia are more strongly associated with COVID-19 compared to any other viral infections that severely compromise gas exchange. Therefore, in this perspective we discuss these two intriguing clinical presentations, as they relate to autonomic nervous system function. In our discussion, we will explore COVID-specific, as well as non-COVID specific mechanisms that may affect autonomic activity and potential therapeutic targets. As we move forward in our understanding of COVID-19, well-designed prospective studies with appropriate control and comparator groups will be necessary to identify potential unique effects of COVID-19 on autonomic function.","Baker, Jacquie; Incognito, Anthony V.; Wilson, Richard J.A.; Raj, Satish R.",Auton Neurosci,300,33

Detection and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses require separate and complex workflows that rely on highly-specialized facilities, personnel, and reagents. To date, no method can rapidly diagnose multiple viral infections and determine variants in a high-throughput manner. Methods We describe a method for multiplex isothermal amplification-based sequencing and real-time analysis of multiple viral genomes, termed NIRVANA. It can simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human adenovirus, and human coronavirus, and monitor mutations for up to 96 samples in real-time. Findings NIRVANA showed high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in 70 clinical samples with a detection limit of 20 viral RNA copies per μl of extracted nucleic acid. It also detected the influenza A co-infection in two samples. The variant analysis results of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples mirror the epidemiology of COVID-19. Additionally, NIRVANA could simultaneously detect SARS-CoV-2 and PMMoV (an omnipresent virus and water quality indicator) in municipal wastewater samples. Conclusions NIRVANA provides high-confidence detection of both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and mutation surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 on the fly. We expect it to offer a promising solution for rapid field-deployable detection and mutational surveillance of pandemic viruses.

Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by the decay in antibody titers over time, methods for estimating population exposure should account for seroreversion, to reflect that changes in seroprevalence measures over time are the net effect of increases due to recent transmission and decreases due to antibody waning. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios (IFR) and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is around six months, IFR is 0.54% to 1.3%, and true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.","Chen, Siyu; Flegg, Jennifer A.; White, Lisa J.; Aguas, Ricardo",PLoS Comput Biol,300,16

Health care authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities worldwide. A poor understanding of the disease among health care workers (HCWs) may result in delayed treatment and result in the rapid spread of the infection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID-19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among variables, with significance set to P<.05. RESULTS: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate: 85.6%); 51.6% (n=234) were male, 32.1% (n=147) were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (n=137, 30.2%) and medical students (n=134, 29.6%). Most participants (n=276, 61.0%) used social media to obtain information on COVID-19. A significant proportion of HCWs had poor knowledge of its transmission (n=276, 61.0%) and symptom onset (n=288, 63.6%) and showed positive perceptions of COVID-19. Factors such as age and profession were associated with inadequate knowledge and a poor perception of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach HCWs worldwide, and further studies are warranted.","Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Aldhaleei, Wafa Ali; Rahmani, Jamal; Mahabadi, Mohammadjavad Ashrafi; Bandari, Deepak Kumar",JMIR Public Health Surveill,300,29

Although Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) is considered to be the gold standard, serological tests based on antibodies could be very helpful. However, individual studies measuring the accuracy of the various tests are usually underpowered and inconsistent, thus, a comparison of different tests is needed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted the literature search in PubMed, medRxiv and bioRxiv. For the statistical analysis we used the bivariate method for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests pooling sensitivities and specificities. We evaluated IgM and IgG tests based on Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Chemiluminescence Enzyme Immunoassays (CLIA), Fluorescence Immunoassays (FIA) and the point-of-care (POC) Lateral Flow Immunoassays (LFIA) that are based on immunochromatography. In total, we identified 38 eligible studies that include data from 7,848 individuals. The analyses showed that tests using the S antigen are more sensitive than N antigen-based tests. IgG tests perform better compared to IgM ones, and show better sensitivity when the samples were taken longer after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, irrespective of the method, a combined IgG/IgM test seems to be a better choice in terms of sensitivity than measuring either antibody type alone. All methods yielded high specificity with some of them (ELISA and LFIA) reaching levels around 99%. ELISA- and CLIA-based methods performed better in terms of sensitivity (90-94%) followed by LFIA and FIA with sensitivities ranging from 80% to 86%. ELISA tests could be a safer choice at this stage of the pandemic. POC tests (LFIA), that are more attractive for large seroprevalence studies show high specificity but lower sensitivity and this should be taken into account when designing and performing seroprevalence studies.","Kontou, Panagiota I; Braliou, Georgia G; Dimou, Niki L; Nikolopoulos, Georgios; Bagos, Pantelis G",,300,23

Many species of bats are insectivorous while others are frugivorous and few of them are hematophagous. Some of these animals fly during the night, others are crepuscular or diurnal. Some fly long distances during seasonal migrations. Many species are colonial cave-dwelling, living in a rather small home range while others are relatively solitary. However, in spite of the importance of bats for terrestrial biotic communities and ecosystem ecology, the diversity in their biology and lifestyles remain poorly known and underappreciated. More than sixty viruses have been detected or isolated in bats; these animals are therefore involved in the natural cycles of many of them. This is the case, for instance, of rabies virus and other Lyssavirus (Family Rhabdoviridae), Nipah and Hendra viruses (Paramyxoviridae), Ebola and Marburg viruses (Filoviridae), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Coronaviridae). For these zoonotic viruses, a number of bat species are considered as important reservoir hosts, efficient disseminators or even directly responsible of the transmission. Some of these bat-borne viruses cause highly pathogenic diseases while others are of potential significance for humans and domestic or wild animals; so, bats are an important risk in human and animal public health. Moreover, some groups of viruses developed through different phylogenetic mechanisms of coevolution between viruses and bats. The fact that most of these viral infections are asymptomatic in bats has been observed since a long time but the mechanisms of the viral persistence are not clearly understood. The various bioecology of the different bat populations allows exchange of virus between migrating and non-migrating conspecific species. For a better understanding of the role of bats in the circulation of these viral zoonoses, epidemiologists must pay attention to some of their biologic properties which are not fully documented, like their extreme longevity, their diet, the population size and the particular densities observed in species with crowded roosting behavior, the population structure and migrations, the hibernation permitting overwintering of viruses, their particular innate and acquired immune response, probably related at least partially to their ability to fly, allowing persistent virus infections and preventing immunopathological consequences, etc. It is also necessary to get a better knowledge of the interactions between bats and ecologic changes induced by man and to attentively follow bat populations and their viruses through surveillance networks involving human and veterinary physicians, specialists of wild fauna, ecologists, etc. in order to understand the mechanisms of disease emergence, to try to foresee and, perhaps, to prevent viral emergences beforehand. Finally, a more fundamental research about immune mechanisms developed in viral infections is essential to reveal the reasons why Chiroptera are so efficient reservoir hosts. Clearly, a great deal of additional work is needed to document the roles of bats in the natural history of viruses.","Rodhain, F.",Bull Soc Pathol Exot,300,16

An ecological study was performed to determine the spatial distribution of COVID-19 testing by ZIP Code Tabulation Area and investigate if testing was associated with race or SES. METHODS: Data were obtained from the New York City Coronavirus data repository and the 2018 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. A combined index of SES was created using principal component analysis, and incorporated household income, gross rent, poverty, education, working class status, unemployment, and occupants per room. Multivariable Poisson regressions were performed to predict the number of total tests and the ratio of positive tests to total tests performed, using the SES index, racial composition, and Hispanic composition as predictors. RESULTS: The number of total tests significantly increased with the increasing proportion of white residents (β=0.004, SE=0.001, p=0.0032), but not with increasing Hispanic composition or SES index score. The ratio of positive tests to total tests significantly decreased with the increasing proportion of white residents in the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (β= –0.003, SE=0.0006, p<0.001) and with increasing SES index score (β= –0.0016, SE=0.0007, p=0.0159). CONCLUSIONS: In New York City, COVID-19 testing has not been proportional to need; existing socioeconomic and racial disparities in healthcare access have likely impacted public health response. There is urgent need for widespread testing and public health outreach for the most vulnerable communities in New York City.","Lieberman-Cribbin, Wil; Tuminello, Stephanie; Flores, Raja M.; Taioli, Emanuela",Am J Prev Med,300,20

Patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could profoundly impact the health care system if a subset were to be PCR-positive again with reactivated SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE To characterize a single center COVID-19 cohort with and without recurrence of PCR positivity, and develop an algorithm to identify patients at high risk of retest positivity after discharge to inform health care policy and case management decision-making. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cohort of 414 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, at The Second Affiliated Hospital of Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China from January 11 to April 23, 2020. EXPOSURES Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and IgM-IgG antibody confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Univariable and multivariable statistical analysis of the clinical, laboratory, radiologic image, medical treatment, and clinical course of admission/quarantine/readmission data to develop an algorithm to predict patients at risk of recurrence of PCR positivity. RESULTS 16.7% (95CI: 13.0%-20.3%) patients retest PCR positive 1 to 3 times after discharge, despite being in strict quarantine. The driving factors in the recurrence prediction model included: age, BMI; lowest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for cholinesterase, fibrinogen, albumin, prealbumin, calcium, eGFR, creatinine; highest levels of the blood laboratory tests during hospitalization for total bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase; the first test results during hospitalization for partial pressure of oxygen, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, blood procalcitonin; and the first test episodic Ct value and the lowest Ct value of the nasopharyngeal swab RT PCR results. Area under the ROC curve is 0.786. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This case series provides clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with recurrent PCR positivity, despite strict quarantine, at a 16.7% rate. Use of a recurrence prediction algorithm may identify patients at high risk of PCR retest positivity of SARS-CoV-2 and help modify COVID-19 case management and health policy approaches.","Huang, J.; Zheng, L.; Li, Z.; Hao, S.; Ye, F.; Chen, J.; Yao, X.; Liao, J.; Wang, S.; Zeng, M.; Qiu, L.; Cen, F.; Huang, Y.; Zhu, T.; Xu, Z.; Ye, M.; Yang, Y.; Wang, G.; Li, J.; Wang, L.; Qu, J.; Yuan, J.; Zheng, W.; Zhang, Z.; Li, C.; Whitin, J.

After individuating groups of similar or dissimilar regions with respect to the ten types of available COVID-19 data using statistical test, we built several similarity matrices. Then, we mapped those similarity matrices into networks where nodes represent Italian regions and edges represent similarity relationships (edge length is inversely proportional to similarity). Then, network-based analysis was performed mainly discovering communities of regions that show similar behavior. In particular, network-based analysis was performed by running several community detection algorithms on those networks and by underlying communities of regions that show similar behavior. The network-based analysis of Italian COVID-19 data is able to elegantly show how regions form communities, i.e., how they join and leave them, along time and how community consistency changes along time and with respect to the different available data.","Milano, Marianna; Cannataro, Mario",Int J Environ Res Public Health,300,10

Several comorbidities have been related to mortality in COVID-19, as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic kidney disease. AIMS: To describe the main clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the major social security institution in Mexico, as well as the contribution of chronic comorbidities and the population attributable fraction related to them. METHODS: Data for all patients with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 in the institutional database was included for analysis. Demographic information, the presence of pneumonia and whether the patient was hospitalized or treated at home as an outpatient as well as comorbidities were analyzed. Case fatality rate was estimated for different groups. Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals from a logistic regression model were estimated, as well as the population attributable fraction. RESULTS: By November 13, 2020, 323,671 subjects with COVID-19 infection have been identified. Case fatality rate is higher in males (20.2%), than in females (13.0%), and increases with age. Case fatality rate increased with the presence of obesity, hypertension and/or diabetes. Age and sex were major independent risk factors for mortality, as well as the presence of pneumonia, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, immunosuppression, and end-stage kidney disease. The population attributable fraction due to obesity in outpatients was 16.8%.

Given the continued high incidence of COVID‐19, and the likelihood that new variants and other infectious agents may cause future outbreaks, we sought to understand the relationship of nursing home quality ratings and measures of COVID‐19 outbreak severity and persistence. DESIGN: We analyzed nursing home facility‐level data on COVID‐19 cases and deaths, county‐level COVID‐19 rates, and nursing home data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), including ratings from the CMS Nursing Home Five‐Star Quality Rating System. We used regression analysis to examine the association between star ratings and cumulative COVID‐19 incidence and mortality as well as persistent high resident incidence. SETTING: All nursing homes in the CMS COVID‐19 Nursing Home Dataset reporting data that passed quality assurance checks for at least 20 weeks and that were included in the January 2021 Nursing Home Care Compare update. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of the included nursing homes. MEASUREMENTS: Cumulative resident COVID‐19 incidence and mortality through January 10, 2021; number of weeks with weekly resident incidence of COVID‐19 in the top decile nationally. RESULTS: As of January 10, 2021, nearly all nursing homes (93.6%) had reported at least one case of COVID‐19 among their residents, more than three‐quarters (76.9%) had reported at least one resident death, and most (83.5%) had experienced at least 1 week in the top decile of weekly incidence. In analyses adjusted for facility and county‐level characteristics, we found generally consistent relationships between higher nursing home quality ratings and lower COVID‐19 incidence and mortality, as well as with fewer high‐incidence weeks. CONCLUSION: Nursing home quality ratings are associated with COVID‐19 incidence, mortality, and persistence. Nursing homes receiving five‐star ratings, for overall quality as well as for each domain, had lower COVID‐19 rates among their residents.","Williams, Christianna S.; Zheng, Qing; White, Alan J.; Bengtsson, Ariana I.; Shulman, Evan T.; Herzer, Kurt R.; Fleisher, Lee A.",J Am Geriatr Soc,300,24

Objective: To assess sleep using validated measures among frontline healthcare workers on social media Design: A self-selection survey was distributed on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for 16 days (August 31-September 15, 2020) targeting healthcare workers (HCW) who were clinically active during the pandemic. Study participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and reported demographic/career information. Poor sleep quality was defined as PSQI>5. Moderate-to-severe insomnia was defined as an ISI>14. The mini-Z was used to measure burnout. Multivariate logistic regression tested associations between demographics, career characteristics, and sleep outcomes. Setting: Online self-selection survey on social media Participants: 963 surveys were completed. Participants were predominantly White (92.8%), female (73.4%), aged 30-49 (71.9%), and physicians (64.4%). Mean sleep duration was 6.1 (SD 1.2) hours. Nearly 90% reported poor sleep (PSQI). One third (33.0%) reported moderate or severe insomnia. Many (60%) experienced sleep disruptions due to device usage or had bad dreams at least once per week (45%). Over 50% reported burnout. In multivariable logistic regressions, non-physician (OR 2.4; CI: 1.7, 3.4), caring for COVID-19 patients (OR 1.8; CI 1.2, 2.8), Hispanic ethnicity (OR 2.2; CI: 1.4, 3.5), being female (OR 1.6; CI 1.1, 2.4), and having a sleep disorder (OR 4.3; CI 2.7,6.9) were associated with increased odds of insomnia. In open-ended comments (n=310), poor sleep mapped to four categories: children and family, work demands, personal health, and pandemic-related sleep disturbances. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 90% of frontline healthcare workers surveyed on social media reported poor sleep, over one-third reported insomnia, and over half reported burnout. Many also reported sleep disruptions due to device usage and nightmares. Sleep interventions for frontline healthcare workers are urgently needed.","Stewart, N. H.; Koza, A.

Although several factors may account for this disparity, striking differences within and between populations indicate that ethnicity might impact COVID-19 clinical outcomes, reflecting the 'color of disease'. Therefore, the role of key biological variables that could interplay with viral spreading and severity indices has attracted increasing attention, particularly among non-Caucasian populations. Although the links between vitamin D status and the incidence and severity of COVID-19 remain elusive, several lines of emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D signaling, targeting several immune-mediated pathways, may offer potential benefits at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given that the vitamin D status is modulated by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including skin type (pigmentation), melanin polymers may also play a role in variable COVID-19 outcomes among diverse population settings. Moreover, apart from the well-known limiting effects of melanin on the endogenous production of vitamin D, the potential crosstalk between the pigmentary and immune system may also require special attention concerning the current pandemic. The present review article aimed to shed light on a range of mostly overlooked host factors, such as vitamin D status and melanin pigments, that may influence the course and outcome of COVID-19.","Sidiropoulou, Polytimi; Docea, Anca Oana; Nikolaou, Vasiliki; Katsarou, Martha-Spyridoula; Spandidos, Demetrios A.; Tsatsakis, Aristidis; Calina, Daniela; Drakoulis, Nikolaos",Int J Mol Med,300,16

The joint destruction common in children with smallpox might be prevented by antiviral drugs, but intraarticular infusion of antiviral drugs is unprecedented. Development of highly effective antiviral drugs against smallpox raises the issue of whether postexposure vaccination can be performed without interference by an antiviral drug.

Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor that increases mortality and other adverse outcomes of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may bind dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) for entering cells of the respiratory tract. Besides, DPP4 takes part in immune system regulation. Thus, DPP-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) may play a role against COVID-19. METHODS: We focused on the impact of DPP4i treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes in people with DM. For this purpose, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the existing evidence on this topic. RESULTS: Retrospective observational studies provide inconsistent results on the association between use of DPP4i and outcomes of COVID-19. While two studies reported significantly lower mortality rates among patients with DM who received DPP4i versus those who did not, a series of other studies showed no effect of DPP4i or even worse outcomes. A meta-analysis of 7 studies yielded a neutral estimate of the risk ratio of COVID-19-related mortality among users of DPP4i (0.81; 95% CI 0.57–1.15). CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized controlled trials, observational research available so far provides inconclusive results and insufficient evidence to recommend use of DPP4i against COVID-19.","Bonora, B.

Several studies report that ABO blood group polymorphism may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes; however, the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether ABO blood groups are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A total of 715 articles were retrieved from seven databases. Ten articles were selected for meta-analysis after removal of duplicates and two levels of screenings. Overall, individuals with blood group A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.56] and B (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) had a substantially higher risk of COVID-19, whereas this was not the case for blood group AB (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30). Individuals with blood group O was not prone to develop the disease (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the Rh-positive blood group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). A meta-analysis of 5 studies suggested that blood group A was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52). Mild publication bias was found in the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that blood groups A and B may be risk factors for COVID-19, whereas the blood group O appears to be protective. Blood group A may be related to unfavourable outcomes. Further rigorous and high-quality research evidence is needed to confirm this association.","Liu, Nanyang; Zhang, Tingting; Ma, Lina; Zhang, Huiqing; Wang, Huichan; Wei, Wei; Pei, Hui; Li, Hao",Blood Rev,300,16

Their prevention is a necessity, and healthcare professionals are one of their main vectors. Thus, they must be at the centre of preventative strategies. As hydro-alcoholic solutions (alcohol-based hand rub) represent the most effective means of preventing these infections, it is necessary to identify the representations, barriers, and facilitators of their use. METHOD: Forty-six healthcare professionals from two areas in France, New Aquitaine and Guadeloupe, were questioned about their practices through semi-structured registered interviews and four focus groups. Each interview and focus group were transcribed then analysed through lexicometric and thematic content analyses. RESULTS: The interviewed identified several barriers and facilitators related to the composition and characteristics of hydro-alcoholic solutions (unpleasantness, harmfulness, personal preferences for other hand hygiene products), personal factors (work habits, cognitive bias, lack of knowledge and communication) and organizational (professional constraints, product accessibility, financial resources). CONCLUSION: Strategies to prevent healthcare-associated infections should be constructed with consideration of psychosocial facilitators and barriers for healthcare professionals in using hydro-alcoholic solutions. These strategies should also ensure that they are well informed about the effectiveness of alcohol-based solutions, through prevention campaigns and scientific articles. This awareness should equally be conveyed with educational tools that involve healthcare professionals and use the social dynamics of their work environment.","Calcagni, Nicolas; Venier, Anne-Gaëlle; Nasso, Raymond; Broc, Guillaume; Ardichen, Eva; Jarrige, Bruno; Parneix, Pierre; Quintard, Bruno",Infect Prev Pract,300,31

Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is ‘physical distancing’ in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk ‘allowances’ or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic’s trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic’s potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","Chersich, Matthew F.; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie, Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah; Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona; Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen",Global Health,300,28

The development of anti-CoV drugs has long been hindered by the capacity of CoVs to proofread and remove mismatched nucleotides during genome replication and transcription. Here, we review the molecular basis of the CoV proofreading complex and evaluate its potential as a drug target.

Despite qualitative discussions of potential social-economic causes, it remains unclear how this unordinary pattern could be substantiated with quantitative explanations. Through the development of an urban epidemic hazard index (EpiRank) for Chinese prefectural districts, we came up with a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. The index is constructed via epidemic simulations on a multi-layer transportation network interconnecting local SEIR transmission dynamics, which characterizes intra- and inter-city population flow with a granular mathematical description. Essentially, we argue that these highlighted small towns possess greater epidemic hazards due to the combined effect of large local population and small inter-city transportation. The ratio of total population to population outflow could serve as an alternative city-specific indicator of such hazards, but its effectiveness is not as good as EpiRank, where contributions from other cities in determining a specific city’s epidemic hazard are captured via the network approach. Population alone and city GDP are not valid signals for this indication. The proposed index is applicable to different epidemic settings and can be useful for the risk assessment and response planning of urban epidemic hazards in China. The model framework is modularized and the analysis can be extended to other nations.","Li, Tianyi; Luo, Jiawen; Huang, Cunrui",Sci Rep,300,24

The disease is characterized primarily, but not exclusively, by respiratory clinical manifestations ranging from mild common cold symptoms, including cough and fever, to severe respiratory distress and multi-organ failure. Macrophages, a heterogeneous group of yolk-sac derived, tissue-resident mononuclear phagocytes of complex ontogeny present in all mammalian organs, play critical roles in developmental, homeostatic and host defense processes with tissue-dependent plasticity. In case of infection, they are responsible for early pathogen recognition, initiation and resolution of inflammation, as well as repair of tissue damage. Monocytes, bone-marrow derived blood-resident phagocytes, are recruited under pathological conditions such as viral infections to the affected tissue to defend the organism against invading pathogens and to aid in efficient resolution of inflammation. Given their pivotal function in host defense and the potential danger posed by their dysregulated hyperinflammation, understanding monocyte and macrophage phenotypes in COVID-19 is key for tackling the disease’s pathological mechanisms. Here, we outline current knowledge on monocytes and macrophages in homeostasis and viral infections and summarize concepts and key findings on their role in COVID-19. While monocytes in the blood of patients with moderate COVID-19 present with an inflammatory, interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)-driven phenotype, cellular dysfunction epitomized by loss of HLA-DR expression and induction of S100 alarmin expression is their dominant feature in severe disease. Pulmonary macrophages in COVID-19 derived from infiltrating inflammatory monocytes are in a hyperactivated state resulting in a detrimental loop of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and recruitment of cytotoxic effector cells thereby exacerbating tissue damage at the site of infection.","Knoll, Rainer; Schultze, Joachim L.; Schulte-Schrepping, Jonas",Front Immunol,300,12

METHODS: Cohort of 370 hospitalized children (1 to 72 months) with SARI from May 2008 to March 2010 was enrolled in this study. Nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens were tested by a commercial assay for 18 respiratory viral targets. The viral distribution and its association with clinical character were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Viral pathogen was detected in 350 (94.29%) of children with SARI. Overall, the most popular viruses were: enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) (54.05%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (51.08%), human bocavirus (BoCA) (33.78%), human parainfluenzaviruse type 3 (PIV3) (15.41%), and adenovirus (ADV) (12.97%).

Muco-obstructive lung diseases (MucOLDs) are characterised by the accumulation of hyper-concentrated mucus in the small airways, leading to persistent inflammation, infection and dysregulated protease activity. Although neutrophilic serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase, have been implicated in the propagation of inflammation and local tissue destruction, it is likely that the serine TLPs also contribute to various disease-relevant processes given the roles that a number of these enzymes play in the activation of both the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). More recently, significant attention has focused on the activation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by host TLPs.

However, clinical trial outcomes have been disparate, suggesting that CQ and HCQ antiviral mechanisms are not fully understood. Based on three-dimensional structural similarities between HCQ and the known ACE2 specific inhibitor MLN-4760, we compared their modulation on ACE2 activity. Here we describe, for the first time, in a cell-free in vitro system that HCQ directly and dose-dependently inhibits the activity of recombinant human ACE2, with a potency similar to the MLN-4760. Further analysis suggests that HCQ binds to a noncompetitive site other than the one occupied by MLN-4760. We also determined that the viral spike glycoprotein segment that comprises the RBD segment has no effect on ACE2 activity but unexpectedly was able to partially reverse the inhibition induced by HCQ but not that by MLN-4760. In summary, here we demonstrate the direct inhibitory action of HCQ over the activity of the enzyme ACE2. Then, by determining the activity of ACE2, we reveal that the interaction with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 leads to structural changes that at least partially displace the interaction of the said enzyme with HCQ. These results may help to explain why the effectiveness of HCQ in clinical trials has been so variable.

The H120 and Ma5 are the only viral strains approved by the Brazilian government as the constituent of vaccines. Despite the systematic vaccination in Brazil, IBV has not yet been controlled and diseases associated with this virus have been reported in vaccinated chickens. Here, we investigated the genetic variability of H120 and Ma5 strains present in the IBV vaccines from different Brazilian manufacturers. We performed DNA sequencing analyses of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene to investigate its genetic variability and the presence of viral subpopulations among vaccines, between batches, and also in each vaccine after a single passage was performed in chicken embryonated eggs. Our results revealed up to 13 amino acid substitutions among vaccines and some of them were localized in regions of the S1 glycoprotein that play a role in virus–host interaction. Secondary nucleotide peaks identified in the chromatogram for the S1 gene sequence revealed that all original vaccines (H120 and Ma5) were composed by different subpopulations of IBV. Moreover, new viral subpopulations were also found in vaccines after a single passage in chicken embryonated eggs. These findings indicate that H120 and Ma5 viral strains used in vaccines market in Brazil can still mutate very rapidly during replication, leading to amino acid substitutions in proteins involved in the stimulation of the immune response, such as the S1 glycoprotein. Therefore, our data suggest that the genetic variability of these viral strains should be taken into consideration to ensure an effective immune response against IBV.

However, little is known about the use of VC on alliance in family-based therapy. The recent COVID-19 pandemic led to a national lockdown during which most family-based therapy transferred to VC. OBJECTIVE: The current study analyzed the development and strength of alliance prior and during lockdown for multi-stressed families participating in Multisystemic Therapy (MST). METHOD: Alliance with the therapist was reported monthly by 846 caregivers (81% female). Using latent growth curve models (longitudinal approach), the development of alliance was estimated for families participating in MST prior to the lockdown, transferring to VC early in treatment or late in treatment. Using regression analyses (cross-sectional approach), lockdown (yes/no) was included as predictor of alliance. In these analyses, type of family (regular; intellectual disability; concerns regarding child abuse or neglect) and gender of caregiver were included as moderators. RESULTS: Both analytical approaches showed that alliance was not affected by VC, except for families with concerns of child abuse, who reported lower alliances during lockdown. However, these results where no longer significant when controlling for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: Strong alliances can be developed and maintained during family-based VC sessions with multi-stressed families. However, for some subgroups, such as families with concerns of child abuse, VC might not be suitable or sufficient. Future research needs to investigate the potential and limitations of using VC with families.","Lange, Aurelie. M. C.; Delsing, Marc J. M. H.; van Geffen, Marieke; Scholte, Ron. H.

Two independent in vitro studies indicated that favipiravir (T-705) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with EC50 values of 61.88 μM (9.4 μg/mL)3 and >100 μM (15.7 μg/mL)4 , respectively. Data from the authors' group suggests an EC50 value in the range 40-80 µg/mL (X. de Lamballerie & F. Touret, unpublished results). I agree with the authors' assumption that favipiravir shows similar EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 and EBOV. As favipiravir is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation through ribosylation and phosphorylation in the host cells to form its triphosphate form (favipiravir-RTP), we think that variation in favipiravir activation by the cultured cells may, at least partially, contribute to the difference in the in vitro EC50 among studies.","Du, Yin‐Xiao; Chen, Xiao‐Ping",Clin Pharmacol Ther,300,6

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are states of chronic inflammation and indicate advanced metabolic disease. We sought to understand the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 associated with NAFLD/NASH. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of 6,700 adults with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from March 1, 2020 to Aug 25, 2020. Logistic regression and competing risk were used to assess odds of being hospitalized. Additional adjustment was added to assess risk of hospitalization among patients with a prescription for metformin use within the 3 months prior to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, history of home glucagon-like-peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use, and history of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS). Interactions were assessed by gender and race. RESULTS: A history of NAFLD/NASH was associated with increased odds of admission for Covid-19: logistic regression OR 2.04 (1.55, 2.96, p<0.01), competing risks OR 1.43 (1.09–1.88, p<0.01); and each additional year of having NAFLD/NASH was associated with a significant increased risk of being hospitalized for Covid-19, OR 1.86 (1.43–2.42, p<0.01). After controlling for NAFLD/NASH, persons with obesity had decreased odds of hospitalization for Covid-19, OR 0.41 (0.34–0.49, p<0.01). NAFLD/NASH increased risk of hospitalization in men and women, and in all racial/ethnic subgroups. Mediation treatments for metabolic syndrome were associated with non-significant reduced risk of admission: OR 0.42 (0.18–1.01, p=0.05) for home metformin use and OR 0.40 (0.14–1.17, p=0.10) for home GLP-1RA use. MBS was associated with a significant decreased risk of admission: OR 0.22 (0.05–0.98, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD/NASH is a significant risk factor for hospitalization for Covid-19, and appears to account for risk attributed to obesity. Treatments for metabolic disease mitigated risks from NAFLD/NASH. More research is needed to confirm risk associated with visceral adiposity, and patients should be screened for and informed of treatments for metabolic syndrome.","Bramante, Carolyn T.; Tignanelli, Christopher J.; Dutta, Nirjhar; Jones, Emma; Tamaritz, Leonardo; Clark, Jeanne; Melton-Meaux, Genevieve; Usher, Michael; Ikramuddin, Sayeed",medRxiv,300,1

We investigated a social intervention to promote living well and enhance independence for people with mild dementia. METHODS: In this two arm parallel group, feasibility RCT at six sites in England, participants were randomized (1:1) to the PRIDE intervention (encompassing social, physical, and cognitive domains supported by a facilitator over three sessions) compared to usual care only. The main objective was to determine the feasibility of a main trial with respect to measures of recruitment, retention, and adherence to the intervention. RESULTS: During a 7-month period, 402 people were invited to the trial, 148 were screened (37%, 95% confidence interval (CI)=32–42%), 137 were eligible at pre-consent, 94 consented to the trial (69% of those eligible, 95% CI=60–76%), and 92 were randomized (46 to each group). Of those allocated to the intervention, 42 (91%) received at least one of three intervention sessions. Outcome assessment follow-up visits were completed for 73 participants at 6 months (79%, 95% CI=70–87%), and this was similar for both groups. CONCLUSION: A large multi-center trial of the PRIDE intervention in community-dwelling people with mild dementia is feasible using systematic recruitment strategies.

A rapid and well-coordinated response is important to curb transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We studied an outbreak on an industrial ship to improve outbreak control for ships and coordination between participating harbour partners. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public Health Service (PHS) Rotterdam-Rijnmond performed an epidemiological investigation during the outbreak of COVID-19 among 77 seafarers on a ship in their port. The captain was interviewed about ship details and his experiences during the outbreak. The seafarers were asked to fill in questionnaires about symptoms suspicious of COVID-19 and date of symptom onset. Information about stakeholders involved in outbreak control was registered. RESULTS: The captain first contacted PHS about probable cases on March 31st 2020 via a physician ashore. One crewmember was hospitalised on April 8th and another died unexpectedly aboard on April 10th. Questionnaires distributed mid-April to the 75 remaining seafarers showed that 38 of 60 responders (63%) had had suspicious symptoms between February 15th and April 13th. None of them were tested but a total of 8 other crewmembers tested positive for COVID-19 after leaving the ship, including the hospitalised crewmember and the one who died aboard. On May 5th, the last case left isolation and the quarantine ended. Many different stakeholders were involved in the outbreak response and responsibilities were not always fully clear beforehand, causing coordination issues. CONCLUSIONS: Testing crew with COVID-19 symptoms underpins control measures and clarifies communication between stakeholders. Building a network beforehand to develop outbreak guidelines tailored to ships and local circumstances is essential to control future outbreaks on ships.","Fanoy, Ewout; Ummels, Anke Elisabeth; Schokkenbroek, Valerie; van Dijk, Bas; Wiegmans, Saskia; Veenstra, Thijs; van der Eijk, Annemiek A; Sikkema, Reina S; de Raad, Annemieke",Int Marit Health,300,23

With increasing reliance on the internet and almost 2 million people in the United Kingdom being affected by vision loss, it is important that they are not overlooked when developing web-based materials. A significant proportion of those affected have irreversible vision loss due to rare genetic eye disorders, and many of them use the internet as a primary source of information for their conditions. However, access to high-quality web-based health information with an inclusive design remains a challenge for many. We have developed a new web-based resource for genetic eye disorders called Gene.Vision that aims to provide a holistic guide for patients, relatives, and health care professionals. OBJECTIVE: Through a usability testing session of our website prototype, this study aims to identify key web-based accessibility features for internet users with vision impairment and to explore whether the contents provided in Gene.Vision are relevant and comprehensible. METHODS: A face-to-face testing session with 8 participants (5 patients, 2 family members, and 1 member of the public) and 8 facilitators was conducted on a prototype website. Remote testing was performed with another patient due to COVID-19 restrictions. Home page design, navigation, content layout and quality, language, and readability were explored through direct observation and task completion using the think-aloud method. A patient focus group was organized to elicit further feedback. Qualitative data were gathered and analyzed to identify core themes through open and axial coding. RESULTS: All participants had good computer literacy; 6 patients with visual impairment used visual aid software including iOS VoiceOver and Speak Screen, iOS Classic Invert, ZoomText 2020, Job Access With Speech, and Nonvisual Desktop Access. The features identified by the participants that will enhance accessibility and usability for users with visual impairment were a consistent website layout, a structured information hierarchy with a clear description of links, good chromatic and luminance contrast, a simple home page with predictable and easy navigation, adaptability to various assistive software, and readable and relevant content. They reported that dynamic content (such as carousels) and large empty spaces reduced accessibility. Information on research, support available, practical advice, and links to charities were incentives for repeated website visits. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the importance of developing a website with a user-based approach. Through end user testing, we identified several key web-based accessibility features for people with visual impairment. Target end users should always be involved early and throughout the design process to ensure their needs are met. Many of these steps can be implemented easily and will aid in search engine optimization.","Yeong, Jian Lee; Thomas, Peter; Buller, James; Moosajee, Mariya",J Med Internet Res,300,21

Since the first outbreak of PDCoV in the United States in 2014, this novel porcine coronavirus has been detected in South Korea, Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and China. In this study, a Chinese PDCoV strain, designated CHN-HN-2014, was isolated from piglets with severe diarrhea on a pig farm in Henan Province, China, and examined with a specific immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that CHN-HN-2014 shares 91.6%–99.4% nucleotide identity with other known PDCoV strains. The pathogenicity of CHN-HN-2014 was further investigated in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets. Both kinds of piglets developed clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, anorexia, lethargy, and severe diarrhea, by 2 days postinoculation (DPI), and diarrhea persisted for about 5–6 days. Viral shedding was detected in rectal swabs until 14 DPI in challenged 5-day-old pigs and until 18 DPI in challenged 21-day-old pigs. At necropsy at 4 DPI, macroscopic and microscopic lesions were observed and viral antigen was detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining. These data demonstrate that Chinese PDCoV strain CHN-HN-2014 shares high nucleotide identity with previously reported PDCoV strains and is pathogenic in 5-day-old and 21-day-old piglets.","Dong, Nan; Fang, Liurong; Yang, Hao; Liu, Han; Du, Ting; Fang, Puxian; Wang, Dang; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Vet Microbiol,300,32

This review summarizes the most up-to-date research on nutritional assessment in relation to mortality and morbidity risk in patients with COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS Numerous studies have been published on malnutrition, muscle wasting, obesity, and nutrition impact symptoms associated with COVID-19, mostly observational and in hospitalized patients. These studies have shown a high prevalence of symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysphagia, fatigue, and loss of smell and taste), malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity in patients with COVID-19, all of which were associated with increased mortality and morbidity risks. SUMMARY Early screening and assessment of malnutrition, muscle wasting, obesity, nutrition impact symptoms and micronutrient status in patients with COVID-19, followed by pro-active nutrition support is warranted, and expected to contribute to improved recovery. There is limited research on nutritional status or nutrition impact symptoms in patients living at home or in residential care.

The data set included patients with an emergency department or inpatient encounter with discharge diagnoses codes that could be associated with suspicion of or exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: There were a total of 154 (0.2%) and 667 (0.3%) patients with intracerebral hemorrhage among 85,645 patients with COVID-19 and 197,073 patients without COVID-19, respectively. In the multivariate model, there was a lower risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.5; 95% confidence interval 0.5–0.6; p < .0001) after adjustment for sex, age strata, race/ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, nicotine dependence/tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, long-term anticoagulant use, and alcohol abuse. The proportions of patients who developed pneumonia (58.4% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), acute kidney injury (48.7% versus 31.0%; p < .0001), acute myocardial infarction (11% versus 6.4%; p = .048), sepsis (41.6% versus 22.5%; p < .0001), and respiratory failure (61.7% versus 42.3%; p < .0001) were significantly higher among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19. The in-hospital mortality among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 was significantly higher compared with that among those without COVID-19 (40.3% versus 19.0%; p < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis does not suggest that rates of intracerebral hemorrhage are higher in patients with COVID-19. The higher mortality in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19 is likely mediated by higher frequency of comorbidities and adverse in-hospital events.

This process is time and resource heavy, requiring multiple steps of lysis, extraction, purification, and amplification procedures. Herein, we have developed a method to detect virus off swabs using solely shaker-mill based mechanical lysis and the transfer of the viral lysate directly to a PCR assay for virus detection, bypassing the substantial reagent and time investments required for extraction and purification steps. METHODS: Using Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) as a model system, we spiked swabs in vitro for proof-of-concept testing. Swabs were spiked in serial dilutions from 1.2 × 10(6) to 1.2 × 10(1) copies/mL and then placed in 2 mL tubes with viral transport media (VTM) to mimic the specimen collection procedures in the clinic prior to processing via shaker-mill homogenization. After homogenization, 1 μL of lysate was processed using RT-qPCR for amplification of the nucleocapsid (N) gene, qualifying viral detection. RESULTS: HCoV-229E in vitro spiked swabs were processed in a novel two-step, direct-to-PCR methodology for viral detection. After running 54 swabs, we confidently determined our limit of detection to be 1.2 × 10(3) viral copies/mL with 96.30% sensitivity. CONCLUSION: We have proven that the shaker-mill homogenization-based two-step, direct-to-PCR procedures provides sufficient viral lysis off swabs, where the resulting lysate can be used directly in PCR for the detection of HCoV-229E. This finding allows for reductions in the time and resources required for PCR based virus detection in comparison to the traditional extraction-to-PCR methodology.","Morehouse, Zachary P.; Proctor, Caleb M.; Ryan, Gabriella L.; Nash, Rodney J.",Virol J,300,24

In these countries, VAT’s C-efficiency, that is, actual revenue over potential revenue, should be one if compliance is perfect. Under this approach, VAT’s C-inefficiency—the aggregate of the policy gap (exemptions, reduced rates, thresholds) and the compliance gap (revenue shortfalls due to laps in compliance and implementation)—is treated as a residual. This contribution shows that calculating VAT’s C-inefficiency independently of its C-efficiency produces a more telling benchmark, particularly of the policy gap. This is illustrated by an analysis of the revenues of the Dutch VAT, which, given the common VAT directive, should be representative of the VATs in other European Union Member States. The large policy gap, hovering around 0.50, forms the background for exploring three options to improve VAT’s performance: reforming the common directive, ceding VAT design to Member States, and introducing a common modern VAT which can be piggybacked by Member States.","Cnossen, Sijbren",Int Tax Public Financ,300,1

Any dressing‐wound spaces may allow for build‐up of non‐retained fluids, causing exudate pooling which forms a favourable environment for pathogen growth. Maceration may follow if the pooled exudates spread to peri‐wound skin. Dressings with a claimed 3D‐shape‐conformation technology are commercially available; however, their effectiveness in minimising dressing‐wound gaps has never been scientifically investigated. We present a novel bioengineering methodology for testing the effectiveness of such 3D‐shape‐conformation dressings, using our recently reported robotic phantom system of a sacral pressure ulcer. By means of 3D laser scanning and bespoke software, we reconstructed dressing shapes after simulated use and calculated the goodness‐of‐fit between each dressing (swelled to near‐saturation) and the corresponding wound geometry. Two dressing sizes (10 × 10 cm and 12.5 × 12.5 cm) and two wound depths (2.5 or 2 cm) were considered. All the tested dressings were far from reaching good contact with the (simulated) wounds: Approximately one‐third of the wound volume and nearly half of the wound surface were not in contact with the swelled dressings. Our present findings question whether 3D‐shape‐conformation dressings are effective, by revealing their swelling behaviour which was previously unknown.","Lustig, Adi; Gefen, Amit",Int Wound J,300,28

This study aimed to take a look at changes in the daily routine of a BoNT/A outpatient clinic due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lockdown, analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2-induced re-injection delay on outcomes in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) (n = 36) and four other disease entities (n = 58), and study the influence of covariables, including previous injections and doses. For the present observational study, the first 100 patients who were scheduled to have an appointment between April 20 and May 18 during the partial lockdown and also had been treated regularly before the lockdown were recruited. Clinical and demographical characteristics and treatment-related data from the previous visits were extracted from charts. Time delay, symptom severity assessment, and TSUI score (if applicable) were gathered at the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown emergency visit for each patient. Of the 94 patients who could come to the clinic, 48 reported a delay and 44 reported worsening during the delay. Delays ranged from 1 to 63 days, the mean delay was 23 days, and the mean worsening was 26% compared to the previous visit. A significant correlation was found between the duration of the delay and the patient’s rating of worsening (PwP). In CD patients, the physician´s rating of CD worsening by the TSUI score (ATUSI-PTSUI) was significantly correlated with general worsening (DwP) and the TSUI at the last visit (PTSUI). A small delay of a few weeks led to a similar worsening of symptoms in CD and all other disease entities and to relapse on a higher level of severity. This relapse can only be compensated by continuous treatment up to at least 1 year until patients reach the same level of treatment efficacy as that before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Samadzadeh, Sara; Brauns, Raphaela; Rosenthal, Dietmar; Hefter, Harald",Toxins (Basel),300,22

Honey bees process the collected pollen and store it in the hive, inside the comb cells. The processed pollen is called bee- bread or ambrosia and it is the main source of proteins, lipids, vitamins, macro-and micro-elements in honey bee nutrition. During storage, beebread undergoes solid state fermentation which preserves it and increases the bioavailability of nutrients. Research on beebread has been rather limited until now. In recent years, there is an increasing interest regarding the antimicrobial properties of BCP and beebread, due to emerging antimicrobial resistance by pathogens. Both BCP and beebread exhibit antimicrobial properties against diverse pathogens, like bacteria and fungi. As is the case with other bee products, lack of antimicrobial resistance might be attributed to the synergy of more than one antimicrobial compounds within BCP and beebread. Furthermore, BCP and bee bread exert targeted activity against pathogens and affect the host microbiome in a prebiotic manner.

As obligate parasites, viruses exploit host-cell machinery to glycosylate their own proteins during replication. Viral envelope proteins from a variety of human pathogens including HIV-1, influenza virus, Lassa virus, SARS, Zika virus, dengue virus, and Ebola virus have evolved to be extensively glycosylated. These host-cell derived glycans facilitate diverse structural and functional roles during the viral life-cycle, ranging from immune evasion by glycan shielding to enhancement of immune cell infection. In this review, we highlight the imperative and auxiliary roles glycans play, and how specific oligosaccharide structures facilitate these functions during viral pathogenesis.

Although the origin of COVID-19 has not been confirmed, approximately half of the early cases were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. However, the first two documented patients did not visit the seafood market. News reports, social media, and informal sources may provide information about outbreaks prior to formal notification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify early signals of pneumonia or severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) in China prior to official recognition of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 using open-source data. METHODS: To capture early reports, we searched an open source epidemic observatory, EpiWatch, for SARI or pneumonia-related illnesses in China from October 1, 2019. The searches were conducted using Google and the Chinese search engine Baidu. RESULTS: There was an increase in reports following the official notification of COVID-19 to the WHO on December 31, 2019, and a report that appeared on December 26, 2019 was retracted. A report of severe pneumonia on November 22, 2019, in Xiangyang was identified, and a potential index patient was retrospectively identified on November 17. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of reports of SARI outbreaks prior to December 31, 2019, with a retracted report on December 26, suggests media censorship, given that formal reports indicate that cases began appearing on December 8. However, the findings also support a relatively recent origin of COVID-19 in November 2019. The case reported on November 22 was transferred to Wuhan approximately one incubation period before the first identified cases on December 8; this case should be further investigated, as only half of the early cases were exposed to the seafood market in Wuhan. Another case of COVID-19 has since been retrospectively identified in Hubei on November 17, 2019, suggesting that the infection was present prior to December.","Kpozehouen, Elizabeth Benedict; Chen, Xin; Zhu, Mengyao; Macintyre, C Raina",JMIR Public Health Surveill,300,20

The bacteriophage φ6 of Pseudomonas syringae was used as a model of the COVID-19 virus because of its similar structure and safety in experiments. The apparatus consisted of a spiked, perforated stainless plate (S-PSP) linked to a direct-current voltage generator to supply negative charge to the spike tips and a vessel with water (G-water) linked to a ground line. The S-PSP and G-water surface were paralleled at a definite interval. Negative charge supplied to the spike tips positively polarised the G-water by electrostatic induction to form an electric field between them in which ionic wind and negative ions were generated. Bacteriophage-containing water was atomised with a nebuliser and introduced into the electric field. The mist particles were ionised by the negative ions and attracted to the opposite pole (G-water). This apparatus demonstrated a prominent ability to capture phage-containing mist particles of the same sizes as respiratory droplets and aerosols regardless of the phage concentration of the mist particles. The trapped phages were successfully sterilised using ozone bubbling. Thus, the present study provides an effective system for eliminating droplet transmission of viral pathogens from public spaces.","Kakutani, Koji; Matsuda, Yoshinori; Nonomura, Teruo; Takikawa, Yoshihiro; Takami, Takeshi; Toyoda, Hideyoshi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,300,14

It is unclear whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to the prototypic Wuhan-1 isolate-based vaccines will be impacted by the three B.1.427/B.1.429 S mutations: S13I, W152C and L452R. Here, we assessed neutralizing Ab responses following natural infection or mRNA vaccination using pseudoviruses expressing the wildtype or the B.1.427/B.1.429 S protein. Plasma from vaccinated or convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers, which were reduced 3-6 fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wildtype pseudoviruses. The RBD L452R mutation reduced or abolished neutralizing activity of 14 out of 35 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including three clinical-stage mAbs. Furthermore, we observed a complete loss of B.1.427/B.1.429 neutralization for a panel of mAbs targeting the N-terminal domain due to a large structural rearrangement of the NTD antigenic supersite involving an S13I-mediated shift of the signal peptide cleavage site. These data warrant closer monitoring of signal peptide variants and their involvement in immune evasion and show that Abs directed to the NTD impose a selection pressure driving SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution through conventional and unconventional escape mechanisms.","McCallum, Matthew; Bassi, Jessica; Marco, Anna De; Chen, Alex; Walls, Alexandra C.; Iulio, Julia Di; Tortorici, M.

Treg cell development and function are dependent on the transcription factor Foxp3. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR loss-of-function screen to identify Foxp3 regulators in mouse primary Treg cells. Foxp3 regulators were enriched in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF nucleosome-remodeling and SAGA chromatin-modifying complexes. Among the three SWI/SNF-related complexes, the Brd9-containing non-canonical (nc) BAF complex promoted Foxp3 expression, whereas the PBAF complex was repressive. Chemical-induced degradation of Brd9 led to reduced Foxp3 expression and reduced Treg cell function in vitro. Brd9 ablation compromised Treg cell function in inflammatory disease and tumor immunity in vivo. Furthermore, Brd9 promoted Foxp3 binding and expression of a subset of Foxp3 target genes. Our findings provide an unbiased analysis of the genetic networks regulating Foxp3 and reveal ncBAF as a target for therapeutic manipulation of Treg cell function.","Loo, Chin-San; Gatchalian, Jovylyn; Liang, Yuqiong; Leblanc, Mathias; Xie, Mingjun; Ho, Josephine; Venkatraghavan, Bhargav; Hargreaves, Diana C.; Zheng, Ye",Immunity,300,5

CoV trigger a drastic reorganization of host cell membranes to promote their replication and egression, but a detailed description of the intracellular remodeling induced by PEDV is still missing. In this study, we examined qualitatively and quantitatively, using electron microscopy, the intracellular membrane reorganization induced by PEDV over the course of an infection. With our ultrastructural approach, we reveal that, as most of CoV, PEDV initially forms double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs), which probably serve as replication/transcription platforms. Interestingly, we also found that viral particles start to form almost simultaneously in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs), which are compartments originating from the Golgi, confirming that α-CoV assemble indistinguishably in two different organelles of the secretory pathway. Moreover, PEDV virons appear to have an immature and a mature form, similar to another α-CoV the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV).

The present study begins to address this gap by (1) examining whether different forms of economic disadvantage were related to telomere length for Latina/o children and (2) determining whether parents’ nativity shapes economic disadvantage-telomere length relationships. METHODS: Data were drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a longitudinal, stratified multistage probability sample of couples and children in 20 large US cities. The sample consisted of 417 Latina/o children and their parents that were followed from birth to age 9. Ordinary least squares regressions were used to examine relationships between economic disadvantage and telomere length. RESULTS: Findings revealed that poverty status was not significantly related to telomere length, whereas some forms of material hardship were shown to play a role in the risk of premature cellular aging. More specifically, medical hardship and difficulty paying bills were associated with shorter telomere length at age 9. Results also provide minimal evidence economic disadvantage-telomere length patterns varied by parents’ nativity. Only medical hardship was related to shorter telomere length at age 9 for children with at least one foreign-born parent. CONCLUSION: Overall, results indicate that the risk of premature cellular aging depends on the measure of economic disadvantage under investigation.

At least 17 million individuals have been infected, and some countries are still battling first or second waves of the pandemic. Nucleic acid tests, especially reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have become the workhorse for early detection of COVID-19 infection. Positive controls for the molecular assays have been developed to validate each test and to provide high accuracy. However, most available positive controls require cold-chain distribution and cannot serve as full-process control. To overcome these shortcomings, we report the production of biomimetic virus-like particles (VLPs) as SARS-CoV-2 positive controls. A SARS-CoV-2 detection module for RT-PCR was encapsidated into VLPs from a bacteriophage and a plant virus. The chimeric VLPs were obtained either by in vivo reconstitution and coexpression of the target detection module and coat proteins or by in vitro assembly of purified detection module RNA sequences and coat proteins. These VLP-based positive controls mimic SARS-CoV-2 packaged ribonucleic acid (RNA) while being noninfectious. Most importantly, we demonstrated that the positive controls are scalable, stable, and can serve broadly as controls, from RNA extraction to PCR in clinical settings.","Chan, Soo Khim; Du, Pinyi; Ignacio, Caroline; Mehta, Sanjay; Newton, Isabel G.; Steinmetz, Nicole F.",ACS Nano,300,16

Although used as the standard method to screen patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection, real-time PCR has challenges in dealing with asymptomatic patients and those with an undetectable viral load. Serological tests are therefore considered potent diagnostic tools to complement real-time PCR-based diagnosis and are used for surveillance of seroprevalence in populations. However, the dynamics of the antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 currently remain to be investigated. Here, through analysis of plasma samples from 84 patients with COVID-19, we observed that the response of virus-specific antibodies against three important antigens, RBD, N and S, dynamically changed over time and reached a peak 5–8 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The antibody responses were irrespective of sex. Severe cases were found to have higher levels of antibody response, larger numbers of inflammatory cells and C-reactive protein levels. Within the mild/moderate cases, pairwise comparison indicated moderate association between anti-RBD vs. anti-N, anti-RBD vs. anti-S1S2, and anti-N vs. anti-S1S2. Furthermore, the majority of cases could achieve IgM and IgG seroconversion at 2 weeks since the disease onset. Analysis of neutralizing antibodies indicated that these responses were able to last for more than 112 days but decline significantly after the peak.

Emerging infections have the potential to cause severe human illness and death, and to spread among human populations and across geographic borders. Direct costs associated with emerging infections are often high, caused by prolonged patient management, hospitalization, and convalescence. Indirect costs are caused by absenteeism from work, death, and permanent removal from the workforce. There may be additional costs if precautionary prevention measures are required, based on the known or potential risk. These costs result from culling and prohibited trade in animals and animal-based products if infected animals are a continuing threat to humans; or from postponement or cancellation of travel and tourism if transmission in the general population is uncontrolled. Emerging infections sometimes cause panic and/or fear because of misunderstanding of the risk, and can lead to actions that result in economic loss similar to that caused by legitimate public health precautionary measures. They include reactions such as avoiding animal-based foods mistakenly thought to be the source of infection; unnecessary cancelling travel plans to avoid geographic areas where there is a perception of risk of infection; and/or unwarranted culling of animals or destruction of animal-based foods. If the misunderstanding is transmitted widely by the press or through social media networks, the negative economic impact can be amplified. Economic loss caused by these perceived risks can generally not be disentangled from the losses causes by public health measures that may be in place, but it is thought that at times they add significantly to the economic burden. The International Health Regulations (IHR) were designed to respond to the international spread of infectious disease outbreaks in a manner that prevents unnecessary negative economic impacts. Agreed by all Member States of the World Health Organization in 2005, they are a legally binding global agreement with the specific purpose of ensuring maximum security against the international spread of diseases, with a minimum interference in world traffic and trade. They reflect current understanding of infectious disease risks, especially those that emerge at the animal/human interface; the realization that infectious diseases cannot be stopped from entering countries at borders; the vast increase in access to information through the internet; and globalization that increases the speed with which infectious diseases spread. Under the IHR, countries are able to work transparently with WHO and its scientific experts and collaborating laboratories to conduct joint risk assessments of public health events such as outbreaks of infectious diseases; to make evidence-based recommendations to help prevent or control their international spread; and, by providing valid and transparent information to national focal points, to help prevent unnecessary panic and misunderstanding about risk.","Heymann, D.L.; Reinhardt, K.",Encyclopedia of Health Economics,300,20

To ensure that the undergraduate teaching curriculum does not become another victim of the virus, online teaching was started in most medical schools. The undergraduate students enrolled in our institution hail mostly from rural areas and small townships with limited internet connectivity and accessibility due to poor socioeconomic status. This study highlights the students’ perception of and motivation towards online classes in respect to internet connectivity and accessibility during COVID-19 pandemic. Since online teaching is essentially a student-centered learning approach, the motivational level of students plays an important role in making teaching protocols effective. METHODS: A prospective qualitative and quantitative assessment of perceptions of 498 medical undergraduate students from 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Vibhuti Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India was done using validated online questionnaires and anonymous voluntary feedback during the government-imposed lockdown from March 2020 to November 2020. RESULTS: On evaluation of 260 responses received, it was found that the majority of students were motivated to attend the online classes but external factors like internet connectivity and household environment were affecting their motivation on a daily basis and thus decreasing the motivation levels. Validity of feedback by Cronbach’s alpha was 0.907 and Pearson coefficient between internet connectivity and motivation factors was 0.419 (p-value <0.001). CONCLUSION: The extrinsic factors of internet connectivity and household environment hamper the motivation of students to attend online classes; this should be considered as an important factor to enable the desired student-led learning as mandated by competency-based medical education.","Dhingra, Shivani; Pasricha, Navbir; Sthapak, Eti; Bhatnagar, Rajan",Adv Med Educ Pract,300,12

Several databases have been published on this pandemic, but the research community still needs an easy way to get comprehensive information on COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 pandemic database (CO-19 PDB) aims to provide wonderful insights for COVID-19 researchers with the well-gathered of all the COVID-19 data to one platform, which is a global challenge for the research community these days. METHODS: We gathered 59 updated databases since December-2019 until May 2021 and divided them into six categories: digital image database, genomic database, literature database, visualization tools database, chemical structure database, and social science database. These categories focus on taking number of functions from the images, information from gene sequences, updates from relevant papers, essays, reports, articles, and books, the data or information in the form of maps, graphs, and charts, information of bonds between atoms, and updates about events of the physical and social environment, respectively. RESULTS: Users can search the information of interest in two ways including typing the name of the database in the search bar or by clicking the right category directly. Computer languages such as CSS, PHP, HTML, Java, etc. are utilized to construct CO-19 PDB. CONCLUSION: This article attempts to compile up-to-date appropriate COVID-19 datasets and resources that have not been compiled and given in such an accessible and user-friendly manner. As a result, the CO-19 PDB offers extensive open data sharing for both worldwide research communities and local people. Further, we have planned future development of new features, that will be awesome for future study.","Ullah, Shahid; Ullah, Anees; Rahman, Wajeeha; Ullah, Farhan; Khan, Sher Bahadar; Ahmad, Gulzar; Ijaz, Muhammad; Gao, Tianshun",Comput Methods Programs Biomed Update,300,1

These products are fragile and typically require cold chain for their delivery and storage. Delivering biologics, while maintaining the cold chain, whether standard (2°C to 8°C) or deepfreeze (as cold as -70°C), requires extensive infrastructure that is expensive to build and maintain. This poses a huge challenge to equitable healthcare delivery, especially during a global pandemic. Even when the infrastructure is in place, breaches of the cold chain are common. Such breaches may damage the product, making therapeutics and vaccines ineffective or even harmful. Rather than strengthening the cold chain through building more infrastructure and imposing more stringent guidelines, we suggest that money and effort are best spent on making the cold chain unnecessary for biologics delivery and storage. To meet this grand challenge in pharmaceutical research, we highlight areas where innovations are needed in the design, formulation and biomanufacturing of biologics, including point-of-care manufacturing and inspection. These technological innovations would rely on fundamental advances in our understanding of biomolecules and cells.","Yu, Yihua Bruce; Briggs, Katharine T.; Taraban, Marc B.; Brinson, Robert G.; Marino, John P.",Pharm Res,300,16

This review provides an update on CPV vaccine types and vaccination protocols. The design of CPV prevention strategies and vaccination programs with a goal of herd immunity has been hampered by deficiencies of studies that model companion animal viral infections and inform an understanding of the basic reproduction number. However, the most important issue in eradication of CPV disease is represented by immunisation failures including: i) the presence of interfering titres of maternally-derived antibodies; ii) the presence of non-responders; and iii) possible reversion to virulence. In contrast, the role of the CPV variants in immunisation failures is widely debated. Taking into account the reduced circulation of canine distemper virus and canine adenovirus type 1 in countries where extensive vaccination is carried out, more effort should be made to aim for CPV eradication, including antibody testing to determine the optimal time for vaccinations of pups and adults and homogeneous vaccine coverage of dog population.","Decaro, N.; Buonavoglia, C.; Barrs, V.R.",Vet Microbiol,300,3

METHODS: Data of COVID-19 patients with clinical outcome in a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, were retrospectively collected and analyzed from Jan 30 to Feb 20, 2020. The prognostic value of admission CRP was evaluated in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Out of 298 patients enrolled, 84 died and 214 recovered. Most non-survivors tended to be males, old aged, or with chronic diseases. Compared to survivors, non-survivors showed significantly elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, defined by platelet count multiply by NLR), CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer, and decreased red blood cell, lymphocyte, and platelet count. Age, neutrophil count, platelet count, and CRP were identified as independent predictors of adverse outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of CRP (0.896) was significantly higher than that of age (0.833), neutrophil count (0.820), and platelet count (0.678) in outcome prediction (all p<0.05). With a cut-off value of 41.4, CRP exhibited sensitivity 90.5%, specificity 77.6%, positive predictive value 61.3%, and negative predictive value 95.4%. Subgroup analysis revealed that CRP remained robust accuracy in adverse outcome prediction in patients with different disease severity (AUC 0.832, z=10.23, p<0.001; AUC 0.989, z=44.04, p<0.001). CRP was also an independent discriminator of severe/critical illness on admission (AUC 0.783, z=10.69, p<0.001).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: RDW was measured as a predictor along with age, sex, chronic illnesses, and BMI in logistic regressions to predict hospitalization and mortality. Hospitalization and mortality odds ratios (ORs) were estimated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RDW was evaluated separately as continuous and discrete (High RDW ≥ 14.5) variables. RESULTS: Four thousand one hundred and sixty-eight patients were included in this study, where 824 patients (19.8%) had a high RDW value ≥14.5% (High RDW: 64.7% were female, mean age 58 years [±22] vs. Normal RDW: 60.2% female, mean age 46 years [±19]). Eight hundred and twenty-nine patients had a hospitalization, where the median time between positive PCR and hospital entry was 5 [IQR 1–18] days. Models were analyzed with RDW (continuous) and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and BMI suggested an OR of 1.242 [95% CI = 1.187–2.688] for hospitalization and an OR of 2.911 [95% CI = 1.928–4.395] for mortality (p < .001). RDW (discrete) with the same adjustments presented an OR of 2.232 [95% CI = 1.853–1.300] for hospitalization and an OR of 1.263 [95% CI = 1.166–1.368] for mortality (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: High RDW values obtained from community blood tests are associated with greater odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with COVID-19. KEY MESSAGES: RDW measures before SARS-CoV-2 infection is a predictive factor for hospitalization and mortality. RDW threshold of 14.5% provides high sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 related mortality, comparatively to other blood tests. Patient records should be accessed by clinicians for prior RDW results, if available, followed by further monitoring.","Banon, Tamar; Wortsman, Joshua; Ben Moshe, Shay; Gazit, Sivan; Peretz, Asaf; Ben Tov, Amir; Chodick, Gabriel; Perez, Galit; Patalon, Tal",Ann Med,300,20

Such a traumatic stress event may also contribute to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depressive, and anxiety symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms as well as the predictive role of problematic Internet use in the above-mentioned psychological problems in university students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 8,879 students in China between April 20 and April 26, 2020. The presence of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms and problematic Internet use were evaluated using PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression 9-item scale, the generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale, and the Young diagnostic questionnaire, respectively. Sociodemographic information and the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward COVID-19 data were also collected. Results: A total of 4,834 (54.4%) participants were female, and 7,564 (85.2%) were undergraduate students. A total of 615 students (6.9%) reported PTSD symptoms; 5.2% (465) and 10.1% (896) reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The problematic Internet use was significantly associated with higher risk of PTSD, depressive, and anxiety symptoms (odds ratio 2.662 [95% CI, 2.239–3.165], odds ratio 4.582 [95% CI, 3.753–5.611], odds ratio 3.251 [95% CI, 2.814–3.757], respectively; all P < 0.001). Lower attitude and practice scores also contributed to the risk of depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Psychological problems should be paid more attention, and problematic Internet use may be a predictor when screening high-risk students for psychological problems. Our results will aid in timely psychological screening, which is meaningful in the prevention and intervention of psychological problems.","Xie, Xinyan; Zhu, Kaiheng; Xue, Qi; Zhou, Yu; Liu, Qi; Wu, Hao; Wan, Zihao; Zhang, Jiajia; Meng, Heng; Zhu, Bing; Song, Ranran",Front Public Health,300,11

We hypothesized that transcriptomic analysis would identify CLI-specific pathways, particularly in regards to fibrosis. Derivation cohort data from muscle biopsies in PAD and non-PAD (controls) was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE120642). Transcriptomic analysis indicated CLI patients (N = 16) had a unique gene expression profile, when compared with non-PAD controls (N = 15) and IC (N = 20). Ninety-eight genes differed between controls and IC, 2489 genes differed between CLI and controls, and 2783 genes differed between CLI and IC patients. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that pathways associated with TGFβ, collagen deposition, and VEGF signaling were enriched in CLI but not IC. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis of nine fibrosis core gene expression revealed the areas under the ROC (AUC) were all >0.75 for CLI. Furthermore, the fibrosis area (AUC = 0.81) and % fibrosis (AUC = 0.87) in validation cohort validated the fibrosis discrimination CLI from IC and control (all n = 12). In conclusion, transcriptomic analysis identified fibrosis pathways, including those involving TGFβ, as a novel gene expression feature for CLI but not IC. Fibrosis is an important characteristic of CLI, which we confirmed histologically, and may be a target for novel therapies in PAD.","Cong, Guangzhi; Cui, Xiangdong; Ferrari, Ricardo; Pipinos, Iraklis I.; Casale, George P.; Chattopadhyay, Ansuman; Sachdev, Ulka",J Clin Med,300,24

Methods Subjects with proven COVID 19 without hypoxemia on ambient air at presentation underwent the 1MSTS. The demographic details, clinical profile, pre and post-test vitals and pulse oximetric saturation was recorded and they were followed up for outcome throughout the hospital stay and after discharge. Results 55 mild cases of COVID-19 and 6 cases of recovering severe COVID-19 were included. The mild cohort had a median age of 35 years (IQR,27-41.5) and a median hospital stay of 16 days (IQR 14,20). The severe cohort had a median age of 47.5 years (IQR, 42.3,54.3) and median intensive care and hospital stays of respectively 9 (IQR, 7.5,9) and 23.5 (IQR, 21.5,27) days.

Clozapine intoxication, pneumonia and delirium are the main complications of COVID-19 in patients on clozapine. In order to prevent clozapine intoxication, reduction of the original dose by half is generally recommended in clozapine users who contract COVID-19. When a cytokine storm is suspected in an advanced stage of COVID-19, reduction by three quarters seems more appropriate. If COVID-19 patients on clozapine develop granulocytopenia, SARS-CoV-2, rather than clozapine, should be considered as the cause. Schizophrenia patients in general and clozapine users in particular belong to a high-risk group that warrants early vaccination on a medical indication.","Veerman, Selene R T; Bogers, Jan P A M; Cohen, Dan; Schulte, Peter F J",Pharmacopsychiatry,300,20

We analytically estimate the fraction of population, needed to be infected or immuned, to achieve herd immunity for an infection. We calculate this estimation as a function of the incubation period of the contagion, contact probability among the infected and susceptible population, and the probability of disease transmission from an infected to a susceptible individual. We show how herd immunity is strongly dependent on the incubation period, and it may be extremely difficult to achieve herd immunity in case of large incubation period. We derive the distribution of generation time from basic principles, which, by far, has been assumed in an ad hoc manner in epidemiological studies. We quantify the success probability of quarantine measures before achieving herd immunity, and discuss a novel method for designing effective quarantine measures in the absence of any pharmaceutical interventions. We also compare the effectiveness of an early imposition against a delayed imposition of lockdown, of the same duration, in mitigating infection from a population.","Nath, S. K.",,300,2

Our goal was to understand the impact of the epidemic on kidney transplantation (KT), at both the national and center‐levels, accounting statistically for waitlist composition. Using SRTR data, we compared data on observed waitlist registrations, waitlist mortality, living‐donor and deceased‐donor kidney transplants (LDKT/DDKT) March 15‐April 30, 2020 to expected events calculated from pre‐epidemic data January 2016‐February 2020. There were few changes before March 15, at which point the number of new listings/DDKT/LDKT dropped to 18%/24%/87% below the expected value (all p<0.001). Only 12 centers performed LDKT March 15‐31; by April 30, 40 centers had resumed LDKT. The decline in new listings and DDKT was greater among states with higher per capita confirmed COVID‐19 cases. The number of waitlist deaths was 2.2‐fold higher than expected in the five states with highest COVID‐19 burden (p<0.001). DCD DDKT and regional/national imports declined nationwide, but most steeply in states with the highest COVID‐19 burden. The COVID‐19 epidemic has resulted in substantial changes to KT; we must adapt and learn rapidly to continue provide safe access to transplantation and limit the growing indirect toll of an already deadly disease.","Boyarsky, Brian J.; Werbel, William A.; Durand, Christine M.; Avery, Robin K.; Jackson, Kyle R.; Kernodle, Amber B.; Snyder, Jon; Hirose, Ryutaro; Massie, Indraneel M.; Garonzik‐Wang, Jacqueline M.; Segev, Dorry L.; Massie, Allan B.",Am J Transplant,300,16

News publishers have the potential to spread their news and reach out to a large number of readers worldwide. In this paper we would like to understand how well they are doing it and which kind of obstacles the news may encounter when spreading. The news to be spread wider cross multiple barriers such as linguistic (the most evident one, as they get published in other natural languages), economic, geographical, political, time zone, and cultural barriers. Observing potential differences between spreading of news on different events published by multiple publishers can bring insights into what may influence the differences in the spreading patterns. There are multiple reasons, possibly many hidden, influencing the speed and geographical spread of news. This paper studies information cascading and propagation barriers, applying the proposed methodology on three distinctive kinds of events: Global Warming, earthquakes, and FIFA World Cup. Our findings suggest that 1) the scope of a specific event significantly effects the news spreading across languages, 2) geographical size of a news publisher’s country is directly proportional to the number of publishers and articles reporting on the same information, 3) countries with shorter time-zone differences and similar cultures tend to propagate news between each other, 4) news related to Global Warming comes across economic barriers more smoothly than news related to FIFA World Cup and earthquakes and 5) events which may in some way involve political benefits are mostly published by those publishers which are not politically neutral.","Sittar, Abdul; Mladenić, Dunja; Grobelnik, Marko",J Intell Inf Syst,300,21

The elimination plan for the disease is currently challenged by many factors including amongst others; the potential emergence of resistance to the main chemotherapeutic agent, ivermectin (IVM). Novel tools, including preventative and therapeutic vaccines, could provide additional impetus to the disease elimination tool portfolio. Several observations in both humans and animals have provided evidence for the development of both natural and artificial acquired immunity. In this study, immuno-informatics tools were applied to design a filarial-conserved multi-epitope subunit vaccine candidate, (designated Ov-DKR-2) consisting of B-and T-lymphocyte epitopes of eight immunogenic antigens previously assessed in pre-clinical studies. The high-percentage conservation of the selected proteins and epitopes predicted in related nematode parasitic species hints that the generated chimera may be instrumental for cross-protection. Bioinformatics analyses were employed for the prediction, refinement, and validation of the 3D structure of the Ov-DKR-2 chimera. In-silico immune simulation projected significantly high levels of IgG1, T-helper, T-cytotoxic cells, INF-γ, and IL-2 responses. Preliminary immunological analyses revealed that the multi-epitope vaccine candidate reacted with antibodies in sera from both onchocerciasis-infected individuals, endemic normals as well as loiasis-infected persons but not with the control sera from European individuals. These results support the premise for further characterisation of the engineered protein as a vaccine candidate for onchocerciasis.","Shey, Robert Adamu; Ghogomu, Stephen Mbigha; Shintouo, Cabirou Mounchili; Nkemngo, Francis Nongley; Nebangwa, Derrick Neba; Esoh, Kevin; Yaah, Ntang Emmaculate; Manka’aFri, Muyanui; Nguve, Joel Ebai; Ngwese, Roland Akwelle; Njume, Ferdinand Ngale; Bertha, Fru Asa; Ayong, Lawrence; Njemini, Rose; Vanhamme, Luc; Souopgui, Jacob",Pathogens,300,25

In this report, we demonstrated the use of molecular genotyping methods together with contact tracing to identify the source case, the causative outbreak strain and transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and for the definite confirmation of a suspected outbreak. Methods M. tuberculosis strains were genotyped with IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism, spacer oligonucleotide typing and minisatellite interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat methods. Clinical data and contact tracing results were collected from medical records and the National TB Registry. Results In this episode, 66 health care workers (HCWs) were notified as TB cases. A total of 18 M. tuberculosis isolates from HCWs and patients were collected. IS6110 RFLP results revealed that 9 out of 10 HCWs' and 7 out of 8 patients' isolates shared the same genotype.

The infection and death rates associated with this pandemic are strikingly variable in different countries. To elucidate this discrepancy, we analyzed 2431 early spread SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID. We estimated continental-wise admixture proportions, assessed haplotype block estimation, and tested for the presence or absence of strains’ recombination. Herein, we identified 1010 unique missense mutations and seven different SARS-CoV-2 clusters. In samples from Asia, a small haplotype block was identified, whereas samples from Europe and North America harbored large and different haplotype blocks with nonsynonymous variants. Variant frequency and linkage disequilibrium varied among continents, especially in North America. Recombination between different strains was only observed in North American and European sequences. In addition, we structurally modelled the two most common mutations, Spike_D614G and Nsp12_P314L, which suggested that these linked mutations may enhance viral entry and replication, respectively. Overall, we propose that genomic recombination between different strains may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 virulence and COVID-19 severity and may present additional challenges for current treatment regimens and countermeasures. Furthermore, our study provides a possible explanation for the substantial second wave of COVID-19 presented with higher infection and death rates in many countries.","Haddad, Dania; John, Sumi Elsa; Mohammad, Anwar; Hammad, Maha M.; Hebbar, Prashantha; Channanath, Arshad; Nizam, Rasheeba; Al-Qabandi, Sarah; Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Alshukry, Abdullah; Ali, Hamad; Thanaraj, Thangavel Alphonse; Al-Mulla, Fahd",PLoS One,300,1
680756,680756,680756,Telemedicine during COVID‐19 pandemic,18.691032,4.076899,2020-05-30,"Background Since December 2019, pneumonia associated with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged in Wuhan, China. The exponential increase of the confirmed number of cases of 2019n-CoV is of great concern to the global community. The fears and panic among residents in the epicenters have prompted diverse responses, which are understudied. During such a crisis, community trust and support for the government and health authorities are important to contain the outbreak. We aimed to investigate the influence of institutional trust on public responses to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Methods An anonymous Internet-based, cross-sectional survey was administered on January 29, 2020. The study population comprised all residents currently residing or working in the province of Hubei, where Wuhan is the capital city. The level of trust in information provision and preventive instructions, individual preventive behaviors and treatment-seeking behaviors were queried. Findings The majority of the participants expressed a great extent of trust in the information and preventive instructions provided by the central government than by the local government. A high uptake of 2019-nCoV preventive measures was found, particularly among people who had been placed under quarantine. Being under quarantine (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80 to 3.08) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.23, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.53) were both strong and significant determinants of higher preventive behavior scores. The majority of study participants (85.7%, n = 3,640) reported that they would seek hospital treatment if they suspected themselves to have been infected with 2019 n-CoV. Few of the participants from Wuhan (16.6%, n = 475) and those participants who were under quarantine (13.8%, n = 550) expressed an unwillingness to seek hospital treatment. Similarly, being under quarantine (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.80 to 3.09) and having a high institutional trust score (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.96 to 2.49) were two strong significant determinants of hospital treatment-seeking. Interpretation The results of this study suggest that institutional trust is an important factor influencing adequate preventive behavior and seeking formal medical care during an outbreak. In view of the 2019-nCoV being highly pathogenic and extremely contagious, our findings also underscore the importance of public health intervention to reach individuals with poor adherence to preventive measures and who are reluctant to seek treatment at formal health services.

Matériels et méthodes Nous avons utilisé la source de données d’IQVIA, LTD, Longitudinal Treatment Dynamics, qui comprend les données de délivrances d’un échantillon représentatif de 45 % des officines françaises. Toutes les B/TSC prescrites par les spécialités habilitées à le faire et délivrées en ville ont été prises en considération. L’impact national des renouvellements et des initiations de ces traitements a été étudié pendant la période de confinement (Semaine S12 à S19) et comparé à la même période en 2019 à partir des données de délivrance des pharmacies ayant transmis leur donnée régulièrement pendant la période d’intérêt (36 % des pharmacies françaises). Les résultats sont présentés à partir des données brutes et exprimés en pourcentage de patients ayant eu une délivrance des classes thérapeutiques d’intérêt en 2020 comparé à 2019 utilisée comme année de référence (Fig. 1). Les classes prises en considération ont été les biothérapies (anti-TNF, anti-IL6, anti-IL17, anti-IL23), les traitements synthétiques ciblés (aprélimast, inhibiteurs de JAK), ainsi que des traitements susceptibles d’être utilisés dans les MIC, à savoir les aminosalicylés, l’hydroxychloroquine et le méthotrexate. Résultats Pendant la période S12 à S19, 48341 et 53944 patients ont eu au moins une délivrance d’un B/TSC respectivement en 2019 et 2020. La période de confinement n’a pas eu d’impact sur les renouvellements de B/TSC comparés à 2019 quelque soit le type de prescripteur ou la molécule prescrite. En revanche pour les initiations, elles ont diminué pour la majorité des classes suivantes dont les anti-TNF (−31 %), les anti-IL17 (− 50 %), les anti-IL23 (−12 %) et les TSC (−42 %) sauf pour les ant-IL6 (+152 %, augmentation concernant exclusivement le tocilizumab).

CARE’s Tipping Point Initiative (TPI) addresses the causes of CEFM by challenging repressive gender norms and inequalities. The TPI engages different participant groups on programmatic topics and supports community dialogue to build girls’ agency, shift inequitable power relations, and change community norms sustaining CEFM. METHODS/ANALYSIS: The Nepal TPI impact evaluation has an integrated, mixed-methods design. The quantitative evaluation is a three-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial (control; Tipping Point Programme (TPP); TPP+ with emphasised social norms change). Fifty-four clusters of ~200 households were selected from two districts (27:27) with probability proportional to size and randomised. A household census ascertained eligible study participants, including unmarried girls and boys 12–16 years (1242:1242) and women and men 25+ years (270:270). Baseline participation was 1134 girls, 1154 boys, 270 women and 270 men. Questionnaires covered agency; social networks/norms; and discrimination/violence. Thirty in-depth interviews, 8 key-informant interviews and 32 focus group discussions were held across eight TPP/TPP+ clusters. Guides covered gender roles/aspirations; marriage decisions; girls’ safety/mobility; collective action; perceived shifts in child marriage; and norms about girls. Monitoring involves qualitative interviews, focus groups and session/event observations over two visits. Qualitative analyses follow a modified grounded theory approach. Quantitative analyses apply intention to treat, regression-based difference-in-difference strategies to assess impacts on primary (married, marriage hazard) and secondary outcomes, targeted endline tracing and regression-based methods to address potential selection bias.

This study aimed to investigate QTc interval and ventricular repolarization dispersion changes, as markers of arrhythmia risks, after HCQ/CQ administration with/without azithromycin (AZT) during COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed in two academic hospitals in Indonesia. Adult patients who received HCQ/CQ alone and HCQ/CQ + AZT concomitant treatments for COVID‐19 infection were enrolled. Baseline and post HCQ/CQ treatment electrocardiograms were obtained. Baseline and post HCQ/CQ treatment QT interval by Bazett (B‐QTc) and Fridericia (F‐QTc) formulas and ventricular repolarization dispersion indices by Tpeak‐Tend (Tp‐e) interval and Tpeak‐Tend/QT (Tp‐e/QT) ratio were calculated and analyzed. RESULTS: The study enrolled 55 (HCQ/CQ alone) and 77 subjects (HCQ/CQ + AZT concomitant). F‐QTc interval significantly lengthened in subjects with HCQ/CQ + AZT (mean difference 11.89 ms [P = .028]). The incidences of severe B‐QTc and F‐QTc lengthening were 13.1% and 12.3%, B‐QTc and F‐QTc prolongation were 25.4% and 12.3%, and severe B‐QTc and F‐QTc prolongation were 6.2% and 3.2%. Tp‐e interval lengthened significantly from baseline to posttreatment in HCQ/CQ alone and HCQ/CQ + AZT (mean difference 10.83 ms [P = .006] and 18.73 ms [P < .001], respectively). Tp‐e/QT ratio increased significantly from baseline to posttreatment in HCQ/CQ + AZT concomitant (mean difference 0.035 [P < .001]). No fatal arrhytmia occurred. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID‐19 pandemic, HCQ/CQ + AZT concomitant treatment caused significant F‐QTc lengthening, significantly increased Tp‐e interval and increased Tp‐e/QT ratio.

Viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) frequently causes adult hospitalization and is linked to antibiotic overuse. European studies suggest that the serum procalcitonin (PCT) level may be used to guide antibiotic therapy. We conducted a trial assessing the feasibility of using PCT algorithms with viral testing to guide antibiotic use in a US hospital. Methods. Three hundred patients hospitalized with nonpneumonic LRTI during October 2013–April 2014 were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to receive standard care or PCT-guided care and viral PCR testing. The primary outcome was antibiotic exposure, and safety was assessed at 1 and 3 months. Results. Among the 151 patients in the intervention group, viruses were identified in 42% (63), and 83% (126) had PCT values of <0.25 µg/mL. There were no significant differences in antibiotic use or adverse events between intervention patients and those in the nonintervention group. Subgroup analyses revealed fewer subjects with positive results of viral testing and low PCT values who were discharged receiving antibiotics (20% vs 45%; P = .002) and shorter antibiotic durations among algorithm-adherent intervention patients versus nonintervention patients (2.0 vs 4.0 days; P = .004). Compared with historical controls (from 2008–2011), antibiotic duration in nonintervention patients decreased by 2 days (6.0 vs 4.0 days; P < .001), suggesting a study effect. Conclusions. Although antibiotic use was similar in the 2 arms, subgroup analyses of intervention patients suggest that physicians responded to viral and biomarker data. These data can inform the design of future US studies. Clinical Trials Registration.

Antibody drugs present an effective weapon for tens of millions of COVID-19 patients. Antibodies disrupting the interactions between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) effectively block SARS-CoV-2 cell entry into host cells. In order to rapidly develop more potent neutralizing antibodies, we utilized virtual scanning mutageneses and molecular dynamics simulations to optimize the antibody of P2B-2F6 isolated from single B cells of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Two potent P2B-2F6 mutants, namely H:V106R and H:V106R/H:P107Y, were found to possess higher binding affinities with the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 than others. Polar interactions are preferred near 106 and 107 paratope residues of the heavy chain. The mutations also increase the hydrogen-bonding network formed between the antibody and the RBD. Notably, the optimized antibodies possess potential neutralizing activity against the alarming SARS-CoV-2 variant of N501Y. This study provides insights into structure-based optimization of antibodies with higher affinity to the antigen. We hope that our proposed antibody mutants could contribute to the development of improved therapies against COVID-19.","Chen, Jiao; Wu, Fei; Lin, Dan; Kong, Weikang; Cai, Xueting; Yang, Jie; Sun, Xiaoyan; Cao, Peng",Comput Biol Med,300,20

It led to the use of search query data from search engines such as Google and Yahoo! as an indicator of when and where influenza was occurring. This methodology has subsequently been extended to other diseases and has led to experimentation with new types of social media for disease surveillance. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review was to formally assess the current state of knowledge regarding the use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance in order to inform future work on early detection and more effective mitigation of the effects of foodborne illness. METHODS: Structured scoping review methods were used to identify, characterize, and evaluate all published primary research, expert review, and commentary articles regarding the use of social media in surveillance of infectious diseases from 2002-2011. RESULTS: Thirty-two primary research articles and 19 reviews and case studies were identified as relevant. Most relevant citations were peer-reviewed journal articles (29/32, 91%) published in 2010-11 (28/32, 88%) and reported use of a Google program for surveillance of influenza. Only four primary research articles investigated social media in the context of foodborne disease or gastroenteritis. Most authors (21/32 articles, 66%) reported that social media-based surveillance had comparable performance when compared to an existing surveillance program. The most commonly reported strengths of social media surveillance programs included their effectiveness (21/32, 66%) and rapid detection of disease (21/32, 66%). The most commonly reported weaknesses were the potential for false positive (16/32, 50%) and false negative (11/32, 34%) results. Most authors (24/32, 75%) recommended that social media programs should primarily be used to support existing surveillance programs. CONCLUSIONS: The use of search queries and social media for disease surveillance are relatively recent phenomena (first reported in 2006). Both the tools themselves and the methodologies for exploiting them are evolving over time. While their accuracy, speed, and cost compare favorably with existing surveillance systems, the primary challenge is to refine the data signal by reducing surrounding noise. Further developments in digital disease surveillance have the potential to improve sensitivity and specificity, passively through advances in machine learning and actively through engagement of users. Adoption, even as supporting systems for existing surveillance, will entail a high level of familiarity with the tools and collaboration across jurisdictions.","Bernardo, Theresa Marie; Rajic, Andrijana; Young, Ian; Robiadek, Katie; Pham, Mai T; Funk, Julie A",J Med Internet Res,300,11

Legal requirements for minimum volumes and the expansion of quality contracts between cost units and hospitals as well as the use of quality indicators relevant to planning for demand-oriented and quality-oriented further development of inpatient care will increase competition in the quality of care between hospitals. The topic of development and definition of quality in medicine was also comprehensively addressed by the Association of Rheumatological Acute Care Clinics (VRA) shortly after its foundation in 1998. At the center of acute inpatient quality management are binding structural criteria linked to the continuous outcome benchmarking in acute rheumatology care (KOBRA) project launched in 2003 in rheumatology (and continuously implemented to date) measuring process and outcome quality. Based on this framework (fulfillment of the structural quality and participation in the KOBRA project) successfully participating rheumatology units can acquire the KOBRA seal of approval for 2 years at a time, which is awarded by the project management, the aQua Institute. The outstanding position of the project is exemplified by data evaluation on treatment change in active rheumatoid arthritis, diagnosis confirmation of connective tissue diseases and vasculitis during the inpatient stay as well as on participatory decision-making processes concerning rheumatoid arthritis (referring to the results of the data collection period 2018). By anchoring projects for structural, process and outcome quality acute inpatient rheumatology is well prepared for the paradigm shift demanded by health policies. Additionally, the KOBRA project is a good prerequisite to meet the requirements concerning quality management fixed in the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) guidelines for recognition as a rheumatology center.","Lakomek, H.-J.; Rudwaleit, M.; Hentschel, A.; Broge, B.; Abrolat, J.; Bessler, F.; Hellmich, B.; Klemann, A.; Krause, A.; Klass, M.; Strunk, J.; Fiori, W.; Roeder, N.; Braun, J.",Z Rheumatol,300,16

Amid growing concerns regarding an “infodemic”, ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating if and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked: which sources informed Wikipedia’s COVID-19-related articles before and during the pandemic’s first wave (January-May 2020). Results We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media sources and high-quality academic research. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how preexisting articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this “scientific infrastructure” facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Lastly, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the shifting landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 vaccine development. Conclusions Understanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its “citizen encyclopedists”, it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.","Benjakob, Omer; Aviram, Rona; Sobel, Jonathan",bioRxiv,300,20

Interpersonal social support is protective for health, particularly during stress, and may be particularly beneficial for individuals who experienced childhood abuse. OBJECTIVE: Investigate whether childhood abuse predicts levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and test whether the perceived availability of social companionship preceding the pandemic moderates this relationship. METHODS: During Phase 1, adults (N = 120; Age M[SD] = 19.4 [0.94]) completed a retrospective measure of childhood adversity along with a measure of perceived availability of opportunities for social engagement immediately preceding the pandemic. Two weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, participants completed the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the pandemic. Hierarchical linear regression analyses examined the interaction between childhood abuse and the perceived availability of social companionship preceding the pandemic as a predictor of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Adjusting for covariates, the interaction between childhood abuse and perceived availability of others to engage with before the onset of the pandemic was a significant predictor of IES-hyperarousal (β = −0.19, t = −2.06, p = 0.04, ΔR(2) = 0.032, CI: [−0.31 to −0.01]). CONCLUSION: Levels of perceived opportunities for social companionship before the pandemic associates with levels of hyperarousal related to the pandemic, particularly for individuals who experienced high levels of childhood abuse. More research is needed to understand how to mitigate the higher levels of distress related to the pandemic for these individuals in order to reduce risk for future psychiatric disorders.","John-Henderson, Neha A.; Counts, Cory J.; Ginty, Annie T.",Front Psychol,300,24

Several non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 proteins have generated multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. In our previous report, we have shown an evenly uneven distribution of unique protein variants of SARS-CoV-2 is geo-location or demography-specific. However, the correlation between the demographic transmutability of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and mutations in various proteins remains unknown due to hidden symmetry/asymmetry in the occurrence of mutations. This study tracked how these mutations are emerging in SARS-CoV-2 proteins in six model countries and globally. In a geo-location, considering the mutations having a frequency of detection of at least five hundred in each SARS-CoV-2 protein; we studied the country-wise percentage of invariant residues. Our data revealed that since October 2020, highly frequent mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed mostly in the Open Reading Frames (ORF) 7b and ORF8, worldwide. No such highly frequent mutations in any of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins were found in the UK, India, and Brazil, which does not correlate with the degree of transmissibility of the virus in India and Brazil. However, we have found a signature that SARS-CoV-2 proteins were evolving at a higher rate, and considering global data, mutations are detected in the majority of the available amino acid locations. Fractal analysis of each protein's normalized factor time series showed a periodically aperiodic emergence of dominant variants for SARS-CoV-2 protein mutations across different countries. It was noticed that certain high-frequency variants have emerged in the last couple of months, and thus the emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains are expected to contain prevalent mutations in ORF3a, membrane, and ORF8 proteins. In contrast to other beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 variants have rapidly emerged based on demographically dependent mutations. Characterization of the periodically aperiodic nature of the demographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants in various countries can contribute to the identification of the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Hassan, Sk Sarif; Basu, Pallab; Redwan, Elrashdy M.; Lundstrom, Kenneth; Choudhury, Pabitra Pal; Serrano-Aroca, Angel; Azad, Gajendra Kumar; Aljabali, Alaa A.A.; Palu, Giorgio; El-Aziz, Tarek Mohamed Abd; Barh, Debmalya; Uhal, Bruce D.; Adadi, Parise; Takayama, Kazuo; Bazan, Nicolas G.; Tambuwala, Murtaza; Lal, Amos; Chauhan, Gaurav; Baetas-da-Cruz, Wagner; Sherchan, Samendra P.; Uversky, Vladimir N.",Environ Res,300,1

The high prevalence of this disease is mostly ascribed to the rapid development of drug resistance to the current anti-TB drugs, exacerbated by lack of patient adherence due to drug toxicity. The aforementioned highlights the urgent need for new anti-TB compounds with different antimycobacterial mechanisms of action to those currently being used. An N-alkyl quinolone; decoquinate derivative RMB041, has recently shown promising antimicrobial activity against Mtb, while also exhibiting low cytotoxicity and excellent pharmacokinetic characteristics. Its exact mechanism of action, however, is still unknown. Considering this, we used GCxGC-TOFMS and well described metabolomic approaches to analyze and compare the metabolic alterations of Mtb treated with decoquinate derivative RMB041 by comparison to non-treated Mtb controls. The most significantly altered pathways in Mtb treated with this drug include fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glycerol metabolism, and the urea cycle. These changes support previous findings suggesting this drug acts primarily on the cell wall and secondarily on the DNA metabolism of Mtb. Additionally, we identified metabolic changes suggesting inhibition of protein synthesis and a state of dormancy.","Knoll, Kirsten E.; Lindeque, Zander; Adeniji, Adetomiwa A.; Oosthuizen, Carel B.; Lall, Namrita; Loots, Du Toit",Antibiotics (Basel),300,15

This study presents the first investigation of how HVAC (heating, ventilation, air‐conditioning) operating conditions influence the dissemination of fluorescent tracer particles released in a BCU. Test conditions included normal HVAC operation and exhaust failure resulting in loss of negative pressure. A suspension of optical brightener powder and water was nebulized to produce fluorescent particles simulating droplet nuclei (0.5‐5 μm). Airborne particle number concentrations were monitored by Instantaneous Biological Analyzers and Collectors (FLIR Systems). During normal HVAC operation, fluorescent tracer particles were contained in the isolation room (average concentration = 1 × 10(4) ± 3 × 10(3)/L(air)). Under exhaust failure, the automated HVAC system maximizes airflow into areas adjacent to isolation rooms to attempt to maintain negative pressure differential. However, 6% of the fluorescent particles were transported through cracks around doors/door handles out of the isolation room via airflow alone and not by movement of personnel or doors. Overall, this study provides a systematic method for evaluating capabilities to contain aerosolized particles during various HVAC scenarios.

Here we present key position statements including observations about the pathophysiology of (ARF). In terms of the pathophysiology of pulmonary infection with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 can be divided into 3 phases. Pulmonary damage in advanced COVID-19 often differs from the known changes in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Two types (type L and type H) are differentiated, corresponding to early- and late-stage lung damage. This differentiation should be taken into consideration in the respiratory support of ARF. The assessment of the extent of ARF should be based on arterial or capillary blood gas analysis under room air conditions, and it needs to include the calculation of oxygen supply (measured from the variables of oxygen saturation, hemoglobin level, the corrected values of Hüfner's factor, and cardiac output). Aerosols can cause transmission of infectious, virus-laden particles. Open systems or vented systems can increase the release of respirable particles. Procedures in which the invasive ventilation system must be opened and endotracheal intubation carried out are associated with an increased risk of infection. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should have top priority because fear of contagion should not be a primary reason for intubation. Based on the current knowledge, inhalation therapy, nasal high-flow therapy (NHF), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), or noninvasive ventilation (NIV) can be performed without an increased risk of infection to staff if PPE is provided. A significant proportion of patients with ARF present with relevant hypoxemia, which often cannot be fully corrected, even with a high inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) under NHF. In this situation, the oxygen therapy can be escalated to CPAP or NIV when the criteria for endotracheal intubation are not met. In ARF, NIV should be carried out in an intensive care unit or a comparable setting by experienced staff. Under CPAP/NIV, a patient can deteriorate rapidly. For this reason, continuous monitoring and readiness for intubation are to be ensured at all times. If the ARF progresses under CPAP/NIV, intubation should be implemented without delay in patients who do not have a “do not intubate” order.","Pfeifer, Michael; Ewig, Santiago; Voshaar, Thomas; Randerath, Winfried Johannes; Bauer, Torsten; Geiseler, Jens; Dellweg, Dominic; Westhoff, Michael; Windisch, Wolfram; Schönhofer, Bernd; Kluge, Stefan; Lepper, Philipp M.",Respiration,300,20

The debate revolves around two views: those who believe that priority for scarce resources should primarily aim at saving the most lives (SML) or at saving the most life-years, and those who believe that public health should focus on health equity to address health disparities and social determinants of health. I argue that maximizing medical outcomes by saving the greatest number of patients is not a plausible strategy for combating COVID-19. There are reasons of fairness to give each patient who can meet general eligibility requirements a chance of being saved. Rather than focusing on outcome maximization, a better solution would be the individualist lottery that takes account of probability of survival and duration of treatment. Although the individualist lottery allocates scarce resources in a fair way that is responsive to health equity concerns, it still gives considerable weight to the concern of SML. Thus, this procedure can be reasonably accepted by all key stakeholders.","Wang, Xueshi",Bioethics,300,6
