508,Role of glutathione in immunity and inflammation in the lung,2011-01-25,"Reactive oxygen species and thiol antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), regulate innate immunity at various levels. This review outlines the redox-sensitive steps of the cellular mechanisms implicated in inflammation and host defense against infection, and describes how GSH is not only important as an antioxidant but also as a signaling molecule. There is an extensive literature of the role of GSH in immunity. Most reviews are biased by an oversimplified picture where “bad” free radicals cause all sorts of diseases and “good” antioxidants protect from them and prevent oxidative stress. While this may be the case in certain fields (eg, toxicology), the role of thiols (the topic of this review) in immunity certainly requires wearing scientist’s goggles and being prepared to accept a more complex picture. This review aims at describing the role of GSH in the lung in the context of immunity and inflammation. The first part summarizes the history and basic concepts of this picture. The second part focuses on GSH metabolism/levels in pathology, the third on the role of GSH in innate immunity and inflammation, and the fourth gives 4 examples describing the importance of GSH in the response to infections.","Ghezzi, Pietro",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048347/,203
2628,DNA methylation signatures in peripheral blood strongly predict all-cause mortality,2017-03-17,"DNA methylation (DNAm) has been revealed to play a role in various diseases. Here we performed epigenome-wide screening and validation to identify mortality-related DNAm signatures in a general population-based cohort with up to 14 years follow-up. In the discovery panel in a case-cohort approach, 11,063 CpGs reach genome-wide significance (FDR<0.05). 58 CpGs, mapping to 38 well-known disease-related genes and 14 intergenic regions, are confirmed in a validation panel. A mortality risk score based on ten selected CpGs exhibits strong association with all-cause mortality, showing hazard ratios (95% CI) of 2.16 (1.10–4.24), 3.42 (1.81–6.46) and 7.36 (3.69–14.68), respectively, for participants with scores of 1, 2–5 and 5+ compared with a score of 0. These associations are confirmed in an independent cohort and are independent from the ‘epigenetic clock'. In conclusion, DNAm of multiple disease-related genes are strongly linked to mortality outcomes. The DNAm-based risk score might be informative for risk assessment and stratification.","Zhang, Yan; Wilson, Rory; Heiss, Jonathan; Breitling, Lutz P.; Saum, Kai-Uwe; Schöttker, Ben; Holleczek, Bernd; Waldenberger, Melanie; Peters, Annette; Brenner, Hermann",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357865/,203
3092,Chinese research into severe ulcerative colitis has increased in quantity and complexity,2018-03-16,"AIM: To investigate the current state of research output from Chinese studies into severe ulcerative colitis (SUC) using a bibliometric analysis of publications. METHODS: The contents of the Chinese periodical databases WANFANG, VIP, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for all papers regarding UC or SUC published in last the 15 years (from 2001 to 2015). The number of publications in each year was recorded to assess the temporal trends of research output. All SUC related publications were downloaded and the complexity of this research was evaluated with methods described previously. The number of patients with SUC reported each year was recorded and their clinical characteristics were analyzed using information available in the relevant papers. RESULTS: There were 13499 publications regarding UC published in Chinese medical journals between 2001 and 2015, of which 201 focused on SUC. The number of publications increased rapidly with more than half of all papers being published in the most recent 5-year period. There was a significant increase in analytical studies and clinical trials over the study period (P < 0.01), with research into the management of SUC, included pharmacotherapy, nutrition support as well as surgery, predominating. Almost half (46.2%) of the observational analytical studies and clinical trials focused on Traditional Chinese Medicine, with little research on the efficacy of cyclosporin and infliximab in disease management. About 6222 patients with SUC were reported in the 201 SUC relevant papers, with a ratio of male/female of 1.38. The number of patients reported in each 5-year period significantly increased. The colectomy rate and short-term mortality rate were 7.7% and 0.8% respectively. The most commonly employed operation was total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. CONCLUSION: The output and complexity of research related to SUC in China increased significantly over the previous 15 years, however few of these studies focused on salvage therapy.","Luo, Cheng-Xin; Wen, Zhong-Hui; Zhen, Yu; Wang, Zhu-Jun; Mu, Jing-Xi; Zhu, Min; Ouyang, Qin; Zhang, Hu",World J Clin Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5852397/,203
4509,Elderly versus non-elderly patients undergoing surgery for left-sided native valve infective endocarditis: A 10-year institutional experience,2020-02-14,"The situation of drug resistance has become more complicated due to the scarcity of plant resistance genes, and overcoming this challenge is imperative. Isatis indigotica has been used for the treatment of wounds, viral infections, and inflammation for centuries. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in all classes of life ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. To identify AMPs, I. indigotica was explored using a novel, sensitive, and high-throughput Bacillus subtilis screening system. We found that IiR515 and IiR915 exhibited significant antimicrobial activities against a variety of bacterial (Xanthomonas oryzae, Ralstonia solanacearum, Clavibacter michiganensis, and C. fangii) and fungal (Phytophthora capsici and Botrytis cinerea) pathogens. Scanning electron microscope and cytometric analysis revealed the possible mechanism of these peptides, which was to target and disrupt the bacterial cell membrane. This model was also supported by membrane fluidity and electrical potential analyses. Hemolytic activity assays revealed that these peptides may act as a potential source for clinical medicine development. In conclusion, the plant-derived novel AMPs IiR515 and IiR915 are effective biocontrol agents and can be used as raw materials in the drug discovery field.","Wu, Jia; Abbas, Hafiz Muhammad Khalid; Li, Jiale; Yuan, Yuan; Liu, Yunjun; Wang, Guoying; Dong, Wubei",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7023251/,203
6800,Prevention and management of oral infections in cancer patients,1999,"BACKGROUND: General surgeons are frequently confronted with colorectal diseases in their daily practice, whereby colorectal cancer is the second most common malignant tumour, with almost 5000 new cases every year in Austria. The incidence of benign colon disorders requiring surgery (e.g. colon polyps, sigmoid diverticulitis) is also increasing. The first aim in colon surgery should be to avoid complications and if they occur to treat them properly. METHODS: We basically distinguish between general and special complications. As general complications, prevention of malnutrition and support of the immune system should receive special attention. As the number of elderly patients increases, so does the risk not only of thrombembolic complications but also of critical cardiocirculatory situations, and renal and hepatic failure. Special complications depend either on the type of surgery (laparoscopic assisted, conventional open surgery) or the techniques employed (stapled, hand sutured). Handling of the tissue also plays a major role (e.g. dry versus wet pads). RESULTS: Shortening of the postoperative stay decreases both hospital costs and the incidence of infections, meaning that minimally invasive surgery and postoperative ""fast track nutrition"" should be promoted. Emergency operations should be avoided (e.g. bridging through colonic stents), as morbidity and mortality are clearly increased in comparison to (semi-) elective operations. During the operation itself, new equipment and techniques (such as Ultracision(®), Ligasure(®)) as well as a well coordinated team help to reduce complications and duration of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: To avoid is better than to repair. If complications do occur, appropriate surgical and intensive – care measures should be taken immediately.","Gmeiner, M.; Pfeifer, J.",Eur Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102154/,203
7071,And Why So Great a “No?”: The Donor and Academic Communities' Failure to Confront Global Chronic Disease,2016-12-08,Patients with immunodeficiency and/or under immunosuppressive therapy have an increased risk of complications due to infectious diseases. After solid organ transplantation infections are the second most common cause of death. Prophylactic measures should therefore routinely be carried out. Infections in immunosuppressed patients may be associated with atypical clinical symptoms making the diagnosis and therapy a challenge for the treating physician. Viral and opportunistic infections in particular can be a therapeutic pitfall. A careful surveillance of the patient with respect to infectious diseases is essential in order to be able to make an early diagnosis and initiate appropriate measures.,"Guberina, H.; Sava, M.; Witzke, O.",Nephrologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7104138/,203
7985,Infrastructure and Organization of Adult Intensive Care Units in Resource-Limited Settings,2019-02-09,"Vaccines against viral disease have traditionally relied on attenuated virus strains or inactivation of infectious virus. Subunit vaccines based on viral proteins expressed in heterologous systems have been effective for some pathogens, but have often suffered from poor immunogenicity due to incorrect protein folding or modification. In this chapter we focus on a specific class of viral subunit vaccine that mimics the overall structure of virus particles and thus preserves the native antigenic conformation of the immunogenic proteins. These virus-like particles (VLPs) have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses, and have unique advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches. With new VLP vaccines for papillomavirus beginning to reach the market place we argue that this technology has now ‘come-of-age’ and must be considered a viable vaccine strategy.","Roy, Polly; Noad, Rob",Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7124136/,203
10226,Treatment of idiopathic spasmodic torticollis with botulinum‐A toxin: a pilot study of 19 patients,1990-05-01,"Recent studies have demonstrated that rhinovirus infections can be prevented in the family setting through use of intranasal interferon sprays which are commenced when another family member develops a cold. One hundred and twenty‐seven children aged 4–9 years who had been hospitalized during their first year of life for severe infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus were studied virologically and epidemiologically during a seven‐month period which included the winter months. The hypothesis was that a significant part of their respiratory morbidity would be preventable by a contact prophylaxis approach using intranasal interferon. However, the findings suggest that a preventive approach of this kind would not substantially reduce the burden of respiratory illness in these children because: the target children themselves more often introduced illness into the family than did other household members; rhinovirus infections preventable by interferon were associated with little lower respiratory morbidity; and rhinoviruses were minor contributors to the total respiratory illness burden in these respiratory illness‐prone children.","Douglas, Robert M; Moore, Brian; Miles, Helen B; Pinnock, Carole B",Med J Aust,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168430/,203
10617,Compliance in teenagers with coeliac disease—a Swedish follow‐up study,2008-01-21,Endemism in Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest: alternative hypotheseS. Evidence is presented which suggests that hypotheses presented by Kirkpatrick & Brown relating to endemic species in Tasmania are either invalid or of limited importance for woody rainforest species. In their place three hypotheses are presented to account for the presence of endemic species in Tasmanian cool temperate rainforest on the basis of the fossil record and the distribution of species which are closely related to the endemics. The first two hypotheses relate to the presence of the endemic species in the general Tasmanian region. They are: 1.. Some species evolved in southeastern Australia during the Tertiary in response to the changing climate. Some of the ancestral species still occur in temperate rainforest at lower latitudes in Australia. 2.. Some species have remained essentially unchanged in Tasmania during the Tertiary and Quaternary climatic changes. The third hypothesis relates to the restriction of these cool temperate rainforest species to Tasmania: 1.. Post‐glacial climatic changes (especially a decrease in rainfall) and the human influence (especially land clearing and fire) may have combined to eliminate some cool temperate rainforest species from mainland Australia.,"HILL, ROBERT S.; READ, JENNIFER",Bot J Linn Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188341/,203
11261,Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene variants in children and adolescents having familial early-onset obesity: genetic and clinical characteristics,2020-03-18,"PURPOSE: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato is a widespread zoonotic disease of global concern. In Nigeria, the exact picture/status of CE is unclear, as most of the states are largely uninvestigated. Yet, as with every parasitic zoonosis, the first step towards planning a comprehensive management and control programme involves assessment of available national/regional prevalence data, host range, and risk factors at play in the transmission dynamics. METHODS: Published articles on echinococcosis were searched on PubMed and Africa Journal Online (AJOL) databases. Inclusion criteria were based on studies reporting prevalence of echinococcosis in animals and humans (including case reports) from 1970 to 2018. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated and summarized cystic echinococcosis reports in Nigeria and found that post 1970–80s, studies on cystic echinococcosis have remained sparse regardless of the high prevalence recorded in the early years of CE investigation. In addition, information on the genetic population structure and the role of wildlife in CE transmission is still lacking. CONCLUSIONS: This study appraises the prevalence and distribution of CE in Nigeria and identified areas where surveillance and control efforts should be focused and intensified.","Ohiolei, John Asekhaen; Yan, Hong-Bin; Li, Li; Zhu, Guo-Qiang; Muku, Rosline James; Wu, Yan-Tao; Jia, Wan-Zhong",Acta Parasitol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223537/,203
11388,The FASILA Score: A Novel Bio-Clinical Score to Predict Massive Blood Transfusion in Patients with Abdominal Trauma,2019-11-20,"PURPOSE: Patients with thoracic trauma are presumed to be at higher risk for pulmonary dysfunction, but adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may develop in any patient, regardless of associated chest injury. This study evaluated the impact of thoracic trauma and pulmonary failure on outcomes in trauma patients admitted to the intensive-care unit (ICU). METHODS: All trauma patients admitted to the ICU over an 8-year period were identified. Patients that died within 48 h of arrival were excluded. Patients were stratified by baseline characteristics, injury severity, development of ARDS, and infectious complications. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine variables significantly associated with the development of ARDS. RESULTS: 10,362 patients were identified. After exclusions, 4898 (50%) patients had chest injury and 4975 (50%) did not. 200 (2%) patients developed ARDS (3.6% of patients with chest injury and 0.5% of patients without chest injury). Patients with ARDS were more likely to have chest injury than those without ARDS (87% vs 49%, p < 0.001). However, of the patients without chest injury, the development of ARDS still led to a significant increase in mortality compared to those patients without ARDS (58% vs 5%, p < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression found ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) to be the only independent predictor for the development of ARDS in ICU patients without chest injury. CONCLUSIONS: ARDS development was more common in patients with thoracic trauma. Nevertheless, the development of ARDS in patients without chest injury was associated with a tenfold higher risk of death. The presence of VAP was found to be the only potentially preventable and treatable risk factor for the development of ARDS in ICU patients without chest injury.","Huang, Xin; Magnotti, Louis J.; Fabian, Timothy C.; Croce, Martin A.; Sharpe, John P.",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223815/,203
14677,Exercise efficacy and prescription during treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a systematic review,2021-01-09,"Anthropogenic combustion-derived water (CDW) may accumulate in an airshed due to stagnant air, which may further enhance the formation of secondary aerosols and worsen air quality. Here we collected three-winter-season, hourly resolution, water-vapor stable H and O isotope compositions together with atmospheric physical and chemical data from the city of Xi’an, located in the Guanzhong Basin (GZB) in northwestern China, to elucidate the role of CDW in particulate pollution. Based on our experimentally determined water vapor isotope composition of the CDW for individual and weighted fuels in the basin, we found that CDW constitutes 6.2% of the atmospheric moisture on average and its fraction is positively correlated with [PM(2.5)] (concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) as well as relative humidity during the periods of rising [PM(2.5)]. Our modeling results showed that CDW added additional average 4.6 μg m(−3) PM(2.5) during severely polluted conditions in the GZB, which corresponded to an average 5.1% of local anthropogenic [PM(2.5)] (average at ∼91.0 μg m(−3)). Our result is consistent with the proposed positive feedback between the relative humidity and a moisture sensitive air-pollution condition, alerting to the nontrivial role of CDW when considering change of energy structure such as a massive coal-to-gas switch in household heating in winter.","Xing, Meng; Liu, Weiguo; Li, Xia; Zhou, Weijian; Wang, Qiyuan; Tian, Jie; Li, Xiaofei; Tie, Xuexi; Li, Guohui; Cao, Junji; Bao, Huiming; An, Zhisheng",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7777102/,203

16147,The use of wearable/portable digital sensors in Huntington's disease: A systematic review,2021-02-11,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In this study, we investigated and boosted the pro-apoptotic and pro-differentiating activity of MEDS433 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MEDS433 is an inhibitor of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase, a fundamental enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. We discovered that MEDS433 alone and in combination with classical antileukemic agents had a good apoptotic activity, but it could be reduced in vivo due to the physiological presence of uridine. On the contrary, the combination of MEDS433 and dipyridamole, a blocker of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, induced metabolic lethality and myeloid differentiation in all our AML models, while being characterized by a limited toxicity on non-AML cells. ABSTRACT: Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a key enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, whose inhibition can induce differentiation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DHODH inhibitors had shown promising in vitro and in vivo activity on solid tumors, but their effectiveness was not confirmed in clinical trials, probably because cancer cells exploited the pyrimidine salvage pathway to survive. Here, we investigated the antileukemic activity of MEDS433, the DHODH inhibitor developed by our group, against AML. Learning from previous failures, we mimicked human conditions (performing experiments in the presence of physiological uridine plasma levels) and looked for synergic combinations to boost apoptosis, including classical antileukemic drugs and dipyridamole, a blocker of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. MEDS433 induced apoptosis in multiple AML cell lines, not only as a consequence of differentiation, but also directly. Its combination with antileukemic agents further increased the apoptotic rate, but when experiments were performed in the presence of physiological uridine concentrations, results were less impressive. Conversely, the combination of MEDS433 with dipyridamole induced metabolic lethality and differentiation in all AML cell lines; this extraordinary synergism was confirmed on AML primary cells with different genetic backgrounds and was unaffected by physiological uridine concentrations, predicting in human activity.","Gaidano, Valentina; Houshmand, Mohammad; Vitale, Nicoletta; Carrà, Giovanna; Morotti, Alessandro; Tenace, Valerio; Rapelli, Stefania; Sainas, Stefano; Pippione, Agnese Chiara; Giorgis, Marta; Boschi, Donatella; Lolli, Marco Lucio; Cilloni, Daniela; Cignetti, Alessandro; Saglio, Giuseppe; Circosta, Paola",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7957697/,203

17121,Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) as a biomarker of COPD,2021-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Surviving critical illness often creates a lasting psychological impact, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Memories of frightening and delusional experiences are the largest potentially modifiable risk factor, but currently, there is no proven intervention to improve these inciting factors. Psychological support based on positive suggestion is a psychotherapeutic approach that can be provided even to patients in altered cognitive states and is therefore a viable psychotherapy intervention throughout the ICU stay. Traditional ICU care team members have limited time and training to provide such psychological support to patients. Doulas are trained supportive companions who have been effectively used to provide patient advocacy and emotional support in other clinical settings and may address this need. Our aim was to train and implement a psychological support based on positive suggestion program for the critically ill using doulas, and measure acceptance of this intervention through stakeholder feedback. METHODS: Doula training included three objectives: an introduction to ICU practice structure and policies; education about fundamental aspects of critical care conditions and procedures; and didactic and hands-on learning experiences in effective use of psychological support based on positive suggestion in the critically ill. Doulas were evaluated at the end of their training and during subsequent clinical activities using competency-based assessments as well as through survey-based questions and interviews with key stakeholders. RESULTS: The ICU doulas performed psychological support based on positive suggestion on 43 critically ill patients in the ICU setting. Stakeholder feedback from nurses, patients, and patient families was positive. The majority (28/32) of surveyed bedside ICU nurses reported that the doulas’ involvement was helpful for both patients and nurses alike. All interviewed family members offered positive comments about the ICU doula presence and of the 40 patients who recalled the intervention 37 found it comforting. CONCLUSIONS: Our program successfully trained two doulas to work effectively in the ICU setting performing patient-centered psychological support based on positive suggestion interventions. Their training improved their skill sets and was reported as beneficial by patients, families, and critical care nursing. This training program offers a proof of concept that could be applied in other medical centers, bringing doulas more commonly into the ICU practice to help humanize the experience for patients, families, and medical teams.","Karnatovskaia, Lioudmila V.; Schultz, Jason M.; Niven, Alexander S.; Steele, Amanda J.; Baker, Brittany A.; Philbrick, Kemuel L.; del Valle, Kathryn T.; Johnson, Kimberly R.; Gajic, Ognjen; Varga, Katalin",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8078413/,203
17171,Serum C-Reactive Protein Is Negatively Associated With Olfactory Identification Ability in Older Adults,2021-04-14,"Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), encoded by Solute Carrier 9A (SLC9A) genes in human, are ubiquitous integral membrane ion transporters that mediate the electroneutral exchange of H+ with Na+ or K+. NHEs, found in the kidney and intestine, play a major role in the process of fluid reabsorption together via Na+,K+-ATPase pump and Na+ channels. Nevertheless, the expression pattern of NHE in the lung and its role in alveolar fluid homeostasis has not been addressed. Therefore, we aimed to examine the expression of NHE specific isoforms in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), and assess their role in congestive heart failure (CHF). Three NHE isoforms were identified in AEC and A549 cell line, at the level of protein and mRNA; NHE1, NHE2 and mainly NHE8, the latter was shown to be localized in the apical membrane of AEC. Treating A549 cells with angiotensin (Ang) II for 3, 5 and 24 hours displayed a significant reduction in NHE8 protein abundance. Moreover, the abundance of NHE8 protein was downregulated in A549 cells that were treated overnight with Ang II. NHE8 abundance in whole lung lysate was increased in rats with 1-week CHF compared to sham operated rats. However, lower abundance of NHE8 was observed in 4-week CHF group. In conclusion, we herein show for the first time, the expression of a novel NHE isoform in AEC, namely NHE8. Notably, Ang II decreased NHE8 protein levels. Moreover, NHE8 was distinctly affected in CHF rats, probably depending on the severity of the heart failure.","Kinaneh, Safa; Knany, Yara; Khoury, Emad E.; Ismael-Badarneh, Reem; Hamoud, Shadi; Berger, Gidon; Abassi, Zaid; Azzam, Zaher S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8059851/,203
18441,The TIMI Study Group’s Contributions to the Advancement of Cardiology -With Focus on Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease-,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND: The invasion of the red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites involves the interplay of several proteins that are also targets for vaccine development. The proteins PfRh5-PfRipr-PfCyRPA-Pfp113 assemble into a complex at the apical end of the merozoite and are together essential for erythrocyte invasion. They have also been shown to induce neutralizing antibodies and appear to be less polymorphic than other invasion-associated proteins, making them high priority blood-stage vaccine candidates. Using available whole genome sequencing data (WGS) and new capillary sequencing data (CS), this study describes the genetic polymorphism in the Rh5 complex in P. falciparum isolates obtained from Kilifi, Kenya. METHODS: 162 samples collected in 2013 and 2014 were genotyped by capillary sequencing (CS) and re-analysed WGS from 68 culture-adapted P. falciparum samples obtained from a drug trial conducted from 2005 to 2007. The frequency of polymorphisms in the merozoite invasion proteins, PfRh5, PfRipr, PfCyRPA and PfP113 were examined and where possible polymorphisms co-occurring in the same isolates. RESULTS: From a total 70 variants, including 2 indels, 19 SNPs [27.1%] were identified by both CS and WGS, while an additional 15 [21.4%] and 36 [51.4%] SNPs were identified only by either CS or WGS, respectively. All the SNPs identified by CS were non-synonymous, whereas WGS identified 8 synonymous and 47 non-synonymous SNPs. CS identified indels in repeat regions in the p113 gene in codons 275 and 859 that were not identified in the WGS data. The minor allele frequencies of the SNPs ranged between 0.7 and 34.9% for WGS and 1.1–29.6% for CS. Collectively, 12 high frequency SNPs (> 5%) were identified: four in Rh5 codon 147, 148, 203 and 429, two in p113 at codons 7 and 267 and six in Ripr codons 190, 259, 524, 985, 1003 and 1039. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the majority of the polymorphisms are rare variants and confirms a low level of genetic polymorphisms in all proteins within the Rh5 complex.

19359,"Identification of Low-Voltage Areas: A Unipolar, Bipolar, and Omnipolar Perspective",2021-06-18,"Dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted viral disease, is present in many neighborhoods in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia. One factor likely to affect its distribution is the socio-economic status of local neighborhoods; however, the absence of socio-economic census data in Saudi Arabia has precluded detailed investigation. This study aims to develop a proxy measure of socio-economic status in Jeddah City in order to assess its relationship with the occurrence of dengue fever. The Delphi method was used to assess the socio-economic status (high, medium or low) of local neighborhoods in Jeddah City. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was applied to understand the distribution of dengue fever according to the socio-economic status of Jeddah City neighborhoods. Low-socio-economic status neighborhoods in south Jeddah City, with poor environmental conditions and high levels of poverty and population density, reported most cases of dengue fever. Nevertheless, dengue continues to increase in high socio-economic status neighborhoods in the northern part of the city, possibly due to ideal breeding conditions caused by the presence of standing water associated with high levels of construction. Moreover, the low-socioeconomic-status neighborhoods had the highest average number of cases, being 3.95 times that of high-status neighborhoods for the period 2006–2009. The Delphi approach can produce a useful and robust measure of socio-economic status for use in the analysis of patterns of dengue fever. Results suggest that there are nuances in the relationship between socio-economic status and dengue that indicate that higher status areas are also at risk. A useful additional tool for researchers in Saudi Arabia would be the development of census data or other systematic measures that allow socio-economic status to be included in spatial analyses of dengue fever and other diseases.","Alkhaldy, Ibrahim; Barnett, Pauline",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8296257/,203

20683,Identification of distinct clinical phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome with differential responses to treatment,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in children, but effective tools for predicting outcome remain elusive. Although many pediatric patients receive early magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), data on its utility in prognostication are lacking. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a hallmark of TBI detected on early MRI and was shown previously to improve prognostication in adult patients with TBI. In this exploratory study, we investigated whether DAI grade correlates with functional outcome and improves prognostic accuracy when combined with core clinical variables and computed tomography (CT) biomarkers in pediatric patients with moderate-severe TBI (msTBI). METHODS: Pediatric patients (≤ 19 years) who were admitted to two regional level one trauma centers with a diagnosis of msTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score < 13) between 2011 and 2019 were identified through retrospective chart review. Patients who underwent brain MRI within 30 days of injury and had documented clinical follow-up after discharge were included. Age, pupil reactivity, and initial motor GCS score were collected as part of the International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI (IMPACT) model. Imaging was reviewed to calculate the Rotterdam score (CT) and DAI grade (MRI) and to evaluate for presence of hypoxic-ischemic injury (MRI). The primary outcome measure was the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category Scale (PCPCS) score at 6 months after TBI, with favorable outcome defined as PCPCS scores 1–3 and unfavorable outcome defined as PCPCS scores 4–6. The secondary outcome measure was discharge disposition to home versus to an inpatient rehabilitation facility. RESULT: Of 55 patients included in the study, 45 (82%) had severe TBI. The most common mechanism of injury was motor vehicle collision (71%). Initial head CT scans showed acute hemorrhage in 84% of patients. MRI was acquired a median of 5 days after injury, and hemorrhagic DAI lesions were detected in 87% of patients. Each 1-point increase in DAI grade increased the odds of unfavorable functional outcome by 2.4-fold. When controlling for core IMPACT clinical variables, neither the DAI grade nor the Rotterdam score was independently correlated with outcome and neither significantly improved outcome prediction over the IMPACT model alone. CONCLUSIONS: A higher DAI grade on early MRI is associated with worse 6-month functional outcome and with discharge to inpatient rehabilitation in children with acute msTBI in a univariate analysis but does not independently correlate with outcome when controlling for the GCS score. Addition of the DAI grade to the core IMPACT model does not significantly improve prediction of poor neurological outcome. Further study is needed to elucidate the utility of early MRI in children with msTBI.

20793,Pulmonary complications observed in patients with infective endocarditis with and without injection drug use: An analysis of the National Inpatient Sample,2021-09-03,"OBJECTIVE: To synthesise the published literature on practitioner, patient and carer views and experiences of shared medical appointments (SMAs) for the management of long-term conditions in primary care. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative primary studies. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science, Social Science Premium Collection (Proquest) and Scopus (SciVerse) from database starting dates to June 2019. Practitioner, patient and carer perspectives were coded separately. Deductive coding using a framework approach was followed by thematic analysis and narrative synthesis. Quality assessment was conducted using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme for qualitative studies. RESULTS: We identified 18 unique studies that reported practitioner (n=11), patient (n=14) and/or carer perspectivs(n=3). Practitioners reported benefits of SMAs including scope for comprehensive patient-led care, peer support, less repetition and improved efficiency compared with 1:1 care. Barriers included administrative challenges and resistance from patients and colleagues, largely due to uncertainties and unclear expectations. Skilled facilitators, tailoring of SMAs to patient groups, leadership support and teamwork were reported to be important for successful delivery. Patients’ reported experiences were largely positive with the SMAs considered a supportive environment in which to share and learn about self-care, though the need for good facilitation was recognised. Reports of carer experience were limited but included improved communication between carer and patient. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to indicate whether views and experiences vary between staff, medical condition and/or patient characteristics. Participant experiences may be subject to reporting bias. Policies and guidance regarding best practice need to be developed with consideration given to resource requirements. Further research is needed to capture views about wider and co-occurring conditions, to hear from those without SMA experience and to understand which groups of patients and practitioners should be brought together in an SMA for best effect.

20851,"Different strategies, equivalent treatment approaches in terms of mortality in four university hospitals: a retrospective multicenter study of gastroschisis in Finland",2021-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, veterinary practitioners and students are reported to be at higher risk of suicide, burnout, and depression compared to other occupational groups. The aim of the current study was to apply text mining and topic modelling analysis on scientific literature regarding suicide, burnout, and depression among veterinary practitioners and students to extract meaningful and synthetic information. These statistical approaches can be used to comprehend more in deep the phenomena involving veterinarians and veterinary students and to suggest the potential changes needed in admission to veterinary school, veterinary curricula, and post-graduation initiatives as preventive actions. RESULTS: A systematic search protocol was set up to identify scientific literature that published on the topic from 1985 to 2019. Two-hundred-eleven records were selected with abstracts/texts submitted to text mining and topic modelling analysis. Student, stress, work, anim*, and euthanasia resulted the most frequent terms. Topics modelling allowed to differentiate groups of words and papers in 3 areas of interest: 1) students’ difficulties encountered during their studies that increase stress and anxiety impairing their psychological health; 2) exposure to death and euthanasia as risk factor for mental health; and 3) need of support among those providing medical and health care, and of supportive group work to cope with such profession. CONCLUSION: Based on the most frequent words included in the clouds and on the contents of the papers clusterised in them, some suggestions are interfered. It is emphasized that the veterinary curricula should include courses that prepare them early to deal with animal death and post-death grief of pet owners, to handle ethical dilemmas and moral stressors, to communicate with clients and staff members, to work in team, to balance work-family life and to promote individual and team resources. Specific courses for veterinary practitioners could keep them updated on their new roles and ways to handle them among functioning as potential feedbacks to monitor their psychological wellbeing.

21593,A Review of the Clinical and Therapeutic Implications of Neuropathic Pain,2021-09-16,"BACKGROUND: Through the comparison of the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of hospital human influenza (influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, H3N2, and B)-related and hospitalized avian-origin influenza A (H7N9)-related viral pneumonia patients, find the different between them. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients. RESULTS: Human influenza A-related patients in the 35–49-year-old group were more than those with B pneumonia patients (p = 0.027), and relatively less in the ≥ 65-year-old group than B pneumonia patients (p = 0.079). The proportion of comorbid condition to human influenza A pneumonia was 58%, lower than B pneumonia and H7N9 pneumonia patients (78% vs. 77.8%; p = 0.013). The proportion of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), lymphocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase to hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than B pneumonia patients (p < 0.05), but lower than H7N9 pneumonia patients (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, pulmonary consolidation (odds ratio (OR): 13.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–121.12; p = 0.019) and positive bacterial culture (sputum) (OR: 7.71; 95% CI 2.48–24.03; p < 0.001) were independently associated with IMV, while shock (OR: 13.16; 95% CI 2.06–84.07; p = 0.006), white blood cell count > 10,000/mm(3) (OR: 7.22; 95% CI 1.47–35.58; p = 0.015) and positive bacterial culture(blood or sputum) (OR: 6.27; 95% CI 1.36–28.85; p = 0.018) were independently associated with death in the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital influenza B-related viral pneumonia mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases, while human influenza A pneumonia mainly affects the young adults; however, the mortality was similar. The hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was severer than B pneumonia patients, but milder than H7N9 pneumonia patients. Pulmonary consolidation and positive bacterial culture (sputum) were independently associated with IMV, while shock, white blood cell count > 10,000/mm(3), and positive bacterial culture (blood or sputum) were independently associated with death to three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients.

21796,Reviewing Peer Review,2021-07-19,"Coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1) is a leading causative agent of severe infectious diseases in humans and has been reported to be associated with outbreaks of aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, and the development of chronic diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). There is no approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy to treat CBV1 infection. And animal models to assess the effects of antiviral agents and vaccine remain limited. In this study, we established a neonatal mouse model of CVB1 using a clinically isolated strain to characterize the pathological manifestations of virus infection and to promote the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs against CVB1. One-day-old BALB/c mice were susceptible to CVB1 infection by intraperitoneal injection. Mice challenged with CVB1 at a low dose [10 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID(50))] exhibited a series of clinical symptoms, such as inactivity, emaciation, limb weakness, hair thinning, hunching and even death. Pathological examination and tissue viral load analysis showed that positive signals of CVB1 were detected in the heart, spinal cord, limb muscle and kidney without pathological damage. Particularly, CVB1 had a strong tropism towards the pancreas, causing severe cellular necrosis with inflammatory infiltration, and was spread by viraemia. Notably, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6H5 and antisera elicited from CVB1-vaccinated mice effectively protected the mice from CVB1 infection in the mouse model. In summary, the established neonatal mouse model is an effective tool for evaluating the efficacy of CVB1 antiviral reagents and vaccines.

Both the disease (viremic travellers) and vector movement to mosquito-free area contributes to the introduction and establishment of autochthonous ZIKV transmission. Mass gathering events can contribute to magnify transmission due to close crowd life in a confined area. Also, multitudinary events can promote the introduction of an infectious disease to a previously naïve area when returning home. Although mathematical models estimate a low risk for introduction of ZIKV in Europe, specific European regions (mainly Portuguese Island of Madeira) account with suitable and efficient vector and opportune climate conditions to harbour the disease. Clinicians should be aware to enable early detection of autochthonous ZIKV cases. International and local guidelines can help clinicians on how to handle suspicious cases, how to confirm the infection and how to report suspected and confirmed cases. In case of autochthonous ZIKV detection, public authorities should perform surveillance and provide adequate resources to sustain enhanced mosquito control.","Díaz-Menéndez, Marta; Crespillo-Andújar, Clara",Zika Virus Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123135/,203
32030,High incidence of ADRs in COVID-19 patients in China,2020-05-02,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 possesses an unusually long and conserved cytoplasmic region. Mutations in the LLP12 domain in this region have been shown to significantly affect viral competence. It is likely that the impaired infectivity of this mutated virus involves certain biochemical aspects of the peptide LLP12. To test our assumptions, some important biochemical properties and functions of LLP12 domain were studied. The recombinant peptide LLP12 (LLP12 domain on gp41, including LLP1 and LLP2 domains) was prepared via bacterial expression system. Biochemical analysis directly demonstrated its multimeric potential and membrane‐binding ability. Several arginine residues in this domain were observed to be extremely highly conserved. Interestingly, the LLP12 mutants constructed by substitution of these arginine residues with alanine (separate mutations in LLP1 or LLP2 or both) showed apparent decreases in their multimeric potential and membrane‐binding ability. Comparing our results with independent data on human immunodeficiency virus from other researchers, it appears that both the multimeric state and the membrane affinity of the LLP12 domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp41 could be involved in viral competence and in the mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Env‐mediated cell fusion.","Zhu, Yun; Lu, Lu; Chao, Lijun; Chen, Ying‐Hua",Chem Biol Drug Des,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7188357/,203

That such supply chains often implicate China, the origin of the pandemic, has also led to claims that trading partners have become too dependent on Chinese supplies. This in turn has led to policy interventions designed to reconfigure supply chains, which if adopted broadly could revise the terms upon which international business operates. A critical evaluation of this policymaker assessment is presented, based on near-time monitoring of medical and food trade disruption induced by government policy, on fine-grained trade data on the pre-pandemic international sourcing patterns of medical goods and medicines by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, on statements from U.S. government health experts before and during the pandemic on the frequency and sources of medicine shortages, and on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s latest evidence on the causes of medicine shortages in 2020.

One hundred seventy-seven samples tested positive and the PEDV-positive rate was 47.20%. A phylogenetic tree analysis based on the entire S gene showed that these strains clustered into four subgroups, GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, and GII-b, and that the GII-b strains have become dominant in recent years. Compared with previous strains, these strains have multiple variations in the SP and S1-NTD domains and in the neutralizing epitopes of the S protein. We also successfully isolated and identified a new virulent GII-b strain, GDgh16, which is well-adapted to Vero cells and caused a high mortality rate in piglets in challenge experiments.

METHODS: Currently, many COVID-19 vaccines are under advanced development and some have begun to be administered. In Nepal, the vaccination programme was initiated with Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 AZD1222 (Covishield) vaccine on January 27th targeting frontline healthcare professionals, sanitary staff and security workers. Newspaper reports and ADR reports received at a regional pharmacovigilance centre in Nepal were analysed. Nepal initiated a national pharmacovigilance programme 15 years back and has 14 functioning regional pharmacovigilance centres. The authors examine the strengths and challenges facing the current pharmacovigilance system in ensuring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. KEY FINDINGS: The news coverage has not mentioned any deaths till date with COVID-19 vaccination. Some patients reported vomiting, urticaria and sudden increase in blood pressure. Few people suffered from headache, fever and myalgia after being vaccinated. A vaccine, approved in an accelerated manner may have safety concerns. The vaccine may cause several types of reactions, but serious reactions have not been reported. Occurrence of adverse effects due to the vaccine is being studied. CONCLUSIONS: Involving key stake holders, training health professionals and strengthening existing reporting procedures are important. Developing a system of reporting and analysing ADRs daily can help generate actionable intelligence to improve the safety of the vaccination programme.

52385,COVID19 Associated Painful Subacute Thyroiditis,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: In 2014, a multidisciplinary burn telemedicine program was developed in order to increase access of burn specialists and improve care. This proved to be beneficial in the face of the pandemic through utilization of existing programs and development of new processes. METHODS: The basis of this burn telemedicine program utilizes a partnership approach. Visit types include inpatient and outpatient consultation, with visits occurring in in-patient settings, emergency departments, out-patient clinics, and in patient’s homes. During the COVID 19 pandemic, a weekly meeting was held with telemedicine program and clinic leadership, program coordinators, and our burn surgeon to triage patients to telemedicine or inpatient visit types. This often required the nursing staff to contact the patients to obtain more information about the injury and help them to securely upload photographs. The telemedicine visits were primarily video visits occurring either in clinic settings or the patient’s home. The burn psychotherapist and occupational therapists also utilized telemedicine for patient care. In addition, aftercare support groups, which originally were held twice each month onsite, transitioned to video and increased to three times. Telemedicine is also being utilized for school re-entry programming and the annual burn camps. The program is also tracking reimbursement for telemedicine activities. RESULTS: The pandemic resulted in a significant increase of telemedicine visits as compared to in person clinic visits often occurring directly into the patient’s homes. A greater number of burn patients were seen overall than previous to this process. Attached graphs show the comparison of in person visits compared to telemedicine visits during this time frame. Additional data will be presented showing the breakdown of visit location, provider (psychotherapist versus surgeon for example), and usage with aftercare programming. CONCLUSIONS: This telemedicine program with established processes and partnerships, allowed transitioning alternative care due to the pandemic to be less stressful event. Benefits to patient care included the ability of the multidisciplinary burn team to see more patients safely via video especially in their own homes and allowed continuation and expansion of aftercare support. Challenges experienced included needing additional staff to ensure patients were triaged appropriately, scheduling of visits, and technology training for patients and families, and to ensure that patients were receiving medications and dressings as needed. The increased volume of patients seen could be attributed to more frequent visits and an increased volume of burn injuries.

This study aimed to assess whether self-reported productivity despite presenteeism may be affected by biomarkers and hormones and how these physiological indicators can interact with each other to explain the presenteeism dimensions. Methods. This pilot study included 180 healthy participants with a mean age of 41.22 years (SD = 13.58), 76.11% of whom were female. The dependent variable included a self-reported measure of productivity loss due to presenteeism: the Stanford Presenteeism Scale 6. This study also includes physiological indicators such as biomarkers (C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood glucose) and hormones (cortisol and TSH thyroid hormone). Results. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that CRP moderated the relationship between cortisol levels and productivity despite presenteeism. Moreover, the increase of TSH moderated the relationship between cortisol, glycemia, and employees’ capacity to complete work tasks while sick. Conclusions. The results highlight TSH’s moderating role in decreasing employees’ capacity to fulfill tasks when these individuals have high levels of glycemia and cortisol in their blood. These findings have practical and theoretical implications based on a fuller understanding of how biomarkers and hormones explain productivity despite presenteeism.","Ferreira, Aristides I.; Pérez-Nebra, Amalia R.; Ellen Costa, Eva; Aguiar, Maria Luisa A.; Zambonato, Adriane; Costa, Carla G.; Modesto, João G.; Ferreira, Paula da Costa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8126032/,203
54945,Post corona infection cardiac abnormalities and the risk for sudden cardiac death,2021-05-11,"The resolution of inflammation is a tissue protective program that is governed by several factors including specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), proteins, gasses and nucleotides. Pro-resolving mediators activate counterregulatory programs to quell inflammation and promote tissue repair in a manner that does not compromise host defense. Phagocytes like neutrophils and macrophages play key roles in the resolution of inflammation because of their ability to remove debris, microbes and dead cells through processes including phagocytosis and efferocytosis. Emerging evidence suggests that failed resolution of inflammation and defective phagocytosis or efferocytosis underpins several prevalent human diseases. Therefore, understanding factors and mechanisms associated with enhancing these processes is a critical need. SPMs enhance phagocytosis and efferocytosis and this review will highlight mechanisms associated with their actions.","Decker, Christa; Sadhu, Sudeshna; Fredman, Gabrielle",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8222715/,203

The pathogenic mechanisms beyond its development are several and are complex and this is the main reason why a functional therapy is still missed. The beneficial effects of natural compounds against cardiovascular diseases and IS have been investigated for a long time. In this article, we reviewed the association between the most studied polyphenols and stroke protection in terms of prevention, effect on acute phase, and rehabilitation. We described experimental and epidemiological studies reporting the role of flavonols, phenolic acid, and stilbens on ischemic mechanisms leading to stroke. We analyzed the principal animal models used to evaluate the impact of these micronutrients to cerebral blood flow and to molecular pathways involved in oxidative stress and inflammation modulation, such as sirtuins. We reported the most significant clinical trials demonstrated as the persistent use of polyphenols is clinically relevant in terms of the reduction of vascular risk factors for IS, such as Atrial Fibrillation. Interestingly, different kinds of polyphenols provide brain protection by activating different pathways and mechanisms, like inducing antithrombotic effect, such as Honokiol. For this reason, we discussed an appropriate integrative use of them as a possible therapeutic alternative against stroke.","Pacifici, Francesca; Rovella, Valentina; Pastore, Donatella; Bellia, Alfonso; Abete, Pasquale; Donadel, Giulia; Santini, Silvia; Beck, Heinz; Ricordi, Camillo; Daniele, Nicola Di; Lauro, Davide; Della-Morte, David",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229516/,203

58972,Critical illness neuropathy in severe COVID-19,2021-10-08,"Cambodia detected its first case of COVID-19 just 3 days before WHO declared that the outbreak constituted as PHEIC. As of February 15, 2021, and after two major outbreaks, only 479 cases had been reported, 396 (83%) of which were imported. This small number of cases was largely thanks to stringent measures and policies put in place by the government to curb the spread. Despite these efforts, a third cluster outbreak was declared on February 20, 2021. It has disrupted all aspects of life in Cambodia. As in many other countries affected by the virus, economic hardship, lockdowns in cities, and food insecurity ensued. Against the backdrop of this widespread impact on the citizens of Cambodia, we conducted this review article to better understand the situation of healthcare workers in nephrology and dialysis patients and the challenge they face in providing and receiving essential medical care. Healthcare providers have continued working to serve their patients despite facing a high risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 and other challenges including difficulties in traveling to work, increased physical and mental burden, and higher stress due to measures taken to minimize the risk of transmission during patients’ care. Some healthcare workers have been discriminated against by neighbors. The most difficult mission is when having to deal with families whose loved one is denied access to a hemodialysis session due to suspected COVID-19 while waiting for PCR test results. Hemodialysis patients reported facing economic hardship and increasingly difficult circumstances. When access to food is limited, patients have eaten canned or dried salted food rather than an appropriate hemodialysis diet. Because hemodialysis centers are concentrated in a few cities, access has become even harder during the travel ban. In-center hemodialysis rules are stricter and does not allow family members or escorts to enter the unit. Only a few hemodialysis patients have been vaccinated. Before COVID-19, hemodialysis patients already faced major burdens. The pandemic appears to be decreasing their quality of life and survival even further. Through this study, we have revealed current hardships and the need to improve the situations for both healthcare workers in nephrology and hemodialysis patients in Cambodia.","Nov, Tam; Hyodo, Toru; Kitajima, Yukie; Kokubo, Kenichi; Naganuma, Toshihide; Wakai, Haruki; Yamashita, Akihiro; Phon, Elin; Kawanishi, Hideki",Ren Replace Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502098/,203

Seizures were the generalized myoclonic and tonic-clonic type. Phenobarbital was initiated and maintained; however, seizures were not controlled. Other anti-seizure drugs, including levetiracetam, zonisamide, and diazepam, also provided insufficient seizure control with seizures occurring hourly to daily. By 8 months of age, the cat displayed non-ambulatory tetraparesis and deep somnolence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and pre- and post-prandial total bile acid analyses were unremarkable. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) revealed central dominant but generally synchronized spikes and multiple spikes. The cat was diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy of unknown cause and was included in a clinical trial of epilepsy surgery. Given the unremarkable MRI and bilateral synchronized EEG abnormalities, a corpus callosotomy was performed at 12 months of age, and partial desynchronization of spikes was confirmed on EEG. Incomplete transection was found in the genu of the corpus callosum on postoperative MRI. After surgery, the mental status and ambulation clearly improved, and seizure frequency and duration were remarkably reduced. Recheck with follow-up EEG and MRI were performed at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. Scores of activities of daily living and visual analog scales including cat's and owner's quality of life had also improved considerably. This case report is the first documentation of the one-year clinical outcome of corpus callosotomy in a clinical feline case with drug-resistant epilepsy.","Hasegawa, Daisuke; Asada, Rikako; Mizuno, Satoshi; Yu, Yoshihiko; Hamamoto, Yuji; Kanazono, Shinichi",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511771/,203

METHODS From January 1, 2008, through November 30, 2012, 107 cases treated with LESS were identified, including pyeloplasty (n = 30), ureterolithotomy (n = 32), nephrectomy (n = 35; simple = 31, partial = 4), and cyst decortication (n = 10). Perioperative data were reviewed, and conversion and complication rates were noted. RESULTS The median follow-up was 21.5 months for pyeloplasty, 20.5 for ureterolithotomy, 28.0 for simple nephrectomy, 14.0 for partial nephrectomy, and 19.0 for cyst decortication. Major complications were encountered in 8 patients, including 3 intraoperative complications (2 bowel injury with serosal tearing and 1 intraoperative bleeding), which were recognized and repaired with LESS or conversion to conventional laparoscopy (CL). During the intermediate postoperative period (30-90 days) major complications occurred in 5 patients: 4 ureteral strictures (Clavien-Dindo grade [CG] IIIb) and 1 urinoma formation (CG IIIa). During the early postoperative period (<30 days), the most common minor complications were flank pain (CG I) in 16 patients and urinary tract infection (CG II) in 11, followed by urinary leakage (CG I) in 8. CONCLUSIONS Intermediate-term functional outcomes of this single-center study confirm that upper tract LESS is a challenging procedure that can be safe and effective when performed by an experienced team. Prospective studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate the safety of LESS in the treatment of various upper urinary tract conditions.","Tugcu, Volkan; Atar, Arda; Sahin, Selcuk; Seker, Gokhan; Kargi, Taner; Tasci, Ali Ihsan",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2015.00081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26648679/,203

The purpose of this article is to call attention to the multiple types and the complexity of ethical challenges in COVID-19 communication. Different types of ethical issues in COVID-19 communication are presented in four main sections. The first deals with ethical issues in informing the public about the risk of the pandemic and dilemmas regarding communicating uncertainty, using threats and scare tactics, and framing the pandemic as a war. The second concerns unintended consequences that relate to increasing inequities, stigmatization, ageism, and delaying medical care. The third raises ethical issues in communicating about specific mitigation practices: contact tracing, wearing face masks, spatial (also referred to as social) distancing, and handwashing or sanitizing. The fourth concerns appealing to positive social values associated with solidarity and personal responsibility, and ethical challenges when using these appeals.

In response to this issue, we conducted a field-based assessment of the malaria outbreak surveillance system in Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe. We visited eleven clinics in Mudzi and Goromonzi districts. Twenty-one interviews were conducted with key informants from the provincial (n = 2), district (n = 7), and clinic (n = 12) levels. Interviews focused on surveillance system activities, preparedness, data quality, timeliness, stability, and usefulness. Main themes were captured utilising standard qualitative data analysis techniques. While the surveillance system detects malaria outbreaks at all levels, we identified several gaps. Clinics experience barriers to timely and reliable reporting of outbreaks to the district level and staff cross-training. Stability of resources, including transportation (33% of informants, n = 7) and staff capacity (48% of informants, n = 10), presented barriers. Strengthening these surveillance barriers may improve staff readiness to detect malaria outbreaks, resulting in timelier outbreak response and a reduction in malaria outbreaks, cases, and deaths.

METHODS Fifty pathologically early HCCs [tumor diameter (mm): mean, 15.8; range, 10-23; follow-up days after RFA: median, 1213; range, 216-2137] and 187 typical HCCs [tumor diameter (mm): mean, 15.6; range, 6-30; follow-up days after RFA: median, 1116; range, 190-2328] were enrolled in this retrospective study. The presence of stromal invasion (namely, tumor cell invasion into the intratumoral portal tracts) was considered to be the most important pathologic finding for the diagnosis of early HCCs. Typical HCC was defined as the presence of a hyper-vascular lesion accompanied by delayed washout using contrast-enhanced computed tomography or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Follow-up examinations were performed at 3-mo intervals to monitor for signs of local tumor progression. The local tumor progression rates of pathologically early HCCs and typical HCCs were then determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS During the follow-up period for the 50 pathologically early HCCs, 49 (98%) of the nodules did not exhibit local tumor progression. However, 1 nodule (2%) was associated with a local tumor progression found 636 d after RFA. For the 187 typical HCCs, 46 (24.6%) of the nodules exhibited local recurrence after RFA. The follow-up period until the local tumor progression of typical HCC was a median of 605 d, ranging from 181 to 1741 d. Among the cases with typical HCCs, local tumor progression had occurred in 7.0% (7/187), 16.0% (30/187), 21.9% (41/187) and 24.6% (46/187) of the cases at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years, respectively. Pathologically early HCC was statistically associated with a lower rate of local tumor progression, compared with typical HCC, when evaluated using a log-rank test (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION The rate of local tumor progression for pathologically early HCCs after RFA was significantly lower than that for typical HCCs.","Hao, Yoshiteru; Numata, Kazushi; Ishii, Tomohiro; Fukuda, Hiroyuki; Maeda, Shin; Nakano, Masayuki; Tanaka, Katsuaki",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v23.i17.3111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28533668/,203

Students were temporarily suspended from campus and clinical sites, requiring prompt changes in structure to their didactic and clinical learning. This article describes the rapid adjustments that one midwifery and women's health nurse practitioner education program created using both synchronous and asynchronous simulation experiences to promote student learning and ongoing engagement. Flexibility and reflexivity were needed by faculty and students alike in the face of the multiple changes wrought by the pandemic. Curricular changes were made simultaneously in many courses. Objective structured clinical examinations simulate telehealth experiences that assess knowledge, clinical reasoning, and professional behaviors via a scripted scenario and an actor patient. On-call simulations mimic telephone triage and provide students the opportunity to build listening, assessment, and management skills for prenatal and intrapartum scenarios. Students are provided equipment and virtual instruction in an intrauterine device insertion session, which promotes skill acquisition and self-confidence. Trigger films are used to visualize real-life or scripted clinical encounters, leading to discussion and decision-making, particularly in the affective domain. Bilateral learning tools, similar to case studies, provide students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and critical thinking with a mechanism for faculty feedback.

Rectal thermometry, the most commonly used method, is stressful, invasive and time consuming. Non-contact infrared thermometry (NIRT) has been used with mixed success to measure temperature in humans and other species. The purpose of this study was to determine if NIRT measurements were comparable to rectal temperature measurements or, if not highly correlated, could at least identify cats in the hypothermic or hyperthermic range in need of further evaluation. METHODS From a total of six NIRT devices and 15 anatomic sites, three devices and three sites (pinna, gingiva and perineum) with the highest correlation to rectal temperature were selected for further study. Measurements were made in 188 adult cats housed indoors at animal shelters, veterinary clinics and private homes across a wide range of body temperatures and compared with rectal temperatures. RESULTS Bland-Altman analysis revealed poor agreement between NIRT and rectal thermometry. The mean NIRT measurements ranged from 0.7-1.3°C below the mean rectal measurements, but the effect was not consistent; NIRT measurements tended to exceed rectal measurements in hypothermic cats and fall below rectal measurements in normothermic and hyperthermic cats. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The accuracy of temperature measurements using NIRT devices is not reliable for clinical use in cats.","Nutt, Kelly R; Levy, Julie K; Tucker, Sylvia J",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15596564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208866/,203

This study analyzed complication rates of two different methods for reconstruction by a circular stapler after totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy (TLTG). METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, clinical data of 19 patients who underwent TLTG for gastric adenocarcinoma were collected retrospectively. There were two methods to fix the anvil of a circular stapler into the distal esophagus: In the single-stapling technique (SST) group, Endo-PSI(II) was used for purse-suturing on the distal esophagus for reconstruction, and in the hemi-double-stapling technique (hemi-DST) group, the esophagus was cut by linear stapler with the entry hole of the anvil shaft opened after inserting the anvil tail. In both groups, surgical procedures were the same, except for the reconstruction. RESULTS All TLTGs were performed securely without mortality. Intracorporeal laparoscopic esophagojejunal anastomosis was performed successfully for all the patients. In the hemi-DST group, four patients experienced anastomotic stenosis, three of whom required endoscopic balloon dilation. In contrast, no stenosis was seen in the SST group (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS Anastomosis with SST is preferred to that with hemi-DST to minimize postoperative complications.","Amisaki, Masataka; Kihara, Kyoichi; Endo, Kanenori; Suzuki, Kazunori; Nakamura, Seiichi; Sawata, Takashi; Shimizu, Tetsu",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4588-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26487216/,203

The objective of this trend analysis is to assess whether clinical outcomes after laparoscopic appendectomy have improved over the past 12 years. METHODS This analysis is based on the prospective database of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. All patients undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis from 1995 to 2006 were included. The following outcomes were assessed for each of the 12 years: conversion rates, intraoperative complications, surgical postoperative complications, general postoperative complications, rate of reoperations, and length of hospital stay. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted multivariable analyses were performed. Statistical significance was set at a level of P < 0.05. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS Data from 7446 patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis were prospectively collected. Over the period of observation, the conversion rate decreased significantly from 2.2% to 1.2% (P(trend)< 0.001), as did intraoperative complications (from 3.1% to 0.7%; P(trend)< 0.001), surgical postoperative complications (from 6.1% to 1.9%; P(trend)< 0.001), general postoperative complications (from 4.9% to 1.5%; P(trend)< 0.001), and rates of reoperations (from 3.4% to 0.7%; P(trend)< 0.001). Average postoperative length of hospital stay also significantly decreased from 4.9 to 3.5 days (P(trend)< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our investigation provides compelling evidence that intraoperative complications, surgical and general postoperative complications, conversion rates, rates of reoperations, and average length of hospital stay have significantly decreased over the past decade in patients undergoing surgery for acute appendicitis. The present trend analysis is the first one in the literature encompassing more than a decade and reporting clinical outcomes after laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis, which represents an important quality control.","Brügger, Lukas; Rosella, Laura; Candinas, Daniel; Güller, Ulrich",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3181fc9d53; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21173695/,203
66225,Efficacy of Baska mask and Laryngeal mask airway supreme during positive pressure ventilation - A comparative study.,2020,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to explore the regulatory mechanism of circRNA UBAP2 (circUBAP2) in colorectal cancer (CRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS The expression levels of circUBAP2, miR-199a, and VEGFA in tissues and cell lines were detected by RT-qPCR. The cell proliferation was examined by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The migration and invasion abilities were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase activity assay were applied to determine the interaction between genes. RESULTS The expression of circUBAP2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and depletion of circUBAP2 suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC. Furthermore, miR-199a inhibitor abrogated the suppressive effect of circUBAP2 knockdown on CRC progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a downstream target gene of miR-199a, and overexpression of VEGFA rescued the tumor phenotypes attenuated by circUBAP2 knockdown or miR-199a overexpression. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrated that circUBAP2 facilitated CRC progression by sponging miR-199a to upregulate VEGFA. These findings implied that circUBAP2 may be a potential therapeutic biomarker for CRC.","Dai, J; Zhuang, Y; Tang, M; Qian, Q; Chen, J-P",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767322/,203

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the relationship between systemic inflammation, muscle strength and/or muscle mass in adults. METHODS An electronic search using keywords such as 'acute phase proteins, cytokines and sarcopenia, muscle mass, muscle strength' was conducted via Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase from inception until the 30th of June 2020. A meta-analysis using correlation data was performed to determine the overall relationship between inflammation and muscle strength and muscle mass in adults. RESULTS Overall, 168 articles; 149 cross-sectional articles (n = 76,899 participants, 47.0 % male) and 19 longitudinal articles (n = 12,295 participants, 31.9 % male) met inclusion criteria. Independent of disease state, higher levels of C reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin (IL)-6 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α were associated with lower handgrip and knee extension strength (CRP; r = -0.10, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.13, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.08, p < 0.001 and CRP; r = -0.18, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.11, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.13, p < 0.001 respectively) and muscle mass (CRP; r = -0.12, p < 0.001, IL-6; r = -0.09, p < 0.001, TNFα; r = -0.15, p < 0.001). Furthermore, higher levels of systemic inflammatory markers appeared to be associated with lower muscle strength and muscle mass over time. CONCLUSION Higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers are significantly associated with lower skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass.","Tuttle, Camilla S L; Thang, Lachlan A N; Maier, Andrea B",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992047/,203
67612,Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: changes in factor VIII and von Willebrand factor impose early hypercoagulability.,2020,"In the last four decades, several researchers worldwide have routinely and meticulously exercised cell culture experiments in two-dimensional (2D) platforms. Using traditionally existing 2D models, the therapeutic efficacy of drugs has been inappropriately validated due to the failure in generating the precise therapeutic response. Fortunately, a 3D model addresses the foregoing limitations by recapitulating the in vivo environment. In this context, one has to contemplate the design of an appropriate scaffold for favoring the organization of cell microenvironment. Instituting pertinent model on the platter will pave way for a precise mimicking of in vivo conditions. It is because animal cells in scaffolds oblige spontaneous formation of 3D colonies that molecularly, phenotypically, and histologically resemble the native environment. The 3D culture provides insight into the biochemical aspects of cell-cell communication, plasticity, cell division, cytoskeletal reorganization, signaling mechanisms, differentiation, and cell death. Focusing on these criteria, this paper discusses in detail, the diversification of polymeric scaffolds based on their available resources. The paper also reviews the well-founded and latest techniques of scaffold fabrication, and their applications pertaining to tissue engineering, drug screening, and tumor model development.","Badekila, Anjana K; Kini, Sudarshan; Jaiswal, Amit K",Journal of cellular physiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29935; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657458/,203

Telemedicine has emerged as an obvious choice to counter these impediments. However, its potential for maintaining outpatient care at pre-pandemic levels during these rapidly changing times is untested. Therefore, we analyzed our experience in a tertiary care epilepsy center. Methods: We divided the study period from March 1, 2020 to April 15, 2020 into a baseline, transition (to telemedicine), and current phase. We divided outpatient encounters into clinic, virtual (using Cleveland Clinic Express Care Online platform), and telephone (including commercial video conferencing platforms). Results: Completed outpatient visits during baseline and current period were 595 and 590, respectively. Nearly 1 out of 4 patients missed outpatient visits during the transition period. The virtual visits accounted for 19.7% of completed visits during baseline and increased to 66.8% during the current period. There were no telephone visits during the baseline phase but accounted for 26.1% of completed visits during the current phase. Less than 1 percent of completed visits in the current phase were in the clinic. Conclusion: We provide evidence that telemedicine's robust and rapid scalability can help maintain a seamless transition of outpatient care during the pandemic.","Punia, Vineet; Nasr, Gaelle; Zagorski, Victoria; Lawrence, George; Fesler, Jessica; Nair, Dileep; Najm, Imad",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32429769/,203

We describe our initial experiences performing otologic surgery with the exoscope during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD The exoscope was used for several semiurgent otologic surgeries in combination with complete eye protection, a ""tent"" drape, a smoke evacuator with ultra-low particulate air filter, and betadine irrigation. These techniques are demonstrated in the accompanying video. This was compared with our experiences using the microscope. RESULTS The described modified goggles allowed complete eye protection while providing a fully three-dimensional view of the surgical site. The other safety measures described are simple and efficient techniques which can easily be adopted for otologic surgery using the microscope. CONCLUSION Use of the exoscope for otologic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic allows full three-dimensional visualization of the surgical field while simultaneously providing complete eye protection. Use of the ""tent"" drape, ultra-low particulate air filter, and betadine irrigation are also options that otologic surgeons may consider for additional safety.","Tu, Nathan; Bojrab, Dennis; Sioshansi, Pedrom; Lin, Kenny; Hong, Robert; Bojrab, Dennis; Babu, Seilesh","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122504/,203

70548,COVID-19 and remdesivir in pediatric patients: the invisible part of the iceberg.,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND The past decade has seen tremendous changes in the management of cleft deformities with the advent of the Smile Train project. The present study evaluates the effect of the Smile Train project on the demographics of cleft deformities. METHOD Data collected over the past three decades were studied retrospectively. The number of cases, age at presentation, and relative proportion of cleft lip-cleft palate patients were analyzed. Thirty patients operated on at the authors' institute for cleft lip deformity were evaluated for their awareness of cleft deformities, and the results were compared with those of 22 patients operated on elsewhere in camp settings. RESULTS The numbers of patients with cleft deformities treated at the authors' institute from 1980 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, and 2000 to 2009 were 1189, 1050, and 374, respectively. However, the number with cleft palate has remained nearly constant over the three decades. The mean age of reporting for treatment of cleft palate was 16 months after being operated on for cleft lip at the authors' institute and 41 months after being operated on elsewhere in camps. All patients operated on at the authors' institute expressed awareness of holistic treatment of cleft deformities. Of the 22 patients operated on at other camps, 16 were ignorant about the time scale and 19 were unaware of the consequences of nonadherence to the treatment protocol. Nineteen of the 22 patients felt that enough information was not provided to them at initial surgery. CONCLUSION The authors recommend that cleft counseling, continued cleft care for the complete complex of deformities, and responsible behavior by the initial operating team should be the goals for the future.","Patil, Surendra B; Kale, Satish M; Khare, Nishant; Math, Mahantesh; Jaiswal, Sumeet; Jain, Arvind",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0b013e3181f95b9c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21200226/,203

Financial integration-the ownership of hospitals or physician practices-often has anticompetitive effects that contribute to the higher prices for health care seen in the US. To determine whether the potential harms of financial integration are counterbalanced by improvements in quality, we surveyed nationally representative samples of hospitals (n = 739) and physician practices (n = 2,189), stratified according to whether they were independent or were owned by complex systems, simple systems, or medical groups. The surveys included nine scales measuring the level of adoption of diverse, quality-focused care delivery and payment reforms. Scores varied widely across hospitals and practices, but little of this variation was explained by ownership status. Quality scores favored financially integrated systems for four of nine hospital measures and one of nine practice measures, but in no case favored complex systems.

Previous studies have identified numerous risk factors for infections and DVT after THA but have often been limited by sample size. We aimed to evaluate the effect of operative time on early postoperative infection as well as DVT rates following THA. We hypothesized that an increase in operative time would result in increased odds of acquiring an infection as well as a DVT. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database from 2006 to 2015 for all patients undergoing primary THA. Associations between operative time and infection or DVT were evaluated with multivariable logistic regressions controlling for demographics and several known risks factors for infection. Three different types of infections were evaluated: (1) superficial surgical site infection (SSI), an infection involving the skin or subcutaneous tissue, (2) deep SSI, an infection involving the muscle or fascial layers beneath the subcutaneous tissue, and (3) organ/space infection, an infection involving any part of the anatomy manipulated during surgery other than the incisional components. RESULTS In total, 103,044 patients who underwent THA were included in our study. Our results suggested a significant association between superficial SSIs and operative time. Specifically, the adjusted odds of suffering a superficial SSI increased by 6% (CI=1.04-1.08, p<0.0001) for every 10-minute increase of operative time. When using dichotomized operative time (<90minutes or >90minutes), the adjusted odds of suffering a superficial SSI was 56% higher for patients with prolonged operative time (CI=1.05-2.32, p=0.0277). The adjusted odds of suffering a deep SSI increased by 7% for every 10-minute increase in operative time (CI=1.01-1.14, p=0.0335). No significant associations were detected between organ/space infection, wound dehiscence, or DVT and operative time either as continuous or as dichotomized. CONCLUSION Prolonged operative times (>90min) are associated with increased rates of superficial SSIs, but not deep SSIs, organ/space infections, wound dehiscence, or DVT.

The purpose of this systematic review was to describe and evaluate participant, intervention, methodological, and outcome characteristics of SDM intervention studies conducted within this population. METHODS Systematic searches of the literature through April 2020 were conducted and supplemented by hand searching of reference lists of identified studies. A total of 53 independent studies of SDM interventions that were conducted with service users with serious mental illnesses and that included a quantitative or qualitative measure of the intervention were included in the review. Data were independently extracted by at least two authors. RESULTS Most studies were conducted with middle-age, male, White individuals from Western countries. Interventions fell into the following categories: decision support tools only, multicomponent interventions involving decision support tools, multicomponent interventions not involving decision support tools, and shared care planning and preference elicitation interventions. Most studies were randomized controlled trials with sufficient sample sizes. Outcomes assessed were diverse, spanning decision-making constructs, clinical and functional, treatment engagement or adherence, and other constructs.

In addition, the literature still lacks comparative studies between the two approaches to prove the above-mentioned advantages of SILS over conventional laparoscopy and, most importantly, its equivalent effectiveness in terms of initial oncological results. PATIENTS AND METHODS Two consecutive series of 10 patients undergoing three-port conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (3PCL-RH) and single-incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy, respectively, were compared in their short-term surgical and oncological outcomes. RESULTS Analysis of perioperative and postoperative outcomes revealed no significant differences between the two groups. In the SILS group an anastomotic leakage occurred, which was conservatively treated by continuous drainage, total parental nutrition, and antibiotic therapy. The analysis of oncological outcomes showed no differences in terms of length of distal tumor-free margin and harvest of lymph nodes. CONCLUSIONS Despite its feasibility for right hemicolectomy and its equivalent short-term surgical and oncological outcome compared with conventional laparoscopy, SILS demonstrated no significant advantages in terms of surgical incision length and postoperative course compared with 3PCL-RH. We acknowledge that the small sample size and the nonrandomized design are a limit of the study. Thus, prospective randomized controlled trials are recommended to prove the superiority of single-incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy.","Currò, Giuseppe; Cogliandolo, Andrea; Lazzara, Salvatore; La Malfa, Giuseppe; Navarra, Giuseppe",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Results For patients who survived >90 days after hospital admission (n = 2), the mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation values upon ambulance and hospital arrival were 24% and 60%, respectively; for patients who did not survive (n = 31), the mean regional cerebral oxygen saturation values were 15% and 17%, respectively. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation values increased to a greater extent between ambulance arrival and hospital arrival in patients who survived >90 days (median, 36%; interquartile range, 32-40%) than in those who did not survive (0; 0-6%; P = 0.07). Additionally, regional cerebral oxygen saturation values were not related to the prehospital return of spontaneous circulation or survival to hospital admission. Conclusion Regional cerebral oxygen saturation could be monitored during resuscitation by emergency medical technicians, and it can be used during physiological monitor-guided cardiopulmonary resuscitation.","Hamanaka, Kunio; Shimoto, Manabu; Hitosugi, Masahito; Beppu, Satoru; Terashima, Mariko; Sasahashi, Nozomu; Nishiyama, Kei",Acute medicine & surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566238/,203
75669,"Follow-up meeting post death, an unmet need. The right moment to start.",2020-07-01,"Autophagy, literally meaning ""self-eating,"" is an intracellular catabolic process of delivering cytosol and/or its specific content to the lysosomes for degradation.The resulting macromolecular constituents are recycled and utilized again by the cells. Basal level autophagy plays an important role in cellular homeostasis through the elimination of the old or damaged organelles, as well as aggregated intracellular proteins. Autophagy refers to sequestration of intact organelles along with a portion of cytosol, into a double-or multi-membrane structure known as phagophore, which elongates, and after closure, forms a vesicular structure known as the autophagosome. Subsequently, the mature autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, thereby forming a single membrane structure, an autolysosome. Autophagy plays a critical role in inflammation, autoimmunity and cellular differentiation. Skin serves as the first line of defense against a variety of environmental insults and autophagy is thought to be a form of an endogenous defense mechanism against such environmental derangements. Autophagy has been linked with keratinocyte differentiation and melanocyte survival, as well as with the pathogenesis of diverse skin disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, psoriasis, vitiligo, infectious skin diseases and cancer. Autophagy has been one of the most studied phenomena in cell biology and pathophysiology, and given its broad clinical implications, has become a major target for drug discovery. The last decade has seen a substantial upsurge in autophagy-related research and publications; still, the dermatology literature appears to be less initiated. Autophagy will probably change our understanding of dermatological disorders/medicines. Hence, a basic knowledge of autophagy is a prerequisite to understand the developments in the field of autophagy-related research.","Nagar, Rahul","Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology",https://doi.org/10.4103/0378-6323.196320; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28004651/,203

Acellular collagen matrices (ACM) have been suggested as an alternative to synthetic durable patches as they are remodeled by the host or could also be used for tissue engineering purposes. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.0x1.0 cm diaphragmatic defects were created in 6-weeks old New-Zealand white rabbits. We compared reconstruction with a purpose-designed cross-linked ACM (Matricel) to 4-layer non-cross-linked small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and a 1-layer synthetic Dual Mesh (Gore-Tex). Unoperated animals or animals undergoing primary closure (4/0 polyglecaprone) served as age-matched controls. 60 (n = 25) resp. 90 (n = 17) days later, animals underwent chest x-ray and obduction for gross examination of explants, scoring of adhesion and inflammatory response. Also, uniaxial tensiometry was done, comparing explants to contralateral native diaphragmatic tissue. RESULTS Overall weight nearly doubled from 1,554±242 g at surgery to 2,837±265 g at obduction (+84%). X-rays did show rare elevation of the left diaphragm (SIS = 1, Gore-Tex = 1, unoperated control = 1), but no herniation of abdominal organs. 56% of SIS and 10% of Matricel patches degraded with visceral bulging in four (SIS = 3, Matricel = 1). Adhesion scores were limited: 0.5 (Matricel) to 1 (SIS, Gore-Tex) to the left lung (p = 0.008) and 2.5 (Gore-Tex), 3 (SIS) and 4 (Matricel) to the liver (p<0.0001). Tensiometry revealed a reduced bursting strength but normal compliance for SIS. Compliance was reduced in Matricel and Gore-Tex (p<0.01). Inflammatory response was characterized by a more polymorphonuclear cell (SIS) resp. macrophage (Matricel) type of infiltrate (p<0.05). Fibrosis was similar for all groups, except there was less mature collagen deposited to Gore-Tex implants (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Matricel induced a macrophage-dominated inflammatory response, more adhesions, had appropriate strength but a lesser compliance compared to native tissue. The herein investigated ACM is not a viable option for CDH repair.","Mayer, Steffi; Decaluwe, Herbert; Ruol, Michele; Manodoro, Stefano; Kramer, Manuel; Till, Holger; Deprest, Jan",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0132021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26147985/,203

Treatment of these critically ill patients is becoming one of the major challenges we are facing. Frequently, more than 10 types of drugs are used simultaneously in the treatment of these critically ill patients, and the combination of many different drugs may easily lead to drug interactions and adverse reactions. Therefore, clinical pharmacist should participate in the optimization of drug treatment programs. MATERIALS AND METHODS A case of a critically ill COVID-19 patient with respiratory failure and diabetes mellitus is used as an example of an analysis of the treatment plan, utilization of combined medications, and the delivery of pharmaceutical care. RESULTS There were some drug use unreasonable phenomena, including the extended continuation of arbidol treatment, the use of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs, the use of drugs with unproven anti-coronavirus effects. CONCLUSION Clinical pharmacists should participate in the optimization of drug treatment programs and provide pharmaceutical care for critically ill COVID-19 patients; this can promote the rational use of drugs.","Li, Xiang; Li, Yanli; Guo, Shuai; Liu, Wenjun",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.5414/cp203772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729823/,203

Yet, the pandemic may have sizable impacts on psychological distress and health behaviors -these effects may be long-lasting and may disproportionately affect some demographic groups more than others. Data came from a longitudinal international study of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' psychological distress and wellbeing (N = 1567). We found high rates of depression (55% were diagnosable with probable depression at baseline), anxiety (65%), and risk for PTSD (51%). More than one-third of participants who reported that they drank alcohol indicated that their drinking had increased since the start of the pandemic. Over time, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts and behaviors increased significantly, but acute stress symptoms decreased. Specific demographic groups (people of color and sexual and gender minorities) appeared to be at high risk of distress across analyses. Our findings suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, acute stress, and other signs of distress like isolation, hopelessness, and use of substances to cope - even at five-month follow-up. Our findings suggest a need to prioritize availability of, and access to, mental health care during both the pandemic and the recovery.","Veldhuis, Cindy B; Nesoff, Elizabeth D; McKowen, Anna Laura W; Rice, Dylan; Ghoneima, Hana; Wootton, Angie; Papautsky, Elizabeth Lerner; Arigo, Danielle; Goldberg, Shoshona; Anderson, Jocelyn",Preventive medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647353/,203
80127,Part 1: Executive Summary: 2020 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.,2020-10-20,"Controlling the supramolecular self-assembly of π-conjugated systems into defined morphologies is a prerequisite for the preparation of functional materials. In recent years, the development of sophisticated sample preparation protocols and modulation of various experimental conditions (solvent, concentration, temperature, etc.) have enabled precise control over aggregation pathways of different types of monomer units. A common method to achieve pathway control consists in the combination of two miscible solvents in defined proportions - a ""poor"" and ""good"" solvent. However, the role of solvents of opposed polarity in the self-assembly of a given building block still remains an open question. Herein, we unravel the effect of aggregation-inducing solvent systems of opposed polarity (aqueous vs. non-polar media) on the supramolecular assembly of a new bolaamphiphilic Pt(ii) complex. A number of experimental methods show a comparable molecular packing in both media driven by a synergy of solvophobic, aromatic and weak hydrogen-bonding interactions. However, morphological analysis of the respective aggregates in aqueous and non-polar media reveals a restricted aggregate growth in aqueous media into spherical nanoparticles and a non-restricted 2D-nanosheet formation in non-polar media. These findings are attributed to a considerably more efficient solvation and, in turn, increased steric demand of the hydrophilic chains in aqueous media than in nonpolar media, which can be explained by the entrapment of water molecules in the hydrophilic aggregate shell via hydrogen bonds. Our findings reveal that the different solvation of peripheral solubilizing groups in solvents of opposed polarity is an efficient method for morphology control in self-assembly.","Bäumer, Nils; Kartha, Kalathil K; Palakkal, Jasnamol P; Fernández, Gustavo",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0sm00537a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633744/,203
80587,Antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombosis in patients with COVID-19.,2020-12-31,"PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has significantly impacted healthcare delivery and utilization. The aim of this article was to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-hospital continuous electroencephalography (cEEG) utilization and identify areas for process improvement. METHODS A 38-question web-based survey was distributed to site principal investigators of the Critical Care EEG Monitoring Research Consortium, and institutional contacts for the Neurodiagnostic Credentialing and Accreditation Board. The survey addressed the following aspects of cEEG utilization: (1) general center characteristics, (2) cEEG utilization and review, (3) staffing and workflow, and (4) health impact on EEG technologists. RESULTS The survey was open from June 12, 2020 to June 30, 2020 and distributed to 174 centers with 79 responses (45.4%). Forty centers were located in COVID-19 hotspots. Fifty-seven centers (72.1%) reported cEEG volume reduction. Centers in the Northeast were most likely to report cEEG volume reduction (odds ratio [OR] 7.19 [1.53-33.83]; P = 0.012). Additionally, centers reporting decrease in outside hospital transfers reported cEEG volume reduction; OR 21.67 [4.57-102.81]; P ≤ 0.0001. Twenty-six centers (32.91%) reported reduction in EEG technologist coverage. Eighteen centers had personal protective equipment shortages for EEG technologists. Technologists at these centers were more likely to quarantine for suspected or confirmed COVID-19; OR 3.14 [1.01-9.63]; P = 0.058. CONCLUSIONS There has been a widespread reduction in cEEG volume during the pandemic. Given the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the importance of cEEG in managing hospitalized patients, methods to optimize use need to be prioritized to provide optimal care. Because the survey provides a cross-sectional assessment, follow-up studies can determine the long-term impact of the pandemic on cEEG utilization.","Zafar, Sahar F; Khozein, Rebecca J; LaRoche, Suzette M; Westover, Michael B; Gilmore, Emily J",Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,https://doi.org/10.1097/wnp.0000000000000802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394823/,203

Here, we aim to evaluate the impact of DGE following laparoscopic repair of very large hiatus hernias on patients' quality of life, gastrointestinal symptomatology, and daily function. METHODS Analysis of data collected from a multicenter prospective randomised trial of patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh versus sutured repair of very large hiatus hernias (>50% of stomach in chest). DGE was defined as gastric food retention visualised at endoscopy after 6 h of fasting at 6 months post-surgery. Quality of life (QOL), gastrointestinal symptomatology, and daily function were assessed with the SF-36 questionnaire, Visick scoring and structured surveys administered prior to surgery and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. RESULTS Nineteen of 102 (18.6%) patients had DGE 6 months after surgery. QOL questionnaires were completed in at least 80% of patients across all time points. Compared with controls, the DGE group demonstrated significantly lower SF-36 physical component scores, delayed improvement in health transition, more adverse gastrointestinal symptoms, higher Visick scores and a slower rate of return to normal daily activities. These differences were still present 12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS DGE following large hiatus hernia repair is associated with a negative impact on quality of life at follow-up to 12 months after surgery.","Liu, David S; Tog, Chek; Lim, Hou K; Stiven, Peter; Thompson, Sarah K; Watson, David I; Aly, Ahmad",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-017-4362-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29159599/,203

There are, however, situations in which the use of the fibrobronchoscope is not applicable, particularly due to problems attributable to the patient or to limited use of the instrument. In such situations, the video laryngoscope can be a useful alternative, as long as it is associated with adequate sedation of the patient. In fact, it ensures excellent viewing of the glottis, allowing for successful orotracheal intubation to be performed even in case of difficult airways, while keeping the patient spontaneously breathing throughout the procedure. From the data present in the literature, this technique seems to ensure a success rate and a safety profile similar to those obtained with the fibrobronchoscope, moreover, with greater ease of use by the anaesthesiologist. The main purpose of this work is to provide a valid and safe alternative to intubation with a fibrobronchoscope while awake in those patients with anticipated difficult airway management and in whom, for different reasons, fibrobronchoscope cannot be used.","Piroli, Alba; Marsili, Ida; Marinangeli, Franco; Costanzi, Silvia; Gentili, Luca; Paladini, Antonella",Case reports in anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5524240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007490/,203

METHODS Primary 3D endoluminal CTC evaluation using a 120 degree FOV was performed by 2 experienced radiologists on 73 patients harboring 104 colonoscopy-proven polyps measuring 6 mm or larger. Unidirectional fly-through evaluation consisted of rectal-to-cecal (retrograde) navigation on the supine display and cecal-to-rectal (antegrade) navigation on the prone display. Electronic fluid subtraction was not used. RESULTS All 104 (100%) polyps were detectable with the single-pass 3D evaluation on either the retrograde supine or antegrade prone fly-through, with 86 (82.7%) of 104 polyps seen on both fly-through views. Of the 18 polyps detected on only one of the two 3D endoluminal passes (10 prone, 8 supine), 13 were either submerged under fluid (n = 12) or within a collapsed segment (n = 1); therefore, these were also undetectable on the corresponding 90 degrees bidirectional fly-through. The remaining 5 (4.8%) polyps were located behind a fold, but these polyps were all detectable on the other fly-through in the reverse direction. CONCLUSIONS Increasing the visual FOV angle to 120 degrees allows for a decrease in the total number of supine and prone 3D endoluminal fly-through passes from 4 to 2 without negatively impacting overall polyp detection.","Pickhardt, Perry J; Schumacher, Clark; Kim, David H",Journal of computer assisted tomography,https://doi.org/10.1097/rct.0b013e31819778ea; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638863/,203

Stress-related trauma is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in wild ruminant species. Trazodone could reduce stress and allow safer capture and handling, thus having a positive effect on their welfare. The objective of this study was to describe the clinical effects and pharmacokinetic profile of an oral dose of trazodone in domestic goats (Capra hircus) as a model for wild ruminants. A pilot study using ethograms and accelerometers identified an oral dose of 10 mg/kg as optimal to reduce activity levels. This dose resulted in a 502% increase in time spent sleeping (P=0.0016) and a 623% increase in time spent lying down (P=0.01). Additionally, there were reductions of 72% in time spent grooming (P=0.02), 49% in time spent moving (P=0.01), and 87% in time spent observing (P=0.0002). Activity levels were significantly decreased by 31% for 4 hr following administration (P=0.049). There were no observed adverse effects. Time spent eating or ruminating was not affected by trazodone administration (P > 0.05). The pharmacokinetics of trazodone following a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg in 7 goats was assessed. All animals achieved plasma concentrations over 130 ng/ml, a level considered therapeutic in humans and dogs, for a mean of 6.4 ± 5.0 hr. Mean terminal half-life was 10.55 ± 6.80 hr. All goats achieved maximum concentration within 5-15 min and still had detectable plasma levels at 24 hr. Trazodone appears promising to decrease stress in exotic ruminant species. Further research is warranted to establish its efficacy in other ruminant species and clinical situations.","Prud'homme, Yasmeen; Ferrell, Shannon T; Beaudry, Francis; Beauchamp, Guy; Nichols, Sylvain; Desmarchelier, Marion",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,https://doi.org/10.1638/2019-0242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33480570/,203

This study in healthy volunteers examined the trajectory of the immune response systemically and within the brain following repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenges. Five young males underwent experimental human endotoxemia (intravenous administration of 2 ng/kg LPS) twice with a 7-day interval. The systemic immune response was assessed by measuring plasma cytokine levels. Four positron emission tomography (PET) examinations, using the translocator protein (TSPO) ligand 18F-DPA-714, were performed in each participant, to assess brain immune cell activation prior to and 5 hours after both LPS challenges. The first LPS challenge caused a profound systemic inflammatory response and resulted in a 53% [95%CI 36-71%] increase in global cerebral 18F-DPA-714 binding (p<0.0001). Six days after the first challenge, 18F-DPA-714 binding had returned to baseline levels (p=0.399). While the second LPS challenge resulted in a less pronounced systemic inflammatory response (i.e. 77±14% decrease in IL-6 compared to the first challenge), cerebral inflammation was not attenuated, but decreased below baseline, illustrated by a diffuse reduction of cerebral 18F-DPA-714 binding (-38% [95%CI -47 to -28%], p<0.0001). Our findings constitute evidence for in vivo immunological reprogramming in the brain following a second inflammatory insult in healthy volunteers, which could represent a neuroprotective mechanism.

STUDY DESIGN Observational. SAMPLE POPULATION Second-year veterinary students (n = 143) enrolled in a surgical laboratory; 9 weeks were taught traditionally, and 6 weeks were taught remotely. METHODS Because of the global pandemic, remote laboratories were developed and delivered. Students performed surgical procedures in model organs remotely while being observed by and receiving feedback from instructors on an internet-based video platform. Methods for remote surgical teaching were explored, and successes and challenges were detailed. Surveys were administered to the students and faculty to gather perspectives on their experience and subsequent confidence. RESULTS Surveys were completed by 81 of 143 (57%) students and seven of seven (100%) instructors. The mean overall student satisfaction score (1 not at all satisfied, 10 very satisfied) for in-person instruction was 8.2, and the mean score for remote instruction was 6.2 (P < .001). Overall, the instructors had a mean satisfaction score of 8 for in-person laboratories and a mean satisfaction score of 6 for remotely taught laboratories. Most students had a perception of greater one-on-one instructor attention in remote laboratories. Students reported similar confidence levels for three surgical procedures. CONCLUSION The described remote teaching method resulted in the perception of greater instructor attention given to students. Student and instructor satisfaction was lower with remote teaching than with in-person teaching. IMPACT The described method of remote teaching may be applied to teaching surgical students in settings when face-to-face instruction cannot be achieved and may be developed further to create an experience equivalent to face-to-face instruction.","Thieman Mankin, Kelley M; Cornell, Karen; Peycke, Laura; Dickerson, Vanna; Scallan, Elizabeth",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565116/,203

The result is a natural experiment that appears to endorse the efficacy of distance therapy. Consequently, the brick-and-mortar consulting room is no longer the presumptive therapeutic space for the conduct of psychodynamic psychiatric or other treatment approaches. The therapeutic space is reconceived as the place or medium intended for treatment and is distinguished from both the therapeutic relationship and conduct of treatment that occurs within that space. How different therapeutic spaces impact treatment is discussed with specific application to psychodynamic psychiatry and virtual venues.

87259,"Muscle mass, strength, and physical performance predicting activities of daily living: a meta-analysis.",2019-12-01,"OBJECTIVE Endovascular treatment of atherosclerotic stenosis of the left common carotid artery ostium (LCCAO) represents a technical challenge. Unlike stenting of other supra-aortic trunk lesions, LCCAO stenting is not able to be performed from a retrograde approach through the brachial artery. Stenting may be performed via a retrograde approach with a carotid artery cut-down or with total endovascular technique via a transfemoral approach. A consecutive case series is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the endovascular transfemoral LCCAO stenting technique. METHODS Our prospectively maintained database of elective neuroendovascular procedures was searched for cases of LCCAO angioplasty and stenting for atherosclerotic stenosis performed between January 2003 and April 2012. Cases identified were isolated and analyzed for clinical and anatomic data. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of periprocedural (30-day) neurological or cardiopulmonary complications. RESULTS Fourteen patients were treated with a transfemoral approach (mean arterial stenosis 72%; symptomatic lesions 86%). Six (43%) had tandem stenosis of the proximal left internal carotid artery. In these cases, embolic protection was used. Stent revascularization was a technical success in all 14 patients, resulting in <20% residual stenosis in each. One intraprocedural complication (transient ischemic attack) was noted in a patient with symptomatic stenosis. One additional patient was identified who was treated with retrograde stenting due to bilateral leg amputations and no femoral access, with no periprocedural complication. CONCLUSIONS In our experience, transfemoral stenting of stenotic LCCAO lesions is feasible and no permanent neurological or cardiopulmonary sequelae occurred in 14 patients treated with this technique.","Dumont, Travis M; Eller, Jorge L; Mokin, Maxim; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2012-010523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23125427/,203
87339,"The HScore for secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, calculated without a marrow biopsy, is consistently low in patients with COVID-19.",2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease characterised by systemic inflammation, which might enhance baseline thrombotic risk, especially in hospitalised patients. Little is, however, known about predictors of thrombotic complications in patients with COVID-19. METHODS We prospectively followed up 180 hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Demographics, clinical and laboratory features at presentation and past medical history were tested as predictors of the first thrombotic complication through multivariate Cox regression analysis and a categorical score generated based on the results. RESULTS Sixty-four thromboses were recorded in 54 patients, of whom seven with thrombosis on admission and 47 with thrombosis during hospitalisation. Patients with thrombosis were mainly Caucasian and diabetic, had marked baseline signs of inflammation and organ damage, lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher D-dimer levels and history of major haemorrhages. The latter three variables were independently associated to thrombotic complications and concurred to a 0-5 score, which accounted for 80% of the total sample variability. Patients with three or more points of the newly generated score were at higher risk for thrombotic complications (HR=4.9, p<0.001). Patients with thrombotic complications were more likely to be admitted to intensive care and/or to die (HR=1.9, p=0.036). Five of 180 patients were diagnosed with disseminated intravascular coagulation and three of them died. Eleven minor and no major bleeding events were observed. CONCLUSIONS Patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk for thrombosis and might be stratified on admission based lower Pao2/FiO2 ratio, higher D-dimer levels and history of major haemorrhages.","Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Calvisi, Stefania L; DE Lorenzo, Rebecca; DA Prat, Valentina; Borio, Giorgia; Gallina, Gabriele; Farolfi, Federica; Cavallo, Ludovica; Pascali, Maria; Castellani, Jacopo; Baccellieri, Domenico; Guzzo, Francesca; Baiardo Redaelli, Martina; Azzolini, Maria Luisa; Alba, Ada C; Zangrillo, Alberto; Bozzolo, Enrica P; Scotti, Raffaella; DI Lucca, Giuseppe; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Rovere Querini, Patrizia; D'Angelo, Armando; Tresoldi, Moreno",Minerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4806.21.07331-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114439/,203
87770,Continued vs interrupted direct oral anticoagulation for cardiac electronic device implantation: A systematic review.,2020-10-14,"INTRODUCTION Immobilization of hindlimb muscles in a shortened position results in an accelerated rate of inactivity-induced muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Similarly, prolonged controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) results in diaphragm inactivity and induces diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. Further, the application of positive end-expiratory airway pressure (PEEP) during mechanical ventilation would result in shortened diaphragm muscle fibers throughout the respiratory cycle. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that, compared to CMV without PEEP, the combination of PEEP and CMV would accelerate CMV-induced diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we combined PEEP with CMV or with assist-control mechanical ventilation (AMV) and determined the effects on diaphragm muscle atrophy and contractile properties. METHODS The PEEP level (8 cmH2O) that did not induce lung overdistension or compromise circulation was determined. In vivo segmental length changes of diaphragm muscle fiber were then measured using sonomicrometry. Sedated rabbits were randomized into seven groups: surgical controls and those receiving CMV, AMV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with or without PEEP for 2 days. We measured in vitro diaphragmatic force, diaphragm muscle morphometry, myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) protein isoforms, caspase 3, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx) and muscle ring finger protein 1 (MuRF1) mRNA. RESULTS PEEP shortened end-expiratory diaphragm muscle length by 15%, 14% and 12% with CMV, AMV and CPAP, respectively. Combined PEEP and CMV reduced tidal excursion of segmental diaphragm muscle length; consequently, tidal volume (VT) decreased. VT was maintained with combined PEEP and AMV. CMV alone decreased maximum tetanic force (Po) production by 35% versus control (P < 0.01). Combined PEEP and CMV did not decrease Po further. Po was preserved with AMV, with or without PEEP. Diaphragm muscle atrophy did not occur in any fiber types. Diaphragm MyHC shifted to the fast isoform in the combined PEEP and CMV group. In both the CMV and combined PEEP and CMV groups compared to controls, IGF-1 mRNAs were suppressed, whereas Caspase-3, MAFbx and MuRF1 mRNA expression were elevated. CONCLUSIONS Two days of diaphragm muscle fiber shortening with PEEP did not exacerbate CMV-induced diaphragm muscle dysfunction.","Sassoon, Catherine S H; Zhu, Ercheng; Fang, Liwei; Sieck, Gary C; Powers, Scott K",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-014-0494-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25212227/,203

An international consensus.,2014,"During the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies were performed to determine the mortality and incidence rates of coronavirus infection among patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, there has been no systematic approach or meta-analysis to evaluate the results worldwide. This meta-analysis summarized the existing evidence of incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 and related risk factors among patients with hemoglobinopathies with a focus on β-thalassemia (β-thal) and sickle cell disease. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Two authors independently screened the articles, extracted eligible ones, and assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The collected data were analyzed by the Stata software. The amount of heterogeneity was demonstrated by the I2 test. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with a hemoglobinopathy, β-thal and sickle cell disease was 4.44, 1.34, and 17.22 per 100,000 person-day, respectively, to June 15 2020. The mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) disorders was calculated as 1.07 per 1000 person-day in the same period. Our findings showed a higher incidence rate of COVID-19 in sickle cell disease patients compared to the general population. A slightly higher mortality rate was also observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies compared to the general population, possibly due to the associated risk factors and comorbidities in this vulnerable group, which underscore special care, timely diagnosis and management along with current immunization, were crucial in decreasing the frequency, disease severity and mortality of these patients.","Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Hosseini-Bensenjan, Mahnaz; Sayadi, Mehrab; Karimi, Mehran",Hemoglobin,https://doi.org/10.1080/03630269.2021.1927751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027786/,203

Several studies confirmed dromedary camels to be a potential reservoir and a source for human infection. Camels located on the Canary Islands were included in those studies and ca 10% of them were positive for MERS-CoV-specific antibodies. However, these findings could not be correctly interpreted because epidemiological information was not provided. Thus, further investigations were necessary to clarify these results. A total of 170 camels were investigated in this survey, of which seven (4.1%) were seropositive by ELISA. Epidemiological information revealed that all seropositive camels had been imported from Africa 20 or more years prior. We conclude that seropositive camels had contact with MERS-CoV in Africa and that there is no shedding of the virus among camels or people around the farms on the Canary Islands. However, the presence of antibodies in the camel herds should be monitored.","Gutiérrez, Carlos; Tejedor-Junco, María Teresa; González, Margarita; Lattwein, Erik; Renneker, Stefanie",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2015.20.37.30019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26536463/,203

RESULTS Twelve studies (including 4340 patients) were eligible. All studies were non-randomized and most had high risk of bias. Patients operated for inflammatory bowel disease had an increased risk of developing depression, compared with surgical patients with diverticulitis or inguinal hernia, but not cancer. In addition, patients with Crohn's disease had higher risk of depression after surgery compared with non-surgical patients. Patients with ulcerative colitis had higher risk of anxiety after surgery compared with surgical colorectal cancer patients. Charlson comorbidity score more than three and female gender were independent predictors for depression and anxiety following surgery.

The aim of this double-blinded, randomized noninferiority trial was to evaluate the effect of neostigmine administration on neuromuscular function when given to patients after spontaneous recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater. METHODS A total of 120 patients presenting for surgery requiring intubation were given a small dose of rocuronium. At the conclusion of surgery, 90 patients achieving a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater were randomized to receive either neostigmine 40 μg/kg or saline (control). Train-of-four ratios were measured from the time of reversal until postanesthesia care unit admission. Patients were monitored for postextubation adverse respiratory events and assessed for muscle strength. RESULTS Ninety patients achieved a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 or greater at the time of reversal. Mean train-of-four ratios in the control and neostigmine groups before reversal (1.02 vs. 1.03), 5 min postreversal (1.05 vs. 1.07), and at postanesthesia care unit admission (1.06 vs. 1.08) did not differ. The mean difference and corresponding 95% CI of the latter were -0.018 and -0.046 to 0.010. The incidences of postoperative hypoxemic events and episodes of airway obstruction were similar for the groups. The number of patients with postoperative signs and symptoms of muscle weakness did not differ between groups (except for double vision: 13 in the control group and 2 in the neostigmine group; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Administration of neostigmine at neuromuscular recovery was not associated with clinical evidence of anticholinesterase-induced muscle weakness.

Methods Thirty COVID-19 (eight mild type and twenty-two common type) patients were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and a semi-structured interview. Results All 30 patients reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The levels of depression and anxiety in mild type COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than those in common type COVID-19 patients. Significant improvements in depression (P<0.001) and anxiety (P<0.001) levels were found in the COVID-19 patients at the second evaluation compared with the baseline (admittance to hospital). More than 80% patients agreed that medical security, support from other patients, and a better living environment were the main reasons for improvements to their adverse psychological states. Conclusions Varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur in patients with COVID-19.

From a forensic point of view, this event is partly changing the manner in which forensic pathologists and all those who work in autopsy services operate, but above all, it is changing the patterns established for years by which cadavers were analysed postmortem. Objective: To present a review of the literature and a proposal for COVID autopsy protocols. To contain the infection risk, a revision of all the protocols that until now have been applied to the examination of bodies that require autopsy services is required. Data source: Currently, the diagnosis and postmortem analysis of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases plays a crucial role in scientific research. A review of the main recommendations proposed by international scientific societies regarding the risk of infection during autopsy has been carried out. Scientific papers currently available via the PubMed NCBI search engine on COVID-19 postmortem diagnosis were also examined. Discussion: Throughout the history of medicine, the role of autopsy has been fundamental to the understanding of multiple pathogenic processes that are investigated postmortem through autopsy. The purpose of the study is to propose an operating protocol that can be useful for all clinical and forensic autopsies with particular reference to the correct methods to be applied to the examination of positive or suspected COVID-19 cases regarding both the autopsy procedure and the collection and analysis of biological samples.","Aquila, Isabella; Sacco, Matteo Antonio; Abenavoli, Ludovico; Malara, Natalia; Arena, Vincenzo; Grassi, Simone; Ausania, Francesco; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Cristoforo; Gratteri, Santo; Oliva, Antonio; Ricci, Pietrantonio",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0165-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32383963/,203

The need for enhanced respiratory precautions for infected patients and patients under investigation has necessitated a new process for interventions and resuscitation. LOCAL PROBLEM Along with changing regulations and equipment, significant staff anxiety surrounded caring for infected patients and preparing for emergency situations. METHODS A huddle process was implemented in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit for acutely ill patients who required enhanced respiratory precautions and were at risk of imminent decompensation, or who required a bedside procedure. During a huddle, the multidisciplinary team used process maps displayed in patient rooms; the huddle process created a situational awareness of events among these teams. INTERVENTION After implementation of huddles, a survey was distributed to cardiac intensive care unit staff in order to understand their satisfaction with the huddle process. RESULTS A total of 36 staff responded to the survey. They thought the huddles helped them to prepare for resuscitation scenarios, helped limit the number of personnel responding to an emergency, and reduced their anxiety surrounding caring for these patients. Staff suggested generalizing this huddle process to all patients at acute risk for decompensation in the cardiac intensive care unit. CONCLUSIONS A novel huddle process created situational awareness among staff caring for patients requiring enhanced respiratory isolation because of COVID-19. Multidisciplinary huddles allowed staff from various disciplines to apply a process map for interventions and resuscitations among critically ill children with heart disease.","Christensen, Kristen; Colman, Nora; Van Voorhis, Kay; Daniels, Katherine; Culpepper, Haley; Hebbar, Kiran; Wolf, Michael",Critical care nurse,https://doi.org/10.4037/ccn2021975; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954707/,203

Indeed as the utilization of single port operations increases the need to approach the operating theatre with already-existing excellent hand-eye coordination skills increases. We suggest that there are a number of ways that trainees can begin to develop these necessary skills. Firstly, using computer games that involve changing horizons and orientations. Secondly, utilizing box-trainers to practice using the thoracoscopic instruments. Thirdly, learning how essential tools such as the stapler work. Trainees will then be able to progress to meaningfully assisting in theatre and indeed learning how to perform the operation themselves. At this stage is useful to observe expert surgeons whilst they operate-to watch both their technical and non-technical skills.

Fetuin-A is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obese patients with T2D have higher plasma fetuin-A levels than those without T2D. LECT-2 has positive correlation with the severity of both obesity and insulin resistance. The changes in plasma fetuin-A are not consistent after bariatric surgery and no studies have investigated the changes in LECT-2 on the obese patients with T2D after bariatric surgery. Methods Overall, 18 patients undergoing gastric bypass (GB) and 16 patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were enrolled. The fasting plasma fetuin-A and LECT-2 levels were measured at baseline, one week, three months, and one year after surgery. Results Both the GB and SG groups significantly decreased the body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, a body shape index; the triglyceride, fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c, C-peptide levels; and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) one year after surgery.

Fetuin-A had a near significant negative relationship with insulin (P = 0.056) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.050) in the SG group. Changes in fetuin-A had a significant positive relationship with changes in BMI (P = 0.031) and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.031) in the GB group and had a near significant positive correlation with FBS (P = 0.051) in the SG group. Discussion Neither GB nor SG modifies plasma levels of plasma fetuin-A or LECT-2 in T2D patients after surgery. The changes in plasma fetuin-A have a positive correlation with those of the BMI and waist-to-hip ratio 12 months after GB.","Huang, Hsien-Hao; Yeh, Chun; Chen, Jung-Chien; Lee, Tzong-Hsi; Chen, Shu-Chun; Lee, Wei-Jei; Chen, Chih-Yen",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29910974/,203
97600,Refixation techniques and approaches for distal biceps tendon ruptures: a systematic review of clinical studies.,2016,"Seventeen per cent of the world's population is estimated to be at risk of inadequate zinc intake, which could in part be addressed by zinc fortification of widely consumed foods. We conducted a review of efficacy and effectiveness studies to ascertain the effect of zinc fortification [postharvest fortification of an industrially produced food or beverage; alone or with multiple micronutrients (MMN)] on a range of health outcomes. Previous reviews have required that the effect of zinc be isolated; because zinc is always cofortified with MMN in existing fortification programs, we did not impose this condition. Outcomes assessed were zinc-related biomarkers (plasma or serum, hair or urine zinc concentrations, comet assay, plasma fatty acid concentrations, and the proportion of and total zinc absorbed in the intestine from the diet), child anthropometry, morbidity, mortality, cognition, plasma or serum iron and copper concentrations, and for observational studies, a change in consumption of the food vehicle. Fifty-nine studies were included in the review; 54 in meta-analyses, totaling 73 comparisons. Zinc fortification with and without MMN increased plasma zinc concentrations (efficacy, n = 27: 4.68 μg/dL; 95% CI: 2.62-6.75; effectiveness, n = 13: 6.28 μg/dL; 95% CI: 5.03-7.77 μg/dL) and reduced the prevalence of zinc deficiency (efficacy, n = 11: OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.60-0.96; effectiveness, n = 10: OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31-0.64). There were statistically significant increases in child weight (efficacy, n = 11: 0.43 kg, 95% CI: 0.11-0.75 kg), improvements in short-term auditory memory (efficacy, n = 3: 0.32 point, 95% CI: 0.13-0.50 point), and decreased incidence of diarrhea (efficacy, n = 3: RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68-0.92) and fever (efficacy, n = 2: RR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.97). However, these effects cannot be solely attributed to zinc. Our review found that zinc fortification with or without MMN reduced the prevalence of zinc deficiency and may provide health and functional benefits, including a reduced incidence of diarrhea.","Tsang, Becky L; Holsted, Erin; McDonald, Christine M; Brown, Kenneth H; Black, Robert; Mbuya, Mduduzi N N; Grant, Frederick; Rowe, Laura A; Manger, Mari S",Advances in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmab065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167148/,203

99976,Update to coagulopathy in COVID-19: Manifestations and management.,2020-12-15,"Background Randomized controlled trials on menopausal hormone therapy in humans have not confirmed the benefit of estrogens on cardiovascular disease found in animal studies. Flawed methodology or publication bias in animal studies may explain the dicrepancy. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether publication of the randomized controlled trials Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study and Women's Health Initiative influenced study authors' assessment of research findings (confirmation bias) as well as to investigate publication bias and small-study effects in animal studies of estrogen effects on atherosclerosis. Methods The data source for this study was PubMed from inception to 2018. We selected animal studies with cardiovascular outcomes comparing 17-β-estradiol, its natural metabolites, or conjugated equine estrogen with control. Qualitative data were extracted on authors' conclusions about estrogen effects on cardiovascular disease, as well as quantitative data for atherosclerosis outcomes. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were used. Publication bias/small-study effects were assessed using funnel plots and Egger's regression. Trim-and-fill plots and extrapolation from Egger's regression were used to adjust for publication bias. The main outcomes and measures were the primary study authors' interpretation of their own results, and estrogen effects on cardiovascular disease in general before and after publication of the Women's health Initiative study (2003). The effects of estrogens on atherosclerosis were measured as standardized mean difference between intervention and control. Results Of 1925 studies retrieved, 360 were eligible for analyses. Study-specific statements concluded that estrogens were protective against cardiovascular disease in 75% of studies before 2003 and 78% after, but the percentage of general statements about estrogens being cardioprotective changed from 70% to 40%. Meta-analyses showed less atherosclerosis in estrogen-treated animals. Extremely skewed funnel plots and P < .01 in Egger's regression suggested publication bias and/or exaggerated effects in small studies, which was more pronounced after 2002. There was substantial heterogeneity of effects (I 2 = 68%-86%) overall and in all subgroups except cynomolgus monkeys (I 2 = 9%), the only animal subgroup without clear bias. Adjusting for publication bias, overall estimates of estrogen effects on atherosclerosis were close to null effect. Conclusions We found substantial evidence of publication bias but not of confirmation bias. Publication bias and flawed small studies may partly explain why findings differ between animal studies and clinical trials on the effect of estrogens on cardiovascular disease.","Friis Berntsen, Christopher; Rootwelt, Pernille; Dahm, Anders Erik Astrup",Research and practice in thrombosis and haemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1002/rth2.12507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013151/,203
100142,A flowchart strategy for children with leukemia during COVID-19: A nondesignated hospital's experience.,2020-07-25,"Background Early diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is critical. The WatchPAT (WP) device was shown to be accurate for the diagnosis of sleep apnea; however, studies using the WatchPAT device have thus far excluded patients with arrhythmias due to the potential effect of arrhythmias on the peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) amplitude and pulse rate changes. Purpose To examine the accuracy of the WP in detecting sleep apnea in patients with AF. Patients and Methods Patients with AF underwent simultaneous WP and PSG studies in 11 sleep centers. PSG scoring was blinded to the automatically analyzed WP data. Results A total of 101 patients with AF (70 males) were recruited. Forty-six had AF episodes during the overnight sleep study. A significant correlation was found between the PSG-derived AHI and the WP- derived AHI (r=0.80, p<0.0001). There was a good agreement between PSG-derived AHI and WP-derived AHI (mean difference of AHI: -0.02±13.2). Using a threshold of AHI ≥15 per hour of sleep, the sensitivity and specificity of the WP were 0.88 and 0.63, respectively. The overall accuracy in sleep staging between WP and PSG was 62% with Kappa agreement of 0.42. Conclusion WP can detect sleep apnea events in patients with AF. AF should not be an exclusion criterion for using the device. This finding may be of even greater importance in the era of the COVID19 epidemic, when sleep labs were closed and most studies were home based.","Tauman, Riva; Berall, Murray; Berry, Richard; Etzioni, Tamar; Shrater, Noam; Hwang, Dennis; Marai, Ibrahim; Manthena, Prasanth; Rama, Anil; Spiegel, Rebecca; Penzel, Thomas; Koren Morag, Nira; Pillar, Giora",Nature and science of sleep,https://doi.org/10.2147/nss.s278752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33299372/,203

This is an important question given the widespread use of antidepressant medication and the significant medical, social, legal and health consequences of violence. We aim to: (1) systematically identify observational studies and randomised controlled trials that quantify the relationship between antidepressant use and interpersonal violence; (2) assess the quality of studies that quantify the relationship between antidepressant use and interpersonal violence and (3) estimate the pooled prevalence and measure of effect for the relationship between antidepressant use and interpersonal violence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and the Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed literature. Our primary outcome is the perpetration of violent acts directed at others. Our secondary outcome is physical, interpersonal aggression measured through validated surveys. We will include randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies that examine the association between the use of antidepressants and violence perpetration and/or physical aggression. No restrictions will be placed on the population. We will use the Methodological Standard for Epidemiological Research scale to assess the quality of included studies. We will provide an overview of the included studies and assess heterogeneity and publication bias. If there are sufficient studies, we will conduct meta-analyses to examine the possible association between antidepressants and violence, and undertake meta-regression to examine the effect of antidepressant class, length of follow-up, age of participants and population subgroups on the association between antidepressants and violence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethics approval is required. Our findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal article and conference presentations.

104131,Systematic review of the antiviral properties of TRIM56: a potential therapeutic intervention for COVID-19.,2020-09-09,"Alphaviral enzymes are synthesized in a single polypeptide. The nonstructural polyprotein (nsP) is processed by its nsP2 cysteine protease to produce active enzymes essential for viral replication. Viral proteases are highly specific and recognize conserved cleavage site motif sequences (~6-8 amino acids). In several Group IV viruses, the nsP protease(s) cleavage site motif sequences can be found in specific host proteins involved in generating the innate immune responses and, in some cases, the targeted proteins appear to be linked to the virus-induced phenotype. These viruses utilize short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) for targeted destruction of host proteins. To identify SSHHPS the viral protease cleavage site motif sequences can be inputted into BLAST and the host genome(s) can be searched. Cleavage initially can be tested using the purified nsP viral protease and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) substrates made in E. coli. The FRET substrates contain cyan and yellow fluorescent protein and the cleavage site sequence (CFP-sequence-YFP). This protease assay can be used continuously in a plate reader or discontinuously in SDS-PAGE gels. Models of the bound peptide substrates can be generated in silico to guide substrate selection and mutagenesis studies. CFP/YFP substrates have also been utilized to identify protease inhibitors. These in vitro and in silico methods can be used in combination with cell-based assays to determine if the targeted host protein affects viral replication.","Hu, Xin; Compton, Jaimee R; Legler, Patricia M",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/60421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31904018/,203

The present waitlist-controlled trial examined the preliminary efficacy of a family-based behavioral parenting intervention (i.e., the iCALM Telehealth Program) that draws on Parent-Child Interaction Therapy and videoconferencing to remotely deliver clinician-led care for anxiety in early childhood. Young children (3-8 years) with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder (N = 40; 65% from ethnic/racial minority backgrounds) were randomly assigned to iCALM or waitlist. Intent-to-treat analyses found that at post, independent evaluators classified roughly half of the iCALM-treated children, but only 6% of waitlist children, as ""Responders"" (Wald test = 4.51; p = .03). By Post, iCALM led to significantly greater reductions than waitlist in child anxiety symptoms, fear, discomfort, and anxiety-related social impairment, and also led to greater improvements in child soothability. By 6-month follow-up, the percentage of iCALM-treated children classified as ""Responders"" rose to roughly 60%. Exploratory moderation tests found iCALM was particularly effective in reducing life impairments and parental distress among families presenting with higher, relative to lower, levels of baseline parental accommodation. The present findings add to a growing body of research supporting the promise of technology-based strategies for broadening the portfolio of options for delivering clinician-led mental health services.","Comer, Jonathan S; Furr, Jami M; Del Busto, Cristina; Silva, Karina; Hong, Natalie; Poznanski, Bridget; Sanchez, Amanda; Cornacchio, Danielle; Herrera, Aileen; Coxe, Stefany; Miguel, Elizabeth; Georgiadis, Christopher; Conroy, Kristina; Puliafico, Anthony",Behavior therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.beth.2021.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452671/,203

Here, we introduce the varied application of intercostal trans-diaphragmatic ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy, and describe the management of intercostal ports with key technical points. METHODS From January 2013 to December 2017, 180 patients underwent laparoscopic hepatectomy. In 32 of these patients (17.8%), intercostal ports (31 right and one left) were applied, and we analyzed the feasibility and safety of intercostal ports during laparoscopic hepatectomy. RESULTS The main tumor location was segment VII and VIII (78%). The major type of laparoscopic hepatectomy was partial hepatectomy (91%). In the majority of cases (66%) the number and size of intercostal trocars was a single 5-mm port. The median operative time and blood loss were 232 min and 50 mL, respectively. A chest drain was placed via the hole of the intercostal port on the chest wall in two cases (6.3%). The median duration of the post-operative hospital stay was 6 days. There was no conversion, and a pure laparoscopic hepatectomy was achieved in all cases. There was no mortality. As for complications due to the application of intercostal ports, an asymptomatic pneumothorax was detected in only one case, and it was cured by conservative treatment. CONCLUSIONS The ribcage and diaphragm could be overcome as barriers to laparoscopic access by the placement of intercostal ports with minimal access during laparoscopic hepatectomy. The use of an intercostal port and proper management allows for a feasible approach and safe resection during laparoscopic hepatectomy.","Hayashi, Hiromitsu; Yamashita, Yo-Ichi; Okabe, Hirohisa; Imai, Katsunori; Higashi, Takaaki; Yamamura, Kensuke; Chikamoto, Akira; Beppu, Toru; Takamori, Hiroshi; Baba, Hideo",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32559223/,203
108393,Alveolar Recruitment Strategies After Cardiac Surgery-Reply.,2017,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) medical group had a much lower primary end point rate than predicted from the preceding Warfarin Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial. This result has been attributed to the aggressive medical therapy used in SAMMPRIS, but an alternative hypothesis is that SAMMPRIS patients were at lower risk. We undertook analyses to evaluate these competing hypotheses. METHODS Using proportional hazards regression, we compared the SAMMPRIS primary end point between SAMMPRIS medical patients and WASID patients meeting the same qualifying criteria adjusted for confounding baseline characteristics. RESULTS The unadjusted comparison of the SAMMPRIS primary end point showed a significantly higher risk for WASID patients (P=0.009, logrank test) with 12 month Kaplan-Meier estimates of 21.9% in WASID and 12.6% in SAMMPRIS and hazard ratio 1.9 (95% confidence interval =1.2-3.0). The analyses identified the following confounding factors that varied between the studies and that conferred a higher risk: lack of statin use at enrollment (hazard ratio =1.8, 95% confidence interval =1.1-2.9, P=0.027) that was more prevalent among WASID patients (39% versus 14%, P<0.0001) and prior infarcts in the territory of the symptomatic vessel (hazard ratio =1.8, 95% confidence interval =1.1-2.9, P=0.023) that was more prevalent among SAMMPRIS patients (34% versus 22%, P=0.015).The hazard ratio for WASID versus SAMMPRIS adjusted for these 2 characteristics was 1.9 (95% confidence interval =1.1-3.2). CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for confounding baseline characteristics, WASID patients had an almost 2-fold higher risk of the SAMMPRIS primary end point, which supports the hypothesis that the lower rate of the primary end point in the medical arm of SAMMPRIS compared with WASID patients was as a result of the aggressive medical management used in SAMMPRIS.

Importantly, in vivo analysis shows that these sequences regulate the translation and replication of the BMV genome. Furthermore, both RNA-target sequences resemble those found for Hfq, the LSm counterpart in bacteria, suggesting conservation through evolution.

In-stent restenosis is an inflammatory response of the immune system to endovascular stent implantation in atherosclerotic patients. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymers are of great interest in this field in order to limit the side effects of stent treatments. Poly([R,S]-3,3-dimethylmalic acid) (PDMMLA) is a new biodegradable statistical polyester which presents promising properties as a stent coating. In this work, we studied by dynamic tensiometry, the adhesion of extracellular matrix proteins (bovine serum albumin, fibronectin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin) and plasma membrane proteoglycan (syndecan-4) on three PDMMLA derivatives with different hydrophilicity levels. The results show that proteins have different adhesion profiles and affinity on these surfaces. They show similar behavior on the most hydrophilic surface, making hydrophilic, ionic and hydrogen type bonds. Then we compared each protein's individual profile to that of a mixture of all studied proteins. The comparison shows that vitronectin and syndecan-4 are the quantitatively dominating proteins adsorbed by specific interactions. Based on the results from previous studies, this work allowed us to identify the most important PDMMLA surface as a promising biomaterial for bioactive stent-coating.","Gholizadeh, Elnaz; Belibel, Rima; Mora, Laurence; Letourneur, Didier; Barbaud, Christel","Colloids and surfaces.

111402,Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease Before and After COVID-19-An Overview and Call for Ongoing Investigation.,2021-09-01,"Background: Given the potential for increased substance use during COVID-19, we examined (1) young adults' changes in cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, and alcohol use from pre- to during COVID-19; and (2) related risk/protective factors. These findings could inform intervention efforts aimed at curbing increases in substance use during periods of societal stress. Methods: We analyzed Wave 3 (W3; September-December 2019) and Wave 4 (W4; March-May 2020) from the Vape shop Advertising, Place characteristics and Effects Surveillance (VAPES), a 2-year, five-wave longitudinal study of young adults across six metropolitan areas. We examined risk/protective factors (i.e. adverse childhood experiences [ACEs], depressive symptoms, resilience) in relation to changes in past 30-day substance use frequency. Results: In this sample (N = 1084, Mage=24.76, SD = 4.70; 51.8% female; 73.6% White; 12.5% Hispanic), W3/W4 past 30-day use prevalence was: 29.1% cigarettes (19.4% increased/26.4% decreased), 36.5% e-cigarettes (23.2% increased/28.6% decreased), 49.4% marijuana (27.2% increased/21.2% decreased), and 84.8% alcohol (32.9% increased/20.7% decreased). Multivariate regressions indicated that, greater increases were predicted by: for e-cigarettes, greater ACEs; and for alcohol, greater depression. Among those with low resilience, predictors included: for e-cigarettes, greater depression; and for marijuana, greater ACEs. Conclusions: Interventions to reduce substance use during societal stressors should target both risk and protective factors, particularly resilience.","Romm, Katelyn F; Patterson, Brooke; Crawford, Natalie D; Posner, Heather; West, Carly D; Wedding, DeEnna; Horn, Kimberly; Berg, Carla J",Substance abuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2021.1930629; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34086537/,203
111512,Smaller Regional Brain Volumes Predict Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at 3 Months After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,2020-10-27,"OBJECTIVE This study was conducted to evaluate recurrence and survival among patients who underwent intraoperative margin re-resection for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). BACKGROUND Among patients who receive intraoperative margin re-resection, the relation between final margin status, pattern of recurrence, and survival is largely unknown. METHODS Three hundred thirty-two patients who underwent hepatic resection for CRLM between 2000 and 2013 were identified. Demographics, operative data, pathologic margin status, site of recurrence, and long-term survival data were collected and analyzed. Patients were stratified in three groups based on their margin status: R0, R1, and R1 → R0. RESULTS R0 resections were achieved in 247 (74.4%) patients, 61 (18.4%) patients had an R1 resection, whereas 24 (7.2%) had an R1 → R0. Median survival for patients undergoing R0 resections was 50.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 49.2-66.2) months versus 63.0 (95% CI 50.3-70.5) months for patients undergoing R1 resections versus 49.2 (95% CI 29.9-NA) months for patients undergoing intraoperative margin re-resection (P > 0.05). Differences in recurrence rate and pattern were not significant between the three groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION In the era of modern systemic chemotherapy, it seems that the impact of margin status on outcomes may be minimal compared to that of patient and tumor factors. In this scenario, margin re-resection to achieve R0 status does not improve long-term outcomes.","Margonis, Georgios A; Spolverato, Gaya; Kim, Yuhree; Ejaz, Aslam; Pawlik, Timothy M",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-014-2710-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25451734/,203

The aim of this study was to detect the expression of eIF3f in gastric carcinoma (GC), which until now has not been reported. METHODS Expression of eIF3f was detected by immunohistochemistry in GC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT) from 195 patients with stage I-III GC who underwent curative gastrectomy. Clinicopathological results, including survival, were analyzed. RESULTS Expression rate of eIF3f in GC and ANCT were 44.8 and 81.7% respectively. Low expression of eIF3f was significantly associated with an increased serum level of carcinoma embryonic antigen (p = 0.02), but not with levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (p = 0.29). eIF3f levels were linked to more advanced tumor stages and likelihood of recurrence (all p < 0.05).The Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that decreased expression of eIF3f was a significant factor for a poor prognosis for GC patients (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION eIF3f may play an important role in recurrence. Its function and potential as a prognostic marker should be further verified in GC.","Cheng, Yu; Jia, Cuimei; Li, Guanghua; Li, Honglun",Oncology research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1159/000360779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24732644/,203

We aimed to assess the most frequent symptoms amongst pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary hospital in Mexico City. METHODS A cross-sectional study of pregnant women attending the National Institute of Perinatology in Mexico City was performed. All women who attended the hospital, despite their symptoms, were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A multivariate-age-adjusted logistic regression was used to assess the association between the main outcome and each characteristic of the clinical history. RESULTS A total of 1880 women were included in the data analysis. Among all women, 30.74% (n = 578) had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from which 2.7 (n = 50) were symptomatic. Symptoms associated with a positive PCR result were headache (p=.01), dyspnea (p=.043), and myalgia (p=.043).

113749,Letter: unknown denominator and misleading conclusions in Covid-19-authors' reply.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Liver transplantation is the best treatment option for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although centers use strict selection criteria, there is a risk of recurrence, reaching up to 20% which are mostly observed within two years following the procedure. The survival after the recurrence is poor and it has been reported to be between 7-16 months. This poor prognosis is due to the systemic course of the recurrence even its presentation is local initially. RESULTS The clinical management and treatment algorithm of recurrence is challenging and there is no guideline regarding the situation. Staging of the disease and multi-disciplinary approach are important. The decision for choice of treatment is given depending on the localization and spread of the recurrence. Adjusting and switching the immunosuppressive therapy should be the first attempt. When the recurrence is limited or confined to resectable regions, surgery should be the choice of treatment. Multiple recurrence sites such as adrenal glands, lung, lymph nodes are not contraindication for curative surgery. Resection of the graft for intrahepatic recurrence is the most beneficial procedure for survival. If resection is not possible due to advanced hepatic disease, loco-regional therapies such as TACE, RF, microwave ablation should be considered. SBRT may be an alternative both for hepatic and extra-hepatic recurrence. In case of systemic disease, sorafenib should be the drug choice.","Sarici, Baris; Isik, Burak; Yilmaz, Sezai",Journal of gastrointestinal cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12029-020-00498-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839944/,203

113894,[Medical rehabilitation of patients with pneumonia associated with the new COVID-19 coronavirus infection].,2020,"INTRODUCTION Silent coronary heart disease is frequently undetected in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and pre diabetes determined by glucose intolerance (GI). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) have been considered markers of cardiovascular mortality, coronary heart disease and chronic renal failure. AIMS To evaluate the incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the relationship between urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and PWV in type 2 DM with silent CAD. METHODS We analyzed 92 individuals (44 male), 49 (60±7y) type 2 DM non-insulin dependents and 43 prediabetics (43±4y), with Grade I-II hypertension and no symptoms of CAD. All type 2 DM patients were under antidiabetic treatment with an A1C hemoglobin between 5.5 and 6.5%. Every patient underwent a myocardial perfusion SPECT scan. In those subjects with ischemic patterns, a coronary angiography was performed. In addition, a PWV, glomerular filtration rate, and ACR were evaluated. STATISTICS mean±SEM, and ANOVA among groups. RESULTS 48.59% of DM2 and 25.58% of GI patients had silent coronary artery disease. DM2 and GI patients with CAD had higher ACR and PWV and reduced GFR. DM2 and GI showed a negative relationship between GFR and ACR. Moreover, this relation was also observed in different levels of GFR (>60 ml/min and <60ml.min (p<0.05) in patients with CAD, suggesting a cardio-renal interaction in DM2. CONCLUSIONS Higher PWV, lower GFR and ACR predict the incidence of CAD in DM2. Dysglycemic individuals also represent a group of higher risk for coronary artery disease with similar predictors showed in DM2. Diabetic and prediabetics, still develop renal microalbuminuria. Thus, PWV seems to represent a reliable marker of renal impairment and coronary artery disease.","Sanchez, Ramiro A; Sanchez, Maria Josefina; Ramirez, Agustin J",Current hypertension reviews,https://doi.org/10.2174/1573402116999201210194817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305706/,203

OBJECTIVE To describe our technique of transvesical robotic simple prostatectomy (RSP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From May 2011 to April 2013, 25 patients underwent RSP. SURGICAL PROCEDURE We performed RSP using our technique. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline demographics, pathology data, perioperative complications, 90-d complications, and functional outcomes were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Mean patient age was 72.9 yr (range: 54-88), baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 23.9 (range: 9-35), prostate volume was 149.6 ml (range: 91-260), postvoid residual (PVR) was 208.1 ml (range: 72-800), maximum flow rate (Qmax) was 11.3 ml/s, and preoperative prostate-specific antigen was 9.4 ng/ml (range: 1.9-56.3). Eight patients were catheter dependent before surgery. Mean operative time was 214 min (range: 165-345), estimated blood loss was 143 ml (range: 50-350), and the hospital stay was 4 d (range: 2-8). There were no intraoperative complications and no conversions to open surgery. Five patients had a concomitant robotic procedure performed. Early functional outcomes demonstrated significant improvement from baseline with an 85% reduction in mean IPSS (p<0.0001), an 82.2% reduction in mean PVR (p=0.014), and a 77% increase in mean Qmax (p=0.20). This study is limited by small sample size and short follow-up period. One patient had a urinary tract infection; two had recurrent hematuria, one requiring transfusion; one patient had clot retention and extravasation, requiring reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RSP is safe and effective. Good functional outcomes suggest it is a viable option for BPH and larger glands and can be used for patients requiring concomitant procedures. PATIENT SUMMARY We describe the technique and report the initial results of a series of cases of transvesical robotic simple prostatectomy. The procedure is both feasible and safe and a good option for benign prostatic hyperplasia with larger glands.","Leslie, Scott; Abreu, Andre Luis de Castro; Chopra, Sameer; Ramos, Patrick; Park, Daniel; Berger, Andre K; Desai, Mihir M; Gill, Inderbir S; Aron, Monish",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.12.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412229/,203

Angiogenesis is a basic process that occurs during tumor growth and metastasis. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway is a key regulator of angiogenesis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether fisetin affects angiogenesis through the VEGFR pathway. In the present study, Y79 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml VEGF in the presence of fisetin at concentrations of 0, 25, 50 and 100 µM. A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect proliferation and the Transwell and Matrigel assays were used to assess cell migration and invasion, respectively. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was applied to measure the expression level of VEGFR mRNA and western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expression of VEGFR. An immunofluorescence assay was used to detect the expression of VEGFR. Angiogenesis in vitro was assessed by a tube formation assay. The results demonstrated that fisetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of Y79 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Fisetin also inhibited the migration and invasion of Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, fisetin inhibited the expression of VEGFR in Y79 cells in a dose-dependent manner and tumor angiogenesis in vitro. Thus, fisetin was found to inhibit angiogenesis via inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathway, and could be used as a candidate drug to inhibit angiogenesis in retinoblastoma.","Wang, Liangjun; Chen, Ning; Cheng, Hongxia",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724364/,203

METHODS 1917 corneae (1000 patients) were allocated to decades of age, classified according to Belin's ABCD KC grading system and the stage distribution was analysed. RESULTS 73 per cent (n=728) of the patients were males, 27% (n=272) were females. The highest KC prevalence occurred between 21 and 30 years (n=585 corneae, 294 patients). Regarding anterior (A) and posterior (B) curvature, the frequency of A was significantly higher than B in all age groups for stage 0, 1 and 2 (A0>B0; A1>B1; A2>B2; p<0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). There was no significant difference between the number of A3 and B3, but significantly more corneae were classified as B4 than A4 in all age groups (p<0.02). The most frequent A|B combinations were A4|B4 (n=451), A0|B0 (n=311), A2|B4 (n=242), A2|B2 (n=189) and A1|B2 (n=154). Concerning thinnest pachymetry (C), most corneae in all age groups were classified as C0>C1>C2>C3>C4 (p<0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). For the best distance visual acuity (D), a significantly higher number of corneae were classified as D1 compared to D0 (p<0.008; D1>D0>D2>D3>D4). CONCLUSION The stage distributions in all age groups were similar. Early KC rather becomes manifest in the posterior than the anterior corneal curvature whereas advanced stages of posterior corneal curvature coincide with early and advanced stages of anterior corneal curvature. Thus, this study emphasises the necessity of posterior corneal surface assessment in KC as enabled by the ABCD grading system.","Flockerzi, Elias; Xanthopoulou, Kassandra; Goebels, Susanne Christiane; Zemova, Elena; Razafimino, Sonia; Hamon, Loïc; Jullien, Theresia; Klühspies, Ulrike; Eppig, Timo; Langenbucher, Achim; Seitz, Berthold",The British journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830125/,203

This study describes its characteristics and the factors that can condition and predict it. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted a prospective, descriptive, observational study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 between April and May 2020 with muscle weakness. A motor balance equal to or lower than 3/5 according to the modified Medical Research Council muscle strength scale was considered to be severe clinical impairment. Altogether 25 analytical studies, 16 neurophysiological studies and one muscle biopsy were performed, with a telephone follow-up at one month, a comparative analysis between the groups with and without severe compromise, and determination of cut-off points for analytical parameters to predict severe involvement using ROC curves. RESULTS The sample consisted of 25 patients with a mean age of 58 years (standard deviation ± 9). The median length of stay in the ICU was 27.5 days. All the electromyograms exhibited a myogenic pattern and 75% also showed neuropathy. The group with severe clinical involvement had higher levels of D-dimer (p = 0.08), lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.03) and interleukin-6 (p = 0.10), and the combination of the alteration of any two of these three parameters predicted severe involvement with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76.9%. At one month of follow-up, 36% were unable to walk autonomously and 92% continued with muscle weakness. CONCLUSIONS Weakness in severe COVID-19 patients has a major clinical impact. Its early detection and study by means of predictors of its development may allow for better management. The absence in some cases of classical risk factors for ICU-acquired weakness suggests a different pathophysiology.","Ballvé, A; Llauradó, A; Palasí, A; Quintana, M; Martínez-Sáez, E; Laínez, E; Raguer, N; Juntas-Morales, R",Revista de neurologia,https://doi.org/10.33588/rn.7301.2021042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170003/,203
117971,Retinal findings in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19.,2020-10-16,"OBJECTIVES To assess whether atherosclerosis is involved in the development of overactive bladder and the function of lower urinary tract after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. METHODS The present cohort consisted of 80 consecutive participants. The preoperative cardio-ankle vascular index was used to evaluate the presence of atherosclerosis. The present cohort was split into two groups, the atherosclerotic group, whose cardio-ankle vascular index was ≥9.0, and the control group, whose index was <9.0. The overactive bladder symptom score and lower urinary tract function were compared for 12 months after surgery. RESULTS The total score of the questionnaire was significantly higher at 6 and 9 months after surgery in the atherosclerosis group (P = 0.04, P = 0.03, respectively). Both the urgency and urgency incontinence subscores of the questionnaire showed a parallel tendency to that of the total score after surgery. At 3 months after surgery, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of de novo overactive bladder in the atherosclerosis group (P = 0.04). At 9 and 12 months after surgery, there was a significant decrease of voided volume in the atherosclerotic group (P < 0.01, P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Atherosclerosis delays the improvement in both overactive bladder symptoms and storage function postoperatively, and it is involved in the transient increase in the prevalence of de novo overactive bladder. Atherosclerosis might be a predictor of the development of overactive bladder after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.","Koguchi, Tomoyuki; Haga, Nobuhiro; Matsuoka, Kanako; Yabe, Michihiro; Hoshi, Seiji; Ogawa, Soichiro; Kataoka, Masao; Akaihata, Hidenori; Sato, Yuichi; Hata, Junya; Ishibashi, Kei; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.13848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417567/,203

To inform research directions in rehabilitation for all adults (aged 18 years and older), we will conduct a scoping review to describe (1) the characteristics of frail adult individuals included in rehabilitation interventions (eg, age range, inclusion and exclusion criteria that are applied), (2) the type of rehabilitation interventions that are used for individuals who are considered frail and (3) the commonly reported outcome measures used for these rehabilitation interventions. METHODS This scoping review will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. Ageline, Cochrane CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, Pubmed, OTSeeker, PeDRO, PsycINFO and Scopus databases will be systematically searched for articles relevant to rehabilitation interventions and health services. To be eligible for inclusion, studies must report on the outcomes from an intervention that involves all individuals (aged 18 and older) who are considered frail. Only English-language, peer-reviewed publications between 1990 and 2018 will be included. A two-step screening process will consist of (1) a title and abstract review and (2) full-text review. In both levels of screening, a minimum of two investigators will independently screen the title and abstract of all retrieved citations for inclusion against a set of minimum inclusion criteria. ANALYSIS Results will be presented as a narrative synthesis to facilitate the integration of diverse evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This study does not require ethics approval. By examining the current state of rehabilitation interventions for frail adults, this scoping review can offer insight into rehabilitation needs and models of care. It can also guide future rehabilitation research for frail adults.

METHODS From January 2012 and March 2016, 60 eligible patients with chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI) received all arthroscopic remnant-preserving reconstruction or open reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament using semitendinosus autograft. They were divided into the arthroscopic group (n = 28) and the open group (n = 32). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS),visual analog scale (VAS), and Karlsson scores and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes pre-operatively and at six and 12 months and the final follow-up of at least 24 months post-operatively, with SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores evaluated for quality of life, and the anterior talar translation and talar tilt measurements for radiologic outcomes. RESULTS There was no difference in pre-operative demographics between two groups (P > 0.05). At the final follow-up, the AOFAS, VAS, Karlsson, SF-36 PCS, and MCS scores improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found in AOFAS (91.9 ± 6.8 vs 91.1 ± 5.5), VAS (2.7 ± 1.7 vs 2.5 ± 1.6), Karlsson (95.3 ± 6.7 vs 94.8 ± 6.5), SF-36 PCS (53.2 ± 6.1 vs 52.9 ± 5.7), and MCS scores (55.7 ± 5.8 vs 54.2 ± 5.4) between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in post-operative operated/non-operated ankle ROM between two groups (P > 0.05). No significant difference was observed in talar tilt angle (7.6 ± 4.1° vs 6.8 ± 3.6°) and anterior talar translation (5.8 ± 1.7 mm vs 5.7 ± 1.5 mm) between the two groups at the final follow-up (P > 0.05), although these two variables improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.05). No severe complications were encountered in both groups during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS The modified all-inside arthroscopic remnant-preserving technique of lateral ankle ligament reconstruction could produce excellent clinical and radiologic outcomes comparable with open reconstruction.","Zhang, Kaibin; Khan, Abdul Aleem; Dai, Hanhao; Li, Yang; Tao, Tianqi; Jiang, Yiqiu; Gui, Jianchao",International orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04773-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803356/,203

To date, Remdesivir has been the only antiviral authorized by FDA as therapy for emergency use. One of the potential complications of this infection is cytokine storm, which optimal treatment remains unknown. We present the case of a 48-year-old man with no past medical history who presented to the hospital with dyspnea, cough, subjective fever, and diarrhea for 10 days. Nasopharyngeal PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2. His respiratory status rapidly worsened to the point of requiring supplemental oxygen by high flow nasal cannula with FiO2 of 80%. Chest computed tomography showed confluent ground glass opacities in upper lobes accompanied by patchy airspace opacities in lower lobes bilaterally. He was started on hydroxychloroquine, which was switched to Remdesivir when it became available. Then, methylprednisolone was initiated for suspected cytokine storm. The patients oxygenation improved significantly over the following days and he was discharged home with no oxygen supplementation and saturating 96% on room air. Our case illustrates the role of Remdesivir for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We also observed a possible clinical benefit of corticosteroids in the context of suspected cytokine storm. Further studies are needed to evaluate this therapeutic strategy.","Gonzales-Zamora, José A; Quiroz, Tanya; Vega, Ana D",Medwave,https://doi.org/10.5867/medwave.2020.07.7998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876623/,203
120740,"Impact of right-handedness on anaesthetic sensitivity, intra-operative awareness and postoperative mortality.",2014,"Polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS, previously known as ""TIGER"") utilizes PCR with broad-range primers to amplify products from a wide array of organisms within a taxonomic group, followed by analysis of PCR amplicons using mass spectrometry. Computer analysis of precise masses allows for calculations of base compositions for the broad-range PCR products, which can then be compared to a database for identification. PCR/ESI-MS has the benefits of PCR in sensitivity and high-throughput capacity, but also has the distinct advantage of being able to detect and identify organisms with no prior characterization or sequence data. Existing broad range PCR primers, designed with an emphasis on human pathogens, were tested for their ability to amplify DNA of well characterized phytobacterial strains, as well as to populate the existing PCR/ESI-MS bacterial database with base counts. In a blinded panel study, PCR/ESI-MS successfully identified 93% of unknown bacterial DNAs to the genus level and 73% to the species/subspecies level. Additionally, PCR/ESI-MS was capable of detecting and identifying multiple bacteria within the same sample. The sensitivity of PCR/ESI-MS was consistent with other PCR based assays, and the specificity varied depending on the bacterial species. Preliminary tests with real life samples demonstrate a high potential for using PCR/ESI-MS systems for agricultural diagnostic applications.","Postinikova, E; Baldwin, C; Whitehouse, C A; Sechler, A; Schaad, N W; Sampath, R; Harpin, V; Li, F; Melton, R; Blyn, L; Drader, J; Hofstadler, S; Schneider, W L",Phytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1094/phyto-98-11-1156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18943403/,203

METHODS We reviewed 100 consecutive patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction and placement of a jejunostomy feeding catheter for esophageal cancer. The incidence of BOFJ was evaluated and the change in body weight after surgery was compared between patients with and without BOFJ. RESULTS BOFJ developed in 17 patients. Compared to patients without BOFJ, those with BOFJ had a higher preoperative body mass index (23.3 kg/m2 versus 20.9 kg/m2, P = 0.022), and greater postoperative body weight loss rate: 3 month, decrease to 84.2% of initial body weight versus 89.3% (P = 0.002). Patients with BOFJ had shorter distance between the jejunostomy and midline (40 mm versus 48 mm, P = 0.011) compared to patients without BOFJ. On multivariate analysis, higher preoperative body mass index (odds ratio (OR) = 9.248; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.344-63.609; p = 0.024), higher postoperative weight loss at 3 months (OR = 8.490; 95% CI = 1.765-40.837, p = 0.008), and shorter distance between the jejunostomy and midline (OR = 8.160; 95% CI = 1.675-39.747, p = 0.009) were independently associated with BOFJ. CONCLUSION Patients of BOFJ had greater preoperative body mass, shorter distance between jejunostomy and midline, and greater postoperative weight loss.","Kitagawa, Hiroyuki; Namikawa, Tsutomu; Iwabu, Jun; Uemura, Sunao; Munekage, Masaya; Yokota, Keiichiro; Kobayashi, Michiya; Hanazaki, Kazuhiro",BMC gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12876-019-1029-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31238878/,203

The purpose of this study was to determine if the mode of ventilation at the time of CDH repair affected mortality or oxygen dependence at 28 days. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study of infants born wih CDH from 1991 to 2015. A generalized linear model was applied to the data using a propensity score analysis. RESULTS Eighty patients met the inclusion criteria; at the time of surgery 39 (48.8%) patients were on HFV and 41 (51.3%) patients were on CMV. In the HFV group, 16 (47.1%) patients remained oxygen dependent and there were 5 (12.8%) deaths at 28 days. In the CMV group, 5 (12.2%) patients remained oxygen dependent at 28 days but none had died. The base model demonstrated that the HFV group had increased rates of oxygen dependence [OR = 6.40 (2.13, 22.2), p = 0.002]. However, after propensity score analysis, we found no difference between HFV and CMV. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that in infants with CDH, there is no significant difference between HFV and CMV in oxygen dependency or death.","Derraugh, Gabrielle; Levesque, Matthew; Schantz, Daryl; Sesha, Molly; Minski, John; Baier, John; Morris, Melanie I; Shawyer, Anna C; Balshaw, Robert; Lum Min, Suyin A; Keijzer, Richard",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04740-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32939579/,203

METHODS In this retrospective monocentric observational study, we included 95 patients treated for ilio-femoral PTVLs. We proposed a four-grade scale evaluating the severity of PTVLS caudal to the common femoral vein based on CT phlebography and per-operative phlebography. For most patients, venous patency was assessed with color duplex ultrasonography and the clinical efficacy of the intervention using the Villalta and CIVIQ scores. RESULTS Recanalization was successful in 100% of patients with a morbidity rate of 4%. After a mean follow-up of 21 months, the overall primary patency was 75%, the assisted primary patency 82%, and the secondary patency 93%. Secondary patency was 100% for grade 0-1, 90% for grade 2, and 63% for grade 3 (p < 0.002). There was no correlation between the extension of stenting caudally of the common femoral vein and venous patency. The mean improvements in the Villalta and CIVIQ-20 scores were, respectively, 4.6 (p < 0.0001) and 18 (p < 0.0001); scores were not correlated with the grade of PTVLs in the thigh. CONCLUSION Venous patency after endovascular treatment of ilio-femoral PTVLs was strongly linked to the severity of PTVLs caudal to the common femoral vein but not to the extent of stenting.","Menez, Caroline; Rodiere, Mathieu; Ghelfi, Julien; Seinturier, Christophe; Martinelli, Thomas; Imbert, Bernard; Perolat, Romain; Bouzat, Pierre; Blaise, Sophie; Carpentier, Patrick; Pernod, Gilles; Thony, Frédéric",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-019-02214-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062068/,203

DHT is a promising option to enable telehealth, and, by the same token, it contributes to the implementation of social distance measures. The objective of this scoping review is to investigate existing DHT solutions that have been put in place to enable remote care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structured literature searches were performed in Medline (Ovid), Scopus and CINAHL with Full Text (EBSCOhost), with a mix of keywords and controlled vocabulary unique to each database. The librarian utilized the search strategy on respiratory pandemics created in April 2020 for Medline (Ovid) by Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health (CADTH). An additional search for grey literature was performed including pre-prints and reports in Google Advanced, LitCovid and MedRx. Two independent reviewers assessed the articles retrieved from the databases (n=131) based on pre-established inclusion criteria and included six articles. Analysis of the results revealed six different types of DHT, including 5 dedicated to telemedicine and one used to track activity of people who were confined to their homes. The results showed positive health-related outcomes and user behavior outcomes. This review revealed that there is limited literature on the use of DHT to enable remote care in response to a pandemic and therefore calls for more documentation of the ongoing deployment of DHTs to support patient safety and the delivery of quality care during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Choukou, M-A; Taha, A; Qadeer, A; Monnin, C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202104_25751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33928627/,203

Genome reductions tend toward the energetically favorable removal of unnecessary, redundant, or nonfunctional genes. However, without mechanisms to compensate for these losses, deleterious mutation and genetic drift might otherwise overwhelm a population. Among the mechanisms employed to counter gene loss and share evolutionary success within a population, gene transfer agents (GTAs) are increasingly becoming recognized as important contributors. Although viral in origin, GTA particles package fragments of their ""host"" genome for distribution within a population of cells, often in a synchronized manner, rather than selfishly packaging genes necessary for their spread. Microbes as diverse as archaea and alpha-proteobacteria have been known to produce GTA particles, which are capable of transferring selective advantages such as virulence factors and antibiotic resistance. In this review, we discuss the various types of GTAs identified thus far, focusing on a defined set of symbiotic alpha-proteobacteria known to carry them. Drawing attention to the predicted presence of these genes, we discuss their potential within the selective marine and terrestrial environments occupied by mutualistic, parasitic, and endosymbiotic microbes.","Christensen, Steen; Serbus, Laura R",Results and problems in cell differentiation,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51849-3_2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263868/,203
125279,Bacterial contamination of suction catheter tips during aortic valve replacement surgery: a prospective observational cohort study.,2015,"Despite the efforts in the literature review on the traffic safety of children, the majority of past studies mainly focused only on the child's seatbelt status, or its position while ignoring other underlying factors that might contribute to the severity of those crashes. Inclusion of ther factors is especially important for a mountainous state like Wyoming with one of the highest rates of children's traffic fatality in the country. Thus, this study is conducted to fill the gap by identifying important factors contributing to the severity of crashes involving children. Here child is defined as any passengers under 9 years old. A first step in identifying factors to the severity of crashes involving children is implementing a reliable statistical method that could account for heterogeneity across various observations. So, in this study, to account for the heterogeneity in the dataset, the standard cumulative link model (CLM) was extended to the random effect model, while instead of assigning the subjective attribute for random effect, an objective hierarchy through the finite mixture modeling (FMM) was used. The FMM was employed in the context of the CLM to prevent the loss of information due to disaggregation of the dataset into the homogeneous datasets. The comparison results highlighted that the random effect model by the objective hierarchy would result in a significant improvement in the model fit compared with the standard cumulative link model. The results highlighted factors such as safety equipment in use, type of collision, and various drivers' characteristics and actions such as belting condition, alcohol and drug involvement are some of the factors contributing to the severity of child crashes. As expected, the main findings of our results highlighted that various drivers' actions and behaviors are the main causes that children would undergo a higher severity level in crashes.

Although it is generally assumed that such a pressure will not affect the intrinsic electronic/magnetic properties of the system, it is known to enhance the antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering temperature TN ( < Ts) and create in-plane resistivity anisotropy above Ts. Here we use neutron polarization analysis to show that such a strain on BaFe2As2 also induces a static or quasi-static out-of-plane (c-axis) AF order and its associated critical spin fluctuations near TN/Ts. Therefore, uniaxial pressure necessary to detwin single crystals of BaFe2As2 actually rotates the easy axis of the collinear AF order near TN/Ts, and such effects due to spin-orbit coupling must be taken into account to unveil the intrinsic electronic/magnetic properties of the system.","Liu, Panpan; Klemm, Mason L; Tian, Long; Lu, Xingye; Song, Yu; Tam, David W; Schmalzl, Karin; Park, J T; Li, Yu; Tan, Guotai; Su, Yixi; Bourdarot, Frédéric; Zhao, Yang; Lynn, Jeffery W; Birgeneau, Robert J; Dai, Pengcheng",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19421-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184278/,203

Its function is dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders that are characterized by stress- or drug-induced alterations in mood, arousal, motivation, and social behavior. However, compared to the BNST's role in mood, arousal, and motivation, its role in social behavior has remained relatively understudied. Moreover, the precise cell types and circuits underlying the BNST's role in social behavior have only recently begun to be explored using modern neuroscience techniques. Here, we systematically review the existing literature investigating the neurobiological substrates within the BNST that contribute to the coordination of various sex-dependent and sex-independent social behavioral repertoires, focusing largely on pharmacological and circuit-based behavioral studies in rodents. We suggest that the BNST coordinates social behavior by promoting appropriate assessment of social contexts to select relevant behavioral outputs and that disruption of socially-relevant BNST systems by stress and drugs of abuse may be an important factor in the development of social dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders.","Flanigan, Meghan E; Kash, Thomas L",The European journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.14991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006806/,203

We compared Mepilex Ag (M), a silver-impregnated foam dressing, and Suprathel (S), a DL-lactid acid polymer, in the outpatient treatment of partial-thickness burns in pediatric and adult patients. Patients were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial. We monitored time to reepithelialization, wound pain, discomfort during dressing changes, and treatment cost. Objective scar characteristics (elasticity, transepidermal water loss, hydration, and pigmentation) and subjective assessments (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) were measured at 1 month post burn. Data are presented as mean ± SEM, and significance was accepted at P < 0.05. Sixty-two patients (S n = 32; M n = 30) were enrolled; age, sex, and burn size were comparable between the groups. Time to reepithelialization was not different between the groups (12 days; P = 0.75). Pain ratings were significantly reduced during the first 5 days after burn in the Suprathel group in all patients (P = 0.03) and a pediatric subgroup (P < 0.001). Viscolelasticity of burned skin was elevated compared with unburned skin in the Mepilex Ag group at 1 month post burn. Patients treated with Suprathel reported better overall scar quality (S: 2; M: 4.5; P < 0.001). The cost of treatment per square centimeter for Mepilex Ag was considerably lower than that of Suprathel. Both dressings are feasible and efficacious for the outpatient treatment of minor and selected moderate partial-thickness burns.

Either 3.0 mL 1.0% Lidocaine or a 3.0 mL 1.0% Lidocaine with (1 : 100,000) epinephrine was injected into the subcutaneous space at the middle point of the palmar digital crease of the 18 middle fingers of 9 healthy volunteers. The SpO(2) of the fingers decreased to a maximum of 97. No subjects showed any symptoms of ischemic injury. The time to anesthesia for the fingers was significantly shorter (P < 0.05), and the duration of anesthesia was significantly longer (P < 0.01) for the fingers in the epinephrine group. In conclusion, a subcutaneous single injection digital blocks with 3.0 mL of 1.0% Lidocaine and (1 : 100,000) epinephrine were safe, reducing the time to the onset of anesthesia, while also markedly prolonging the anesthesia.","Sonohata, Motoki; Nagamine, Satomi; Maeda, Kazumasa; Ogawa, Kenji; Ishii, Hideki; Tsunoda, Kenji; Asami, Akihiko; Mawatari, Masaaki",Anesthesiology research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/487650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21822431/,203

128661,Current issues in venous thromboembolism.,2021-07-16,"BACKGROUND Recently new disease process, often referred to as athletic pubalgia (AP), has been acknowledged by the medical community. The patients suffering from this ailment present with unilateral or bilateral chronic groin pain associated with physical activity without a clear diagnosis of a groin hernia. Though physical therapy and medical treatments are considered first line remedies, some believe that surgical treatment may have better, quicker, and more durable outcomes and procedures aimed at groin reinforcement seem to relieve most of symptoms in the majority of the patients. Despite many surgeons consistently noting rectus insertion or adductor thinning, multiple hernia defects are often seen during dissections and the clinical significance of these findings is still not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, 40 patients underwent an extra-peritoneal laparoscopic reinforcement of rectus abdominals and insertion of adductor muscles for AP. All patients underwent wide and bilateral groin dissection and the findings were cataloged. RESULTS All of the patients presented with groin defects upon wide dissection. Thirty-four patients (85%) presented with small bilateral indirect inguinal defects and 28 (70%) of these patients did not have any additional defects. Five patients (12.5%) were found to have only unilateral inguinal hernia defects. One patient presented with a small direct defect. In addition to these defects, five patients (12.5%) had additional unilateral femoral hernias, whereas no patient had solitary femoral hernia defects. CONCLUSION AP is a new diagnostic entity with poorly understood etiology. It mostly affects young active adults, often involved in competitive sports and surgical methods may be most effective at achieving the cure. In our experience all of the patients presented with groin defects, though not all were the same. It is our belief that these defects, although likely not the only component, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of AP.","Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Eid, George M",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3866-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294545/,203
128768,Getting to the heart of the matter of COVID-19.,2020-05-27,"Health equity allows people to reach their full health potential and receive high-quality care that is appropriate for them and their needs, no matter where they live, what they have, or who they are. It is a core element of quality in health care. Around the world, there are many efforts to improve equity through primary care. In order to advance these efforts, it is important to share successes and challenges. Building on our work with international stakeholders to identify key primary care research priorities, we organized the Toronto International Conference on Quality in Primary Care that was held on November 16, 2019. Participants from 8 countries took part. Key recommendations included the establishment of continuous relationships between providers and patients over time, relationships between providers in the health and social sectors, and resources supported proportionally to patient need. Solutions must be generated using team-based approaches that explicitly include people with who have experienced discrimination. Progress will require confronting structural determinants including racism, capitalism, and colonialism. Conference participants suggested practical solutions, such as developing a public transportation program for rural residents to improve community building and the ability to attend medical appointments, and identifying patients who have recently missed clinic visits that may benefit from additional care. These approaches will need to be evaluated through high-quality research and quality improvement, with a knowledge translation that facilitates sustainability and expansion across settings.","O'Neill, Braden; Ferrer, Robert; O'Brien, Patricia; Watt, Graham; Gottlieb, Laura; Pinto, Andrew; Willems, Sara; Currie, Jody; Harriott, Dawnmarie; Leitch, Jonathan; Zsager, Alexander; Kidd, Michael; Kiran, Tara",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661039/,203

OBJECTIVE To report the feasibility, safety, and outcomes associated with the use of the PED for intracranial aneurysms performed in awake patients after the administration of conscious sedation (CS) and a local anesthetic. METHODS Between March 2012 and September 2014, 130 patients with 139 intracranial aneurysms (8 ruptured) were treated with the PED under CS at our institution. Procedure details and time (including duration, radiation exposure, and fluoroscopy) and procedure-related complications were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS A total of 155 PED deployment procedures were performed under CS. Treatment was successfully completed in all cases. Anesthesia was converted from CS to general anesthesia during 5 procedures. Mean interval from patient entry at the endovascular suite to procedure initiation was 18 minutes (range, 5 minutes-1 hour 10 minutes). Mean procedure length was 1 hour 25 minutes (range, 30 minutes-3 hours 51 minutes). Mean ± SD values for fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were 36.17 ± 18.4 minutes and 1367 ± 897 mGy, respectively. The mean amount of contrast material administered was 211.37 ± 83.5 mL. Permanent neurological complications were seen in 4 patients (3%). CONCLUSION In our experience, CS for PED placement for intracranial aneurysm treatment is feasible and safe. Procedure and fluoroscopy times and amount of radiation exposure are similar to or less than described in reports of PED placement under general anesthesia. CS allows direct neurological evaluation and earlier detection of and response to intraprocedural complications.","Rangel-Castilla, Leonardo; Cress, Marshall C; Munich, Stephan A; Sonig, Ashish; Krishna, Chandan; Gu, Eugene Y; Snyder, Kenneth V; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26284351/,203

Many drugs have therapeutic potential. The aminoquinolones, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine are undergoing evaluation as a potential therapy against COVID -19. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that these drugs affect viral adherence and modify inflammatory responses, which may provide some impact on the symptoms associated with COVID. As palliative care specialists encounter more COVID positive patients, palliative care specialists need to know how these drugs work, and importantly how they interact with palliative care drugs used for symptom control. At the same time, there is a need to reduce polypharmacy in any seriously ill patient population. The goals of this paper are to identify whether or not hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine improves symptoms in palliative care patients and whether or not these drugs are safe to use in the advanced illness population who have COVID.","Prommer, Eric",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120952773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929975/,203

We previously reported that TRPV1 antagonists such as AMG517 enhanced EM in mice, however, these mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying the enhancement of EM by AMG517, a selective TRPV1 antagonist, in mice. Respiratory gas analysis indicated that intragastric administration of AMG517 enhanced EM along with increasing locomotor activity in mice. Next, to clarify the possible involvement with afferent sensory nerves, including the vagus, we desensitized the capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves of mice by systemic capsaicin treatment. In the desensitized mice, intragastric administration of AMG517 did not change EM and locomotor activity. Therefore, this study indicated that intragastric administration of AMG517 enhanced EM and increased locomotor activity via capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves, including vagal afferents in mice.","Hai, Jun; Kawabata, Fuminori; Uchida, Kunitoshi; Nishimura, Shotaro; Tabata, Shoji","Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",https://doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2020.1789836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633621/,203

OBJECTIVE To describe a simplified surgical technique of robot-assisted nephroureterectomy (RANU) and to report our single-center surgical outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patients with history of UTUC treated with this modality between April 2010 and August 2013 were included in the analysis. Institutional review board approval was obtained. Informed consent was signed by all patients. SURGICAL PROCEDURE A simplified single-step RANU not requiring repositioning or robot redocking. Lymph node dissection was performed selectively. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive analysis of patients' characteristics, perioperative outcomes, histopathology, and short-term follow-up data was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The analysis included 31 patients (mean age: 72.4±10.6 yr; mean body mass index: 26.6±5.1kg/m(2)). Twenty-six of 30 tumors (86%) were high grade. Mean tumor size was 3.1±1.8cm. Of the 31 patients, 13 (42%) had pT3 stage disease. One periureteric positive margin was noted in a patient with bulky T3 disease. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 9.4 (standard deviation: 5.6; range: 3-21). Two of 14 patients (14%) had positive lymph nodes on final histology. No patients required a blood transfusion. Six patients experienced complications postoperatively, with only one being a high grade (Clavien 3b) complication. Median hospital stay was 5 d. Within the follow-up period, seven patients experienced bladder recurrences and four patients developed metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS Our RANU technique eliminates the need for patient repositioning or robot redocking.

The disease has since been included in the Class B infectious diseases category, as stipulated in the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and shall be managed according to Class A infectious diseases. During the early phases of COVID-19 infection, no specific pulmonary imaging features may be evident, or features overlapping with other pneumonia may be observed. Although CT is not the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, it nonetheless is a convenient and fast method, and its application can be deployed in community hospitals. Furthermore, CT can be used to render a suggestive diagnosis and evaluate the severity as well as the effects of therapeutic interventions for typical cases of COVID-19. The mobile emergency special CT device described in this document (also known as Emergency Mobile Cabin CT) has several unique characteristics, including its mobility, flexibility, and networking capabilities. Furthermore, it adopts a fully independent isolation design to avoid cross-infection between patients and medical staff. It can play an important role in screening suspected cases presenting with imaging features of COVID-19 in hospitals of various levels that provide care to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients as part of the first line procedures of epidemic prevention and control.","Yang, Qi; Xu, Haibo; Tang, Xiaoying; Hu, Chunhong; Wang, Peijun; Wáng, Yì Xiáng J; Wang, Yaofa; Ma, Guolin; Zhang, Bing",Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/qims-20-980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33139998/,203

132427,Biomarkers of treatment success in fully sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis patients: a multicenter longitudinal study.,2020-11-03,"OBJECTIVES More than a billion adolescents and youngsters are estimated to be at risk of acquiring recreational noise-induced hearing loss (RNIHL) due to the unsafe use of personal audio systems. RNIHL is preventable; therefore, the present study aimed to determine (i) the accuracy and reliability of dbTrack (Westone) sound-level monitoring earphones and (ii) the effect of sound-level monitoring earphones with smartphone feedback and hearing-health information as an intervention to promote healthy listening behaviors in young adults. DESIGN The study consisted of two phases: the first phase investigated the accuracy and reliability of dbTrack sound-level monitoring earphones. Accuracy was determined by comparing earphone measurements to sound level meter measurements. Intradevice reliability was determined by comparing earphone measurements during test-retest conditions. Nineteen participants were recruited through convenience sampling to determine within-subject reliability by comparing in-ear sound levels measured by the earphones during test-retest conditions. For the second phase of the study, a single-group pretest-posttest design was utilized. Forty participants, recruited through snowball sampling, utilized the sound-level monitoring earphones with the accompanying dbTrack smartphone application for 4 weeks. The application's smartphone feedback was disabled during the first 2 weeks (pretest condition) and enabled during the last 2 weeks (posttest condition). Average daily intensities, durations, and sound dosages measured during pre- and posttest conditions were compared. RESULTS Phase 1 dbTrack earphone measurements were within 1 dB when compared with sound level meter measurements. Earphones were also within 1 dB in repeated measures across earphones and across participants. Phase 2 posttest average daily intensity decreased by 8.7 dB (18.3 SD), duration decreased by 7.6 minutes (46.6 SD), and sound dose decreased by 4128.4% (24965.5% SD). Differences in intensity and sound dose were significantly lower with a small and medium effect size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS This study's preliminary data indicate that dbTrack (Westone) sound-level monitoring earphones with a calibrated in-ear microphone can reliably and accurately measure personal audio systems sound exposure. Preliminary results also suggest that feedback on sound exposure using the accurate sound-level monitoring earphones with the accompanying dbTrack application can potentially promote safe listening behavior in young adults and reduce the risk of acquiring an RNIHL.","Knoetze, Megan; Mahomed-Asmail, Faheema; Manchaiah, Vinaya; Swanepoel, De Wet",Ear and hearing,https://doi.org/10.1097/aud.0000000000001029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974781/,203

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated glycemic control of individuals with T1DM using HCL system in the period before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy (February 10th - 23rd, 2020 - Time 1), when movements were only reduced (February 24th - March 8th, 2020 - Time 2) and during complete lockdown (March 9th-22nd, 2020 - Time 3). Information about regular PA (at least 3 hours per week) prior and during the quarantine were collected. RESULTS The study included 13 individuals with a median age of 14.2 years and a good glycemic control at baseline (GMI 7%, TIR 68%, TBR 2%). All individuals continued to show good glycemic control throughout the study period. There was an increase in TIR during the study period (+3%) and TIR was significantly higher in Time 3 (72%) than in Time 2 (66%). TBR was significantly lower in Time 3 (1%) both compared to Time 1 and Time 2 (2%). A meaningful variance in TIR at Time 3 between individuals who performed or not PA during quarantine and a significant increase in TIR between Time 2 and Time 3 both in individuals doing PA at baseline and during quarantine, was found. At logistic regression, only the presence of PA during quarantine significantly predicted a TIR >70 %. CONCLUSIONS Glycemic control of T1DM in adolescents using HCL system did not worsen during the restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemics and further improved in those who continued physical activity during the quarantine. Maintaining regular physical activity in a safe home environment is an essential strategy for young individuals with T1DM during the COVID-19 crisis.","Tornese, Gianluca; Ceconi, Viola; Monasta, Lorenzo; Carletti, Claudia; Faleschini, Elena; Barbi, Egidio",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1089/dia.2020.0169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421355/,203

134476,Monitoring the brain: processed electroencephalogram and peri-operative outcomes.,2014,"BACKGROUND Knowledge translation (KT) aims to facilitate the use of research evidence in decision making. Changes in technology have provided considerable opportunities for KT strategies to improve access and use of evidence in decision making by public health policy makers and practitioners. Despite this opportunity, there have been no reviews that have assessed the effects of digital technology-enabled KT (TEKT) in the field of public health. OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies in (1) improving the capacity for evidence-based decision making by public health policy makers and practitioners, (2) changing public health policy or practice, and (3) changes in individual or population health outcomes. METHODS A search strategy was developed to identify randomized trials assessing the effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies in public health. Any primary research study with a randomized trial design was eligible. Searches for eligible studies were undertaken in multiple electronic bibliographic databases (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], Excerpta Medica dataBASE [EMBASE], PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], and Scopus) and the reference lists of included studies. A hand search of 2 journals (Implementation Science and Journal of Medical Internet Research) and a gray literature search were also conducted. Pairs of independent review authors screened studies, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted data from relevant studies. RESULTS Of the 6819 citations screened, 8 eligible randomized trials were included in the review. The studies examined the impact of digital TEKT strategies on health professionals, including nurses, child care health consultants, physiotherapists, primary health care workers, and public health practitioners. Overall, 5 of the interventions were web-training programs. The remaining 3 interventions included simulation games, access to digital resource materials and the use of tailored messaging, and a web-based registry. The findings suggest that digital TEKT interventions may be effective in improving the knowledge of public health professionals, relative to control, and may be as effective as a face-to-face KT approach. The effectiveness of digital TEKT strategies relative to a control or other digital KT interventions on measures of health professional self-efficacy to use evidence to enhance practice behavior or behavioral intention outcomes was mixed. The evidence regarding the effects on changes to health policy or practice following exposure to digital TEKT was mixed. No trials assessed the effects on individual or population-level health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This review is the first to synthesize the effectiveness of digital TEKT interventions in a public health setting. Despite its potential, relatively few trials have been undertaken to investigate the impacts of digital TEKT interventions. The findings suggest that although a digital TEKT intervention may improve knowledge, the effects of such interventions on other outcomes are equivocal.","Brown, Alison; Barnes, Courtney; Byaruhanga, Judith; McLaughlin, Matthew; Hodder, Rebecca K; Booth, Debbie; Nathan, Nicole; Sutherland, Rachel; Wolfenden, Luke",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/17274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735231/,203

RESULTS Thirteen patients underwent gynecological procedures with benign indications via vNOTES. Of the 13 operations, 6 of the patients had salpingo-oophorectomies and 7 had hysterectomies, and all of the surgeries were performed by the same surgeon (Dr. Ahmet Kale). No conversion to a conventional laparoscopy or even a laparotomy was needed in any of the procedures. The mean operation time was 73.14 min in the hysterectomy patients and 40.8 min in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. The mean drop in the hemoglobin (Hb) level was 1.4 g/dl in the hysterectomy patients and 1.6 g/dl in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. For these patients undergoing vNOTES, the mean postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score at 6 h was 4.38 and at 24 h it was 0.62. There were no intraoperative complications in any of the cases. The mean length of the hospital stay was 1.8 days in the hysterectomy patients and 1.5 days in the salpingo-oophorectomy patients. CONCLUSION The vNOTES procedure overcomes the surgical and technical difficulties of conventional vaginal surgery by incorporating the advantages of endoscopic surgery. Moreover, vNOTES uses inexpensive, reusable, handmade conventional laparoscopic instruments and avoids those problems related to abdominal wall incisions and trocar-related complications. Overall, this procedure results in high patient satisfaction, cosmetic advantages, and decreased postoperative pain.","Kale, Ahmet; Sarıibrahim, Bahar; Başol, Gülfem",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2017.09.062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951308/,203

Despite the limited data on the possible pathogenetic mechanisms, evidence suggests that cognitive decline, and thus dementia and Alzheimer's disease, might arise from a complex interplay between type 2 diabetes and the aging brain, including decreased insulin signalling and glucose metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and vascular disease. Furthermore, there is increasing interest on the effects of antidiabetic agents on cognitive decline. There are many studies showing that antidiabetic agents might have beneficial effects on the brain, mainly through inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In addition, experimental studies on patients with diabetes and Alzheimer's disease have shown beneficial effects on synaptic plasticity, metabolism of amyloid-β, and microtubule-associated protein tau. Therefore, in the present review, we discuss the effects of antidiabetic agents in relation to cognitive decline, and in particular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, in patients with type 2 diabetes.","Papazafiropoulou, Athanasia K; Koros, Chris; Melidonis, Andreas; Antonopoulos, Stavros",Archives of medical sciences.

METHODS Twenty-seven consecutive Chinese patients (23 females; mean age 37.6 ± 8.9 years) received LGCP for the treatment of obesity from September 2010 to December 2011. Mean baseline body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI) were 84.6 ± 17.5 kg and 31.2 ± 4.7 kg/m(2), respectively. RESULTS All procedures were performed laparoscopically with conversion to open surgery in one patient. There was neither mortality nor any postoperative complications. Mean follow-up was 10.6 ± 6.5 months. Mean procedure time was 117.9 ± 22.3 min and mean hospital stay was 2.6 ± 0.7 days. Mean BMI loss was 4.1 ± 1.6, 4.8 ± 2.0 and 5.2 ± 2.5 kg/m(2) at 3, 6 and 12 months. Mean % EBL was 67.3 ± 42.1, 66.4 ± 35.9 and 60.2 ± 25.5 % at 3, 6 and 12 months. Mean % EBL in BMI >35 group (n = 7) was 38.2 ± 11.1, 43.5 ± 14.0 and 50.6 ± 21.6 % at 3, 6 and 12 months.

METHODS Participants were recruited to attend the virtual information session over a 2-week period via social media and communication with medical school radiology interest groups. Attendees were able to submit questions or topics of interest prior to the session. The virtual information session was hosted by trainees and faculty from a radiology residency. Data regarding the demographics of the attendees and the efficacy of the session were obtained through interactive live polling during the virtual session and a voluntary anonymous postsession survey. RESULTS A total of 171 attendees participated in the virtual information session. Of the attendees, 42% learned about the session from Twitter and 72% were fourth-year medical students applying for residency. Among topics addressed during the session, attendees indicated that they were most interested in learning about ""Application strategies during COVID-19"" during an in-session poll. On the post-session survey, 96% of attendees reported being more knowledgeable about the residency program culture and the breadth of research and educational opportunities. CONCLUSION Given the virtual nature of the 2020-2021 residency application cycle, utilization of web-based platforms for recruitment will be essential.

This has been dubbed as the MH 'second wave'. In Australia, these impacts have been partly mitigated by institutional responses such as increased access to psychotherapy. Consultation Liaison (CL) psychiatry services provide MH care to acutely unwell patients in general hospitals. It was hypothesised that the number of referrals to the studied service had increased since the start of the pandemic. METHODS From the Electronic medical records (eMRs), the authors collected daily referral numbers, over 3 consecutive years, to a large CL service in metropolitan Sydney. RESULTS Referrals were significantly increased by 25%, 95% CI [1.14, 1.36], p < .001 since the start of the pandemic. This increase was delayed, and remained elevated despite a reduction in COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION This study adds evidence to the existence of the MH 'second wave', highlights a key impact on healthcare workers' well-being and will assist in guiding resource allocation decisions in the near future.","Lele, Kiran; Cartoon, Jodi; Griffiths, Alison",Australasian psychiatry : bulletin of Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists,https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856221992937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856921/,203

However, systemic respiratory vaccines generally provide limited protection against viral replication and shedding within the airway, as this requires a local mucosal secretory IgA response. Indeed, preclinical studies of adenovirus and mRNA candidate vaccines demonstrated persistent virus in nasal swabs despite preventing COVID-19. This suggests that systemically vaccinated patients, while asymptomatic, may still be become infected and transmit live virus from the upper airway. COVID-19 is known to spread through respiratory droplets and aerosols. Furthermore, significant evidence has shown that many clinic and surgical endonasal procedures are aerosol generating. Until further knowledge is acquired regarding mucosal immunity following systemic vaccination, otolaryngology providers should maintain precautions against viral transmission to protect the proportion of persistently vulnerable patients who exhibit subtotal vaccine efficacy or waning immunity or who defer vaccination.","Bleier, Benjamin S; Ramanathan, Murugappan; Lane, Andrew P",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820982633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320052/,203

Both are now even more critically socially constructed. In the middle of battle with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Republic of Croatia's capital of Zagreb was afflicted with another disaster - two severe earthquakes. Restrictive public health measures were already in place, including restriction on public transport, travel between regions, closure of educational and other public institutions, alongside measures of physical distancing. Most previous cases of COVID-19 were centered in Zagreb, leading to concern of spreading the disease into disease-free communities. It seems that earthquakes did not have an effect on disease transmission - the number of COVID-19 cases remained stable through the 14-day incubation period, with a linear pandemic curve in Croatia in April, and flattened in May. This leads to a conclusion that the earthquake did not have a direct effect on disease spread. Despite the fact that the current pandemic and its responses are unique, this paradox can have interesting repercussions on how we conceptualize and approach notions as vulnerability and resilience.","Ćurković, M; Svetina, L; Košec, A",Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sste.2021.100402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509429/,203

However, effects of cropping systems on drought resistance of arable crops via their hydraulic behaviour remain unclear. We investigated how hydraulic traits of a field-grown pea-barley (Pisum sativum L. and Hordeum vulgare L.) mixture were affected by different cropping systems, that is, organic and conventional farming with intensive or conservation tillage. Xylem vulnerability to cavitation of both species was estimated by measuring the pressure inducing 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity (P50 ), while the water stress plants experienced in the field was assessed using native percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (nPLC). Pea and barley showed contrasting hydraulic behaviours: pea was less vulnerable to xylem cavitation and less stressed than barley; cropping systems affected xylem vulnerability of barley, but not of pea. Barley grown under conventional farming with no tillage was more vulnerable and stressed than under organic farming with intensive tillage. nPLC proved to be a valuable indicator for plant water stress. Our results highlight the impact of cropping systems on crop xylem vulnerability and drought resistance, thus plant hydraulic traits, for protecting food security under future climate.

Deciphering the mechanisms involved in this communication is crucial to find new therapeutic strategies. HS sequesters a number of secreted growth factors and cytokines, controlling their bioavailability to the target cells, suggesting that HS is an important regulator of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and a key player in the cell-cell and cell-microenvironment communication during prostate morphogenesis and physiology. We propose that by controlling HS biosynthesis and sulfation pattern, as well as the cleavage of the HS chain and/or the shedding of proteoglycans, epithelial and stromal cells are able to precisely tune the availability of signaling molecules and modulate ligand-receptor interaction and intracellular signal transduction.

141031,[Immune thrombocytopenia preceded by asymptomatic COVID-19 infection].,2021,"PURPOSE The GlideScope® video laryngoscope (GVL) is widely used for nasotracheal intubation in dental and facial plastic surgery. The angle of the Magill forceps is different from that of the GVL blade, which suggests that the Magill forceps are not the ideal forceps for use with the GVL. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the Magill forceps vs vascular forceps for nasotracheal intubation using the GVL. METHODS This study included 60 patients scheduled to undergo elective surgery requiring nasotracheal intubation. Patients were assigned to one of two groups-i.e., Magill forceps (group M) or vascular forceps along with a tube exchanger (group V), by computer randomization. The primary outcome was total intubation time, defined as the time from when the anesthesiologist picked up the device to the time when three successive end-tidal CO2 waves were obtained following intubation. Secondary outcomes were blood in the endotracheal tube and trauma to the oral tissues or teeth. A blind observer assessed the presence of sore throat one hour and 24 hr after surgery. RESULTS The total intubation time was significantly different between group M and group V (96.1 sec and 78.1 sec, respectively; mean difference, 18 sec; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13.7 to 49.7). The incidence of epistaxis in group M was significantly greater than that in group V (46.7% vs 16.7%, respectively; relative risk, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.8). CONCLUSION The total intubation time was significantly less with the vascular forceps (and tube exchanger) than with the Magill forceps. Using vascular forceps also reduced the incidence of epistaxis compared with that using the Magill forceps. Using a tube exchanger and vascular forceps offers advantages over use of Magill forceps when a GlideScope video laryngoscope is used for nasotracheal intubation.

METHODS This was a retrospective study of patients presenting with cardiovascular emergencies to four tertiary regional emergency departments in western India during the government implementation of complete lockdown. RESULTS 25.0% of patients during the lockdown period and 17.4% of patients during the pre-lockdown period presented outside the window period (presentation after 12 hours of symptom onset) compared with only 6% during the pre-COVID period. In the pre-COVID period, 46.9% of patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction underwent emergent catheterisation, while in the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, these values were 26.1% and 18.8%, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy increased from 18.4% in the pre-COVID period to 32.3% in the post-lockdown period. Inhospital mortality for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) increased from 2.69% in the pre-COVID period to 7.27% in the post-lockdown period. There was also a significant decline in emergency admissions for non-ACS conditions, such as acute decompensated heart failure and high degree or complete atrioventricular block.

RESULTS Case 1 is a healthy 59-year-old man presenting with loss of consciousness, cortical blindness, restlessness and anterograde amnesia, immediately following a cervical Ozone Therapy (OT) session for chronic neck pain. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) on admission was normal. A follow-up scan demonstrated a subtle increased T2 FLAIR signal within the left cerebellum; an echocardiography showed a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO). Case 2 is a 56-year-old woman, with history of migraine, PFO and lumbar pain, who presented with headache, bilateral visual impairment, motor dysphasia, and agitation. All her symptoms began immediately after lumbar OT. Her brain MRI was negative. Case 3 is a healthy 27-year old man who complained of vertigo and mild blurred vision 5 minutes following a cervical ozone injection. His neurological examination and brain MRI were normal. All three patients had full recovery within 48 hours. We found in the literature 8 additional cases of OIE.

The posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT score (pc-ASPECTS) on Computed Tomography Angiography source images (CTA-SI) predicts functional outcome in patients with basilar artery occlusion. Aims We assessed the prognostic value of pc-ASPECTS on CT perfusion in patients with vertebral and basilar artery occlusion (VBAO) in comparison with CTA-SI. Methods Whole-brain CT perfusion from consecutive stroke patients with VBAO at four stroke centers was retrospectively analyzed. pc-ASPECTS - a 10-point score assessing hypoattenuation on CTA-SI - was calculated from CT perfusion parameters as focally reduced cerebral blood flow or cerebral blood volume, focally increased time to peak of the deconvolved tissue residue function (Tmax) or mean transit time. Two investigators independently reviewed the images. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficient. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin scale ≤3 at three months. Results We included 60 patients with VBAO. After assessment of four CT perfusion maps simultaneously, area-under-ROC curve (AROC) was 0.83 (95%CI 0.72-0.93) for cerebral blood volume, 0.76 (95%CI 0.64-0.89) for cerebral blood flow, 0.77 (95%CI 0.64-0.89) for Tmax, 0.70 (95%CI 0.56-0.84) for mean transit time versus area-under-ROC curve 0.64 (95%CI 0.50-0.79) for CTA-SI. Cerebral blood volume had greater accuracy compared with CTA-SI for poor outcome (p = 0.04).

145908,Response of bispectral index to neuromuscular block in awake volunteers.,2015,"Sympathetically mediated contractions of smooth muscle cells in vasa deferentia are mediated by neuronally released adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and noradrenaline, which stimulate P2X1-purinoreceptors and α1A-adrenoceptors respectively. This process is crucial for sperm transport, as demonstrated in knockout mouse studies where simultaneous genetic deletion of P2X1-purinoreceptors and α1A-adrenoceptors resulted in male infertility. We hypothesise that dual pharmacological antagonism of these two receptors could inhibit sperm transport sufficiently to provide a novel non-hormonal method of male contraception. To generate a suitable P2X1-purinoceptor antagonist, substituents were introduced on the phenyl moiety of 2-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinoxaline to create a series of analogues that were tested for P2X1-purinoreceptor antagonism in isolated preparations of rat vas deferens. Novel compounds were initially screened for their ability to attenuate contractile responses to electrical field stimulation (EFS: 60 V, 0.5 ms, 0.2 Hz). The addition of polar substituents to the meta, but not ortho, position, markedly increased the inhibition of contractions, as did the addition of both polar and aliphatic substituents to the para position. Di-substituted compounds were also synthesised and tested, resulting in a compound 31 (2-hydroxy, 4-fluoro), which exhibited the greatest potency, with an IC50 of 14 μM (95% confidence limits: 12-16 μM). Additionally, compound 31 non-competitively antagonised contractions mediated by exogenously administered αß-methylene ATP (10 nM-30 μM) but had no inhibitory effect on contractions mediated by exogenously administered noradrenaline (30 nM-100 μM) or acetylcholine (30 nM-100 μM). These results have contributed to a structure activity relationship (SAR) profile for the P2X1-purinoreceptor that will inform future designs of more potent antagonists.","Mathiew, Mitch; Dennis, Belinda; Bennetts, Felix; Su, Eunice; Nguyen, Nghi; Botteon, Antony; Baell, Jonathan; Ventura, Sabatino",Biology of reproduction,https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioaa117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648904/,203

Notably, a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 characterises TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura), a rare but potentially fatal disorder associated with thrombosis due to accumulation of prothrombotic ultra-large VWF multimers. Although prompt identification/exclusion of TTP can be facilitated by rapid ADAMTS13 testing, the most commonly utilised assays are based on ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) and require long turnaround time and have relatively limited throughput. Nevertheless, several rapid ADAMTS13 assays are now available, at least in select geographies. The current mini-review discusses these issues, as well as the potential utility of ADAMTS13 testing in a range of other conditions, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

This study aims to understand the perceptions of children in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil towards SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and viruses in general, through a qualitative study. We interviewed 20 children via conference services platforms. The findings indicate that children are aware of the risks and necessary precautions for coronavirus prevention, displaying apprehension and fear of catching the disease and transmitting it to their family members. As for viruses in general, we found that their perceptions are related directly to the novel coronavirus, that is, the situation they are dealing with at present.

147324,Immigration status and end-stage kidney disease: Role of policy and access to care.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND Sonography has become the imaging technique of choice for guiding intraoperative interventions in abdominal surgery. Due to artefacts from residual air content, however, videothoracoscopic and open intraoperative ultrasound-guided thermoablation of lung malignancies are impossible. Lung flooding is a new method that allows complete ultrasound imaging of lungs and their tumours. METHODS Fourteen resected tumourous human lung lobes were examined transpleurally with B-mode ultrasound before (in atelectasis) and after lung flooding with isotonic saline solution. In two swine, the left lung was filled with 15 ml/kg isotonic saline solution through the left side of a double-lumen tube. Lung tumours were simulated by transthoracic ultrasound-guided injection of 5 ml of purified bovine serum albumin in glutaraldehyde, centrally into the left lower lung lobe. The rate of tumour detection, the severity of disability caused by residual gas, and sonomorphology of the lungs and tumours were assessed. RESULTS The ex vivo tumour detection rate was 100% in flooded human lung lobes and 43% (6/14) in atelectatic lungs. In all cases of atelectasis, sonographic tumour imaging was impaired by residual gas. Tumours and atelectatic tissue were isoechoic. In 28% of flooded lungs, a little residual gas was observed that did not impair sonographic tumour imaging. In contrast to tumours, flooded lung tissue was hyperechoic, homogeneous, and of fine-grained structure. Because of the bronchial wall three-laminar structure, sonographic differentiation of vessels and bronchi was possible. In all cases, malignant tumours in the flooded lung appeared well-demarcated from the lung parenchyma. Adenocarcinoma, squamous, and large cell carcinomas were hypoechoic. Bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma was slightly hyperechoic. Transpleural sonography identifies endobronchial tumour growth and bronchial wall destruction. With transthoracic sonography, the flooded animal lung can be completely examined in vivo. There is no residual gas, which interferes with ultrasound. Pulmonary vessels and bronchi are clearly differentiated. Simulated lung lesions can easily be detected inside the lung lobe. CONCLUSIONS Lung flooding enables complete lung sonography and tumour detection. We have developed a novel method that efficiently uses ultrasound for guiding intraoperative interventions in open and endoscopic lung surgery.","Lesser, Thomas Günther; Schubert, Harald; Bischoff, Sabine; Wolfram, Frank",European journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-783x-18-23; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23841910/,203
147673,"Risk, Racial Disparity, and Outcomes Among Patients With Cancer and COVID-19 Infection-Reply.",2021-05-06,"UNLABELLED The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a major target of protective immunity in vivo. Although a large number of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) have been developed, it remains unclear if a single RBD-targeting nAb or two in combination can prevent neutralization escape and, if not, attenuate viral virulence in vivo. In this study, we used a large panel of human nAbs against an epitope that overlaps the interface between the RBD and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to assess their cross-neutralization activities against a panel of human and zoonotic SARS-CoVs and neutralization escape mutants. We also investigated the neutralization escape profiles of these nAbs and evaluated their effects on receptor binding and virus fitness in vitro and in mice. We found that some nAbs had great potency and breadth in neutralizing multiple viral strains, including neutralization escape viruses derived from other nAbs; however, no single nAb or combination of two blocked neutralization escape. Interestingly, in mice the neutralization escape mutant viruses showed either attenuation (Urbani background) or increased virulence (GD03 background) consistent with the different binding affinities between their RBDs and the mouse ACE2. We conclude that using either single nAbs or dual nAb combinations to target a SARS-CoV RBD epitope that shows plasticity may have limitations for preventing neutralization escape during in vivo immunotherapy. However, RBD-directed nAbs may be useful for providing broad neutralization and prevention of escape variants when combined with other nAbs that target a second conserved epitope with less plasticity and more structural constraint. IMPORTANCE The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 has resulted in severe human respiratory disease with high death rates. Their zoonotic origins highlight the likelihood of reemergence or further evolution into novel human coronavirus pathogens. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that prevent infection of related viruses represent an important immunostrategy for combating coronavirus infections; however, for this strategy to succeed, it is essential to uncover nAb-mediated escape pathways and to pioneer strategies that prevent escape. Here, we used SARS-CoV as a research model and examined the escape pathways of broad nAbs that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the virus. We found that neither single nAbs nor two nAbs in combination blocked escape. Our results suggest that targeting conserved regions with less plasticity and more structural constraint rather than the SARS-CoV RBD-like region(s) should have broader utility for antibody-based immunotherapy.","Sui, Jianhua; Deming, Meagan; Rockx, Barry; Liddington, Robert C; Zhu, Quan Karen; Baric, Ralph S; Marasco, Wayne A",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02232-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231316/,203

AIMS To investigate the impact of lithium exposure on early fetal growth. METHODS In this retrospective observational cohort study, we included all singleton pregnancies of women using lithium and referred for advanced fetal ultrasound scanning between 1994 and 2018 to the University Medical Centers in Leiden and Rotterdam, the Netherlands (n=119). The Generation R study, a population-based cohort, served as a non-exposed control population from the same geographic region (n=8184). Fetal head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and transcerebellar diameter were measured by ultrasound at 18-22 weeks of gestation. RESULTS Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in head circumference of 1.77 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.53, 3.01), in abdominal circumference of 5.54 mm (95% confidence interval: 3.95, 7.12) and in femur length of 0.59 mm (95% confidence interval: 0.22, 0.96) at 18-22 weeks gestation. Furthermore, lithium use during pregnancy was associated with an average increase in birth weight of 142.43 grams (95% confidence interval: 58.01, 226.89), whereas it was associated with an average decrease of 1.41 weeks in gestational duration (95% confidence interval: -1.78, -1.05). CONCLUSIONS Lithium use during pregnancy was associated with increased fetal growth parameters at 18-22 weeks gestational age and increased birth weight. Further research is needed to evaluate both short- and long-term implications, as well as the mechanisms driving this difference in growth.","Poels, Eline Mp; Sterrenburg, Karin; Wierdsma, André I; Wesseloo, Richard; Beerthuizen, Annemerle; van Dijke, Laura; Lau, Condon; Hoogendijk, Witte Jg; Marroun, Hanan El; van Kamp, Inge L; Bijma, Hilmar H; Bergink, Veerle",Journal of psychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881120940914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684118/,203

To solve this problem, under the scenario-response paradigm and theories on parallel emergency management and discrete event system (DES), the parallel simulation decision-making framework (PSDF), which includes the methods of abstract modeling, simulation operation, decision-making optimization, and parallel control, is proposed for unconventional public health emergency response processes. Furthermore, with the example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) response process, the evolutionary scenarios that include infected patients and diagnostic processes are transformed into simulation processes. Then, the validity and operability of the DES-PSDF method proposed in this paper are verified by the results of a simulation experiment. The results demonstrated that, in the case of insufficient prior knowledge, effective parallel simulation models can be constructed and improved dynamically by multi-stage parallel controlling. Public health system bottlenecks and relevant effective response solutions can also be obtained by iterative simulation and optimizing decisions. To meet the urgent requirements of emergency response, the DES-PSDF method introduces a new response decision-making concept for unconventional public health emergencies.","Xie, Tian; Ni, Mengna; Zhang, Zhaoyun; Wei, Yaoyao",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2019.30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317864/,203

Design, setting and participants Analysis of all confirmed COVID-19 cases diagnosed in NSW from 1 January to 31 May 2020 extracted from the NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System and linked to routinely collected hospitalisation data. Outcome measures In-patient hospitalisations and hospital service utilisation details. Results There were 3,101 COVID-19 cases diagnosed between 1 January and 31 May 2020 in NSW: mean age 46.7 years, 50.5% were females. Overall, 12.5% (n = 389) had a record of inpatient hospitalisation, 4.2% (n = 130) were admitted to ICU and 1.9% (n = 58) received ventilation. Among adult cases, hospital and ICU admission rates increased with increasing age: 2.9% of those aged 20-29 years were hospitalised, increasing to 46.6% of those aged 80-89 years; 0.6% of those aged 20-29 years were admitted to ICU, increasing to 11.2% of those aged 70-79 years. The median time from symptoms to hospitalisation was seven days (IQR 4-11). The median time in hospital was nine days (IQR 4-20), and in ICU six days (IQR 2-15); the median time in hospital increased with older age. Almost half (49.4%) of those hospitalised with a diagnostic code had pneumonia/lower respiratory tract infection and another 36.6% had an upper respiratory tract infection or other known COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusion COVID-19 is a serious infection particularly in older adults. During January to May of 2020, 1 in 8 of those diagnosed in NSW were hospitalised. While this partly reflects the cautious approach to case management in the initial phase of the pandemic, it also demonstrates the large potential impact of COVID-19 on Australian health services and need for continuing mitigation strategies.","Liu, Bette; Spokes, Paula; Alfaro-Ramirez, Maria; Ward, Kate; Kaldor, John",Communicable diseases intelligence,https://doi.org/10.33321/cdi.2020.44.97; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357174/,203

METHODS A retrospective analysis of postmarketing (spontaneous) case reports of erenumab-associated elevated BP submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System from May 17, 2018 through April 30, 2020. A case of elevated BP was defined as (a) an initiation of a pharmacological intervention or emergency department visit or hospitalization for emergent de novo or worsening of preexisting hypertension, or (b) BP measurement of ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic with or without baseline BP measurement reported. Reports of elevated BP associated with erenumab use were analyzed for baseline and demographic information, latency, drug-event causal association, and clinical outcome. RESULTS Sixty-one cases of elevated BP were identified, 86% (49/57) were women and the median age was 56 [range 24-88] years. Forty-one cases were associated with a serious outcome per regulatory criteria, including seven that specified hospitalization. No case reported an outcome of death. The median systolic BP increase was 39 (interquartile range (IQR) 32, 59) mm Hg and median diastolic BP increase was 28 (IQR 18, 41) mm Hg. A total of 27/61 (44%) cases reported treatment for elevated BP (i.e., pharmacologic intervention or emergency department visit/hospitalization). Elevated BP occurred most frequently (28/61, 46%) within a week of the first dose of erenumab. Nineteen cases (19/61, 31%) reported a history of preexisting hypertension.

METHODS Two hundred and twenty-one cats referred for further evaluation of spinal disease were included and categorised as follows: non-lymphoid neoplasia (n = 44); intervertebral disc disease (n = 42); fracture/luxation (n = 34); ischaemic myelopathy (n = 22); feline infectious peritonitis virus myelitis (n = 18); lymphoma (n = 16); thoracic vertebral canal stenosis (n = 11); acute non-compressive nucleus pulposus extrusion (n = 11); traumatic spinal cord contusion (n = 8); spinal arachnoid diverticula (n = 7); lumbosacral stenosis (n = 5); and spinal empyema (n = 3). Information retrieved from the medical records included signalment, clinical history and clinical presentation. Univariate analyses of variables (clinical history, breed, age, sex, general physical examination findings, onset, progression, spinal hyperaesthesia, asymmetry, ambulatory status and neuroanatomical location) were performed, and variables were retained in a multivariate logistic regression model if P <0.05. RESULTS Multivariate logistic regression revealed that intervertebral disc disease most often occurred in middle-aged, purebred cats with a normal general physical examination and an acute onset of painful and progressive clinical signs. Ischaemic myelopathy occurred most often in older cats with a stable or improving, non-painful, lateralising, C6-T2 myelopathy. Spinal fracture/luxation occurred most often in younger cats and resulted most often in a peracute onset, painful, non-ambulatory neurological status. Concurrent systemic abnormalities or abnormal findings detected on general physical examination were significantly associated with feline infectious peritonitis virus myelitis, spinal lymphoma or spinal empyema. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that using easily identifiable characteristics from the history and clinical examination can assist in obtaining a preliminary differential diagnosis when evaluating cats with spinal disease.

It is established that postoperative changes in sleep architecture occur and this may have pathophysiological implications for OSA patients. Upper airway muscle activity decreases during rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). Severe OSA patients exhibit exaggerated chemoreceptor-driven ventilation during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), which leads to central and obstructive apnea. This article critically reviewed the literature relevant to preoperative screening for OSA, prevalence of OSA in surgical populations and changes in postoperative sleep architecture relevant to OSA patients. In particular, we addressed three questions in regard to the effects of sedative-hypnotics, anesthetics and analgesics on sleep architecture, the underlying mechanisms and the relevance to OSA. Indeed, these classes of drugs alter sleep architecture, which likely significantly contributes to abnormal postoperative sleep architecture, exacerbation of OSA and postoperative complications.","McEntire, Dan M; Kirkpatrick, Daniel R; Kerfeld, Mitchell J; Hambsch, Zakary J; Reisbig, Mark D; Agrawal, Devendra K; Youngblood, Charles F",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1586/17512433.2014.966815; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25318836/,203

This study prospectively assessed efficacy and safety of linezolid, compared with a dose-optimized vancomycin regimen, for treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia. METHODS This was a prospective, double-blind, controlled, multicenter trial involving hospitalized adult patients with hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated MRSA pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous linezolid (600 mg every 12 hours) or vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 hours) for 7-14 days. Vancomycin dose was adjusted on the basis of trough levels. The primary end point was clinical outcome at end of study (EOS) in evaluable per-protocol (PP) patients. Prespecified secondary end points included response in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population at end of treatment (EOT) and EOS and microbiologic response in the PP and mITT populations at EOT and EOS. Survival and safety were also evaluated. RESULTS Of 1184 patients treated, 448 (linezolid, n = 224; vancomycin, n = 224) were included in the mITT and 348 (linezolid, n = 172; vancomycin, n = 176) in the PP population. In the PP population, 95 (57.6%) of 165 linezolid-treated patients and 81 (46.6%) of 174 vancomycin-treated patients achieved clinical success at EOS (95% confidence interval for difference, 0.5%-21.6%; P = .042). All-cause 60-day mortality was similar (linezolid, 15.7%; vancomycin, 17.0%), as was incidence of adverse events. Nephrotoxicity occurred more frequently with vancomycin (18.2%; linezolid, 8.4%). CONCLUSIONS For the treatment of MRSA nosocomial pneumonia, clinical response at EOS in the PP population was significantly higher with linezolid than with vancomycin, although 60-day mortality was similar.","Wunderink, Richard G; Niederman, Michael S; Kollef, Marin H; Shorr, Andrew F; Kunkel, Mark J; Baruch, Alice; McGee, William T; Reisman, Arlene; Chastre, Jean",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cir895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22247123/,203

The RA column was composed of hydrophobic inner column (poly(styrene-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and hydrophilic outer layer (poly-hydroxyethyl methacrylate chain) which was grafted on the hydrophobic surface by means of the second ARGET-ATRP reaction. The as-prepared RA monolithic tip was connected to a 2mL syringe for directly extracting magnolol and honokiol from rat plasma just by manually pushing operation. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the column were characterized by scanning electronic microscope, infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy respectively. The determined results of evaluation experiments based on the optimized solid phase extraction conditions showed that the RA column possessed good protein exclusion power, extraction recovery and reusability. The constructed RA-SPE-HPLC/UV method for simultaneously analyzing magnolol and honokiol in rat plasma was validated with quality control (QC) samples at four concentration levels. Good precision (RSDs, 3.39~11.16%) and acceptable accuracy (relative recoveries, 89.52%~108.42%) were obtained for intra- and inter-day assays. The determined results of real rat plasma as well as the standard-addition samples demonstrated the developed method with good accuracy and precision. It can be extrapolated from the experimental results that this simple and cost-efficient RA-SPE method is also suitable for directly extracting other hydrophobic constituents in biological body fluid for therapeutic drug monitoring or pharmacokinetic study.","Zhou, Jingwei; Hu, Yaoyao; Chen, Peichun; Zhang, Hongwu",Journal of chromatography.

Reproductive biotechnologies such as somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) and SCNT-mediated genetic modification show great potential value in genetic preservation and utilization of Huanjiang Xiang pigs. Our previous work has successfully produced cloned and transgenic-cloned embryos using somatic cells from a Huanjiang Xiang pig. In this study, we firstly report the generation of transgenic-cloned Huanjiang Xiang pigs carrying an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene. A total of 504 SCNT-derived embryos were transferred to two surrogate recipients, one of which became pregnant and gave birth to three live piglets. Exogenous eGFP transgene had integrated in all of the three Huanjiang Xiang piglets identified by genotyping. Furthermore, expression of eGFP was also detected from in vitro cultured skin fibroblast cells and various organs or tissues from positive transgenic-cloned Huanjiang Xiang pigs. The present work provides a practical method to preserve this unique genetic resource and also lays a foundation for genetic modification of Huanjiang Xiang pigs with improved values in agriculture and biomedicine.","Zhu, Xiang-Xing; Zhong, Yi-Zhi; Ge, Yao-Wen; Lu, Ke-Huan; Lu, Sheng-Sheng",Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene,https://doi.org/10.1111/rda.13301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30085375/,203

In this study, mental status was determined for 81 nurses and 61 controls using the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) scale. A subgroup (n = 57) was further scanned by resting-state functional MRI with two sessions. Based on the SCL-90 scale, ""somatic complaints"" and ""diet/sleeping"" exhibited the most prominent difference between nurses and controls. This mental health change in nurses was further supported by the spatial independent component analysis on functional MRI data. First, dynamic functional connectome analysis identified two discrete connectivity configurations (States I and II). Controls had more time in the State I than II, while the nurses had more time in the State II than I. Second, nurses showed a similar static network topology as controls, but altered dynamic properties. Third, the symptom-imaging correlation analysis suggested the functional alterations in nurses as potential imaging biomarkers indicating a high risk for ""diet/sleeping"" problems. In summary, this study emphasized the high risk of mental deficits in nurses and explored the underlying neural mechanism using dynamic brain connectome, which provided valuable information for future psychological intervention.","Bai, Ling; Ji, Gong-Jun; Song, Yongxia; Sun, Jinmei; Wei, Junjie; Xue, Fang; Zhu, Lu; Li, Rui; Han, Yanfang; Zhang, Liu; Yang, Jinying; Qiu, Bensheng; Wu, Guo-Rong; Zhang, Jing; Hong, Jingfang; Wang, Kai; Zhu, Chunyan",Human brain mapping,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25617; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34331489/,203

Here, we assessed the mechanism of ADE of PRRSV infection. First, we found that subneutralizing serum could induce ADE of PRRSV infection in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). Quantitative PCR, Western blotting and flow cytometry revealed that CD16 is the most abundant Fcγ receptor (FcγR) expressed on the surface of PAMs; thus, the role of CD16 in ADE of PRRSV infection was examined in PAMs. By using functional blocking antibodies, we demonstrated that CD16 is involved in enhanced virus production in PRRSV-antibody immune complex-infected PAMs. Because PAMs co-express different FcγR isoforms, we evaluated the effects of CD16 in FcγR-non-bearing cells by transfection. Using these engineered cells, we found that CD16 could specifically bind to the PRRSV-antibody immune complex and subsequently mediate internalization of the virus, resulting in the generation of progeny virus. We also showed that efficient expression of CD16 required association of the FcR γ-chain. Together, our findings provide significant new insights into PRRSV infection, which can be enhanced by CD16-mediated PRRSV-antibody immune complexes. This CD16-mediated ADE may induce a shift in PRRSV tropism towards CD16-expressing cells, distributing virus to more organs during virus infection.","Gu, Weihong; Guo, Longjun; Yu, Haidong; Niu, Junwei; Huang, Mingming; Luo, Xiaolei; Li, Ren; Tian, Zhijun; Feng, Li; Wang, Yue",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.000118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752917/,203

However, due to overlapping morphologies, distinguishing them remains a diagnostic challenge. Our study investigates the utility of immunohistochemistry for nuclear lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) and paired box gene 8 (PAX8) in differentiating these 2 entities. LEF1 and PAX8 immunohistochemistry were performed on fine-needle aspiration cell blocks and surgical resection specimens diagnosed as SPN or PanNET at our institution from January 2007 to August 2016. Eight SPN and 25 PanNET cell blocks and 17 SPN and 34 PanNET surgical resection specimens were examined. On cell blocks, positive staining for LEF1 had high frequency, sensitivity, and specificity for SPN (88%, 88%, and 88%) as did positive staining for PAX8 for PanNET (76%, 76%, and 75%). The findings on surgical resection specimens were consistent with those from cell blocks (LEF1+ in SPN: 100%, 100%, and 97%; PAX8+ in PanNET: 59%, 59%, and 100%). A combined LEF1+/PAX8- phenotype showed high sensitivity and specificity for SPN (cell block: 63% and 100%; surgical specimen: 100% and 98%) as did a LEF1-/PAX8+ phenotype for PanNET (cell block: 64% and 100%; surgical specimen: 59% and 100%). SPN and PanNET exhibit opposite immunophenotypic profiles with LEF1+/PAX8- in SPN and LEF1-/PAX8+ in PanNET.

158608,"Current Understanding, Knowledge Gaps and a Perspective on the Future of COVID-19 Infections: A Systematic Review.",2020,"BACKGROUND Despite widespread use of imaging technologies including ultrasonography and computed tomography, rates of negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis remain high. This trend analysis examined whether rates of negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis have decreased over time, and sought to evaluate clinical predictors associated with negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis. METHODS This analysis was based on the prospective database of the Swiss Association of Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery (SALTS). All patients aged 12 years and over undergoing emergency laparoscopic appendicectomy between 1995 and 2006 were included. Unadjusted and risk-adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 7964 patients underwent laparoscopic appendicectomy, of whom 7452 (93.6 per cent) had acute appendicitis and 512 (6.4 per cent) had a macroscopically normal appendix. Perforation occurred in 1230 (16.5 per cent) of those with appendicitis. In multivariable analysis, younger age (12-18 years), female sex, absence of local or generalized peritonitis and an early point during the study period were significant predictors of negative appendicectomy. For perforated appendicitis, significant predictors included age over 36 years, presence of localized or generalized peritonitis, and high American Society of Anesthesiologists grade. The rate of negative appendicectomy decreased from 12.7 per cent in 1995 to 2.8 per cent in 2006, there being a significant reduction in both unadjusted and risk-adjusted analyses (P < 0.001 for trend). In adjusted analyses, the rate of perforated appendicitis did not increase significantly over time. CONCLUSION The rate of negative appendicectomy decreased over time, without an accompanying increase in perforated appendicitis. The risk of having a negative appendicectomy was highest in girls aged 12-18 years without local or generalized peritonitis during the early study period, whereas perforation was associated with age over 36 years, presence of localized or generalized peritonitis, and greater co-morbidity.

Our goals were to (1) compare WCST-64 scores between HIV+ Black/African American (Black/AA) (n = 45) and Latinx (n = 41) urban-dwelling adults; (2) compare our total sample to the WCST-64 manual's normative (N) and clinical normative (CN) groups; and (3) explore relationships between WCST-64 performance and sociocultural/health variables. In our sample, employment (12%), mean annual income (<$10,000), and mean education (<12 years) were low, while mean medication adherence rates were high for both Black/AA (90%) and Latinx (87%). WCST-64 scores were similar between groups (p > .05). Percentages of ""below average"" and ""mildly impaired"" scores in our sample were higher than the N group, and similar to the CN group. Lifetime heroin use, dementia, and longer HIV illness duration were significantly associated with worse WCST-64 performance (ps < .05).

160003,Lung perfusion SPECT/CT images associated with COVID-19 - a case series.,2021,"BACKGROUND Several studies have evaluated use of local anesthetic, specifically, administration of intraperitoneal anesthetic, during laparoscopic general surgery and gynecologic operations, with varying results. There have been no studies to determine the role of local anesthetic in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. This study evaluates the efficacy of subcutaneous and intraperitoneal anesthetic in reducing postoperative pain following common laparoscopic colorectal procedures, in patients managed with enhanced recovery care pathways. METHODS A single-institution retrospective cohort analysis of 172 patients who underwent common elective laparoscopic colorectal procedures was carried out. Over three consecutive time periods, patients were divided into three study arms, based on administration of local anesthetic. The first group received no local anesthetic (n = 66), the next received only subcutaneous bupivacaine (n = 67), and the final group received both subcutaneous bupivacaine and intraperitoneal lidocaine (n = 44). Pain scores, time in the postoperative care unit, and the amount of opioid pain medication consumed in the immediate postoperative period were quantified. RESULTS There was no difference in pain scores reported between the three study arms, including upon arrival and upon leaving the recovery unit (P ≤ 0.086, P ≤ 0.166), and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 h postoperatively (P ≤ 0.332, P ≤ 0.142, P ≤ 0.155, P ≤ 0.872). There was no significant difference in the amount of postoperative opioid analgesia consumed between the three study arms on postoperative day 0 and on postoperative day 1 (P ≤ 0.365, P ≤ 0.458). There were no significant differences in the amount of time spent in the postoperative care unit, hospital stay, 30 day morbidity, or 30 day mortality between the three study arms. CONCLUSIONS Use of local anesthetic does not influence postoperative opioid requirements or patients' subjective report of pain following laparoscopic colorectal procedures managed within enhanced recovery care pathways.","Stuhldreher, Jacquelenn Marie; Adamina, Michel; Konopacka, Alex; Brady, Karen; Delaney, Conor P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2079-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179466/,203
160309,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency enhances Covid-19 infection in elderly people.,2020,"BACKGROUND Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term encompassing disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances occurring in the developing fetal or infant brain. As there are diverse risk factors and causes, no one strategy will prevent all cerebral palsy. Therefore, there is a need to systematically consider all potentially relevant interventions for their contribution to prevention. OBJECTIVES To summarise the evidence from Cochrane reviews regarding the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions for preventing cerebral palsy. METHODS We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews on 7 August 2016, for reviews of antenatal or intrapartum interventions reporting on cerebral palsy. Two authors assessed reviews for inclusion, extracted data, assessed review quality, using AMSTAR and ROBIS, and quality of the evidence, using the GRADE approach. We organised reviews by topic, and summarised findings in text and tables. We categorised interventions as effective (high-quality evidence of effectiveness); possibly effective (moderate-quality evidence of effectiveness); ineffective (high-quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); probably ineffective (moderate-quality evidence of harm or of lack of effectiveness); and no conclusions possible (low- to very low-quality evidence). MAIN RESULTS We included 15 Cochrane reviews. A further 62 reviews pre-specified the outcome cerebral palsy in their methods, but none of the included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported this outcome. The included reviews were high quality and at low risk of bias. They included 279 RCTs; data for cerebral palsy were available from 27 (10%) RCTs, involving 32,490 children. They considered interventions for: treating mild to moderate hypertension (two) and pre-eclampsia (two); diagnosing and preventing fetal compromise in labour (one); preventing preterm birth (four); preterm fetal maturation or neuroprotection (five); and managing preterm fetal compromise (one). Quality of evidence ranged from very low to high. Effective interventions: high-quality evidence of effectiveness There was a reduction in cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.87; five RCTs; 6145 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of harm There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children born to mothers in preterm labour with intact membranes who received any prophylactic antibiotics versus no antibiotics (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.99 to 3.34; one RCT; 3173 children). There was an increase in cerebral palsy in children, who as preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, were born immediately compared with those for whom birth was deferred (RR 5.88, 95% CI 1.33 to 26.02; one RCT; 507 children). Probably ineffective interventions: moderate-quality evidence of lack of effectiveness There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy in children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received repeat doses of corticosteroids compared with a single course (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.50; four RCTs; 3800 children). No conclusions possible: low- to very low-quality evidence Low-quality evidence found there was a possible reduction in cerebral palsy for children born to women at risk of preterm birth who received antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation compared with placebo (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03; five RCTs; 904 children). There was no clear difference in the presence of cerebral palsy with interventionist care for severe pre-eclampsia versus expectant care (RR 6.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 48.14; one RCT; 262 children); magnesium sulphate for pre-eclampsia versus placebo (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.26; one RCT; 2895 children); continuous cardiotocography for fetal assessment during labour versus intermittent auscultation (average RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.63; two RCTs; 13,252 children); prenatal progesterone for prevention of preterm birth versus placebo (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.48; one RCT; 274 children); and betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour versus placebo (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.63; one RCT; 246 children).Very low-quality found no clear difference for the presence of cerebral palsy with any antihypertensive drug (oral beta-blockers) for treatment of mild to moderate hypertension versus placebo (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.01; one RCT; 110 children); magnesium sulphate for prevention of preterm birth versus other tocolytic agents (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.51; one RCT; 106 children); and vitamin K and phenobarbital prior to preterm birth for prevention of neonatal periventricular haemorrhage versus placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.76; one RCT; 299 children). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This overview summarises evidence from Cochrane reviews on the effects of antenatal and intrapartum interventions on cerebral palsy, and can be used by researchers, funding bodies, policy makers, clinicians and consumers to aid decision-making and evidence translation. We recommend that readers consult the included Cochrane reviews to formally assess other benefits or harms of included interventions, including impacts on risk factors for cerebral palsy (such as the reduction in intraventricular haemorrhage for preterm babies following exposure to antenatal corticosteroids).Magnesium sulphate for women at risk of preterm birth for fetal neuroprotection can prevent cerebral palsy. Prophylactic antibiotics for women in preterm labour with intact membranes, and immediate rather than deferred birth of preterm babies with suspected fetal compromise, may increase the risk of cerebral palsy. Repeat doses compared with a single course of antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth do not clearly impact the risk of cerebral palsy.Cerebral palsy is rarely diagnosed at birth, has diverse risk factors and causes, and is diagnosed in approximately one in 500 children. To date, only a small proportion of Cochrane reviews assessing antenatal and intrapartum interventions have been able to report on this outcome. There is an urgent need for long-term follow-up of RCTs of interventions addressing risk factors for cerebral palsy, and consideration of the use of relatively new interim assessments (including the General Movements Assessment). Such RCTs must be rigorous in their design, and aim for consistency in cerebral palsy outcome measurement and reporting to facilitate pooling of data, to focus research efforts on prevention.","Shepherd, Emily; Salam, Rehana A; Middleton, Philippa; Makrides, Maria; McIntyre, Sarah; Badawi, Nadia; Crowther, Caroline A",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012077.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28786098/,203
160658,Higher midlife CAIDE score is associated with increased brain atrophy in a cohort of cognitively healthy middle-aged individuals.,2021-01-09,"INTRODUCTION Radiographic assessment of facial fractures with computed tomography (CT) scanning has become standard of care. As imaging resolution has improved, findings such as herniation of extraocular muscles (EOM) have become a means of diagnosing conditions like orbital entrapment. However, the sensitivity and specificity of these findings has not been well-studied. We sought to evaluate the value of radiographic findings such as fat herniation, EOM contour irregularity, and EOM herniation in predicting orbital entrapment after orbital fracture. Secondary endpoints include diplopia, abnormal EOM motility, and the need for surgical fixation. METHODS A single institution, retrospective review at a regional level 1 trauma center was conducted. Patients with orbital fractures were identified by International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and CT reports were queried for the terms ""herniation,"" ""herniated,"" ""entrapped,"" and ""entrapment."" Four hundred records were analyzed. RESULTS Sixty-seven percent of radiology reports mentioned ""entrapped"" or ""entrapment,"" while the incidence of clinical entrapment was 2.8%. The odds of entrapment, diplopia, and abnormal EOM motility were higher in those with EOM herniation; however, EOM herniation had a positive predictive value of 7.9% for clinical entrapment. Fat herniation alone and EOM contour irregularity had positive predictive values of 4.2% and 4.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS While the odds of entrapment appear higher in patients with EOM herniation, this imaging finding is not predictive of clinical entrapment. Fat herniation and EOM contour irregularity did not have higher odds of entrapment, nor were they predictive. Diagnosis of orbital entrapment should be based primarily on physical exam, with CT as an adjunct only. The assumption that radiographic findings indicate orbital emergencies may result in unnecessary interfacility transfers, subspecialist consultations, and emergency operative procedures.","Pontell, Matthew E; Jackson, Kianna; Golinko, Michael; Drolet, Brian C",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33055563/,203

163028,COVID-19 Patient in a Dental Office – Literature Review,2020,"Background: Some older adults show exaggerated responses to drugs that act on the brain, such as increased delirium risk in response to anticholinergic drugs. The brain's response to anesthetic drugs is often measured clinically by processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices. Thus, we developed a processed EEG based-measure of the brain's neurophysiologic resistance to anesthetic dose-related changes, and hypothesized that it would predict postoperative delirium. Methods: We defined the Duke Anesthesia Resistance Scale (DARS) as the average BIS index divided by the quantity 2.5 minus the average age-adjusted end-tidal MAC (aaMAC) inhaled anesthetic fraction. The relationship between DARS and postoperative delirium was analyzed in derivation (Duke; N=69), validation (Mt Sinai; N=70), and combined estimation cohorts (N=139) of older surgical patients (age >/= 65). In the derivation cohort, we identified a threshold relationship between DARS and for delirium and identified an optimal cut point for prediction. Results: In the derivation cohort, the optimal DARS threshold for predicting delirium was 27.0. The delirium rate was 11/49 (22.5%) vs 11/20 (55.0%) and 7/57 (12.3%) vs 6/13 (46.2%) for those with DARS >/= 27 vs those with DARS < 27 in the derivation and validation cohorts respectively. In the combined estimation cohort, multivariable analysis found a significant association of DARS <27.0 with postoperative delirium (OR=4.7; 95% CI: 1.87, 12.0; p=0.001). In the derivation cohort, the DARS had an AUC of 0.63 with sensitivity of 50%, specificity of 81%, positive predictive value of 0.55, and negative predictive value of 0.78. The DARS remained a significant predictor of delirium after accounting for opioid, midazolam, propofol, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, phenylephrine and ketamine dosage, and for nitrous oxide and epidural usage. Conclusions: These results, if confirmed by larger future studies, suggest than an intraoperative processed EEG-based measure of lower brain anesthetic resistance (i.e. DARS <27) could be used in older surgical patients as an independent predictor of postoperative delirium risk.","Cooter, M.; Bunning, T.; Eleswarpu, S.

This is due to its continued grappling with simultaneous political, economic, and conflict-related transitions: Myanmar was a largely closed-off military dictatorship for nearly fifty years prior to its partial opening in 2011. In conjunction with structural factors, the triple transition had several important implications for Myanmar’s response to the pandemic. First, many of the aggressive approaches to countering Covid-19 that were effective in other contexts were infeasible for Myanmar, as the state lacked the capacity to enforce comprehensive population movement controls and large-scale testing and contact tracing. Second, Myanmar’s structural conditions prevented a uniform response to the pandemic. Third, Myanmar has several high-risk subgroups that complicated responses to the pandemic. © the several contributors 2021.","Ostwald, K.; Myint, T.",Covid-19 in Asia: Law and Policy Contexts,https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780197553831.003.0023,203

However, the practice of social distancing and stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic has severely hindered leisure involvement. We knew little about how the reduction in leisure participation during the pandemic affected older adults' leisure lifestyles. The purpose of the study was to explore how older adults adapted in times when their leisure opportunities were constrained. Data were collected through a multi-author blog. Participants (n = 28) were invited to create posts, share photos, and comment on the posts of others. Data were analyzed thematically. The findings demonstrated that older adults gradually adapted to the pandemic in a manner that closely aligned with the Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) model. The article discusses how the SOC model could be applied in the context of external adversity.","Chung, W.; Genoe, M.

Simple, yet powerful methods such as bar- and QR-codes have been highly successful, e.g. in the retail space, but the lack of security, limited information content and impossibility of seamless integration with the environment have prevented a large-scale linking of physical objects to their digital twins. This paper proposes to link digital assets created through BIM with their physical counterparts using fiducial markers with patterns defined by Cholesteric Spherical Reflectors (CSRs), selective retroreflectors produced using liquid crystal self-assembly. The markers leverage the ability of CSRs to encode information that is easily detected and read with computer vision while remaining practically invisible to the human eye. We analyze the potential of a CSR-based infrastructure from the perspective of BIM, critically reviewing the outstanding challenges in applying this new class of functional materials, and we discuss extended opportunities arising in assisting autonomous mobile robots to reliably navigate human-populated environments, as well as in augmented reality.","Schwartz, Mathew; Geng, Yong; Agha, Hakam; Kizhakidathazhath, Rijeesh; Liu, Danqing; Lenzini, Gabriele; Lagerwall, Jan PF",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05800v1.pdf,203

Since the pandemic began in China at the end of 2019, the disease spread to every landmass except Antarctica. The effect of antiviral drugs on the new corona virus has been tested, but no basic and complete cure has been found, although there are many drugs such as interleukin-6 inhibitor, monoclonal antibody and corticosteroid which remarkably reduced mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients in a major clinical trial. Although not enough experimental data has been released yet, many researchers have hailed the result as a step in the right direction. In this review, a series of the newly chemical derivatives were synthesized and evaluated against human coronavirus. Many derivatives found to be active in inhibiting the cellular infection of human coronavirus which causes the SARS-CoV-2pandemic. This mini- review summarizes the synthesis of these new antiviral derivatives that target coronaviruses and describes general current strategies and models for developing antiviral drugs. The review aims to provide a starting point for medicinal chemists to synthesize necessary and effective drugs against coronaviruses.","Hussein, W.; Alheibshy, F.; Alshammari, F.",Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International,https://doi.org/10.9734/jpri/2021/v33i34b31861,203

Objectives: To assess sarcopenia rate (which has not been described yet) following COVID-19 hospitalization and to highlights features associated with sarcopenic vs. non-sarcopenic patients. Methods: Major confirmed COVID-19 patients undergoing intensive care unit (ICU) or Pneumology Department admission in Strasbourg University Hospital between March and June 2020 were prospectively included. Muscle and cardio-respiratory evaluations were performed 3 months after discharge. Sarcopenic patients were compared to non-sarcopenic ones. A second muscle assessment 6 months after discharge was performed in patients with pathologic muscle tests. Results: 127 patients were included, 39 (30.7%) not requiring ICU care, 88 (69.3%) requiring ICU care. The cohort consisted of 71% male patients, with a median age of 63 years [28-82]. Forty-one-percent were obese (BMI>30 kg/m2). Most individuals had preexisting comorbidities (82 patients, 70%), mainly hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The median total hospital stay duration was 22 days and up to 89 days. At the 3 months assessment, 17/127 (13%) patients were diagnosed with sarcopenia which comprised 6/17 (35%) severe sarcopenia (4.7% of the total cohort). At the 6 months assessment, only 4/15 (27%) of the initial sarcopenic patients remained sarcopenic (3% of the total cohort) and 3 of these 4 patients had severe sarcopenia. BMI (26,3 vs. 29,3, p=0.03), COPD (20% vs. 3%, p=0.03), comorbidities (93% vs. 67%, p=0.04), total hospital stay duration (33 vs. 20 days, p=0.03) and ICU stay duration (33 vs. 13 days, p=0.01) were significantly associated with sarcopenic vs. no sarcopenic patients. However, there was no significant difference concerning cardio-pulmonary evaluations between these two groups. Conclusion: We here highlighted a sarcopenia prevalence at 3 and 6 months following a hospitalization for COVID-19 of 13% and 3% respectively, occurring mainly in patients with comorbidities. Sarcopenia was not associated to worse cardio-pulmonary results in comparison with non-sarcopenic patients.","Levy, D.; Giannini, M.; Oulehri, W.; Riou, M.; Marcot, C.; Meyer, A.; Geny, B.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2531,203
166060,ITP World Impact Survey (I-WISh) 2.0: Further Exploration of the Impact of ITP on Patients,2020,"Evidence strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the S1 subunit of its spike protein, and S1 can be used as a proxy for the uptake patterns and mechanisms used by the whole virus; unlike studies based on productive infection, viral proteins can be used to precisely determine pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. Here, we found that radioiodinated S1 (I-S1) readily crossed the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB). I-S1 from two commercial sources crossed the BBB with unidirectional influx constants of 0.287 ± 0.024 μL/g-min and 0.294 ± 0.032 μL/g-min and was also taken up by lung, spleen, kidney, and liver. I-S1 was uniformly taken up by all regions of the brain and inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide reduced uptake in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. I-S1 crossed the BBB completely to enter the parenchymal brain space, with smaller amounts retained by brain endothelial cells and the luminal surface. Studies on the mechanisms of transport indicated that I-S1 crosses the BBB by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis and that the murine ACE2 receptor is involved in brain and lung uptake, but not that by kidney, liver, or spleen. I-S1 entered brain after intranasal administration at about 1/10th the amount found after intravenous administration and about 0.66% of the intranasal dose entered blood. ApoE isoform or sex did not affect whole brain uptake, but had variable effects on olfactory bulb, liver, spleen, and kidney uptakes. In summary, I-S1 readily crosses the murine BBB, entering all brain regions and the peripheral tissues studied, likely by the mechanism of adsorptive transcytosis.

The sample consisted of voluntarily participating German elementary (n = 857) and secondary school teachers (n = 1,590) from a sample of randomly drawn schools in four federal states in Germany. We describe the main survey findings and examine the importance of different distance teaching aspects for teacher reports of students attaining their learning objectives and students’ learning progress during distance teaching. Our results particularly highlight the necessity for students and teachers to remain in contact in all the surveyed school types. In elementary school, regular contact between teachers and parents is similarly important. The key challenges highlighted inadequate digitalization, the participation of all students, and students’ motivation. Correspondingly, adequate technical equipment for schools, teachers, and students, together with teachers’ and students’ competence to use technical devices and digital media as well as students’ motivation to participate in distance learning were found to be necessary prerequisites for successful distance teaching. We conclude that efforts should be devoted to enabling teachers and students to better communicate using digital devices, for example, expanding the digital infrastructure in combination with training teachers and students in the use of technical devices and digital media. © Copyright © 2021 Schneider, Sachse, Schipolowski and Enke.","Schneider, R.; Sachse, K.

Even though phishing email attacks are a known cybercriminal strategy for decades, their usage has been expanded over last couple of years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, where attackers exploit people's consternation to lure victims. Therefore, further research is needed in the phishing email detection field. Recent phishing email detection solutions that extract representational text-based features from the email's body have proved to be an appropriate strategy to tackle these threats. This paper proposes a comparison approach for the combined usage of Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT) and Machine Learning (Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Trees, and Naive Bayes) methods for phishing email detection. The evaluation was performed on two datasets, one balanced and one imbalanced, both of which were comprised of emails from the well-known Enron corpus and the most recent emails from the Nazario phishing corpus.

Design: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Methods: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and Google Scholar up to 26th August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. Results: We identified 1,908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.93, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.59-2.34) compared to people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalised cohorts (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.05-2.24) and studies of PLWH across all settings (HR 2.08, 95%CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower-quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate (TDF)-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by comorbidities. Conclusion: Evidence is emerging that suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of TDF is warranted.","Mellor, Maya; Bast, Anne; Jones, Nicholas; Roberts, Nia; Ordonez-Mena, Jose; Reith, Alastair; Butler, Christopher C; Matthews, Philippa C; Dorward, Jienchi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.22.20199661,203

171924,Clinical Relevance of Masks in the Operating Room? A Systematic Review,2021,"Introduction: A growing body of data has shown that higher cumulative anesthesia exposure is associated with neurocognitive impairment in children with chronic disease, including those with hematologic malignancies [Banerjee JAMA Oncology 2019]. To limit general anesthesia (GA) exposure alternative means of sedation and acceptance of alternatives by patients, families and providers need to be explored for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma (ALL/LL) undergoing repeated lumbar punctures (LP) to deliver intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. Methods: Patients age 1 to 25 years with ALL/LL treated at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia main outpatient clinic (CHOP Main) and two CHOP satellite oncology offices (KOP, VOR) were analyzed for baseline rates of sedation for lumbar punctures. GA was defined as the use of intravenous (IV) propofol or an inhalational flurane. Moderate sedation was defined as IV fentanyl (maximum 2 mcg/kg dosing) for analgesia and midazolam (maximum 0.1 mg/kg) for anxiolysis. IV or oral midazolam only was considered mild sedation. We created a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) pathway to implement the use of mild/moderate sedation as a new Division of Oncology standard for LP-only procedures. Our QI goal was a 10% reduction in use of GA with concomitant measurement of outpatient clinic length of stay (LOS) as an additional metric. LOS was measured as time from triage to port de-access. Results: Our interdisciplinary QI team leveraged the CHOP QI framework utilizing tools that included a driver diagram (Figure 1) and impact/effort matrix to develop and prioritize interventions associated with achieving the QI goal. The Plan-Do-Study Act methodology was used to optimize the intervention. This required extensive collaboration with pediatric oncologists, nurse practitioners, nursing, child life, pharmacy, and QI staff to encourage methodology adoption and to optimize clinic workflow for maximal provider/patient participation and procedural efficiency. In the immediate period preceding the QI intervention (October 2019 to February 2020), baseline rates of GA use for across all 3 clinic sites were 73.1%, 15% (plus 34.6% deep sedation), and 24.7% at CHOP Main, KOP, and VNJ, respectively in 310 LP only procedures for patients with ALL/LL. After a delay in implementation due to COVID, the rate of GA usage at CHOP Main from May to July 2020 was reduced to 55.6% for 81 LPs (p=0.001) (Figure 2), while GA rates at the satellite clinics were unchanged. Decreased GA use at CHOP main was replaced by a significant increase in mild/moderate sedation (26.9% to 44.5%;p=0.001). Of the 18 newly diagnosed patients participating in the intervention to date, 16 receive their LPs with no or mild/moderate sedation. The median age of this cohort is 7 years of age with 6 patients ≤ 5 and 12 patients ≤ 10 years. The other two patients have medical syndromes deemed not conducive to replacing GA with moderate sedation. No child has experienced complications from moderate sedation or returned to GA due to sedation intolerance. Overall clinic LOS decreased significantly for all patients getting LPs (GA and sedation) (mean 4.88 hours vs 4.08 hours;p=0.033). An unintended benefit of the QI initiative is that the average LOS for patients receiving moderate sedation decreased from 6.67 hours to 4.15 hours (p=0.017) with the new streamlined clinic workflow. Conclusion: Baseline rates of sedation varied by oncology clinic site and appeared to align with ease of access to GA. GA is available in the oncology main clinic 3 days/week, and 73% of ALL/LL patients were using GA for LPs prior to the intervention. Since March 2020, nearly all patients with newly diagnosed ALL/LL are now undergoing LPs with no or mild/moderate sedation. Our data show that with appropriate education and preparation, LP with mild/moderate sedation is a feasible alternative to GA even for very young patients and reduces clinic LOS. We have expanded this QI intervention to include children with other newly-diagnosed cancers who require LP and/or IT chemotherapy. Future directions include converting patients in ALL/LL maintenance and those undergoing other minimally invasive procedures from GA to moderate sedation.

Based on the information we got, we think that cell lines infected by coronavirus might go through 5 stages, and 10 HUB genes(AKT1, CD68, CTSS, FCGR3A, HSPA8, PTPRC, UBC, VCP, PRPF31, ITPKB) might play a key role in coronavirus infection.

So far, it has caused 203,815,431 confirmed cases and 4,310,623 deaths in the world. We collected sequences from 150,659 COVID-19 patients. Based on the previous phylogenomic analysis, we found three major branches of the virus RNA genomic mutation located in Asia, America, and Europe which is consistent with other studies. We selected sites with high mutation frequencies from Asia, America, and Europe. There are only 13 common mutation sites in these three regions. It infers that the viral mutations are highly dependent on their location and different locations have specific mutations. Most mutations can lead to amino acid substitutions, which occurred in 3/5’UTR, S/N/M protein, and ORF1ab/3a/8/10. Thus, the mutations may affect the pathogenesis of the virus. In addition, we applied an ARIMA model to predict the short-term frequency change of these top mutation sites during the spread of the disease. We tested a variety of settings of the ARIMA model to optimize the prediction effect of three patterns. This model can provide good help for predicting short-term mutation frequency changes.","Wei, Bomin; Sun, Yuzhe; Gong, Xiang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.11.455941,203

SARS CoV-2, another coronavirus, causes it. Finding effective therapeutics against this global health crisis became a significant challenge for researchers. However, Allopathic medicine is effective to some extent with severe side effects, which cause concern. In this process, some researchers focused on natural compounds like plant-synthesized secondary metabolites (PSMs) for the treatment of COVID-19. Because these natural compounds like PSMs had a history of tackling a wide range of viral pathogens successfully without significant side effects. Many medicinal plants from different families have antiviral activities. This review intends to systematically evaluate the natural metabolites that could be used against this new disease looking at their natural sources, mechanism of action, and previous pharmacological usages. So, it can be a good initiation for the greater goal of finding effective natural therapeutics for the treatment of Covid-19 without any severe side effects.","Vasavi, M.; Pujitha, M.; Raagini, G.; Ramaiah, M.; Ramalingeswara Rao, K.",International Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Pharmacy,https://doi.org/10.7897/2277-4343.120385,203

Guided by the revolutionary thinking of complexity theory, this leadership perspective details leadership for sustainability. Leadership for sustainability suggests systems are comprised of dynamic relationships, including social and social–ecological relationships, in which every action, and interaction, creates an opportunity to disrupt the system. It is through system disruption that change emerges, as relationships throughout the system form new patterns of equilibrium. In leadership for sustainability, each individual within the system has the capacity to initiate change and the responsibility to continually adjust interactions in support of system sustainability, defined as ecological viability, social equity, and economic prosperity. This leadership perspective explores the implications of leadership for sustainability during and after the global COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing how leadership scholarship and practice must change to equip all individuals with the capacity to disrupt systems, collaborate across differences, learn continuously, and build relationships in an effort to collectively advance toward a more ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable future. © 2021 University of Phoenix","McKim, A.

Epidemic dynamics in hypergraphs has been studied by using the simplicial susceptible-infected-susceptible ($s$-SIS) model; however, the efficient immunization strategy for epidemics in hypergraphs is not studied despite the importance of the topic in mathematical epidemiology. Here, we propose an immunization strategy that immunizes hyperedges with high simultaneous infection probability (SIP). This strategy can be implemented in general hypergraphs. We also generalize the edge epidemic importance (EI)-based immunization strategy, which is the state of the art in complex networks. However, it does not perform as well as the SIP-based method in hypergraphs despite its high computational cost. We also show that immunizing hyperedges with high H-eigenscore effectively contains the epidemics in uniform hypergraphs. A high SIP of a hyperedge suggests that the hyperedge is a""hotspot""of the epidemic process. Therefore, SIP can be used as a centrality measure to quantify a hyperedge's influence on higher-order dynamics in general hypergraphs. The effectiveness of the immunization strategies suggests the necessity of scientific, data-driven, systematic policy-making for epidemic containment.","Jhun, Bukyoung",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04568v2.pdf,203

Since the COVID pandemic, our human needs and values have been rapidly evolving in a new direction that takes us back to our humanity in a quest to retrieve the lost meaning in our lives. We are experiencing a 180-degree paradigm shift from brands to people reversing the dynamic of the brand-consumer relationships. For this reason, the future of consumer collectives is a human collective. There are no consumers or collectives. There is only one collective: the human collective. As we are reclaiming our humanity and are awakening to our higher needs, segmenting people into consumer collectives is no longer as relevant. To authentically connect with people, brands need to shift their focus away from themselves and their purpose and focus on what people value—and that is meaning.

Ninety-nine student-athletes (Mage = 19.7 years, SD = 1.5) completed assessments on their mental health. Regression analysis revealed experiences directly related to COVID-19 did not affect general well-being or quality of life, but anxiety, depression, and significant insomnia did. Social well-being was lower for student-athletes closer to graduation (e.g., juniors, seniors), independent of reported anxiety and depression levels. These findings highlight the importance of psychosocial support, particularly in times of crisis, and indicate that tailored support might be beneficial at later stages of the collegiate years.","Schary, David P.; Lundqvist, Carolina",Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology,https://doi.org/10.1123/jcsp.2021-0041,203

There can be many repercussions on existing public health issues, especially tuberculosis (TB), which is endemic in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In most of the LMICs, the health services are poorly equipped, the resources being diverted to control the pandemic of COVID-19, which can lead to grave consequences for LMICs. COVID-19 and TB are known to affect the respiratory system, so their symptoms are very similar, and at times can be perplexing for diagnosis. Moreover, lack of proper treatment and vaccine for COVID19 can further increase the mounting pressure. Synthetic drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, are currently being used, but the side effects are a cause of concern. Hence, the efficacy of repositioned drugs is still under evaluation. The situation is further worsened by the possible development of drug-resistant mutants. What we need in current times is potential novel anti-viral drugs that are highly productive and economic in control and management of viral infections in LMICs. The only option which we can look upon is the natural products which are also known as bioactive compounds and their phytochemicals like flavonoids, alkaloids and peptides that have anti-viral secondary metabolites which have shown promising results on COVID-19. This review systematically emphasizes the urgency for treatment options, which can be both safe and effective, especially for TB patients from LMICs.","Dolma, K. G.; Mahboob, T.; Pereira, M.

We focus on the problem of novelty detection in images based on deep learning (DL) techniques. DL based models are trained through an optimization process in which a loss function is minimized. For visual novelty detection, this loss function must be able to capture in a scalar value the visual properties of the normal samples, usually the mean square error (MSE). While satisfactory performance has been obtained with this formulation, it is often complicated for a single loss function to capture all of the relevant information to discriminate novelty from normality. In this paper we propose novel reconstruction loss that combines pixel-wise and perceptual information. Its performance is experimentally evaluated using generative adversarial networks (GANs), and compared against autoencoders based on MSE, showing superior performance. Additionally, we present an application to novelty detection in X-Ray images, which is relevant for current work con COVID diagnosis. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Palacios-Alonso, M.

To this end, the political economy approach, along with presenting ethnographic narratives that are pertinent to the subject under study, is used as an analytical lens. Also, document review of journal articles, official and academic reports, internet blogs, and newspaper and other media posts was undertaken to substantiate findings from primary sources. The paper concludes that the ongoing Ethiopian transition unfolded by paving avenues for opening up space for negotiating unsettled issues surrounding state-society relations in a context of a relatively liberalized political economy. However, the envisioned model of transition is constrained by different factors characterized by a split in the ranks of the ruling coalition, intergroup conflicts, and rising unmet expectations that resulted in the absence of peace and stability. Besides, the prevailing weakness of democratic institutions and polarized inter-ethnic relations, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic stalled the progress of the transition process.","Ashine, Yonas Berhanu Kassahun",Journal of Asian and African Studies,https://doi.org/10.1177/00219096211007653,203

180942,Neuropsychiatric disorders as risk factors and consequences of COVID-19: A Mendelian randomization study,2021-07-03,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the delivery of face-to-face teaching especially bedside teaching for medical students in the hospitals. Rheumatology outpatient clinics have mostly become virtual or telephone consultation clinics which prevent medical students from seeing patients in person. Students are deprived of the opportunities to take rheumatology history, examining patients and seeing signs of rheumatologic diseases. New adaptations have to be made to ensure equitability and that students still receive the relevant teaching in line with their learning curriculum and to help them prepare for their examinations. Objectives: Our aims are: 1)To adapt bedside teaching in the wards to simulated teaching in the classroom using trained simulated 'patients';and 2)To create simulation teaching of patient journeys in Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) format known as Clinically Observed Medical Education Tutorials (COMET) (Nair et al., 2001). Methods: 1)For simulated teaching in the classroom, we have trained our teaching colleagues as simulated or standardized patients (SPs). We write up fictitious patient histories which simulate common presentations at rheumatology clinics. We train the SPs to give as accurate a history as possible and to simulate pains in different joints (e.g. pain at the metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints in rheumatoid arthritis) on clinical examinations. For clinical presentations that are not easily simulated, we use photographs of the relevant signs. This method is used not only as formative assessments but also as endof-placement summative assessments. 2)COMET comprises 3 OSCE-style stations with a tutor each where the students perform different tasks based on a patient's clinical problem (e.g. acute hot swollen joint). The first station is initial A-to-E assessment of the patient (using a simulator), followed by investigations and interpretations of lab results and imaging (station 2) and lastly, management (including prescribing medications) and communication skills (e.g. explain arthrocentesis to the patient). Results: The overall feedback from students is very positive. We use Likert scale to assess confidence level before and after the teaching session, and pre-session and post-session multiple choice questions to assess learning and knowledge gained. Conclusion: While simulated teaching cannot replace encounters with real patients, students do enjoy these sessions as they get to 'experience' a large variety of rheumatologic cases and practice their clinical skills which at times are limited with real patients due to reluctance and pain of the patients.","Chang, Y.; Nicholls, J.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2635,203

Multiple studies have noted telemedicine as an effective alternative to traditional face-to-face management of patients. This study provides insight into public perception and impression of telemedicine in Hong Kong, specifically among the elderly who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Methods Face-to-face surveys were conducted on elderly relatives of current medical students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who were aged [≥] 60 years. The survey included socio-demographic details; past medical history; and concerns towards telemedicine use. Univariate and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to examine statistically significant associations. The primary outcomes are consideration of telemedicine use during: (1) a severe outbreak; and (2) after the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 109 surveys were conducted. Multivariable regression analyses revealed that expectation of government subsidies for telemedicine services was the strongest common driver, and also the only positive independent predictors of telemedicine use for both during a severe outbreak, as well as after the COVID-19 pandemic. No negative independent predictors of telemedicine use during severe outbreak were found. Negative independent predictors of telemedicine use after the COVID-19 pandemic included old age, and living in the New Territories. Conclusions Government support such as telemedicine-specific subsidies will be crucial in promoting telemedicine use in Hong Kong both during a severe outbreak and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Robust dissemination of information regarding the pros and cons of telemedicine towards the public, especially towards the elderly population, is warranted.","Choi, M. C. Y.; Chu, S. H.; Siu, L.

However, the contribution of each dose to the generation of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the degree of protection against novel variants, including delta, warrant further study. Here, we investigated the B cell response to the BNT162b2 vaccine by integrating repertoire analysis with single-cell transcriptomics of B cells from serial blood collections pre- and post-vaccination. The first vaccine dose elicits highly mutated IgA+ plasmablasts against the S protein subunit S2 at day 7, suggestive of recall of a memory B cell response generated by prior infections with heterologous coronaviruses. On day 21, we observed minimally-mutated IgG+ activated switched memory B cells targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, likely representing a primary response derived from naive B cells. The B cell response against RBD is specifically boosted by the second vaccine dose, and encodes antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and partially neutralize novel variants, including delta. These results demonstrate that the first vaccine dose activates a non-neutralizing recall response predominantly targeting S2, while the second vaccine dose is vital to boosting neutralizing anti-S1 RBD B cell responses.","Brewer, R.

181759,"Demographics, outcomes, and risk factors for patients (Pts) with sarcoma and COVID-19: A multiinstitutional cohort analysis",2021,"The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a revolutionary technology to detect and characterize distinct cell populations under different biological conditions. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, the expression of genes from scRNA-seq is highly sparse due to limited sequencing depth per cell. This is worsened by tossing away a significant portion of reads that cannot be mapped during gene quantification. To overcome data sparsity and fully utilize original sequences, we propose scSimClassify, a reference-free and alignment-free approach to classify cell types with k-mer level features derived from raw reads in a scRNA-seq experiment. The major contribution of scSimClassify is the simhash method compressing k-mers with similar abundance profiles into groups. The compressed k-mer groups (CKGs) serve as the aggregated k-mer level features for cell type classification. We evaluate the performance of CKG features for predicting cell types in four scRNA-seq datasets comparing four state-of-the-art classification methods as well as two scRNA-seq specific algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate that the CKG features lend themselves to better performance than traditional gene expression features in scRNA-seq classification accuracy in the majority of cases. Because CKG features can be efficiently derived from raw reads without a resource-intensive alignment process, scSimClassify offers an efficient alternative to help scientists rapidly classify cell types without relying on reference sequences. The current version of scSimClassify is implemented in python and can be found at https://github.com/digi2002/scSimClassify.","Sun, Qi; Peng, Yifan; Liu, Jinze",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.29.446268,203

The number of opinions rapidly increased since the countries began implementing social isolation and reduction. In these comments, users often express different emotions regarding COVID-19 signs and symptoms, the majority of which are sadness and fear sentiments. It is important to determine the symptom effect level for the emotions of symptomatic persons based on their opinions. However, no study analyzes the tweets' sentiment related to the COVID-19 topic to predict the symptoms effect level. Therefore, in this study, we present a method to predict the symptoms effect level based on the sentiment analysis of symptomatic persons according to the following steps. First, the sentiments in tweets are analyzed by using a combination of the text representation model and convolutional neural network. Second, a topic modeling model is built based on the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm to group symptoms into small clusters that conform to sadness and fear sentiments. Finally, the symptom effect level is predicted based on the probability distribution of the symptoms in each sentiment cluster. Experiments using tweets promise that the proposed method achieves significant results toward the accuracy and obtained information. © 2021 IEEE.","Phan, H. T.; Bui, V. H.; Nguyen, N.

In this report, we describe two educational escape rooms built using freely available technology and implemented with two different cohorts of interprofessional learners in large-scale courses of over 500 students. We sought to demonstrate that a screen-based or virtual escape room approach was feasible, flexible in terms of content and format, and engaging for learners collaborating in small group teams. Cohort 1 of students from the Interprofessional Quality Improvement and Patient Safety course included 510 students on 88 teams. The activity was completed in person as a tabletop exercise utilizing a shared computer. Most students indicated the exercise was worthwhile and posttest scores on a subset of measures of patient safety learning (APSQ-III) were significantly higher than retrospective pretest scores with moderate effect size. Cohort 2 included 523 students in the Foundations of Interprofessional Collaborative Practice course. This cohort completed the activity asynchronously and virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reactions were generally positive though limited in number. An interprofessional educational virtual escape room proved to be feasible and well-received across two different learner groups, two sets of content, and two modes for group collaboration: in person versus remote. Piloting this approach required only resources that are freely available online and a sustainable level of faculty engagement, enabling implementation at any program size.

Ours is a retrospective, observational study of 203 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All of them were confirmed RT-PCR positive cases. We used simple hematological parameters (total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ration and platelet to lymphocyte ratio); and a severity classification of pneumonia (mild, moderate and severe) based on a single clinical parameter, the percentage saturation of oxygen at room air, to predict the outcome in these cases. The results show that a high absolute neutrophil count on day of onset of pneumonia symptoms correlated strongly with both severity and survival in COVID-19. In addition, it was the primary driver of an initial high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) observed in patients with severe disease. The effect of low lymphocyte count was not found to be very significant in our cohort. Multivariate logistic regression was done using Python 3.7 to assess whether these parameters can adequately predict survival. We found that clinical severity and a high neutrophil count on day of presentation of pneumonia symptoms could predict the outcome with 86% precision.

Given the dynamic nature of the pandemic, to catch the day-level within individual variance (along with between individuals variance), the study adopts a multilevel approach where days are nested in people. 1950 day-level data are collected from 390 respondents for five consecutive days during the first phase of the pandemic (when there were strict social isolation policies) in Turkey. Results for partitioning variance components supported the necessity of using a multilevel approach. Findings of analysis conducted through hierarchical linear modeling demonstrated that day-level physical activity at home and digital socializing significantly alleviate daily negative affect and positively associate with day-level positive affect and happiness levels of respondents. These results were controlled for demographic variables, extraversion, and psychological resiliency. Extraversion was negatively, and psychological resiliency was positively related to day-level negative affect.

Dada la naturaleza dinámica de la pandemia para capturar el nivel diario dentro de la varianza individual, el estudio adapta un enfoque multinivel donde los días se anidan en personas. Se recopilan 1950 datos diarios a partir de 390 encuestados durante 5 días consecutivos durante la primera fase de la pandemia (cuando había políticas estrictas de aislamiento social) en Turquía. Los resultados de la partición de los componentes de la varianza respaldaron la necesidad de utilizar un enfoque multinivel. Los resultados del análisis realizado a través de modelos lineales jerárquicos demostraron que la actividad física a nivel diurno en el hogar y la socialización digital alivian significativamente el afecto negativo diario y se asocia positivamente con el nivel diario de afecto positivo y los niveles de felicidad de los encuestados. Estos resultados fueron controlados por variables demográficas, extraversión y resiliencia psicológica. La extraversión fue negativa y la resiliencia psicológica se relacionó positivamente con el nivel diario de afecto negativo.

Final rule with comment period.,2017,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, fluctuating mask mandates, and school re-openings, increased infections and disease surged among children recently. Thus, there is an urgent need for COVID-19 vaccines for children of all ages. However, whether young children will respond appropriately to mRNA vaccines remains unclear. Here, we deeply profiled the vaccine-induced humoral immune response in 7-11 year old children receiving the mRNA-1273 vaccine. Vaccinated children induced significantly higher antibody titers and functions compared to naturally infected children. Moreover, we observed comparable SARS-CoV-2 titers and neutralizing activity across variants of concern and superior Fcγ-receptor binding and phagocytic antibodies in children compared to vaccinated adults. Our data indicate that mRNA vaccination elicits robust antibody responses and drives superior antibody functionality in children.

The variables used in this work are C1 which refers to self-perception of happiness, F11 which refers to marital status and C11 referring to self-religious. Hypotheses refer to a greater perception of happiness if entrepreneurs are married, and also if they are religious. The data analysis was based on the information provided by the European Social Survey (ESS). This is a representative sample of the population over 15 years of age in approximately 30 European countries. It is collected biannually and in Spain, this action is taken by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS). Since the sample has N= 185 members, and because of the Central Limit Theorem, the distributions can be considered to be behaving as usual, so the ANOVA test is also used. The main findings indicate that married people have a higher perception of happiness than widowers, separated people, divorced people and single. On the other hand, those who declare themselves religious feel happier than those who are not.

Design: Bland Altman analysis of the HAT chart, compared to the last measured visual acuity on a standard clinical test. Setting: Routine outpatient ophthalmology telemedicine clinics in a tertiary centre. Participants: 50 control subjects with no eye disease and 100 consecutive adult ophthalmology outpatients from strabismus and low vision telemedicine clinics. Participants were excluded if they reported subjective changes in their vision. Main outcome measures: For control participants, test/retest variability of the HAT and agreement with standard logMAR visual acuity measurement. For ophthalmology outpatients, agreement with the last recorded clinic visual acuity and with ICD11 visual impairment category. Results: For control participants, HAT test/retest variability was -0.012 logMAR (95% CI: -0.25 to 0.11 logMAR). Agreement with standard vision charts was -0.14 logMAR, with a 95% confidence interval of -0.39 to +0.12 logMAR (figure 3). For ophthalmology outpatients, agreement in visual acuity was -0.10 logMAR (one line on a conventional logMAR sight chart), with the HAT indicating poorer vision than the previous clinic test. The 95% confidence interval for difference was -0.44 to +0.24 logMAR. Agreement in visual impairment category was good for patients (Cohen's K test, K = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.81), and control participants (Cohen's K test, K = 0.88 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.88). Conclusions The HAT can be used to measure vision by telephone for a wide range of ophthalmology outpatients with diverse conditions, including those who are severely visually impaired. Test/retest variability is low and agreement in visual impairment category is good.","Crossland, M. D.; Dekker, T. M.; Hancox, J.; Lisi, M.; Wemyss, T. A.; Thomas, P.

These events are stressful, even for experienced physicians. The present paper reviews what is known about the incidence and types of in-flight emergencies that are likely to be encountered, the international regulations governing medical kits and drugs, and the liability, fitness and indemnity issues facing 'Good Samaritan' medical volunteers. The medical and aviation literature was searched, and information was collated from airlines and other sources regarding medical equipment available on board commercial aircraft. Figures for the incidence of significant in-flight emergencies are approximately 1 per 10-40 000 passengers, with one death occurring per 3-5 million passengers. Medically related diversion of an aircraft following an in-flight emergency may occur in up to 7-13% of cases, but passenger prescreening, online medical advice and on-board medical assistance from volunteers reduce this rate. Medical volunteers may find assisting with an in-flight emergency stressful, but should acknowledge that they play a vital role in successful outcomes. The medico-legal liability risk is extremely small, and various laws and industry indemnity practices offer additional protection to the volunteer. In addition, cabin crew receive training in a number of emergency skills, including automated defibrillation, and are one of several sources of help available to the medical volunteer, who is not expected to work alone.","Cocks, Robert; Liew, Michele",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17305654/,203

Eighty-three infected patients deteriorated and were admitted to intensive care units. Our study focused on 24 of these patients. Positivity for influenza A(H1N1)2009 was monitored by realtime PCR and duration of viral shedding was determined. The first available sample of each patient was analysed for bacterial, fungal and viral co-infection. We observed six bacterial (or bacterial/fungal) co-infections and one viral co-infection with respiratory syncytial virus. The samples were analysed for the presence of the neuraminidase H275Y (N1 numbering) mutation, which confers resistance to oseltamivir, by realtime PCR of the neuraminidase gene. No H275Y mutation was observed in any of the viral strains screened in this study. In parallel, a fragment of the haemagglutinin gene encoding amino acid residues 173 to 362 was sequenced to detect mutations that had been reported to increase the severity of the disease. Two patients were infected by strains bearing the D222G (H3 numbering) mutation. The viral shedding of A(H1N1)2009 in this study ranged from four to 28 days with a median of 11 days.","Malato, L; Llavador, V; Marmier, E; Youssef, J; Balick Weber, C; Rozé, H; Bessede, E; Fleury, H J",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21284922/,203

193144,Complications after transcatheter arterial embolization for pelvic trauma: relationship to level and laterality of embolization.,2016,"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) replicates primarily and most likely solely in a subpopulation of macrophages in extraneuronal tissues. Infection of mice, regardless of age, with LDV leads to the rapid cytocidal replication of the virus in these cells, resulting in the release of large amounts of LDV into the circulation. The infection then progresses into life-long, asymptomatic, low-level viremic persistence, which is maintained by LDV replication in newly generated LDV-permissive cells which escapes all antiviral immune responses. In situ hybridization studies of tissue sections of adult FVB mice revealed that by 1 day postinfection (p.i.), LDV-infected cells were present in practically all tissues but were present in the highest numbers in the lymph nodes, spleen, and skin. In the central nervous system, LDV-infected cells were restricted to the leptomeninges. Most of the infected cells had disappeared at 3 days p.i., consistent with the cytocidal nature of the LDV infection, except for small numbers in lymph node, spleen, liver, and testis tissues. These tissues harbored infected cells until at least 90 days p.i. The results suggest that the generation of LDV-permissive cells during the persistent phase is restricted to these tissues. The continued presence of LDV-infected cells in testis tissue suggests the possibility of LDV release in semen and sexual transmission. Most striking was the accumulation of large amounts of LDV RNA in newly generated germinal centers of lymph nodes and the spleen. The LDV RNA was not associated with infected cells but was probably associated with virions or debris of infected, lysed cells. The appearance of LDV RNA in germinal centers in these mice coincided in time with the polyclonal activation of B cells, which leads to the accumulation of polyclonal immunoglobulin G2a and low-molecular-weight immune complexes in the circulation.","Anderson, G W; Rowland, R R; Palmer, G A; Even, C; Plagemann, P G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609091/,203

In this paper, we introduce federated f-differential privacy, a new notion specifically tailored to the federated setting, based on the framework of Gaussian differential privacy. Federated f-differential privacy operates on record level: it provides the privacy guarantee on each individual record of one client's data against adversaries. We then propose a generic private federated learning framework PriFedSync that accommodates a large family of state-of-the-art FL algorithms, which provably achieves federated f-differential privacy. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the trade-off between privacy guarantee and prediction performance for models trained by PriFedSync in computer vision tasks.","Zheng, Qinqing; Chen, Shuxiao; Long, Qi; Su, Weijie J",Proceedings of machine learning research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350418/,203
195411,[Management of androgenic diseases during the epidemic of COVID-19 pneumonia].,2020-03-01,"Poliovirus (PV) is the causal agent of paralytic poliomyelitis, a disease that involves the destruction of motor neurons associated with PV replication. In PV-infected mice, motor neurons die through an apoptotic process. However, mechanisms by which PV induces cell death in neuronal cells remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PV infection of neuronal IMR5 cells induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, both of which are evidence of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. PV infection also activates Bax, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family; this activation involves its conformational change and its redistribution from the cytosol to mitochondria. Neutralization of Bax by vMIA protein expression prevents cytochrome c release, consistent with a contribution of PV-induced Bax activation to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. Interestingly, we also found that c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated soon after PV infection and that the PV-cell receptor interaction alone is sufficient to induce JNK activation. Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of JNK by SP600125 inhibits Bax activation and cytochrome c release. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of JNK-mediated Bax-dependent apoptosis in PV-infected cells. Our findings contribute to our understanding of poliomyelitis pathogenesis at the cellular level.","Autret, Arnaud; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Mousson, Laurence; Wirotius, Aurélie; Petit, Frédéric; Arnoult, Damien; Colbère-Garapin, Florence; Estaquier, Jérôme; Blondel, Bruno",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17494073/,203

However, the epidemiology, management, and associated outcomes have varied greatly between studies. The pathophysiology remains unclear. Summary: The etiology of AKI in the setting of COVID-19 appears multifactorial. Systemic effects of sepsis, inflammation, and vascular injury likely play some role. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, highly expressed in the kidney, providing a route for direct infection. Older age, baseline comorbidities, and respiratory failure are strong risk factors for the development of AKI. Regardless of etiology, AKI carries a significantly increased risk for in-hospital mortality, especially in those with critical illness. Currently, management of AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains supportive. Key Messages: AKI is common in patients with COVID-19. Future studies are needed to examine the response to anti-viral treatment as well as long-term renal outcomes in patients with AKI.","Lynch, Matthew R; Tang, Jie",Rhode Island medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900008/,203

A prediction rule, which demarcates low from high risk patients for SARS in an outbreak situation was developed. A total of 295 patients with unexplained respiratory illnesses, admitted to Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China, in March to July 2003, were evaluated for clinical, radiological, haematological and alanine transaminase (ALT) data daily for 3 days after hospitalisation. In total, 44 cases were subsequently confirmed to have SARS by RT-PCR (68.2%) and serology (100%). The scoring system of attributing 11, 10, 3, 3 and 3 points to the presence of independent risk factors, namely: epidemiological link, radiographical deterioration, myalgia, lymphopenia and elevated ALT respectively, generated high and low-risk (total score 11-30 and 0-10, respectively) groups for SARS. The sensitivity and specificity of this prediction rule in positively identifying a SARS patient were 97.7 and 81.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 47.8 and 99.5%, respectively. The prediction rule appears to be helpful in assessing suspected patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome at the bedside, and should be further validated in other severe acute respiratory syndrome cohorts.","Ho, P L; Chau, P H; Yip, P S F; Ooi, G C; Khong, P L; Ho, J C; Wong, P C; Ko, C; Yan, C; Tsang, K W",The European respiratory journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16135731/,203

199473,Anticoagulant treatment of COVID-19 as early as possible - Sulodexide and perspectives,2021,"In 2008 we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, research on this topic has continued to accelerate, and many new scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Accordingly, it is important to update these guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Various reviews have described the range of assays that have been used for this purpose. Nevertheless, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to measure autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. A key point that needs to be emphasized is that there is a difference between measurements that monitor the numbers or volume of autophagic elements (e.g., autophagosomes or autolysosomes) at any stage of the autophagic process vs. those that measure flux through the autophagy pathway (i.e., the complete process); thus, a block in macroautophagy that results in autophagosome accumulation needs to be differentiated from stimuli that result in increased autophagic activity, defined as increased autophagy induction coupled with increased delivery to, and degradation within, lysosomes (in most higher eukaryotes and some protists such as Dictyostelium) or the vacuole (in plants and fungi). In other words, it is especially important that investigators new to the field understand that the appearance of more autophagosomes does not necessarily equate with more autophagy. In fact, in many cases, autophagosomes accumulate because of a block in trafficking to lysosomes without a concomitant change in autophagosome biogenesis, whereas an increase in autolysosomes may reflect a reduction in degradative activity. Here, we present a set of guidelines for the selection and interpretation of methods for use by investigators who aim to examine macroautophagy and related processes, as well as for reviewers who need to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of papers that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a formulaic set of rules, because the appropriate assays depend in part on the question being asked and the system being used. In addition, we emphasize that no individual assay is guaranteed to be the most appropriate one in every situation, and we strongly recommend the use of multiple assays to monitor autophagy. In these guidelines, we consider these various methods of assessing autophagy and what information can, or cannot, be obtained from them. Finally, by discussing the merits and limits of particular autophagy assays, we hope to encourage technical innovation in the field.","Klionsky, Daniel J; Abdalla, Fabio C; Abeliovich, Hagai; Abraham, Robert T;

199567,Tinnitus following COVID-19 vaccination: report of three cases,2021,"UNLABELLED The solitary fibrous tumour of the visceral pleura is a rare neoplasm that derives from mesenchymal cells adjacent to the mesothelial tissue of pleura. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice in benign lesions and healing resulting in half of malignant. Local recurrence can occur in malignant cases, but it is very rare in solitary benign tumors. It may be a result of an incomplete or conservative surgery, lack of identification of a tumor during the operation or a growth of a synchronous neoplasm independent from that removed. Surgical resection is also burdened with some difficulty as the size of the tumor, the relationship with the adjacent structures and identification of the vascular peduncle. We report a case of 72 years-old male with a sessile left solitary fibrous tumour of the visceral pleura. The mass of 10 x 7 x 5 cm was attached, thanks to large planting base, to lateral basal segment of left lower lobe. The patient was treated by single port video assisted approach with a 4 cm skin incision. This case, in our knowledge, represents the first resection by single port VATS of a sessile SFTP with a large plating base and, more generally, the third SFTP resection treated by single portal access.

199985,Diagnosis of COVID-19 and the bariatric surgery population: a single center experience,2021,"BACKGROUND Restrictions on the nonurgent use of hospital services were imposed in March 2003 to control an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto, Ont. We describe the impact of these restrictions on health care utilization and suggest lessons for future epidemics. METHODS We performed a retrospective population-based study of the Greater Toronto Area (hereafter referred to as Toronto) and unaffected comparison regions (Ottawa and London, Ont.) before, during and after the SARS outbreak (April 2001-March 2004). We determined the adjusted rates of hospital admissions, emergency department and outpatient visits, diagnostic testing and drug prescribing. RESULTS During the early and late SARS restriction periods, the rate of overall and medical admissions decreased by 10%-12% in Toronto; there was no change in the comparison regions. The rate of elective surgery in Toronto fell by 22% and 15% during the early and late restriction periods respectively and by 8% in the comparison regions. The admission rates for urgent surgery remained unchanged in all regions; those for some acute serious medical conditions decreased by 15%-21%. The rates of elective cardiac procedures declined by up to 66% in Toronto and by 71% in the comparison regions; the rates of urgent and semi-urgent procedures declined little or increased. High-acuity visits to emergency departments fell by 37% in Toronto, and inter-hospital patient transfers fell by 44% in the circum-Toronto area. Drug prescribing and primary care visits were unchanged in all regions. INTERPRETATION The restrictions achieved modest reductions in overall hospital admissions and substantial reductions in the use of elective services. Brief reductions occurred in admissions for some acute serious conditions, high-acuity visits to emergency departments and inter-hospital patient transfers suggesting that access to care for some potentially seriously ill patients was affected.","Schull, Michael J; Stukel, Thérèse A; Vermeulen, Marian J; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Alter, David A; Manuel, Douglas G; Guttmann, Astrid; Laupacis, Andreas; Schwartz, Brian",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17576979/,203

A series of ecological surveys of Iriomote cats were performed between November 2003 and September 2010. During this period, 31 Iriomote cats were captured or found, and 39 blood samples were collected. Polymerase chain reaction screening for hemoplasmas and BLAST searches revealed that 4 of the 31 cats were positive for hemoplasma infection (n=3, Mycoplasma haemofelis [Mhf]; n=1, 'Candidatus M. turicensis' [CMt]). The 4 infected cats were captured or found in the northern area of the island of Iriomote. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close relationships between Mhf and CMt isolated from Iriomote cats compared with those from domestic cats and other wild felids. In our study, we identified two species of hemoplasma in Iriomote cats. The number and location of the hemoplasma-positive cats appeared to be limited; however, continuous surveillance of hemoplasma infection in Iriomote cats is necessary.","Hirata, Momoko; Tateno, Morihiro; Sakuma, Masato; Nakanishi, Nozomi; Izawa, Masako; Asari, Yumiko; Okamura, Maki; Shimokawa Miyama, Takako; Setoguchi, Asuka; Endo, Yasuyuki",The Journal of veterinary medical science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22785566/,203
200490,RE: Immediate Shockwave Lithotripsy vs Delayed Shockwave Lithotripsy After Urgent Ureteral Stenting in Patients with Ureteral or Pyeloureteral Urolithiasis: A Matched-Pair Analysis,2021,"One of the most serious complications of acute infection is venous thromboembolism (VTE). The mechanism of host procoagulant responses in bacterial and viral infections is complex, and various factors are known to trigger the proinflammatory responses and activate systemic coagulation. Host defense mechanisms include proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-α, and complement system proteins, all of which can induce coagulopathy. Tissue factor (TF) expression on monocytes/macrophages, neutrophil and platelet activation, produce activation of thrombosis. This thromboinflammatory response, together with extracellular vesicles, causes endothelial damage that further increase thrombin generation. A key role in the development of thrombosis has TF. Penetration of the infection into the body leads to the formation of the TF-f.VIIa complex on cell surfaces and in the bloodstream, which launches the initial phase of coagulation by activating factors IX and X. Bacterial lipopolysaccharides stimulate the synthesis and expression of TF on endothelial cells and monocytes. Acute infections diagnosed in hospital or treated in the community were associated with a markedly increased risk of VTE. The association was strongest within the first 2-4 weeks (sometimes up to 12 weeks) after infection onset and gradually declined thereafter. but remained approximately twofold higher for almost all types of infection for up to 1 year of followup. The highest risk increases associated with respiratory tract infections. According to 9th ACCP Guidelines 2012 updated by CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report 2020 for hospitalized patients with acute infection and acutely ill hospitalized medical patients with hospital-diagnosed infection, who are at increased risk of thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis with LMWH, low-dose unfractioned heparin (bid or tid), or fondaparinux is recommended. The panel cautions against the use of DOAC and antiplatelet agents.","Musil, Dalibor",Vnitrni lekarstvi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740855/,203
200573,Prognostic indicators for COVID-19 related deaths in patients with cancer,2020,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs.","Olive, Marie-Marie; Goodman, Steven M; Reynes, Jean-Marc",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493102/,203
200620,Biomarkers for severe COVID-19,2021,"Gene 3 of infectious bronchitis virus is tricistronic; open reading frames (ORFs) 3a and 3b encode two small nonstructural (ns) proteins, 3a and 3b, of unknown function, and a third, structural protein E, is encoded by ORF 3c. To determine if either the 3a or the 3b protein is required for replication, we first modified their translation initiation codons to prevent translation of the 3a and 3b proteins from recombinant infectious bronchitis viruses (rIBVs). Replication in primary chick kidney (CK) cells and in chicken embryos was not affected. In chicken tracheal organ cultures (TOCs), the recombinant rIBVs reached titers similar to those of the wild-type virus, but in the case of viruses lacking the 3a protein, the titer declined reproducibly earlier. Translation of the IBV E protein is believed to be initiated by internal entry of ribosomes at a structure formed by the sequences corresponding to ORFs 3a and 3b. To assess the necessity of this mechanism, we deleted most of the sequence representing 3a and 3b to produce a gene in which ORF 3c (E) was adjacent to the gene 3 transcription-associated sequence. Western blot analysis revealed that the recombinant IBV produced fivefold less E protein. Nevertheless, titers produced in CK cells, embryos, and TOCs were similar to those of the wild-type virus, although they declined earlier in TOCs, probably due to the absence of the 3a protein. Thus, neither the tricistronic arrangement of gene 3, the internal initiation of translation of E protein, nor the 3a and 3b proteins are essential for replication per se, suggesting that these proteins are accessory proteins that may have roles in vivo.","Hodgson, Teri; Britton, Paul; Cavanagh, Dave",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16352554/,203
201283,"T Cell Activation, Highly Armed Cytotoxic Cells and a Shift in Monocytes CD300 Receptors Expression Is Characteristic of Patients With Severe COVID-19",2021,"OBJECTIVES To summarize the clinical features of liver injury in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), providing information for further mechanism and clinical study. METHODS The clinical and some laboratory data of 154 patients suffered from SARS were collected and analyzed, who were admitted to the isolation wards of Beijing You-an Hospital from March 11 to June 3, 2003. The serum samples were taken from 46 patients to detect IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-alpha, endotoxin and hepatitis related viral inclusions. In addition, 11 patients were detected ultrasonically, and 3 patients were described pathological features. Other two groups including 15 healthy care workers and 22 patients with chronic hepatitis in the same period were selected and analyzed as controls. RESULTS When being admitted to hospital, serum ALT and (or) AST levels were elevated in 37.7% SARS patients. Some of them (43.1%) were mild, and most of them (56.9%) were moderate. Abnormal liver function mainly resulted from ALT elevation (70.7%), then both ALT and AST elevation (22.4%). The aminotransferases in 75.9% SARS patients normalized within two weeks, while they elevated in four patients during the hospitalization. There was a significant difference in ALT/AST elevation rates between severe and mild clinical type (chi2=19.28, P<0.05). Serum total bilirubin values elevated in 8.4% patients. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels decreased in 24.0% and 28.6% patients, respectively. Creatine kinase (CK) and (or) creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) levels elevated in 72.7% patients when they hospitalized. The six kinds of interleukins and TNF-alpha levels during the first week of hospitalization were higher than those in the fourth week and in control groups (t>or=1.67, P<0.05). The levels of some factors, such as IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 in patients with elevated ALT, were higher than those in ALT normal patients (t>or=2.36, P<0.05). In the first week, only 15.2% patients had elevated serum endotoxin level. Ultrasonic examination and pathological observation showed no special features, compared with those in common acute hepatitis patients. CONCLUSIONS All the results suggest strongly that there may be a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in most SARS patients in early stage, and the liver damage is only its partial signs. It may be beneficial to suppress cytokines storm in SARS patients in early stage, which will stop the progression of SIRS and release hepatic damage and improve the prognosis of SARS patients.","Duan, Zhong-ping; Chen, Yu; Zhang, Jing; Zhao, Jun; Lang, Zhen-wei; Meng, Fan-kun; Bao, Xu-li",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12939186/,203

202082,Effect of COVID-19 on viral hepatitis services in Pakistan,2021,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins E1 and E2, when expressed in eukaryotic cells, are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). C-terminal truncation of E2 at residue 661 or 715 (position on the polyprotein) leads to secretion, consistent with deletion of a proposed hydrophobic transmembrane anchor sequence. We demonstrate cell surface expression of a chimeric glycoprotein consisting of E2 residues 384 to 661 fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA), termed E2661-HATMCT. The E2661-HATMCT chimeric glycoprotein was able to bind a number of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies and a recombinant soluble form of CD81, suggesting that it was folded in a manner comparable to ""native"" E2. Furthermore, cell surface-expressed E2661-HATMCT demonstrated pH-dependent changes in antigen conformation, consistent with an acid-mediated fusion mechanism. However, E2661-HATMCT was unable to induce cell fusion of CD81-positive HEK cells after neutral- or low-pH treatment. We propose that a stretch of conserved, hydrophobic amino acids within the E1 glycoprotein, displaying similarities to flavivirus and paramyxovirus fusion peptides, may constitute the HCV fusion peptide. We demonstrate that influenza virus can incorporate E2661-HATMCT into particles and discuss experiments to address the relevance of the E2-CD81 interaction for HCV attachment and entry.","Flint, M; Thomas, J M; Maidens, C M; Shotton, C; Levy, S; Barclay, W S; McKeating, J A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10400776/,203

202616,Hyperpyrexia and metabolic alkalosis in a COVID-19 patient,2020,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has had devastating effects on global health and worldwide economy. Despite an initial reluctance to perform autopsies due to concerns for aerosolization of viral particles, a large number of autopsy studies published since May 2020 have shed light on the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review summarizes the histopathologic findings and clinicopathologic correlations from autopsies and biopsies performed in patients with COVID-19. PubMed and Medline (EBSCO and Ovid) were queried from June 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and histopathologic data from autopsy and biopsy studies were collected based on 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 58 studies reporting 662 patients were included. Demographic data, comorbidities at presentation, histopathologic findings, and virus detection strategies by organ system were collected. Diffuse alveolar damage, thromboembolism, and nonspecific shock injury in multiple organs were the main findings in this review. The pathologic findings emerging from autopsy and biopsy studies reviewed herein suggest that in addition to a direct viral effect in some organs, a unifying pathogenic mechanism for COVID-19 is ARDS with its known and characteristic inflammatory response, cytokine release, fever, inflammation, and generalized endothelial disturbance. This study supports the notion that autopsy studies are of utmost importance to our understanding of disease features and treatment effect to increase our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and contribute to more effective treatment strategies.","Caramaschi, Stefania; Kapp, Meghan E; Miller, Sara E; Eisenberg, Rosana; Johnson, Joyce; Epperly, Garretson; Maiorana, Antonino; Silvestri, Guido; Giannico, Giovanna A",Mod. pathol,,203

DESIGN: Case series study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Sequentially hospitalized adults admitted for COVID-19 at two tertiary care academic hospitals in New Orleans, LA, between 27 February and 15 July 2020. MEASURES AND OUTCOMES: Measures included demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, and laboratory results. Outcomes included intensive care unit admission (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and in-hospital death. RESULTS: We included 776 patients (median age 60.5 years; 61.4% women, 75% non-Hispanic Black). Rates of ICU, IMV, and death were similar in both sexes. In women versus men, obesity (63.8 vs 41.6%, P < 0.0001), hypertension (77.6 vs 70.1%, P = 0.02), diabetes (38.2 vs 31.8%, P = 0.06), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 22.1 vs 15.1%, P = 0.015), and asthma (14.3 vs 6.9%, P = 0.001) were more prevalent. More women exhibited dyspnea (61.2 vs 53.7%, P = 0.04), fatigue (35.7 vs 28.5%, P = 0.03), and digestive symptoms (39.3 vs 32.8%, P = 0.06) than men. Obesity was associated with IMV at a lower BMI (> 35) in women, but the magnitude of the effect of morbid obesity (BMI &#8805; 40) was similar in both sexes. COPD was associated with ICU (adjusted OR (aOR), 2.6; 95%CI, 1.5-4.3) and IMV (aOR, 1.8; 95%CI, 1.2-3.1) in women only. Diabetes (aOR, 2.6; 95%CI, 1.2-2.9), chronic kidney disease (aOR, 2.2; 95%CI, 1.3-5.2), elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (aOR, 2.5; 95%CI, 1.4-4.3), and elevated ferritin (aOR, 3.6; 95%CI, 1.7-7.3) were independent predictors of death in women only. In contrast, elevated D-dimer was an independent predictor of ICU (aOR, 7.3; 95%CI, 2.7-19.5), IMV (aOR, 6.5; 95%CI, 2.1-20.4), and death (aOR, 4.5; 95%CI, 1.2-16.4) in men only.

203174,COVID-19 mortality needs age adjusting for international comparisons,2021,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we conduct daily life, as well as sports training and sports competitions. Given the stress produced by COVID-19, and the ""bubble"" safety measures for the World Sambo Championship, held in Novi Sad, from the 6th to the 8th of November, 2020, athletes might have experienced more stress than athletes normally would in non-pandemic conditions. Therefore, the current study aimed to create a psychological profile of sambo athletes participating in the Sambo World Championship and living in this condition. Methods: One-hundred-fifteen participants took part in the study, completing the Profile of Mood Scale (POMS), the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. A mediation model with Fear of COVID-19 predicting both stress level directly and stress level through mood disturbance was hypothesized. Gender differences were evaluated through t-test. Results: The results showed that the sample presented higher levels of stress but no problems in sleeping. In particular, data analysis confirmed an indirect effect of Fear of COVID on Perceived stress through mood disturbance (beta = 0.14, Z = 2.80, and p = 0.005), but did not have a significant impact on the direct effect (beta = -0.04, Z = -0.48, and p = 0.63). Gender differences emerged in the perceived stress level (t = -2.86, df = 114, and p = 0.005) and daytime dysfunction (t = -2.52, df = 114, and p = 0.01) where females scored higher than males for both aspects. Conclusion: The athletes participating to the World Sambo Championship experienced stress levels determined by the mood disturbance produced by the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic. Female athletes were more stressed and showed higher daytime dysfunction. The findings of the current study are useful to understand the psychological profile of the athletes competing in the ""bubble"" conditions during COVID-19 pandemic.","Gentile, A.; Trivic, T.; Bianco, A.; Lakicevic, N.; Figlioli, F.; Roklicer, R.; Eliseev, S.; Tabakov, S.; Maksimovic, N.; Drid, P.",Frontiers in Psychology,,203

A single case study of City University of Science and Information Technology (CUSIT), Pakistan was selected as a unit of analysis. Mix methodology was used in this research. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted from the top management as a primary source while secondary data regarding usage and functions of LMS was collected for the period of 2 years (four semesters Fall-2017-Spring 2019). Data from both sources was utilized, and triangulated for case building and analysis. It was found that CUSIT has a state-of-the-art automated infrastructure, management information system (MIS) and learning management system (LMS) which facilitates faculty, staff and administration. LMS provides an integrated and digital platform to key stakeholders particularly to the teachers for sharing course outlines, lesson plan, assignment generation and submission, announcements and generating assessment reports. Similarly, the student gets access to all course material, assignments, assessment report, notices, and other relevant information at any point of time. However, the system lacks some of the major E-learning features with limited support to the large file size, real time learning, online classes, real time feedback and query system etc. Furthermore, this study identified few seldomly used functions of automated system as well as few duplications and operational activities which requires consideration by the management. The case of CUSIT proves to be a practical case for all those universities who are facing challenges due to corona virus pandemic and are looking for a solution to continue education through distance learning and e-learning platforms. This study supports the automation of HEIs and provides lesson learned for the academia and management of HEIs by identification of success features as well as limitations of the system.","Habib, Muhammad Nauman; Jamal, Waseef; Khalil, Uzma; Khan, Zunnoorain",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,203

204397,Secukinumab in severe COVID-19 pneumonia: does it have a clinical impact?: Secukinumab in severe COVID-19,2021,"Purpose of Review: Kumbh Mela, a religious gathering of Hindus held in India, is the largest massive gathering event in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented healthcare crisis in recent times with effects reverberating in all spheres of human lives. India has registered the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. This paper aims to dwell in the religious and social background of Kumbh Mela massive gathering, as well as the ritualistic practices that could potentially entail public health risks in the current situation. It also aims to identify possible preparatory and interventional measures to evade such risks. Recent Findings: In recent years, the increase in the number of people attending the Kumbh Mela has been phenomenal. Congregants are put up at the holy sites for several days. The sheer number of people assembling at the religious venues poses a great challenge to manage the crowds, to cater to the requirements of basic amenities, and to meet their healthcare needs. Some of the ritualistic practices could heighten the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated over the past few months in India. The pandemic is expected to sustain its tempo in India throughout the foreseeable future. Organization of the forthcoming Kumbh Mela needs meticulous planning. Summary: Kumbh Mela is a Hindu religious gathering at the banks of India's rivers, held periodically. It witnesses assembly of huge numbers of people and has the potential to amplify the COVID-19 pandemic in India; this could overwhelm the healthcare system.","Quadri, Sayed A; Padala, Prasad R",Curr Trop Med Rep,,203

206444,A Pilot Study Examining Vitamin C Levels in Periodontal Patients,2020,"Leadership and communication capabilities of federal leaders during crises are imperative to support and guide citizens’ behaviors and emotions. We examine crisis communication delivered by the Australian Prime Minister (PM), Scott Morrison during the COVID-19 pandemic. Communication delivered over seven months starting from the first reported case of COVID-19 in Australia, was analyzed through a process of coding to identify central organizing crisis communication frames and themes and measured against eleven main themes based on principles of Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) recommended by the WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Transcripts were sourced from the PM’s official website and 91 communiques were analyzed. Key epidemiological indicators and public health measures were reviewed over timeframe to examine changes in communication over the pandemic. Findings indicated that PM Morrison included many features of CERC within his official messaging. Our analysis revealed that the original framework was limited in its scope to encompass certain messages and thus the allocation of new frames,‘public health and medical advice’ and 'assuring and commending the public and institutions', allowed for a more thorough analysis of communication during a novel global health pandemic. The temporal analysis demonstrated that the government's policy and communication temporally followed case numbers and relative threat of the virus. This study has provided an in-depth review of CERC during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. New frames and themes for the current CERC framework are suggested which can be transferable to other crises in Australia and other countries.","Bernard, Natalie Reyes Basit Abdul Sofija Ernesta Phung Hai Lee Jessica Rutherford Shannon Sebar Bernadette Harris Neil Phung Dung Wiseman Nicola",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,,203

A century apart, these two pandemics have devastated the world. The advances in health and science over the past hundred years have proved only partially effective against the current pandemic. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive and prevention is aimed at reducing transmission in the community. This outbreak is more than an intensive care phenomenon, rather it is a public health and humanitarian crisis. Western health care systems have been built around the concept of patient-centred care but a pandemic requires a change of perspective toward a concept of community-centred care. Malta has painfully learned this the hard way. This paper examines the sources of variability during both pandemics in shaping the morbidity experience of the Maltese islands which in turn allows for a better understanding of how developments of isolation, exposure, history and physical distancing could play important roles in shaping the epidemic experience.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,203

However, to date, there has been little investigation into the implications of the 'Telegram' application for online medical education and training. Aim: This study explores the potential benefits and disadvantages of integrating Telegram into undergraduate medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An exploratory study was conducted between March and May 2020, with 203 undergraduate medical students recruited through purposive sampling. Data was collected through seven open-ended questions, followed by thematic analysis using Atlas.ti. Results: Most students participating in this study reported multiple utilities of the application, including easy access to educational resources and the ability to add unlimited members, as well as files in all formats and sizes. Additionally, the application assisted students to engage with collaborative learning, maintain their wellbeing, and ensure their security. However, they also reported some drawbacks, i.e., a complex interface, information overload, and a tendency to distract them, causing time wastage. Conclusion: This study concludes that Telegram provides an effective mobile learning platform for medical students during the current crisis, in particular. Moreover, it offers considerably more functionalities and fewer potential drawbacks than alternative applications.","Iqbal, Muhammad Zafar; Alradhi, Hussain Ibrahim; Alhumaidi, AbdulSalam Abdulkarim; Alshaikh, Khalid Hussni; AlObaid, Abdulraouf Mohammed; Alhashim, Mohammed Taher; AlSheikh, Mona Hmoud",Acta Inform.

209959,Lung mechanics in type L CoVID-19 pneumonia: a pseudo-normal ARDS,2020,"Background: Telehealth has been successfully implemented for the delivery of obstetrical care. However, little is known regarding the attitudes and acceptability of patients and providers in high risk obstetrics and if implementation improves access to care in non-rural settings. Objective: The study aims to: 1) Describe patient and provider attitudes toward telehealth for delivery of high risk obstetrical care in a large health care system with both urban and suburban settings. 2) Determine if implementation of a telehealth model improves patient adherence to scheduled appointments in this patient population.Study DesignTwo self-administered surveys were designed. The first survey was sent to all high-risk obstetrical patients who received a telehealth visit between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. The second survey was designed for providers who participated in these visits. We also compared the attended, cancelled and no show visit rates before (March 1-May 30, 2019) and after (March 1-May 30, 2020) telehealth implementation, as well as telehealth versus in person visits in 2020. We reviewed scheduled high-risk prenatal care appointments, diabetes education sessions, and genetic counseling and Maternal- Fetal Medicine consultations. Results: A total of 91 patient surveys and 33 provider surveys were analyzed. Overall, 86.9% of patients were satisfied with the care they received and 78.3% would recommend telehealth visits to others. 87.8% of providers reported having a positive experience using telehealth, and 90.9% believed that telehealth improved patients' access to care. When comparing patient and provider preference regarding future obstetrical care after experiencing telehealth, 73.8% of patients desired a combination of in person and telehealth visits during their pregnancy. However, a significantly higher rate of providers preferred in-person visits (56% vs 23% respectively). When comparing visits between 2019 and 2020, there was a significantly lower rate of no-show appointments, patient-cancelled appointments, and patient same-day cancellations with the implementation of telehealth. There was also a significantly lower rate of patient-cancelled appointments, and patient same-day cancellations with those receiving telehealth visits compared to in person visits in 2020. Conclusion: Implementation of telehealth in high risk obstetrics has the potential to improve access to high risk obstetrical care, by reducing the rate of missed appointments. Both patients and providers surveyed expressed a high rate of satisfaction with telehealth visits and a desire to integrate telehealth into the traditional model of high risk obstetrical care.","Jeganathan, Sumithra; Prasannan, Lakha; Blitz, Matthew J; Vohra, Nidhi; Rochelson, Burton; Meirowitz, Natalie",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,203

Ifirst outline key domestic and international legislative provisions positioned as securing children’s and parents’ rights in this context. Prior to the pandemic, there was growing recognition of the current regime's failings regarding illegal exclusions from school, children missing from education, and the lack of inclusive education for children with special educational needs and disabilities (‘SEND’). The protection of children’s rights relied on the benevolent exercise of discretion and key decision-makers not exploiting limited oversight and scrutiny in order to meet results-driven accountability measures. Second, I critically analyse pandemic law-making and regulation, particularly in relation to the exclusion process, the legal duty to provide education in an online environment, the law on Education, Health, and Care Plans (‘EHCPs’), and the de-registration and fines for non-attendance. Third, I argue that the educational impact of the pandemic highlights the need for law reform, rather than merely revisions to statutory guidance and focus on best practice. Such reform may also trigger improvement via the ‘reflexive regulation’ of the education system.","Ferguson, L.",Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties,,203

213137,Clinical prioritisation of revision knee surgical procedures: BASK working group consensus document,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Patient-generated data (PGData) are an emergent research area and may improve HIV care. The objectives of this scoping review were to synthesise, evaluate and make recommendations based on the available literature regarding PGData use in HIV care. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO and Emcare databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies involving PGData use within HIV care for people living with HIV and/or healthcare professionals (HCPs) published before February 2021. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted using a table and the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was used to assess empirical rigour. We used thematic analysis to evaluate content. RESULTS: 11 articles met the eligibility criteria. Studies were observational, predominantly concerned hypothetical or novel digital platforms, mainly conducted in high-income settings, and had small sample sizes (range=10-160). There were multiple definitions of PGData. In the majority of studies (n=9), participants were people living with HIV, with a few studies including HCPs, informatics specialists or mixed participant groups. Participants living with HIV were aged 23-78 years, mostly men, of diverse ethnicities, and had low educational, health literacy and income levels.We identified four key themes: (1) Perceptions of PGData and associated digital platforms; (2) Opportunities; (3) Anticipated barriers and (4) Potential impact on patient-HCP relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Use of PGData within HIV care warrants further study, especially with regard to digital inequalities, data privacy and security. There is a need for longitudinal data on use within HIV in a variety of settings with a broad range of users, including impact on clinical outcomes. This will allow greater understanding of the role of PGData use in improving the health and well-being of people living with HIV, which is increasingly pertinent as digital healthcare becomes more widespread as a result of COVID-19.","Hewitt, Clara; Lloyd, Karen C; Tariq, Shema; Durrant, Abigail; Claisse, Caroline; Kasadha, Bakita; Gibbs, Jo",BMJ Open,,203
213198,"Expedited Mitra clip: Rapid evaluation, treatment, and discharge in the COVID-19 era",2020,"A primary quantity of interest in the study of infectious diseases is the average number of new infections that an infected person produces. This so-called reproduction number has significant implications for the disease progression. There has been increasing literature suggesting that superspreading, the significant variability in number of new infections caused by individuals, plays an important role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, we consider the effect that such superspreading has on the estimation of the reproduction number and subsequent estimates of future cases. Accordingly, we employ a simple extension to models currently used in the literature to estimate the reproduction number and present a case-study of the progression of COVID-19 in Austria. Our models demonstrate that the estimation uncertainty of the reproduction number increases with superspreading and that this improves the performance of prediction intervals. Of independent interest is the derivation of a transparent formula that connects the extent of superspreading to the width of credible intervals for the reproduction number. This serves as a valuable heuristic for understanding the uncertainty surrounding diseases with superspreading.","Johnson, Kory D; Beiglböck, Mathias; Eder, Manuel; Grass, Annemarie; Hermisson, Joachim; Pammer, Gudmund; Polechová, Jitka; Toneian, Daniel; Wölfl, Benjamin",,,203

We aimed to compare temporal trends in volume of acute stroke alerts, patient characteristics, telestroke care, and short-term outcomes pre- and post-SIP orders. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in 21 stroke centers of an integrated healthcare system serving 4.4+ million members across Northern California. We included adult patients who presented with suspected acute stroke and were evaluated by telestroke between January 1, 2019, and May 9, 2020. SIP orders announced the week of March 15, 2020, created pre (January 1, 2019, to March 14, 2020) and post (March 15, 2020, to May 9, 2020) cohort for comparison. Main outcomes were stroke alert volumes and inpatient mortality for stroke. RESULTS: Stroke alert weekly volume post-SIP (mean, 98 [95% CI, 92-104]) decreased significantly compared with pre-SIP (mean, 132 [95% CI, 130-136]; P<0.001). Stroke discharges also dropped, in concordance with acute stroke alerts decrease. In total, 9120 patients were included: 8337 in pre- and 783 in post-SIP cohorts. There were no differences in patient demographics. Compared with pre-SIP, post-SIP patients had higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores (P=0.003), lower comorbidity score (P<0.001), and arrived more often by ambulance (P<0.001). Post-SIP, more patients had large vessel occlusions (P=0.03), and there were fewer stroke mimics (P=0.001). Discharge outcomes were similar for post-SIP and pre-SIP cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, regional stroke alert and ischemic stroke discharge volumes decreased significantly in the early COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with pre-SIP, the post-SIP population showed no significant demographic differences but had lower comorbidity scores, more severe strokes, and more large vessel occlusions. The inpatient mortality was similar in both cohorts. Further studies are needed to understand the causes and implications of care avoidance to patients and healthcare systems.","Nguyen-Huynh, Mai N; Tang, Xian Nan; Vinson, David R; Flint, Alexander C; Alexander, Janet G; Meighan, Melissa; Burnett, Molly; Sidney, Stephen; Klingman, Jeffrey G",Stroke,,203

215612,Follow-up study of pulmonary function among COVID-19 survivors 1 year after recovery,2021,"We study the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US, since January 2020 until May 2021. Our primary goal is to understand some of the complex coupled dynamics between factors that ultimately regulate the epidemic case load. As potentially crucial factors, we focus on population mobility and vaccination patters (both related to risk of contracting the SARS-Cov2 virus). These factors may in turn depend on demographic parameters (which are unrelated to the epidemic evolution), but also on the population response to the epidemic outbreak itself. In our work, we use correlation analyses, in conjunction with open source data from US states, to investigate the type and strength (1) of the relationships between demographic measures and epidemic, mobility and vaccination timelines during our established time window; (2) of the bidirectional coupling between these timelines. We showed that the wide between-state differences in epidemic outcome correspond to between-state differences in demographic measures (such as density, income, political affiliation). As a potential underlying mechanism, we found that demographic measures are also predictive of the degree of coupling between epidemic timelines (on one hand) and vaccination and mobility timelines (on the other hand), coupling which can be broadly interpreted as the populations behavioral response to the epidemic. In support of this idea, our analysis shows this response to be tightly correlated with epidemic outcome. This suggests that a states demographic profile may be invaluable to generating predictions on the epidemic evolution in the respective state, and that this information may be used to understand the weaknesses of a state and how to compensate for them to improve epidemic outcome (e.g., via state centralized incentives, and customized mitigation strategies).","Radulescu, Anca; Alonso, Tatiana; Reid, Norman; Sanchez, Johanna",,,203

Four primary care clinics were recruited, key informant interviews with clinic providers were conducted, electronic health record (EHR) capacity to collect data related to CRC screening and follow-up was assessed, and a series of meetings were held with clinic champions to discuss implementation of strategies to impact clinic CRC screening rates. Analysis of interviews revealed multilevel barriers to CRC screening. Patient-level barriers included fatalism, competing priorities, and financial and literacy concerns. The main provider- and clinic-level barriers were provider preference for colonoscopy over stool-based testing and EHR tracking concerns. Clinics selected strategies to address barriers, but the onset of COVID-19 necessitated modifications to these strategies. Due to COVID-19, changes in clinic staffing and workflow occurred, including provider furloughs, a state-mandated pause in elective procedures, and an increase in telehealth. Clinics adapted screening strategies to match changing needs, including shifting from paper to digital educational tools and using telehealth to increase annual wellness visits for screening promotion. While significant delays persist for scheduling colonoscopies, clinics were encouraged to promote stool-based tests as a primary screening modality for average-risk patients.","Kruse-Diehr, Aaron J; Dignan, Mark; Cromo, Mark; Carman, Angela L; Rogers, Melinda; Gross, David; Russell, Sue",J. cancer educ,,203

Methodologically, the spatial distribution of those infected in the study area, the city of Málaga (Spain), is firstly analyzed from the disaggregated and anonymous address information. After defining the concept of neighborhood contagion focus and justifying its morphological parameters, a method to detect and map neighborhood contagion focus in urban settings is proposed and applied to the study case. As the main results, the existence of focuses and micro-focuses in the spatial pattern of contagion is verified. Focuses are considered as an ideal spatial analysis unit, and the advantages and potentialities of the use of mapping focus as a useful tool for health and territorial management in different phases of the epidemic are shown.","Perles, María-Jesús; Sortino, Juan F; Mérida, Matías F",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203

However, whether induction of autophagy will lead to survival or death has been the focus of many laboratories. Autophagy is a very context-dependent process, and no specific biomarker has been identified to define whether the process will lead to survival or death.

AIMS: This study sought to investigate patterns and predictors of DSM-5 PTSD in a treatment-seeking sample of African refugees. METHODS: Participants were 122 African refugees and asylum-seekers living in Italy who completed measures of trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify PTSD symptom profiles, and predictors of class membership were identified via multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among participants, 79.5% had a probable diagnosis of PTSD. Three PTSD classes were identified by LCA: Pervasive (32.0%) with high probabilities of all symptoms, high-Threat (45.9%) with higher probabilities of intrusions and avoidance symptoms, moderate-Avoidance (22.1%) with high probability of thoughts/feelings avoidance. None of the examined variables (legal status, gender, age, education, months spent in Italy, number of traumatic events, employment) significantly predicted class membership with the relevant exception of reception conditions. Specifically, living in large reception centres (over 1,000 people) significantly predicted Pervasive PTSD class membership compared to high/Threat PTSD class and to moderate/Avoidance class. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for distinct patterns of PTSD symptomatology in refugees and asylum seekers. We identified three classes which present both qualitative and quantitative differences in symptoms: Pervasive class, high-Threat class and a new moderate class, characterised by avoidance symptoms. Reception conditions contributed to the emergence of the Pervasive PTSD profile characterised by the symptoms highest severity. These findings highlight that stressors in the post-migration environment, as inadequate reception conditions in large facilities, may have detrimental effect on refugees' mental health. We emphasise the importance for host countries to implement reception models that provide effective protection and integration to this vulnerable population.","Barbieri, Alberto; Visco-Comandini, Federica; Alunni Fegatelli, Danilo; Dessì, Anna; Cannella, Giuseppe; Stellacci, Antonella; Pirchio, Sabine",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,203

In healthcare, machine learning is proven to be an efficient technology for helping to combat the COVID-19. Hospitals are now overwhelmed with the increased infections of COVID-19 cases and given patients' confidentiality and rights. It becomes hard to assemble quality medical image datasets in a timely manner. For COVID-19 diagnosis, several traditional computer-aided detection systems based on classification techniques were proposed. The bag-of-features (BoF) model has shown a promising potential in this domain. Thus, this work developed an ensemble-based BoF classification system for the COVID-19 detection. In this model, we proposed ensemble at the classification step of the BoF. The proposed system was evaluated and compared to different classification systems for different number of visual words to evaluate their effect on the classification efficiency. The results proved the superiority of the proposed ensemble-based BoF for the classification of normal and COVID19 chest X-ray (CXR) images compared to other classifiers.","Ashour, Amira S; Eissa, Merihan M; Wahba, Maram A; Elsawy, Radwa A; Elgnainy, Hamada Fathy; Tolba, Mohamed Saeed; Mohamed, Waleed S",Biomed Signal Process Control,,203

The impact may be much devastating in developing countries due to fragmented health care system. Our study aims to explore the underlying burden of depression and its related factors among health care workers in South Asian countries. Data was collected through an online survey. A total of 476 health care workers including doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff participated from Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka. A validated WHO Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) was used to screen for Depression. A 25.7% prevalence of depression was reported among health care workers. Almost 70% of them were either not satisfied or partially satisfied with the provided personal protective equipment. On multivariable analysis, females gender (aOR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.90), fear of unprotection (aOR=1.80, 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.90), confirmed COVID-19 case in workplace (aOR=1.98, 95% CI= 1.18 - 3.33) and family (aOR=2.98, 95% CI: 1.02 - 8.70) were found to be independent predictors of depression among healthcare workers. Depression among HCW in South-Asian countries is quite alarming. This may jeopardize attention to other non-COVID health problems which are still on a priority in developing countries.","Saeed, Rabeeya; Amin, Faridah; Talha, Muhammad; Randenikumara, Sankha; Shariff, Idris; Durrani, Noureen; Salman, Shaheena",Asia Pac J Public Health,,203

220341,COVID-19 and pulmonary hypertension,2020,"Immune and inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 contribute to disease severity of COVID-19. However, the utility of specific immune-based biomarkers to predict clinical outcome remains elusive. Here, we analyzed levels of 66 soluble biomarkers in 175 Italian patients with COVID-19 ranging from mild/moderate to critical severity, and assessed type-I IFN-, type-II IFN-, and NF-&#954;B-dependent whole blood transcriptional signatures. A broad inflammatory signature was observed, implicating activation of various immune and non-hematopoietic cell subsets. Discordance between IFN-&#945;2a protein and IFNA2 transcript levels in blood suggests that type-I IFNs during COVID-19 may be primarily produced by tissue-resident cells. Multivariable analysis of patients' first samples revealed 12 biomarkers (CCL2, IL-15, sST2, NGAL, sTNFRSF1A, ferritin, IL-6, S100A9, MMP-9, IL-2, sVEGFR1, IL-10) that when increased were independently associated with mortality. Multivariate analyses of longitudinal biomarker trajectories identified 8 of the aforementioned biomarkers (IL-15, IL-2, NGAL, CCL2, MMP-9, sTNFRSF1A, sST2, IL-10) and two additional biomarkers (lactoferrin, CXCL9) that were significantly associated with mortality when increased, while IL-1&#945; was associated with mortality when decreased. Among these, sST2, sTNFRSF1A, IL-10, and IL-15 were consistently higher throughout the hospitalization in patients who died versus those who recovered, suggesting that these biomarkers may provide an early warning of eventual disease outcome.","Abers, Michael S; Delmonte, Ottavia M; Ricotta, Emily E; Fintzi, Jonathan; Fink, Danielle; de Jesus, Adriana A; Zarember, Kol A; Alehashemi, Sara; Oikonomou, Vasileios; Desai, Jigar V; Canna, Scott W; Shakoory, Bita; Dobbs, Kerry; Imberti, Luisa; Sottini, Alessandra; Quiros-Roldan, Eugenia; Castelli, Francesco; Rossi, Camillo; Brugnoni, Duilio; Biondi, Andrea; Bettini, Laura R; D039,; Angio039,; Mariella,; Bonfanti, Paolo; Castagnoli, Riccardo; Montagna, Daniela; Licari, Amelia; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Gliniewicz, Emily; Shaw, Elana R; Kahle, Dana; Rastegar, Andre T; Stack, Michael A; Myint-Hpu, Katherine; Levinson, Susan L; DiNubile, Mark J; Chertow, Daniel W; Burbelo, Peter; Cohen, Jeffrey I; Calvo, Katherine R; Tsang, John S; Su, Helen C; Gallin, John I; Kuhns, Douglas B; Goldbach-Mansky, Raphaela; Lionakis, Michail S; Notarangelo, Luigi D",JCI insight,,203

Methodology: This retrospective ecological study was carried out using Brazilian municipality data obtained from the information systems of the National Public Health System. The outcomes were medical appointments, prenatal procedures and diabetes care. The exposure variable was the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the first case reported in Brazil. Multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression was used to analyze the association between the number of procedures per 10,000 inhabitants and COVID-19. Results: Data from 5,564 Brazilian municipalities were included in the present study. Regarding medical appointments, the largest reduction occasioned by the pandemic occurred in May (IRR = 0.27, 95%CI 0.24 - 0.30). Prenatal procedures were reduced by 65% (IRR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.32 - 0.38), also in May. In addition, diabetes care saw the biggest reductions in April 2020 (IRR = 0.24, 95%CI 0.11 - 0.53) and May 2020 (IRR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.09 - 0.43). From February to December 2020, the pandemic had a significant effect on the total number of procedures evaluated. Conclusion: The findings showed a reduction in prenatal procedures, diabetes and medical consultations performed in Brazil's Primary Health Care, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chisini, Luiz Alexandre; Castilhos, Eduardo Dickie de; Costa, Francine dos Santos; DAvila, Otávio Pereira",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,203

Objective: The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results: We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations. ICU patients showed a more severe inflammatory response as assessed by white blood cell count, neutrophil and platelet count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin, and albumin levels. By the end of the study period, 65 inpatients had been discharged because of improvement, 70 continued hospitalized, and five had died. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidities, either middle-age obese or elderly complaining of fever, cough, or dyspnea, were more likely to be admitted. At admission, patients with diabetes, high BMI, and clinical or laboratory findings consistent with a severe inflammatory state were more likely to require IC.","Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; Villanueva-Reza, Marco; González-Lara, María F; Tamez-Torres, Karla M; Román-Montes, Carla M; Díaz-Mejía, Bruno A; Pérez-García, Esteban; Olivas-Martínez, Antonio; Rajme-López, Sandra; Martinez-Guerra, Bernardo A; de-León-Cividanes, Nereyda A; Fernández-García, Oscar A; Guerrero-Torres, Lorena; Torres-González, Lorena; Carrera-Patiño, Fabián A; Corral-Herrera, Ever A; Hernández-Alemón, Aldo N; Tovar-Vargas, Maria de Los Á; Serrano-Pinto, Yamile G; Espejo-Ortiz, Cristian E; Morales-Ortega, María de la L; Lozano-Cruz, Óscar A; Cárdenas-Fragoso, José L; Vidal-Mayo, José de J; Hernández-Gilsoul, Thierry; Rivero-Sigarroa, Eduardo; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Cervantes-Villar, Luz E; Ramos-Cervantes, Maria Del P; Ibarra-González, Violeta; Calva-Mercado, Juan J; Sierra-Madero, Juan G; López-Íñiguez, Álvaro; Ochoa-Hein, Eric; Crabtree-Ramírez, Brenda E; Galindo-Fraga, Arturo; Guerrero-Almeida, María de L; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo M; Gulías-Herrero, Alfonso; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Kershenobich-Stalnikowitz, David; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo",Rev Invest Clin,,203

On the basis of clinical practice and in-vitro studies, we postulated that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) using Arbidol is associated with decreased infection among individuals exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on family members and health care workers who were exposed to patients confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time RT-PCR and chest computed tomography (CT) from January 1 to January 16, 2020. The last follow-up date was Feb. 26, 2020. The emergence of fever and/or respiratory symptoms after exposure to the primary case was collected. The correlations between post-exposure prophylaxis and infection in household contacts and health care workers were respectively analyzed. A total of 66 members in 27 families and 124 health care workers had evidence of close exposure to patients with confirmed COVID-19. The Cox regression based on the data of the family members and health care workers with Arbidol or not showed that Arbidol PEP was a protective factor against the development of COVID-19 (HR 0.025, 95% CI 0.003-0.209, P=0.0006 for family members and HR 0.056, 95% CI 0.005-0.662, P=0.0221 for health care workers). Our findings suggest Arbidol could reduce the infection risk of the novel coronavirus in hospital and family settings.

METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and chest CT features of 20 pediatric inpatients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by pharyngeal swab COVID-19 nucleic acid test were retrospectively analyzed during 23 January and 8 February 2020. The clinical and laboratory information was obtained from inpatient records. All the patients were undergone chest CT in our hospital. RESULTS: Thirteen pediatric patients (13/20, 65%) had an identified history of close contact with COVID-19 diagnosed family members. Fever (12/20, 60%) and cough (13/20, 65%) were the most common symptoms. For laboratory findings, procalcitonin elevation (16/20, 80%) should be pay attention to, which is not common in adults. Coinfection (8/20, 40%) is common in pediatric patients. A total of 6 patients presented with unilateral pulmonary lesions (6/20, 30%), 10 with bilateral pulmonary lesions (10/20, 50%), and 4 cases showed no abnormality on chest CT (4/20, 20%). Consolidation with surrounding halo sign was observed in 10 patients (10/20, 50%), ground-glass opacities were observed in 12 patients (12/20, 60%), fine mesh shadow was observed in 4 patients (4/20, 20%), and tiny nodules were observed in 3 patients (3/20, 15%). CONCLUSION: Procalcitonin elevation and consolidation with surrounding halo signs were common in pediatric patients which were different from adults. It is suggested that underlying coinfection may be more common in pediatrics, and the consolidation with surrounding halo sign which is considered as a typical sign in pediatric patients.","Xia, Wei; Shao, Jianbo; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xuehua; Li, Zhen; Hu, Daoyu",Pediatr Pulmonol,,203

The clinical course of the disease in children and infants is milder than in adults. It should be noted that, although typical symptoms may be present in children, non-specific symptoms could be noted in the neonate. The disease is rare in the neonate, so, its suspicion in this group can help to make a quick diagnose.Case report: A 15-day-old neonate was admitted with fever, lethargy, cutaneous mottling, and respiratory distress without cough. His mother had symptoms of Novel coronavirus. So Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done for the neonate and showed to be positive. The newborn was isolated and subjected to supportive care. Antibiotic and antiviral treatment was initiated. Eventually, the baby was discharged in good general condition.Conclusion: When a newborn presents with non-specific symptoms of infection with an added history of COVID-19 in his/her parents, it indicates the need for PCR testing for Novel coronavirus.","Kamali Aghdam, Mojtaba; Jafari, Nahid; Eftekhari, Kambiz",Infect Dis (Lond),,203

This study applies molecular docking techniques to assess inhibitory effects of some bioactive compounds from the plants mentioned above against the main protease (Mpro), a key protein involved in SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiles for screened compounds were predicted in silico. Methods: The crystal structure of Mpro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank, while the plant bioactive compounds were retrieved from Pubchem. Drug-likeness of the selected compounds and a control drug (hydroxychloroquine) were assessed, and the compounds that satisfied the drug-likeness rule were docked against Mpro. The docked complexes were analyzed using LigPlot and the protein-ligand profiler server. The top five compound hits were subjected to ADMET screening using the ADMETSar server. Results: A total of 17 out of 22 screened compounds passed Lipinski's assessment. Additionally, the most active compounds from the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro compared with hydroxychloroquine, which alludes to their possible involvement in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease replication process. Conclusions: In our study, most of the active phytocomponents of the investigated plants exhibited relative inhibitory potentials against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 and preferred pharmacological features when compared with hydroxychloroquine. These findings indicate these compounds are potentially antiviral candidates against SARS-CoV-2.","Umar, Haruna I; Josiah, Sunday S; Saliu, Tolulope P; Jimoh, Tajudeen O; Ajayi, Adeola; Danjuma, Jamilu B",,,203

Few are testing or quarantining all inmates, and there are more proactive responses devoted to staff than inmates in their facilities. Findings demonstrate that prison systems? policies regarding COVID-19 testing, quarantining, and provision of personal protective equipment for inmates do not fully align with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations.

At the time of survey, fewer than 150 children in Australia and New Zealand had documented infection. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes, readiness and confidence in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic through an online survey of paediatric physicians and sub-specialists across Australia and New Zealand. METHODS: Multiple email list groups were used to contact paediatric physicians to undertake an online Likert scale survey between 17 and 24 March. Respondents' specialty, experience and work setting were recorded. Ordinal logistic regression was used to determine respondent factors. RESULTS: There were 542 respondents from across Australia and New Zealand: an estimated 11% of the paediatric physician workforce. A minority (36.6%) agreed that their national response had been well coordinated; the majority (92.7%) agreed that senior-level hospital administrators were taking the situation seriously. Most reported a good understanding of the natural history of COVID-19 in children, and knowledge of where to find local information. A large proportion of physicians (86.1%) were worried about becoming infected through their work; few (5.8%) reported that they would not come to work to avoid infection. Closure of school and childcares would reduce the ability to continue work at current capacity for 23.6% of respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite limited experience in pandemics, most paediatric physicians felt informed. Concern about exposure at work is common; most were willing to work regardless. The closure of schools and daycares may have an impact on staffing. Coordination and leadership will be critical.","Foley, David A; Kirk, Michael; Jepp, Catherine; Brophy-Williams, Sam; Tong, Steven Y C; Davis, Joshua S; Blyth, Christopher C; O039,; Brien, Matthew P; Bowen, Asha C; Yeoh, Daniel K",J Paediatr Child Health,,203
224280,An Impetus for Change: How COVID-19 Will Transform the Delivery of GI Health Care,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to forecast the number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the state of Maryland, United States, using transfer function time series (TS) models based on a Social Distancing Index (SDI) and determine how their parameters relate to the pandemic mechanics. METHODS: A moving window of 2 mo was used to train the transfer function TS model that was then tested on the next week data. After accounting for a secular trend and weekly cycle of the SDI, a high correlation was documented between it and the daily caseload 9 days later. Similar patterns were also observed on the daily COVID-19 cases and incorporated in our models. RESULTS: In most cases, the proposed models provide a reasonable performance that was, on average, moderately better than that delivered by TS models based only on previous observations. The model coefficients associated with the SDI were statistically significant for most of the training/test sets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed models that incorporate SDI can forecast the number of COVID-19 cases in a region. Their parameters have real-life interpretations and, hence, can help understand the inner workings of the epidemic. The methods detailed here can help local health governments and other agencies adjust their response to the epidemic.","Cruz-Cano, Raul; Ma, Tianzhou; Yu, Yifan; Lee, Minha; Liu, Hongjie",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,203
224284,Risk of COVID-19 for patients with cancer,2020,"Biological systems have a remarkable capability of synthesizing multifunctional materials that are adapted for specific physiological and ecological needs. When exploring structure-function relationships related to multifunctionality in nature, it can be a challenging task to address performance synergies, trade-offs, and the relative importance of different functions in biological materials, which, in turn, can hinder our ability to successfully develop their synthetic bioinspired counterparts. Here, we investigate such relationships between the mechanical and optical properties in a multifunctional biological material found in the highly protective yet conspicuously colored exoskeleton of the flower beetle, Torynorrhina flammea Combining experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that a micropillar-reinforced photonic multilayer in the beetle's exoskeleton simultaneously enhances mechanical robustness and optical appearance, giving rise to optical damage tolerance. Compared with plain multilayer structures, stiffer vertical micropillars increase stiffness and elastic recovery, restrain the formation of shear bands, and enhance delamination resistance. The micropillars also scatter the reflected light at larger polar angles, enhancing the first optical diffraction order, which makes the reflected color visible from a wider range of viewing angles. The synergistic effect of the improved angular reflectivity and damage localization capability contributes to the optical damage tolerance. Our systematic structural analysis of T. flammea's different color polymorphs and parametric optical and mechanical modeling further suggest that the beetle's microarchitecture is optimized toward maximizing the first-order optical diffraction rather than its mechanical stiffness. These findings shed light on material-level design strategies utilized in biological systems for achieving multifunctionality and could thus inform bioinspired material innovations.","Jia, Zian; Fernandes, Matheus C; Deng, Zhifei; Yang, Ting; Zhang, Qiuting; Lethbridge, Alfie; Yin, Jie; Lee, Jae-Hwang; Han, Lin; Weaver, James C; Bertoldi, Katia; Aizenberg, Joanna; Kolle, Mathias; Vukusic, Pete; Li, Ling",Proc.

Here, we report that murine hepatitis coronavirus initially seeded on FFR filter material is inactivated (6 order of magnitude reduction as measured by median tissue culture infective dose, TCID50) after dry heating at 75°C for 30 min. We also find that the quantitative fit of FFRs after heat treatment at this temperature, under dry conditions or at 90% relative humidity, is not affected by single or 10 heating cycles. Previous studies have reported that the filtration efficiency of FFRs is not negatively impacted by these heating conditions. These results suggest that thermal inactivation of coronaviruses is a potentially rapid and widely deployable method to reuse N95 FFRs in emergency situations where reusing FFRs is a necessity and broad-spectrum sterilization is unavailable. However, we also observe that a radiative heat source (e.g. an exposed heating element) results in rapid qualitative degradation of the FFR. Finally, we discuss differences in the results reported here and other recent studies investigating heat as a means to recycle FFRs. These differences suggest that while our repeated decontamination cycles do not affect FFR fit, overall wear time and the number of donning/doffing cycles are important factors that likely degrade FFR fit and must be investigated further.","Massey, Travis L; Borucki, Monica K; Paik, Samuel Y; Fuhrer, Kyle W; Bora, Mihail; Kane, Staci R; Haque, Razi-Ul M; Baxamusa, Salmaan H",Ann.

225123,Takotsubo Syndrome in the Setting of COVID-19 Infection,2020,"The catastrophic outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently a public emergency. Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is an autoinflammatory disease characterized by life-threatening complications. Systemic hyperinflammation and cytokine storm play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both COVID-19 and AOSD. We aimed to compare the similarities and differences focusing on ferritin and cytokine levels between severe COVID-19 and active AOSD. A literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science to collect the levels of cytokine including IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-&#945;, IL-10, and ferritin in severe COVID-19 patients. After extracting available data of indicators of interest, we acquired these statistics with a single-arm meta-analysis. Furthermore, a comparison was conducted between 52 patients with active AOSD in our center and severe COVID-19 patients from databases. The levels of IL-6 and IL-10 were higher in severe COVID-19 compared with those in active AOSD. There were no significant differences on the cytokine of IL-1ß and TNF-&#945;. Fold changes of IL-18 were defined as the mean expression level ratio of severe COVID-19 to healthy controls in the COVID-19 study and active AOSD to healthy controls in our study, individually. Although the fold change of IL-18 in patients with AOSD was significantly higher than patients with severe COVID-19 (fold change: 594.00 vs 2.17), there was no statistical comparability. In addition, the level of ferritin was higher in active AOSD in comparison with severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that severe COVID-19 and active AOSD have differences in cytokine panel and ferritin level, indicating the pathogenic role of ferritin in overwhelming inflammation. And it paves the way to make efficacy therapeutic strategy targeting the hyperinflammatory process in COVID-19 according to AOSD management, especially in severe COVID-19.","Meng, Jianfen; Ma, Yuning; Jia, Jinchao; Wang, Mengyan; Teng, Jialin; Shi, Hui; Liu, Honglei; Su, Yutong; Ye, Junna; Sun, Yue; Cheng, Xiaobing; Chi, Huihui; Liu, Tingting; Zhu, Dehao; Zhou, Zhuochao; Wan, Liyan; Wang, Zhihong; Wang, Fan; Qiao, Xin; Chen, Xia; Zhang, Hao; Tang, Zihan; Yang, Chengde; Hu, Qiongyi",Front Immunol,,203

METHODS: We examined 3115 hospital discharges to a national cohort of 1068 adult care homes and subsequent outbreaks of COVID-19 occurring between 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time-dependent exposure to hospital discharge on incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7-21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics, including size and type of provision. RESULTS: A total of 330 homes experienced an outbreak, and 544 homes received a discharge over the study period. Exposure to hospital discharge was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.47, P = .29) after adjusting for care home characteristics. Care home size was the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison with homes of <10 residents were as follows: 3.40 (1.99, 5.80) for 10-24 residents; 8.25 (4.93, 13.81) for 25-49 residents; and 17.35 (9.65, 31.19) for 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison with periods when homes were unexposed. CONCLUSION: Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.","Emmerson, Chris; Adamson, James P; Turner, Drew; Gravenor, Mike B; Salmon, Jane; Cottrell, Simon; Middleton, Victoria; Thomas, Buffy; Mason, Brendan W; Williams, Chris J",Influenza other respir. viruses,,203

On wheat bran P. subrubescens degraded xylan main chain and side residues from Day 2 of cultivation, whereas it started to degrade side chains of pectin in sugar beet pulp prior to attacking the main chain on Day 3. In addition, on Day 3 the cellulolytic enzymes were highly increased.

227569,Early and late pregnancy loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome undergoing IVF/ICSI treatment: a retrospective cohort analysis of 21 820 pregnancies,2020,"BACKGROUND: Mortality from the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to rise across the United States. Evidence is emerging that environmental factors may contribute to susceptibility to disease and mortality. Greenspace exposure promotes enhanced immunity and may protect against risk of mortality among those with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine if high county level greenspace exposure is associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Greenspace exposure was characterized in 3049 counties across the conterminous United States using Leaf Area Index (LAI) deciles that were derived from satellite imagery via Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from 2011 to 2015. COVID-19 mortality data were obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate the association between county level LAI and COVID-19 mortality rate in analyses adjusted for 2015-2019 county level average total county population, older population, race, overcrowding in home, Medicaid, education, and physical inactivity. RESULTS: A dose-response association was found between greenness and reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. COVID-19 mortality was negatively associated with LAI deciles 8 [MRR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.93)], 9 [MRR = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.89)], and 10 [MRR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.69)]. Aside from LAI decile 5, no associations were found between the remaining LAI deciles and COVID-19 mortality. Increasing prevalence of counties with older age residents, low education attainment, Native Americans, Black Americans, and housing overcrowding were significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, whereas Medicaid prevalence was associated with a reduced risk. DISCUSSION: Counties with a higher amount of greenspace may be at a reduced risk of experiencing mortality due to COVID-19.","Russette, Helen; Graham, Jon; Holden, Zachary; Semmens, Erin O; Williams, Elizabeth; Landguth, Erin L",Environ Res,,203
228260,Coagulation disorders and thromboembolic disease in COVID-19: review of current evidence in search of a better approach,2021,"BACKGROUND: The primary method of surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is with nasopharyngeal swabs. Given the significant demand for nasopharyngeal swabs, a large number of previously untrained and unfamiliar staff are now performing this test. It was noted that there was significant heterogeneity in instructions for performing nasopharyngeal swabs in Canada, in contrast to the guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The objective of this study was to review the instructions provided across Canada and contrast them to those of the CDC and PAHO. METHODS: A standard series of steps for nasopharyngeal swab performance was outlined based on the CDC, PAHO, and New England Journal of Medicine instructions. A comprehensive search was performed in August 2020 to identify nasopharyngeal swab guidelines provided by public health in the provinces and territories of Canada. Regional health authority guidance was also collected. Instructions provided were contrasted against the standardized steps. RESULTS: Instructions were identified for all provinces and territories, and for 81 regional health authorities. From the provincial and territorial guidelines, 10/13 (77%) cleared the nasal passages before swab insertion, 11/13 (85%) tilted the patient's head back slightly, 12/13 (92%) inserted the swab parallel to the palate, but only 3/13 (23%) inserted the swab to at least a depth of two-thirds the distance between the patient's nose and ear. A clear majority (81%) of regional health authority guidelines followed their respective provincial guidelines. For depth of insertion, Quebec provided a pictogram but no distance or technique for estimation. Six provinces and territories - Northwest Territories, Nunavut, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Alberta - recommended 4 cm or one-half the distance from nostrils to ear. British Columbia and Manitoba recommended a 7 cm depth of insertion. Nova Scotia recommended one-half to two-thirds the distance from nose to ear. Lastly, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and the Yukon recommended an insertion from nose to the external ear canal. CONCLUSION: There is significant heterogeneity in guidance for nasopharyngeal swab performance across Canada. The instructions provided by the majority of provinces and territories in Canada would not be effective in reaching the nasopharynx.","Hiebert, Nole M; Chen, Breanna Ashley; Sowerby, Leigh J",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,203

A multidimensional index of neighborhood social and environmental resources was created and stratified by tertile (high, medium, and low). Differences were examined in individual-level medical spending associated with living in high-, medium-, or low-resource neighborhoods in unadjusted and adjusted 2-part models and quantile regression models. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS: Enrollees who live in neighborhoods with low social and environmental resources incur significantly higher spending at the mean and across the distribution of medical spending even after controlling for age, race, sex, and morbidity than those who live in neighborhoods with high social and environmental resources. On average, this spending difference between individuals in low- and those in high-resource neighborhoods is estimated to be $523.60 per person per year. CONCLUSIONS: Living in neighborhoods with low (versus those with high) resources is associated with higher individual-level medical spending across the distribution of medical spending. Findings suggest potential benefits from efforts to address the social and environmental context of neighborhoods in addition to the traditional orientation to addressing individual behavior and risk.","Sherry, Melissa K; Bishai, David M; Padula, William V; Weiner, Jonathan P; Szanton, Sarah L; Wolff, Jennifer L",Am J Prev Med,,203

236402,COVID-19 and remdesivir in pediatric patients: the invisible part of the iceberg,2020,"BACKGROUND: We examined whether existing licensed pharmacotherapies could reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 µg/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. RESULTS: A total of 3037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2-42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7-39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, -5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, -10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%), and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Chemoprophylaxis with either oral hydroxychloroquine or povidone-iodine throat spray was superior to oral vitamin C in reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and healthy men.","Seet, Raymond Chee Seong; Quek, Amy May Lin; Ooi, Delicia Shu Qin; Sengupta, Sharmila; Lakshminarasappa, Satish Ramapatna; Koo, Chieh Yang; So, Jimmy Bok Yan; Goh, Boon Cher; Loh, Kwok Seng; Fisher, Dale; Teoh, Hock Luen; Sun, Jie; Cook, Alex R; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Hartman, Mikael",Int J Infect Dis,,203

From data available in mid April 2003, we predict that SARS would be controlled by June and nearly 1700 persons would be infected based on the SIR model. This is consistent with the known data. A simple way to evaluate the development and efficacy of control is described and shown to provide a useful measure for the future evolution of an epidemic. This may contribute to improve strategic response from the government. The evaluation process here is universal and therefore applicable to many similar homogeneous epidemic diseases within a fixed population. A novel model consisting of map systems involving the Small-World network principle is also described. We find that this model reproduces qualitative features of the random disease propagation observed in the true data. Unlike traditional deterministic models, scale-free phenomena are observed in the epidemic network. The numerical simulations provide theoretical support for current strategies and achieve more efficient control of some epidemic diseases, including SARS.","Shi, Pengliang; Small, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0312016v1.pdf,203
236937,Pulmonary Fibrosis After COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) outbreak has manifested into a major public health concern across the globe, affecting particularly the most vulnerable population groups. Currently, there are various clinical trials being conducted to develop effective treatments. It is estimated that it could take one or more years before these drugs pass all safety tests and concrete results with regard to their effectiveness become available. In addition, despite the recent development of vaccines (licensed for use under conditional licenses) and the commencement of COVID-19 vaccination programs in several countries, there is still a need for safe and novel strategies that may reduce the symptomatology and/or prevent the severe complications associated with COVID-19. Natural compounds previously shown to have antiviral potential should be thoroughly considered and investigated for use in prophylactic treatment of COVID-19 due to their availability and safety. RECENT FINDINGS: The current narrative review investigates whether there is evidence in the literature that supplementation with dietary minerals and vitamins may have a role in preventing infection with SARS-CoV-2 or in reducing COVID-19 symptomatology and disease progression. The current evidence from the literature supports that zinc and vitamin C have a potential in reducing the inflammatory response associated with SARS-CoV-2 while folate and vitamin D may have a role in antagonizing the entry of SARs-CoV-2 virus in host calls. Thus, further research should be conducted that could lead to the development of nutritional supplements involving natural and widely available compounds such as zinc, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D. The latter could be an effective, safe, and inexpensive way to either prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 and/or lessen the burden of COVID-19 disease.","Pinnawala, Nathan Ushmantha; Thrastardottir, Tinna Osk; Constantinou, Constantina",Curr. nutr. rep,,203

238944,Prothrombotic changes in patients with COVID-19 are associated with disease severity and mortality,2020,"BACKGROUND: Myocardial injury is a common finding in COVID-19 strongly associated with severity. We analysed the prevalence and prognostic utility of myocardial injury, characterized by elevated cardiac troponin, in a large population of COVID-19 patients, and further evaluated separately the role of troponin T and I. METHODS: This is a multicentre, retrospective observational study enrolling patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 32 Spanish hospitals. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values above the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit, as recommended by international guidelines. Thirty-day mortality was defined as endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 1280 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 187 (14.6%) died during the hospitalization. Using a nonspecific sex cut-off, elevated troponin levels were found in 344 patients (26.9%), increasing to 384 (30.0%) when a sex-specific cut-off was used. This prevalence was significantly higher (42.9% vs 21.9%; P < .001) in patients in whom troponin T was measured in comparison with troponin I. Sex-specific elevated troponin levels were significantly associated with 30-day mortality, with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 3.00 for total population, 3.20 for cardiac troponin T and 3.69 for cardiac troponin I. CONCLUSION: In this multicentre study, myocardial injury was a common finding in COVID-19 patients. Its prevalence increased when a sex-specific cut-off and cardiac troponin T were used. Elevated troponin was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, irrespective of cardiac troponin assay and cut-offs to detect myocardial injury. Hence, the early measurement of cardiac troponin may be useful for risk stratification in COVID-19.","García de Guadiana-Romualdo, Luis; Morell-García, Daniel; Rodríguez-Fraga, Olaia; Morales-Indiano, Cristian; María Lourdes Padilla Jiménez, Ana; Gutiérrez Revilla, José Ignacio; Urrechaga, Eloísa; Álamo, José María; Hernando Holgado, Ana María; Lorenzo-Lozano, María Del Carmen; Sánchez Fdez-Pacheco, Silvia; de la Hera Cagigal, Patricia; Juncos Tobarra, María Ángeles; Vílchez, Juan A; Vírseda Chamorro, Isabel; Gutiérrez Garcia, Irene; Pastor Murcia, Yolanda; Sahuquillo Frías, Laura; Altimira Queral, Laura; Nuez-Zaragoza, Elisa; Adell Ruiz de León, Juan; Ruiz Ripa, Alicia; Salas Gómez-Pablos, Paloma; Cebreiros López, Iria; Fernández Uriarte, Amaia; Larruzea, Álex; López Yepes, María Luisa; Sancho-Rodríguez, Natalia; Zamorano Andrés, María Consuelo; Pedregosa Díaz, José; Acevedo Alcaraz, Cristina; Blázquez Manzanera, Alfonso-L; Pérez Sanmartín, Sonia; Baamonde Calzada, María Del Carmen; Vera, Marina; Valera Nuñez, Elena; Canalda Campás, Magdalena; García Muñoz, Sara; Bauça, Josep Miquel; Vicente Gutiérrez, Luis; Jiménez Añón, Laura; Pérez Martínez, Alfonso; Pons Castillo, Aurelio; González Tamayo, Ruth; Férriz Vivancos, Jorge; José Alcaide Martín, María; Ferrer Díaz de Brito Fernández, Vicente; Aguadero, Vicente; García Arévalo, María Gloria; Arnaldos Carrillo, María",Eur J Clin Invest,,203
238948,Correlations between COVID-19 and burden of dementia: An ecological study and review of literature,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe success rates of respiratory protective equipment (RPE) fit testing and factors associated with achieving suitable fit. DESIGN: Prospective observational study of RPE fit testing according to health and safety, and occupational health requirements. SETTING: A large tertiary referral UK healthcare facility. POPULATION: 1443 healthcare workers undergoing quantitative fit testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative fit test success (pass/fail) and the count of tests each participant required before successful fit. RESULTS: Healthcare workers were fit tested a median (IQR) 2 (1-3) times before successful fit was obtained. Males were tested a median 1 (1-2) times, while females were tested a median 2 (1-2) times before a successful fit was found. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). Modelling each fit test as its own independent trial (n=2359) using multivariable logistic regression, male healthcare workers were significantly more likely to find a well-fitting respirator and achieve a successful fit on first attempt in comparison to females, after adjusting for other factors (adjusted OR=2.07, 95% CI): 1.66 to 2.60, p<0.001). Staff who described their ethnicity as White were also more likely to achieve a successful fit compared with staff who described their ethnicity as Asian (OR=0.47, 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.58, p<0.001), Black (OR=0.54, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.71, p<0.001), mixed (OR=0.50 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.80, p=0.004) or other (OR=0.53, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.99, p=0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Male and White ethnicity healthcare workers are more likely to achieve RPE fit test success. This has broad operational implications to healthcare services with a large female and Black, Asian and minority ethnic group population. Fit testing is imperative in ensuring RPE effectiveness in protecting healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Carvalho, Clarissa Y M; Schumacher, Jan; Greig, Paul Robert; Wong, Danny J N; El-Boghdadly, Kariem",BMJ Open,,203

METHODS: Six cases of severe or critically severe COVID-19 patients treated in The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University from January 22 to February 4, 2020 were recruited, and all of them received artificial liver support treatment. Statistical analysis was carried out on the change of cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4), inflammation-related indicators (white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin), immune-related indicators (B lymphocyte percentage, natural killer cell percentage, CD3+CD4+CD8 T cell percentage), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the 6 patients before and after treatment, and the proportions of patients with abnormal indicators were analyzed as well. In addition, computed tomography (CT) was used to observe the absorption of pulmonary lesions before and after the artificial liver support treatment. RESULTS: The levels of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) were effectively reduced in the 6 patients after treatment with the artificial liver support system. Meanwhile, the proportions of patients with abnormal TNF-&#945;, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were all decreased (p < 0.05). The levels of inflammation-related indicators including white blood cell, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, and the proportions of patients with these abnormal indicators were both significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The level of neutrophil was not effectively reduced before and after the treatment, but the proportion was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, the abnormality of lymphocyte in the patients was not improved. There was no significant difference in immune-related indicators, AST and ALT before and after the treatment (p > 0.05). CT imaging showed that the artificial liver support treatment contributed to absorption of pulmonary lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The artificial liver support system had a great clinical effect in the treatment of cytokine storm and inflammation in COVID-19 patients, and it could promote the absorption of infected lesions.","Xia, Qi; Xu, Kaijin; Yu, Liang; Zhang, Huafen; Li, Lanjuan",Int Immunopharmacol,,203
241275,Association of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency with vitamin D status: who is most at risk of getting severe COVID-19?,2021,"Background: Drug development strategies for treating COVID-19 focus on actives that either physically block angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors (viral entry point), or those, which inactivate viral proteases like 3CLpro or RdRp, inside the infected host cells. Objectives: The objective of the present study is to virtually screen phytochemicals for both these purposes. Methods: Molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) and multiple sequence alignment were employed. Results: All the screened phytochemical actives showed negative binding energies with their respective targets, attesting good complex stabilities. Among each set of ten actives, for blocking ACE-2 receptors and for inactivation of 3CLpro and RdRp, Dichamanetin-ACE-2, Glabrene-3CLpro and Naringenin-RdRp complexes were most stable, with binding energies of -9.8, -9.11 and -7.7 Kcal/mol respectively. MDS studies of these representative actives and their complexes, also attested to complex stabilities. Multiple sequence alignment analysis of nine significant amino acid residues of the Homo sapiens ACE-2 receptor, with nine different species, showed conservation of several residues. Conclusion: A set of phytochemicals actives can block ACE-2 receptors and prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host endothelial cells. Two other sets of actives can inactivate viral 3CLpro and RdRp enzymes and prevent replication of SARS-CoV-2 inside host cells. They all can hence be further explored for the control of COVID-19.","Dey, D.; Dey, N.; Ghosh, S.; Khan, I.; Thiagarajan, P.",Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research,,203

Aim of this study was to evaluate the role of high sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: we retrospectively analysed hs-TnI values measured in 523 patients (median age 64 years, 68% men) admitted to a university hospital in Milan, Italy, and diagnosed COVID-19. RESULTS: A significant difference in hs-TnI concentrations was found between deceased patients (98 patients) vs discharged (425 patients) [36.05 ng/L IQR 16.5-94.9 vs 6.3 ng/L IQR 2.6-13.9, p < 0.001 respectively]. Hs-TnI measurements were independent predictors of mortality at multivariate analysis adjusted for confounding parameters such as age (HR 1.004 for each 10 point of troponin, 95% CI 1.002-1.006, p < 0.001). The survival rate, after one week, in patients with hs-TnI values under 6 ng/L was 97.94%, between 6 ng/L and the normal value was 90.87%, between the normal value and 40 ng/L was 86.98, and 59.27% over 40 ng/L.

Exploring different clinical features that may act as detrimental to this population's survival is pivotal for recognizing the highest risk individuals for poor outcome. We thus aimed to characterize the clinical differences between 60-day survivors and non-survivors, as well as analyze variables influencing survival in the first older adults hospitalized in Poznan, Poland, with COVID-19. Symptoms, comorbidities, complications, laboratory results, and functional capacity regarding the first 50 older patients (&#8805;60 years) hospitalized due to COVID-19 were retrospectively studied. Functional status before admission (dependent/independent) was determined based on medical history. The 60-day survivors (n = 30/50) and non-survivors (n = 20/50) were compared across clinical parameters. The patients had a mean age of 74.8 ± 9.4 years. Overall, 20/50 patients died during hospitalization, with no further fatal outcomes reported during the 60-day period. The non-survivors were on average older (78.3 ± 9.7 years), more commonly experienced concurrent heart disease (75%), and displayed functional dependence (65%) (p < 0.05). When assessing the variables influencing survival (age, heart disease, and functional dependence), using a multivariate proportional hazards regression, functional dependence (requiring assistance in core activities of daily living) was the main factor affecting 60-day survival (HR, 3.34; 95% CI: 1.29-8.63; p = 0.01). In our study, functional dependence was the most important prognostic factor associated with mortality. Elderly with COVID-19 who required assistance in core activities of daily living prior to hospitalization had a three times increased risk to experience mortality, as compared to those with complete independence. Exploring geriatric approaches, such as assessment of functional capacity, may assist in constructing comprehensive survival prognosis in the elderly COVID-19 population.","Neumann-Podczaska, Agnieszka; Chojnicki, Michal; Karbowski, Lukasz M; Al-Saad, Salwan R; Hashmi, Abbas A; Chudek, Jerzy; Tobis, Slawomir; Kropinska, Sylwia; Mozer-Lisewska, Iwona; Suwalska, Aleksandra; Tykarski, Andrzej; Wieczorowska-Tobis, Katarzyna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203

However, the association of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety among pregnant women under the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario has been poorly addressed. We conducted one large-scale, multicenter cross-sectional study which recruited 1794 pregnant women across middle and west China. Self-reported demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and mental health status were collected from 6th February to 8th May 2020. We investigated the association of sleep duration and screen time with the risk of anxiety by multivariable logistic regression analysis and linear regression analysis after adjusting potential confounders. The dose-response relationship of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety was visualized using a cubic spline plot. Our data revealed that almost 35% of pregnant women suffered from anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep duration was dose-dependently associated with a lower risk of anxiety among pregnant women (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.63), while screen time exhibited a conversed effect (OR = 2.01, 95% CI:1.00-4.39). Notably, sleep duration (&gt;=8 h/day) synergistically combined with screen time (3-7 h/day) to diminish the risk of anxiety (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.50-0.99).

247146,Mesenteric ischemia in COVID-19 patients: A review of current literature,2021,"The worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic made dramatic and rapid progress in the year 2020 and requires urgent global effort to accelerate the development of a vaccine to stop the daily infections and deaths. Several types of vaccine have been designed to teach the immune system how to fight off certain kinds of pathogens. mRNA vaccines are the most important candidate vaccines because of their capacity for rapid development, high potency, safe administration and potential for low-cost manufacture. mRNA vaccine acts by training the body to recognize and response to the proteins produced by disease-causing organisms such as viruses or bacteria. This type of vaccine is the fastest candidate to treat COVID-19 but it currently facing several limitations. In particular, it is a challenge to design stable mRNA molecules because of the inefficient in vivo delivery of mRNA, its tendency for spontaneous degradation and low protein expression levels. This work designed and implemented a sequence deep model based on bidirectional GRU and LSTM models applied on the Stanford COVID-19 mRNA vaccine dataset to predict the mRNA sequences responsible for degradation by predicting five reactivity values for every position in the sequence. Four of these values determine the likelihood of degradation with/without magnesium at high pH (pH 10) and high temperature (50 degrees Celsius) and the fifth reactivity value is used to determine the likely secondary structure of the RNA sample. The model relies on two types of features, namely numerical and categorical features, where the categorical features are extracted from the mRNA sequences, structure and predicted loop. These features are represented and encoded by numbers, and then, the features are extracted using embedding layer learning. There are five numerical features depending on the likelihood for each pair of nucleotides in the RNA. The model gives promising results because it predicts the five reactivity values with a validation mean columnwise root mean square error (MCRMSE) of 0.125 using LSTM model with augmentation and the codon encoding method. Codon encoding outperforms Base encoding in MCRMSE validation error using the LSTM model meanwhile Base encoding outperforms codon encoding due to less over-fitting and the difference between the training and validation loss error is 0.008.","Qaid, Talal S.; Mazaar, Hussein Alqahtani Mohammed S.; Raweh, Abeer A.; Alakwaa, Wafaa",PeerJ Computer Science,,203
247224,Myeloid cell dynamics correlating with clinical outcomes of severe COVID-19 in Japan,2021,"AIM: The effect of reopening schools on children's contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially within households, remains controversial. This study describes the clinical presentation of a large ambulatory COVID-19 pediatric cohort and evaluates the role of children in household transmission prior to and following school reopening. METHODS: A retrospective database cohort study conducted in a large Health Maintenance Organization in Israel. Data of all pediatric, laboratory-confirmed Coronavirus cases between 28/2/2020- 20/6/2020 were extracted. All cases were analyzed for household contacts and primary cases within each family cluster. RESULTS: 1,032 cases under 18 years old (median age 12 years) were included. 432 (41.9%) were asymptomatic. 122 (11.8%) cases acquired the infection at school, 45 of them were part of two school clusters. 846 children had at least one positive household contact, in 498 family clusters, among them 293 primary cases were identified. Only 27 (9.2%) primary cases were under 18 years of age and six (2%) were below 10. The proportion of primary cases did not change after the re-opening of educational facilities. CONCLUSION: Children, particularly under 10 years of age, are less likely to be the vector for SARS-CoV-2 infection within household settings. Opening educational facilities did not change transmission dynamics.","Shapiro Ben David, Shirley; Cohen, Daniella; Tasher, Diana; Geva, Adi; Azuri, Joseph; Ash, Nachman",Acta paediatr. scand,,203

In this retrospective study, data were collected from 662 patients with severe/critical COVID-19 who were admitted to a designated hospital to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. All patients were divided into an exposed group (CHM users) and a control group (non-users). After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, 156 CHM users were matched by propensity score to 156 non-users. No significant differences in seven baseline clinical variables were found between the two groups of patients. All-cause mortality was reported in 13 CHM users who died and 36 non-users who died. After multivariate adjustment, the mortality risk of CHM users was reduced by 82.2% (odds ratio 0.178, 95% CI 0.076-0.418; P < 0.001) compared with the non-users.

New lines of research have shown that the diversity of human intestinal and oropharyngeal microbiomes can shape pulmonary viral infection progression. Here, we suggest that the disruption in microbial sharing, as it is associated with dysbiosis (loss of bacterial diversity associated with an imbalance of the microbiota with deleterious consequences for the host), may worsen the prognosis of COVID-19 disease. In addition, social detachment can also decrease the rate of transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Therefore, it seems crucial to perform new studies combining the pandemic control of COVID-19 with the diversity of the human microbiome.","Domingues, Célia P F; Rebelo, João S; Dionisio, Francisco; Botelho, Ana; Nogueira, Teresa",MSphere,,203

Although most patients with COVID-19 have mild illness and may be asymptomatic, some will develop severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and death. RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 are capable of hijacking the epigenetic landscape of host immune cells to evade antiviral defense. Yet, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of immune cell epigenetic changes associated with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection pathology. Here, we examined genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia compared with uninfected, hospitalized influenza, untreated primary HIV infection, and mild/moderate COVID-19 HIV coinfected individuals. Cell-type deconvolution analyses confirmed lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 and revealed a high percentage of estimated neutrophils suggesting perturbations to DNAm associated with granulopoiesis. We observed a distinct DNAm signature of severe COVID-19 characterized by hypermethylation of IFN-related genes and hypomethylation of inflammatory genes, reinforcing observations in infection models and single-cell transcriptional studies of severe COVID-19. Epigenetic clock analyses revealed severe COVID-19 was associated with an increased DNAm age and elevated mortality risk according to GrimAge, further validating the epigenetic clock as a predictor of disease and mortality risk. Our epigenetic results reveal a discovery DNAm signature of severe COVID-19 in blood potentially useful for corroborating clinical assessments, informing pathogenic mechanisms, and revealing new therapeutic targets against SARS-CoV-2.","Corley, Michael J; Pang, Alina P S; Dody, Kush; Mudd, Philip A; Patterson, Bruce K; Seethamraju, Harish; Bram, Yaron; Peluso, Michael J; Torres, Leonel; Iyer, Nikita S; Premeaux, Thomas A; Yeung, Stephen T; Chandar, Vasuretha; Borczuk, Alain; Schwartz, Robert E; Henrich, Timothy J; Deeks, Steven G; Sacha, Jonah B; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C",J. leukoc. biol,,203

The level of IgG antibody was stable, the level of IgM antibody decreased slightly in the early convalescent phase and was detected in only five patients in the sixth month after symptom onset. The level of IgG antibody was higher in the severe and critical group than in the moderate group. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies have a long-term persistence in convalescent COVID-19 patients, whether they have long-term protection need to be further investigated.","Liu, Chuanmiao; Yu, Xiaoqi; Gao, Chunming; Zhang, Li; Zhai, Hui; Hu, Yanan; Liu, Enhui; Wang, Qiong; Gao, Yu; Wei, Dong; Zhang, Donghua; Han, Yue; Zhang, Xinxin",J Med Virol,,203

Nevertheless, the precise biological role and underlying mechanisms of BUB1B in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain indistinct. METHOD: To figure out the role of BUB1B in HCC, we first assessed its expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. We then verified BUB1B expression in HCC tissues, nontumor tissues, and HCC cell lines through western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. To explore the specific function of BUB1B in HCC in vivo and in vitro, we performed the flow cytometry, Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, colony formation, Transwell, wound-healing, subcutaneous tumor growth, and metastasis assays. Additionally, we identified the BUB1B-regulated pathways involved in HCC by using gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Our data displayed that higher BUB1B expression was detected in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. The overexpression of BUB1B was positively correlated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analyses showed that lower recurrence-free and overall survival rates were correlated with the overexpression of BUB1B in patients with HCC. Moreover, the malignancy of HCC was facilitated by BUB1B both in vivo and in vitro. Lastly, the results were confirmed by western blots, which showed that BUB1B upregulated mTORC1 signaling pathway in HCC. Meanwhile, the oncogenic effect of BUB1B will be impaired when the mTORC1 signaling pathway was inhibited by rapamycin. CONCLUSION: We highlighted that BUB1B played an oncogenic role in HCC and was identified as a possible clinical prognostic factor and a potential novel therapeutic target for HCC.","Qiu, Jiannan; Zhang, Shaopeng; Wang, Peng; Wang, Hao; Sha, Bowen; Peng, Hao; Ju, Zheng; Rao, Jianhua; Lu, Ling",Cancer med,,203

RES development results in many effects, direct and indirect, linked to each other, societal, local and individual, i.e., “multiple impacts of RES” (MI RES). These effects need to be carefully assessed and evaluated to obtain the full picture of energy field transformation and its context, and enable further development of RES. Nevertheless, the MI RES concept is often presented misleadingly and its scope varies throughout the literature. This paper provides a literature overview of the methodologies of this concept and presents a new concept of MI RES, respecting the difference between effects resulting from the implementation of RES and ultimate multiple impacts. We have summarized the effects into four groups: economic, social, environmental, and technical, which all lead to group of ultimate multiple impacts. Finally, we provide the complex overview of all MI RES and present the framework, which is used to analyze the multiple impacts and effects of RES and to show how the RES development leads and contributes to these impacts and effects. The concept is recommended to be considered in designing a robust energy policy by decision-makers.","Valentová, Michaela",Energies,,203

To investigate if SARS-CoV-2 can affect early human embryos, we analysed scRNA-seq datasets of human embryos for the SARS-CoV-2 receptors ACE2 and BSG (CD147), the serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral spike protein priming, and the endosomal protease CTSL for spike protein activation via the endosomal route. The results reveal that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are co-expressed in a proportion of epiblast cells, and both BSG and CTSL are expressed in all the stages of embryonic development. The cells of the blastocysts express genes encoding for other coronavirus receptors such as DPP4 and ANPEP as well. Interestingly, the cells of the epiblast also express genes involved in viral endocytosis and replication. We further identified 194 genes that are differentially expressed in ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells as compared to ACE2- and TMPRSS2-negative cells of the epiblast. Our results show that developing human embryos express the receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses; embryos also harbour the necessary machinery for viral internalization and replication. We suggest that couples be advised to avoid conceiving during the pandemic and that IVF procedures be kept to a minimum to prevent any possible hazard to the developing embryos.","Colaco, Stacy; Chhabria, Karisma; Singh, Neha; Bhide, Anshul; Singh, Domdatt; Singh, Abhishek; Husein, Atahar; Mishra, Anuradha; Sharma, Richa; Ashary, Nancy; Modi, Deepak",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04935v1.pdf,203

Inflammatory markers like lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are simple and readily available markers. In this study, we evaluated the utility of these markers in the early identification of patients with complicated AP. Patients and Methods: All patients with a diagnosis of AP admitted to the University Medical Center in Las Vegas/Nevada between August 2015 and September 2018 were identified using ICD-10 codes. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Epidemiological measures and their associated confidence intervals were calculated using MedCalc (v. 18). Results: The LMR showed a significant difference between groups, with the non-complicated cases consistently higher than the complicated cases but without significant temporal differences. The NLR showed a significant difference with a significant temporal relation. Using the bound of the 95% confidence interval separating the two groups, LMR <2 was found to be associated with a complicated case and NLR >10.5 was suggestive of a complicated case. High specificity (85-92%) with low sensitivity (23-69%) was noted; hence, these cut points were very good at discerning non-complicated cases. Conclusion: Our data show persistently low LMR that is associated with severe AP and a value of <2.0 can be used clinically to predict severe AP on admission. It also shows that elevated NLR is associated with complicated AP and prolonged hospital stay with a value >10.5 that can be used to predict severe complicated AP and to monitor response to treatment over time.","Mubder, Mohamad; Dhindsa, Banreet; Nguyen, Danny; Saghir, Syed; Cross, Chad; Makar, Ranjit; Ohning, Gordon",,,203

255290,Recommendations and Clinical Guidance for Children with Metabolic-associated Fatty Liver Disease during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Despite community efforts to support and enable older and vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic, many people with dementia and their family carers are still finding it difficult to adjust their daily living in light of the disruption that the pandemic has caused. There may be needs specific to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations in these circumstances that remain thus far unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with dementia and their family carers of BAME backgrounds, in relation to their experiences of community dementia care and the impact on their daily lives. DESIGN: 15 participants (persons with dementia and carers) were recruited for semistructured qualitative interviews. Respondents were of South Asian and Afro-Caribbean backgrounds. We used thematic analysis to analyse our data from a constructivist perspective, which emphasises the importance of multiple perspectives, contexts and values. RESULTS: There were a number of ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted BAME persons with dementia and carers with regard to their experiences of dementia community care and the impact on their everyday lives. In particular we identified eight key themes, with subthemes: fear and anxiety, food and eating (encompassing food shopping and eating patterns), isolation and identity, community and social relationships, adapting to COVID-19, social isolation and support structures, and medical interactions. Fear and anxiety formed an overarching theme that encompassed all others. DISCUSSION: This paper covers unique and underexplored topics in a COVID-19-vulnerable group. There is limited work with these groups in the UK and this is especially true in COVID-19. The results showed that such impacts were far-reaching and affected not only day-to-day concerns, but also care decisions with long-ranging consequences, and existential interests around fear, faith, death and identity.","West, Emily; Nair, Pushpa; Barrado-Martin, Yolanda; Walters, Kate R; Kupeli, Nuriye; Sampson, Elizabeth L; Davies, Nathan",BMJ Open,,203
255726,Selecting Treatment for Patients With Tardive Dyskinesia Using Safety and Efficacy Evidence,2020,"Background and aims The ACR1990 criteria of fibromyalgia (FM) have been criticized due to poor reliability of tender points counting (TPC), inconsistent definitions of the widespread pain, and by not considering other symptoms than pain in the FM phenotype. Therefore, several newer self-report measures for FM criteria have emerged. The aim of this study was to translate the fibromyalgia survey questionnaire (FSQ) to Norwegian and validate both the 2011 and the 2016 fibromyalgia survey diagnostic criteria (FSDC) against the ACR1990 criteria. Methods One hundred and twenty chronic pain patients formerly diagnosed with fibromyalgia according to the ACR1990 criteria, and 62 controls not diagnosed or where fibromyalgia was not suspected, were enrolled in this study. All responded to a Norwegian version of the FSQ. Also, they had a clinical examination according to ACR1990 fibromyalgia criteria including a counting of significant tender points with an algometer (TPC). The FSQ with the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity scale (SSS) subscales, Fibromyalgia Severity (FS) sum score, was examined for correlations with the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQ) and TPCs. Face-validity, internal consistence, test-retest reliability and construct validity with convergent and divergent approaches were examined and a Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was performed. Results The internal consistency of FS measured by Cronbach's alfa was good (=0.904). The test-retest reliability measures using intra class correlation were respectable for the FS, including WPI and SSS subscales (0.86, 0.84 and 0.87). FS, WPI and SSS correlated significantly with FIQ (0.74, 0.59 and 0.85) and TPC indicating an adequate construct, convergent validity. The medians of FS, WPI and SSS in the fibromyalgia-group were significantly different from the non-fibromyalgia-group indicating good construct, divergent validity. Using the 2011 and 2016 FSDC vs. ACR 1990 as a reference, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR +) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were identified. The accuracy rate for both 2011 and 2016 FSDC were respectable (84%). ROC analysis using FS revealed a very good Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.860. Conclusion The current study revealed that the Norwegian versions of FSQ is a valid tool for assessment of fibromyalgia according to the 2011 and 2016 (FSDC).","Fors, Egil A; Wensaas, Knut-Arne; Eide, Hilde; Jaatun, Ellen A; Clauw, Daniel J; Wolfe, Fred; Helvik, Anne-Sofie",Scandinavian journal of pain (Online),,203
256731,Acute necrotizing myelitis and acute motor axonal neuropathy in a COVID-19 patient,2020,"Pro-life advocates commonly argue that fetuses have the moral status of persons, and an accompanying right to life, a view most pro-choice advocates deny. A difficulty for this pro-life position has been Judith Jarvis Thomson's violinist analogy, in which she argues that even if the fetus is a person, abortion is often permissible because a pregnant woman is not obliged to continue to offer her body as life support. Here, we outline the moral theories underlying public health ethics, and examine the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of public health considerations overriding individual rights. We argue that if fetuses are regarded as persons, then abortion is of such prevalence in society that it also constitutes a significant public health crisis. We show that on public health considerations, we are justified in overriding individual rights to bodily autonomy by prohibiting abortion. We conclude that in a society that values public health, abortion can only be tolerated if fetuses are not regarded as persons.","Blackshaw, Bruce; Rodger, Daniel",Bioethics,,203

The adoption of a preventive measure is required to control the spread. This research explores the impact of influencing factors like COVID-19 knowledge, behavioral control, moral and subject norms, preventive e-guidelines by the government, and environmental factors on the intention to prevent COVID-19 and risk aversion. A cross-sectional study was performed of 310 respondents about different COVID-19 related influencing factors in Pakistan. The partial least square-structural equation modeling was applied to estimate the path coefficient. Moral and subject norms (0.359) had a comparatively higher path coefficient. Other influencing factors/drivers were preventive e-guideline by the government (0.215) followed by COVID-19 knowledge (0.197), and behavioral control (0.121). The intention to prevent COVID-19 showed a positive and significant impact (0.705) on risk aversion. The indirect analysis also confirmed that the positive influence of moral and subject norms, COVID-19 knowledge, preventive e-guideline by the government, and behavioral control on risk aversion. However, the path coefficient of environmental factors was negative but insignificant, which implies than environmental factors do not influence the intention to prevent COVID-19. It is suggested to provide clear guidelines using print, social, electronic media. It is also suggested to provide e-guidelines in local languages. The COVID-19 knowledge about its transmission, symptoms, and precautions is also useful. It is suggested to include the causes, symptoms, and precaution of viral diseases in the educational syllabus. The government should ensure the availability of preventive medical items like surgical masks and sanitizers to meet the demand of the public.","Raza, Ali; Ali, Qamar; Hussain, Tanveer",,,203
257113,Managing COVID-19 Iinfection in pediatric patients,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has infected over 46 million people in 219 countries and territories. Following evidence of viral loadings and infectivity of feces of infected individuals, public health authorities have suggested to take precautions on the transmission of COVID-19 via fecal-associated routes. Recent discussions on fecal transmission of COVID-19 have mainly focused on municipal sewage. Yet, a widely neglected aspect in containing the virus is that a major part of the population in developing regions do not have access to private, clean sanitary facilities. Therefore, we hypothesize that open defecation and the prevalent use of squat toilets are additional risk factors in those communities. Here, we review fecal transmission of COVID-19, the practices of open defecation, and the resultant routes of transmission of fecal pathogens. Also, we highlight the open design of common squat toilets and the potential exposure to fecal droplets and residues. We observed that at least 20 countries reporting more than 10,000 confirmed infections have 5-26% of their population practicing open defecation. We illustrate the potential routes of transmission of COVID-19 and other fecal pathogens via human feces in communities practicing open defecation. Here, poor hand hygiene, contaminated shoes and objects, mechanical vectors, and outdoor human activities can all contribute to fecal transmission. Other risk factors include squat pans with lidless designs and open flushing mechanisms, in-cubicle open waste bins, and the lack of water-sealing U-traps in squat toilets.","Sun, Shiyi; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,,203

In this paper, we study whether, and to what extent, the topology of the trade network can explain the rate of COVID-19 diffusion and mortality across countries. We compute the countries' centrality measures and we apply the community detection methodology based on communicability distance. Then, we use these measures as focal regressors in a negative binomial regression framework. In doing so, we also compare the effect of different measures of centrality. Our results show that the number of infections and fatalities are larger in countries with a higher centrality in the global trade network.","Antonietti, Roberto; Falbo, Paolo; Fontini, Fulvio; Grassi, Rosanna; Rizzini, Giorgio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14554v1.pdf,203
257861,COVID-19 Infection in Cancer Patients: How Can Oncologists Deal With These Patients?,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a cure in the time of a pandemic, social distancing measures seem to be the most effective intervention to slow the spread of disease. Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (ß) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ß values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.","Delen, Dursun; Eryarsoy, Enes; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,203

At present, there is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Liu Shen capsule (LS), a traditional Chinese medicine, has been proven to have a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. However, little is known about the antiviral effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, the study was designed to investigate the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential effect in regulating the host's immune response. The inhibitory effect of LS against SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells was evaluated by using the cytopathic effect (CPE) and plaque reduction assay. The number of virions of SARS-CoV-2 was observed under transmission electron microscope after treatment with LS. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. The results showed that LS could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells, and reduce the number of virus particles and it could markedly reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß, IL-8, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Moreover, the expression of the key proteins in the NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway was detected by western blot and it was found that LS could inhibit the expression of p-NF-&#954;B p65, p-I&#954;B&#945; and p-p38 MAPK, while increasing the expression of I&#954;B&#945;. These findings indicate that LS could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus infection via downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced virus and regulating the activity of NF-&#954;B/MAPK signaling pathway in vitro, making its promising candidate treatment for controlling COVID-19 disease.","Ma, Qinhai; Pan, Weiqi; Li, Runfeng; Liu, Bin; Li, Chufang; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Zhao, Jin; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Yang, Zifeng",Pharmacol Res,,203

As such, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to reduce the burden of COVID-19. Several vaccines, including mRNA, vector-based vaccines, and inactivated vaccines, have been approved for emergency use in various countries. However, the slow roll-out of vaccines and insufficient global supply remains a challenge to turn the tide of the pandemic. Moreover, vaccines are important tools for preventing the disease but therapeutic tools to treat patients are also needed. As such, since the beginning of the pandemic, repurposed FDA-approved drugs have been sought as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19 due to their known safety profiles and potential anti-viral effects. One of these drugs is ivermectin (IVM), an antiparasitic drug created in the 1970s. IVM later exerted antiviral activity against various viruses including SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we delineate the story of how this antiparasitic drug was eventually identified as a potential treatment option for COVID-19. We review SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle, the role of the nucleocapsid protein, the turning points in past research that provided initial 'hints' for IVM's antiviral activity and its molecular mechanism of action- and finally, we culminate with the current clinical findings.","Wehbe, Zena; Wehbe, Maya; Iratni, Rabah; Pintus, Gianfranco; Zaraket, Hassan; Yassine, Hadi M; Eid, Ali H",Front Immunol,,203

Currently, deep learning-based SISR approaches have been widely discussed in medical image processing, because of their potential to achieve high-quality, high spatial resolution images without the cost of additional scans. However, most existing methods are designed for scale-specific SR tasks and are unable to generalise over magnification scales. In this paper, we propose an approach for medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MIASSR), in which we couple meta-learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to super-resolve medical images at any scale of magnification in (1, 4]. Compared to state-of-the-art SISR algorithms on single-modal magnetic resonance (MR) brain images (OASIS-brains) and multi-modal MR brain images (BraTS), MIASSR achieves comparable fidelity performance and the best perceptual quality with the smallest model size. We also employ transfer learning to enable MIASSR to tackle SR tasks of new medical modalities, such as cardiac MR images (ACDC) and chest computed tomography images (COVID-CT). The source code of our work is also public. Thus, MIASSR has the potential to become a new foundational pre-/post-processing step in clinical image analysis tasks such as reconstruction, image quality enhancement, and segmentation.","Zhu, Jin; Tan, Chuan; Yang, Junwei; Yang, Guang; Lio', Pietro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10738v1.pdf,203

263347,HERV-W envelope expression in blood leukocytes as a marker of disease severity of COVID-19,2021,"Background & Aims: Chronic immunosuppression is associated with increased and more severe viral infections. However, little is known about the association between immunosuppression and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our aim was to describe the clinical course of immunosuppressed autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) patients during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in Italy. Methods: Our study is a case series of AIH patients treated with immunosuppression, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 during outbreak of COVID-19. Results: Ten patients from six different hospitals in Italy were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020. Seven subjects were female (70%) and age ranged from 27 to 73 years. Before the onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all patients were taking immunosuppressive therapy for AIH, and eight of them were on biochemical remission. Two other patients had recent acute onset of their AIH, and were consequently started high-dose steroids, as per induction protocol. All patients had a respiratory syndrome and had a positive nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Five patients developed a CT-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Six subjects received a combination of antiretroviral and antimalarial drugs. In seven patients the dosage of immunosuppressive medication was changed. Liver enzymes were repeated during SARS-CoV-2 infection in all hospitalized cases; they remained within the normal range in all cases, and improved in the two acute cases treated with high-dose steroids. The clinical outcome was comparable to the reported cases occurring in non-immunosuppressed subjects. Conclusion: Patients under immunosuppressive therapy for AIH developing COVID-19 show a disease course presumptively similar to that reported in non-immunosuppressed population. These data might help medical decision when dealing with SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients.","Gerussi, Alessio; Rigamonti, Cristina; Elia, Chiara; Cazzagon, Nora; Floreani, Annarosa; Pozzi, Roberta; Pozzoni, Pietro; Claar, Ernesto; Pasulo, Luisa; Fagiuoli, Stefano; Cristoferi, Laura; Carbone, Marco; Invernizzi, Pietro",,,203

263891,COVID-19-associated delayed posthypoxic necrotizing leukoencephalopathy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Understanding how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spread within the hospital setting is essential if staff are to be adequately protected, effective infection control measures are to be implemented and nosocomial transmission is to be prevented. METHODS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the air and on environmental surfaces around hospitalised patients, with and without respiratory symptoms, was investigated. Environmental sampling was carried out within eight hospitals in England during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Samples were analysed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation assays. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 30 (8.9%) of 336 environmental surfaces. Ct values ranged from 28·8 to 39·1 equating to 2·2 x 105 to 59 genomic copies/swab. Concomitant bacterial counts were low, suggesting the cleaning performed by nursing and domestic staff across all eight hospitals was effective. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in four of 55 air samples taken <1 m from four different patients. In all cases, the concentration of viral RNA was low and ranged from <10 to 460 genomic copies per m3 of air. Infectious virus was not recovered from any of the PCR positive samples analysed. CONCLUSIONS: Effective cleaning can reduce the risk of fomite (contact) transmission but some surface types may facilitate the survival, persistence and/or dispersal of SARS-CoV-2. The presence of low or undetectable concentrations of viral RNA in the air supports current guidance on the use of specific PPE ensembles for aerosol and non-aerosol generating procedures.","Moore, Ginny; Rickard, Helen; Stevenson, David; Bou, Paz Aranega; Pitman, James; Crook, Ant; Davies, Katherine; Spencer, Antony; Burton, Chris; Easterbrook, Linda; Love, Hannah E; Summers, Sian; Welch, Stephen R; Wand, Nadina; Thompson, Katy-Anne; Pottage, Thomas; Richards, Kevin S; Dunning, Jake; Bennett, Allan",J. hosp. infect,,203

Rural exposure during undergraduate medical training is promising as a means for overcoming the shortage of physicians outside urban areas, but the effectiveness is widely unknown. This integrative review assesses the effects of rural placements during undergraduate medical training on graduates' likelihood to take up rural practice. Methods: The paper presents the results of a longitudinal review of the literature published in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar and elsewhere on the measurable effects of rural placements and internships during medical training on the number of graduates in rural practice. Results: The combined database and hand search identified 38 suitable primary studies with rather heterogeneous interventions, endpoints and results, mostly cross-sectional and control studies. The analysis of the existing evidence exhibited predominantly positive but rather weak correlations between rural placements during undergraduate medical training and later rural practice. Beyond the initial scope, the review underpinned rural upbringing to be the strongest predictor for rural practice. Conclusions: This review confirms that rural exposure during undergraduate medical training to contributes to recruitment and retention in nonurban settings. It can play a role within a broader strategy for overcoming the shortage of rural practitioners. Rural placements during medical education turned out to be particularly effective for rural-entry students. Given the increasing funding being directed towards medical schools to produce graduates that will work rurally, more robust high-quality research is needed.","Holst, Jens",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203
265553,[Multiple cerebral haemorrhages secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in a patient with COVID-19],2021,"In this commentary, we briefly summarize the available data from Iran and other countries on the sudden increase in anosmia, hyposmia, and hypogeusia that has coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic. Alarmingly, a high proportion of patients with severe COVID-19 had isolated anosmia as the sole initial presenting symptom, which is likely due to the direct neuropathic effect of the virus rather than being secondary to nasal congestion and obstruction. Since isolated anosmia is not yet considered a prerequisite for screening for COVID-19, we wish to raise awareness on the association of anosmia with COVID-19, urging international and national health authorities to consider this association in their efforts for early detection and isolation of infected individuals and for breaking the chain of transmission. We urge our colleagues who assess patients with new-onset anosmia to strictly adhere to the safety guidelines to reduce the risk of exposure and infection during this nascent pandemic.","Karimi-Galougahi, Mahboobeh; Raad, Nasim; Mikaniki, Narges",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,203
265948,Third Cranial Nerve Palsy Due to COVID-19 Infection,2021,"BACKGROUND: Available data suggest that the obstetric population is particularly vulnerable to severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, with a variable clinical course leading to severe respiratory failure. However, established early warning scores designed to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration were never validated in the obstetric population. OBJECTIVE: This retrospective cohort study sought to evaluate the initial clinical characteristics of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and to develop a pregnancy-specific early warning score to identify patients at risk for clinical deterioration and requiring advanced respiratory support. STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center, retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and December 2020. A total of 50 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April 2020 and November 2020 were used to create the prediction model. Initial clinical characteristics identified at the time of diagnosis were compared between patients who required advanced respiratory support and those who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms for those diagnosed during the period of April 2020 to November 2020. Risk factors associated with a requirement for advanced respiratory support were used to create the Obstetric Warning Score system. The Obstetric Warning Score system was then validated using 30 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in December 2020. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated to evaluate the test characteristics of the Obstetric Warning Score system compared with other scoring systems including the Early Warning Score, the National Early Warning Score 2, and the Maternal Early Warning Criteria. RESULTS: Women who required advanced respiratory support were more likely to present with dyspnea (100% vs 33.3%; P<.001), have a higher heart rate (113.4 beats per minute vs 93 beats per minute; P<.001), respiratory rate (23.5 breaths per minute vs 17.7 breaths per minute; P<.001), temperature (99.1°F vs 98.3°F; P=.004), and C-reactive protein level (7.4 mg/dL vs 2.4 mg/dL; P<.001). Furthermore, 88.2% of patients requiring advanced respiratory support showed chest x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia, compared with 20.0% of the patients not requiring advanced respiratory support (P<.001). All patients requiring advanced respiratory support presented with at least 1 coronavirus disease 2019 symptom, whereas only 51.5% of patients not requiring advanced respiratory support were symptomatic (P<.001). The Obstetrical Warning Score model allocated 1 point each for a hazard ratio of >100 beats per minute, temperature of >99.0°F, C-reactive protein level of >2.0 mg/dL, respiratory rate between 20 and 24 breaths per minute, complaints of dyspnea, and a positive chest x-ray. A respiratory rate of >24 breaths per minute was assigned 2 points. The area under the curve for the Obstetric Warning Score system was 0.97 compared with 0.72 for the Early Warning Score system, 0.92 for the National Early Warning Score 2 system, and 0.85 for the Maternal Early Warning Criteria system. An Obstetric Warning Score of &#8805;3 was predictive of a requirement for advanced respiratory support with a sensitivity of 100%, specificity 64%, and a positive predictive value of 36%. CONCLUSION: The Obstetric Warning Score system presents a validated method for providers to identify pregnant patients who are at risk for respiratory failure and a requirement for advanced respiratory support.","Yao, Ruofan; Martin, Courtney B; Haase, Victoria S; Tse, Beverly C; Nishino, Melissa; Gheorghe, Ciprian; Balli, Kevin",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,203

Summarizing the development of COVID-19 and assessing the effects of control measures are very critical to China and other countries. A logistic growth curve model was employed to compare the development of COVID-19 before and after the emergency response took effect. We found that the number of confirmed cases peaked 9-14 days after the first detection of an imported case, but there was a peak lag in the province where the outbreak was concentrated. Results of the growth curves indicated that the fitted cumulative confirmed cases were close to the actual observed cases, and the R2 of all models was above 0.95. The average growth rate decreased by 44.42% nationally and by 32.5% outside Hubei Province. The average growth rate in the 12 high-risk areas decreased by 29.9%. The average growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases decreased by approximately 50% after the emergency response. Areas with frequent population migration have a high risk of outbreak. The emergency response taken by the Chinese government was able to effectively control the COVID-19 outbreak.

(Special Section: Coronavirus.),2020,"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, adherence to suggested precautionary measures has been emphasized as important in preventing and curtailing its spread. However, strict adherence to precautionary measures can be demanding. METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial done among 1517 undergraduate dental students tested the effectiveness of 'dissonance induction' (DI) and 'assessment reactivity' (AR) in improving adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) measures as compared to a control group. At baseline, participants in the DI group were tested for their knowledge of precautionary measures, immediately followed by assessment of their adherence to them. This methodology was adapted to systematically reveal the poor adherence of the participants in their self-held cognitions, should there be any. The magnitude of dissonance was measured as the proportion of such dissonant cognitions held by an individual. In the AR group, at baseline, participants were asked about their attitudes alone toward measures. The control group was neither assessed for knowledge and adherence nor for attitudes toward the measures at baseline. Two weeks after the administration of these interventions in the DI and AR groups, the 3 study groups were assessed for adherence. RESULTS: The follow-up adherence scores in the DI group were found to be significantly higher (15.11 ± 4.1) compared to the AR (13.13 ± 2.01) and control (12.87 ± 2.97) groups as analysed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (Hâ¯=â¯243.5; P < .001). Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the adherence scores significantly improved in the DI group from baseline to follow-up (zâ¯=â¯-8.84; P < .001). Magnitude of dissonance at baseline was found to be a significant predictor of follow-up adherence scores (R2â¯=â¯0.255). CONCLUSION: This study found that DI is an easy intervention to bring an immediate and significant change in adherence to precautionary measures.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya; Lingamaneni, Krishna Prasad; Pachava, Srinivas; Baddam, Venkat Ramana Reddy; Marella, Yamuna",Int. dent. j,,203

Results indicated that more errors are made on the traditional format than on the digital format, but the errors that did occur on the digital format were on subtests that require clinical acumen. Q-interactive did not reduce errors related to more complex judgments and nuanced scoring. The participating graduate students were surveyed regarding their perceptions of each format, and they revealed a majority preference for the digital format. Training implications are discussed, and specific suggestions provided for how training programs may respond to our current situation by integrating Q-interactive into their assessment courses.","Corcoran, Stephanie",Contemp Sch Psychol,,203

269220,A Simple and Practical Scoring System for Radiosurgical Treatment in Patients with Brain Metastases,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2 demands rapid, safe and effective therapeutic options. In the last decades, the endogenous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) has emerged as modulator of several biological functions and its deficiency has been associated with different disorders. Therefore, many H2 S-releasing agents have been developed as potential therapeutic tools for diseases related with impaired H2 S production and/or activity. Some of these compounds are in advanced clinical trials. Presently, the pivotal role of H2 S in modulating the inflammatory response and pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade is well recognized, and the usefulness of some H2 S-donors for the treatment of acute lung inflammation has been reported. Recent data is elucidating several mechanisms of action, which may account for antiviral effects of H2 S. Noteworthy, some preliminary clinical results suggest an inverse relationship between endogenous H2 S levels and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, repurposing of H2 S-releasing drugs may be a potential therapeutic opportunity for treatment of COVID-19.

269895,"Trends, predictors and outcomes of cerebrovascular disease amongst patients with thrombotic microangiopathy",2021,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), although most commonly demonstrates respiratory symptoms, but there is a growing set of evidence reporting its correlation with the digestive tract and faeces. Interestingly, recent studies have shown the association of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with gastrointestinal symptoms in infected patients but any sign of respiratory issues. Moreover, some studies have also shown that the presence of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in the faeces of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, the pathophysiology of digestive symptoms associated with COVID-19 has raised a critical need for comprehensive investigative efforts. To address this issue we have developed a bioinformatics pipeline involving a system biological framework to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA expression on deciphering its association with digestive symptoms in COVID-19 positive patients. Using two RNA-seq datasets derived from COVID-19 positive patients with celiac (CEL), Crohn's (CRO) and ulcerative colitis (ULC) as digestive disorders, we have found a significant overlap between the sets of differentially expressed genes from SARS-CoV-2 exposed tissue and digestive tract disordered tissues, reporting 7, 22 and 13 such overlapping genes, respectively. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis, comprehensive analyses of protein-protein interaction network, gene regulatory network, protein-chemical agent interaction network revealed some critical association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the presence of digestive disorders. The infectome, diseasome and comorbidity analyses also discover the influences of the identified signature genes in other risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 infection to human health. We hope the findings from this pathogenetic analysis may reveal important insights in deciphering the complex interplay between COVID-19 and digestive disorders and underpins its significance in therapeutic development strategy to combat against COVID-19 pandemic.","Nashiry, Md Asif; Sumi, Shauli Sarmin; Sharif Shohan, Mohammad Umer; Alyami, Salem A; Azad, A K M; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Brief. bioinform,,203

Better characterization of re-positive cases is urgently needed. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained through Guangdong's COVID-19 surveillance network. Neutralization antibody titre was determined using microneutralization assays. Potential infectivity of clinical samples was evaluated by cell inoculation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected using three different RT-PCR kits and multiplex PCR with nanopore sequencing. FINDINGS: Among 619 discharged COVID-19 cases, 87 re-tested as SARS-CoV-2 positive in circumstances of social isolation. All re-positive cases had mild or moderate symptoms at initial diagnosis and were younger on average (median, 28). Re-positive cases (n = 59) exhibited similar neutralization antibodies (NAbs) titre distributions to other COVID-19 cases (n = 218) tested here. No infectious strain could be obtained by culture and no full-length viral genomes could be sequenced from re-positive cases. INTERPRETATION: Re-positive SARS-CoV-2 cases do not appear to be caused by active reinfection and were identified in ~14% of discharged cases. A robust NAb response and potential virus genome degradation were detected in almost all re-positive cases, suggesting a substantially lower transmission risk, especially through respiratory routes.","Lu, Jing; Peng, Jinju; Xiong, Qianling; Liu, Zhe; Lin, Huifang; Tan, Xiaohua; Kang, Min; Yuan, Runyu; Zeng, Lilian; Zhou, Pingping; Liang, Chumin; Yi, Lina; du Plessis, Louis; Song, Tie; Ma, Wenjun; Sun, Jiufeng; Pybus, Oliver G; Ke, Changwen",EBioMedicine,,203

We critically evaluate the studies performed in nonhuman primates, ex vivo organ culture ocular models, stem cell derived eye organoids and the differences in infection efficiency observed in different parts of human ocular surface epithelium. Finally, we highlight the additional work that needs to be carried out to understand the immune response of the ocular surface to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be translated into prophylactic treatments that may be applied to other organ systems.","Armstrong, Lyle; Collin, Joseph; Mostafa, Islam; Queen, Rachel; Figueiredo, Francisco C; Lako, Majlinda",Stem Cells Transl Med,,203

Here, we describe a case of a 59-year-old male with severe COVID-19 infection who developed severe encephalopathy, which persisted well after his acute infection had subsided and had begun to improve from his respiratory dysfunction. He was found to have diffuse leukoencephalopathy with concomitant diffusion restriction on MR imaging. This case represents a delayed onset of leukoencephalopathy secondary to hypoxia in a small but growing cohort of COVID-related leukoencephalopathy due to similarities in imaging features and lack of superior alternate diagnosis.

279612,"COVID-19 pneumonia: current evidence of chest imaging features, evolution and prognosis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric septic arthritis, although a rare diagnosis in the developed world, remains a significant challenge in the New Zealand population. In recent years, there has been effort to characterize the nature of paediatric bone and joint infection for New Zealand due to rising incidence of osteomyelitis and staphylococcal sepsis [1, 2]. We have sought to identify trends in presentation, diagnosis and management of paediatric septic arthritis, with added focus on ethnicity and access to healthcare. METHODS: A ten year retrospective review of all cases < 16 years with presumed septic arthritis presenting to a tertiary referral centre between 2008 and 2018 was performed. RESULTS: A total of 103 cases met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 5.9 years (SD +/- 4.17) with a male predominance (64%). Traditional laboratory culture method isolated an organism in 66% of cases: Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen identified (61%). Incidence varied greatly by ethnicity 1:16,000 for NZ European children; 1:8760 for Pacifica and 1:4300 for Maori. Mean distance travelled by patients to reach the nearest emergency department was 38.3 km, ranging from 2 to 188 km. Assessment using NZ deprivation scores showed the Maori paediatric population were likely to reside in areas of worse socioeconomic deprivation (p = 0.0005). The majority (66%) of cases were treated surgically with a low recurrence rate (2.9%). Delayed presentation was associated with worse outcomes and more likely in patients residing > 20 km away from the nearest emergency department. CONCLUSION: The incidence of paediatric septic arthritis in New Zealand is concerningly high within Maori and Pacific populations. Future health interventions should consider environmental, socioeconomic, and microbiological trends in the burden of disease.","Hunter, Sarah; Baker, Joseph F",Int. orthop,,203

Patients in the arbidol + LH group received 200âmg of arbidol and 1400âmg of LH per 8âhour, and the arbidol group was given 200âmg arbidol per 8âhour. Blood routine examination, blood biochemistry detection, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, and chest CT scans were performed to evaluate the clinical effects between the 2 groups.No statistically significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of preoperative characteristics including the baseline characteristics, laboratory indicators, and chest CT. On day 7 after admission, patients in the arbidol + LH group showed a higher level of Lymphocytes count, and a lower level of serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein levels (Pâ<â.05). Moreover, the median time from admission to the first negative result of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection was shorter in the arbidol + LH group (Pâ<â.05). Analysis based on CT scan results showed a better extinction of lung inflammation in the arbidol + LH group. No apparent side effects were found in both groups. No patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) treatment.Arbidol combined with LH treatment may be more effective in improving the prognosis and accelerating the SARS-CoV-2 clearance in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Lei; Shi, Feng; Tu, Pei; Chen, Chen; Zhang, Ming; Li, Xiaoguang; Li, Chang",Medicine (Baltimore),,203

280546,Inhaled corticosteroid is not associated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19,2021,"Children and young people with asthma need regular monitoring to maintain good asthma control, prevent asthma attacks and manage comorbidities. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in healthcare professionals making fundamental changes to the way healthcare is delivered and for patients and families adapting to these changes. Comprehensive remotely delivered, technology-based healthcare, closer to the patients home (reducing hospital footfall and possibly reducing carbon footprint) is likely to be one of the important collateral effects of the pandemic. Telemedicine is anticipated to impact everyone involved in healthcare - providers and patients alike. It is going to bring changes to organization, work areas and work culture in healthcare. Healthcare providers, policymakers and those accessing healthcare services will experience the impact of technology-based healthcare delivery. Telemedicine can play an exciting role in the management of childhood asthma by delivering high-quality care closer to the child's home. However, unlike adults, children still need to be accompanied by their carers for virtual care. Policymakers will need to take into account potential additional costs as well as the legal, ethical and cultural implications of large scale use of telemedicine. In this narrative review, we review evidence regarding the role of telemedicine and related emerging technologies in paediatric and adolescent asthma. Although there are gaps in the current knowledge, there is evidence demonstrating the important role of telemedicine in management of childhood and adolescent asthma.

Previous researches have shown that short-term mechanical stretch induces stem cell proliferation through activating the predominant transcription factor YAP, and YAP is a critical modulator in controlling epidermal proliferation. However, our study finds that after this phase, the cell growth arrest appears which is induced by long-term mechanical stretch. In the interfollicular epidermal stem cells (IFESCs) undergoing long-term mechanical stretch in vivo and in vitro, the level of H3K27me3 and its histone methyltransferase EZH2 are significantly elevated with suppressed expression of the target genes of YAP. EZH2 forms repressive H3K27me3 that suppresses gene transcription. Small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 rescues significantly the cell growth arrest in IFESCs induced by long-term mechanical stretch, thus promoting epidermal proliferation in vivo again. These findings reveal that there is an unexpected correlation between stem cell proliferation and the duration of mechanical stretch regulated by EZH2. This study of long-term mechanical stretch that induces the cell growth arrest provides a strategy for clinical translation to promote skin regeneration.","Wang, Jing; Zhang, Yifan; Gao, Ya; Shan, Shengzhou; Li, Qingfeng",J. invest. dermatol,,203

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, educators tweeted using various pandemic-related Twitter hashtags. In this study, we analyze data from two such hashtags: #remoteteaching and #remotelearning. We first data mined more than 36,000 tweets and then analyzed a random sample of 1,148 tweets and the accounts which sent those tweets. Our results suggest that the hashtags functioned as spaces in which a variety of education stakeholders engaged in activities that included knowledge sharing, social sharing, and information broadcasting. Alongside and sometimes entangled with such sharing, there was also a great deal of self-promotion. We discuss how these spaces appeared to offer potential benefits to educators navigating the transition to remote teaching but also consider how the presence of self-promotion may suggest downsides to such social mediums. We conclude with implications of these findings for education stakeholders and future research.","Carpenter, Jeffrey P.; Trust, Torrey Kimmons Royce Krutka Daniel G.",Computers and Education Open,,203

This has led to widespread testing that interrupted the supply chain for testing materials around the world. A prospective study was conducted to compare inexpensive and easily sourced 3-dimensionally (3D)-printed polylactic acid and polyester nasopharyngeal swabs to commercially manufactured swabs for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the study period, 287 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at multiple stages of their illness, were enrolled. The median age for the study population was 47.6 years (interquartile range [IQR], 34.4 to 56.6 years), and two-thirds (67.6%) of the subjects were male. The median duration of hospitalization, at the time of sampling, was 13 days (IQR, 10 to 16 days). Overall concordance between the prototype and control swabs was 80.8% (Cohen's kappa coefficient, 0.61). Most discrepant results were due to prototype-positive control-negative results. When considering all positive results to be true positives, the prototype swab had a higher sensitivity (90.6% versus 80.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 85.7% to 94.0% and 74.7% to 85.7%, respectively; P < 0.015). The cost to produce the prototype swab was estimated to be $0.05 per swab. Polylactic acid 3D-printed polyester-tipped swabs were shown to be effective for nasopharyngeal sample collection. We believe that this design can easily be adopted in countries where commercial swabs are not readily available and can play a vital role in public health efforts for disease control in low-income countries.","Alghounaim, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al Youha, Sarah; Papenburg, Jesse; Alowaish, Osama; AbdulHussain, Ghadeer; Al-Shemali, Rawan; Albuloushi, Ahmad; Alzabin, Saud; Al-Wogayan, Khaled; Al-Mutawa, Yousef; Al-Sabah, Salman",J. clin. microbiol,,203

Methods included an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is examining the effect of pain education combined with exercise on pain in patients with chronic Achilles tendinopathy. We hypothesized that a biopsychosocial approach to patient education would reduce movement-evoked pain more than standard care (biomedical education and exercise). Since March 2020, challenges have included a temporary halt of in-person human subjects research, adapting virtual screening procedures to maintain confidentiality and safety, need to obtain telehealth license in multiple states, inability to use specialized laboratory equipment to evaluate secondary outcomes, and gradual resumption of in-person visits with PPE. As COVID-19 prevented the trial from proceeding as planned, we adapted our design to both exploit new opportunities and maintain high standards of transparency and rigor. We maintained study enrollment by modifying screening, evaluation, and treatment to accommodate virtual participation with consistent content. We adjusted our aims to include an a priori hypothesis that differential effects of a biopsychosocial versus biomedical approach on pain may be magnified during a pandemic. Additionally, strategies developed to adapt to an altered research-environment may be useful tools for future RCTs to facilitate participant recruitment and retention. We logged changes in a time-stamped manner on Open Science Framework;full disclosure will be ensured in final reports at Clinicaltrials.gov and publications. Adaptive designs are at risk of low confidence unless full transparency is integrated into research processes.

App-based contact tracing has the potential to optimize the resources of overstretched public health departments. However, its efficiency is dependent on widespread adoption. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the uptake of the Australian Government's COVIDSafe app among Australians and examine the reasons why some Australians have not downloaded the app. METHODS: An online national survey, with representative quotas for age and gender, was conducted between May 8 and May 11, 2020. Participants were excluded if they were a health care professional or had been tested for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 (16.0%) were excluded prior to completing the survey, 13 (0.7%) declined, and 1500 (83.2%) participated in the survey. Of the 1500 survey participants, 37.3% (n=560) had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 18.7% (n=280) intended to do so, 27.7% (n=416) refused to do so, and 16.3% (n=244) were undecided. Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (165/660, 25.0%) and technical concerns (159/660, 24.1%). Other reasons included the belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app was unnecessary (111/660, 16.8%), distrust in the government (73/660, 11.1%), and other miscellaneous responses (eg, apathy and following the decisions of others) (73/660, 11.1%). In addition, knowledge about COVIDSafe varied among participants, as some were confused about its purpose and capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of citizens, specifically privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of contact tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives, such as downloading and correctly using contact tracing apps.","Thomas, Rae; Michaleff, Zoe A; Greenwood, Hannah; Abukmail, Eman; Glasziou, Paul",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,203

285039,Kennedy's disease: an under-recognized motor neuron disorder,2020,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda inclusive, implemented lockdowns, curfew, banning of both private and public transport systems, and mass gatherings to minimize spread. Social control measures for COVID-19 are reported to increase violence and discrimination globally, including in Uganda as some may be difficult to implement resulting in the heavy deployment of law enforcement. Media reports indicated that cases of violence and discrimination had increased in Uganda's communities following the lockdown. We estimated the incidence and factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination among Ugandans during the COVID-19 lockdown to inform control and prevention measures. METHODS: In April 2020, we conducted a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data under the International Citizen Project (ICP) to assess adherence to public health measures and their impact on the COVID-19 outbreak in Uganda. We analyzed data on violence and discrimination from the ICP study. We performed descriptive statistics for all the participants' characteristics and created a binary outcome variable called experiencing violence and/or discrimination. We performed logistic regression analysis to identify the factors associated with experiencing violence and discrimination. RESULTS: Of the 1726 ICP study participants, 1051 (58.8%) were males, 841 (48.7%) were currently living with a spouse or partner, and 376 (21.8%) had physically attended work for more than 3 days in the past week. Overall, 145 (8.4%) experienced any form of violence and/or discrimination by any perpetrator, and 46 (31.7%) of the 145 reported that it was perpetrated by a law enforcement officer. Factors associated with experiencing violence or discrimination were: being male (AOR = 1.60 CI:1.10-2.33), having attended work physically for more than 3 days in the past week (AOR = 1.52 CI:1.03-2.23), and inability to access social or essential health services since the epidemic started (AOR = 3.10 CI:2.14-4.50). CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of Ugandan residents experienced violence and/or discrimination during the COVID-19 lockdown, mostly perpetrated by law enforcement officers. We recommend mitigation of the collateral impact of lockdowns with interventions that focus on improving policing quality, ensuring continuity of essential services, and strengthening support systems for vulnerable groups including males.","Katana, Elizabeth; Amodan, Bob Omoda; Bulage, Lilian; Ario, Alex R; Fodjo, Joseph Nelson Siewe; Colebunders, Robert; Wanyenze, Rhoda K",BMC Public Health,,203

Allotransplantation is the most promising approach for treatment particularly for its cost-effective and exact curative potential. Herein our aim was to evaluate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A allele matching effect on clinical improvement and graft survival after parathyroid transplantation. We performed parathyroid transplantation between ABO/Rh compatible recipient and an unrelated donor who has chronic kidney disease. Preoperative immunological tests include panel reactive antibody, T-flow cytometry crossmatch, B-flow cytometry crossmatch, autoflow cytometry crossmatch, and complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch tests were performed. After histopathological evaluation, half of the resected parathyroid gland cells were isolated and transplanted to the omentum surface by laparoscopy. The transplantation outcome was followed up throughout 382 days. The recipient discharged 2 days after transplantation without any complication. During follow-up, calcium and vitamin D supplementation reduced to a one-third dose; even the intact PTH levels remained low. However, clinical improvement was observed by serum calcium levels. The recipient still continues with low-dose supplementation after 382 days of post-transplantation. Parathyroid cell transplantation to the omental tissue is the most promising option even with only one allele matching for patients with using lifelong high-dose supplementation. Clinical improvements and long-term effect of HLA-A allele matching should be evaluated with more studies and in larger cohorts as well.","Goncu, Beyza; Salepcioglu Kaya, Harika; Yucesan, Emrah; Ersoy, Yeliz Emine; Akcakaya, Adem",J Investig Med,,203

OBJECTIVE: To characterize inpatient adaptations to care for non-ICU COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: A network of 72 hospital medicine groups at US academic centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: COVID-19 testing, approaches to personal protective equipment (PPE), and features of respiratory isolation units (RIUs). RESULTS: Fifty-one of 72 sites responded (71%) between April 3 and April 5, 2020. At the time of our survey, only 15 (30%) reported COVID-19 test results being available in less than 6 hours. Half of sites with PPE data available reported PPE stockpiles of 2 weeks or less. Nearly all sites (90%) reported implementation of RIUs. RIUs primarily utilized attending physicians, with few incorporating residents and none incorporating students. Isolation and room-entry policies focused on grouping care activities and utilizing technology (such as video visits) to communicate with and evaluate patients. The vast majority of sites reported decreases in frequency of in-room encounters across provider or team types. Forty-six percent of respondents reported initially unrecognized non-COVID-19 diagnoses in patients admitted for COVID-19 evaluation; a similar number reported delayed identification of COVID-19 in patients admitted for other reasons. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has required medical wards to rapidly adapt with expanding use of RIUs and use of technology emerging as critical approaches.

Orf9b is a unique accessory protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. It is implicated in immune evasion by targeting mitochondria, where it associates with the versatile adapter TOM70. Here, we determined the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 orf9b in complex with the cytosolic segment of human TOM70 to 2.2 Å. A central portion of orf9b occupies the deep pocket in the TOM70 C-terminal domain (CTD) and adopts a helical conformation strikingly different from the ß-sheet-rich structure of the orf9b homodimer. Interactions between orf9b and TOM70 CTD are primarily hydrophobic and distinct from the electrostatic interaction between the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) EEVD motif and the TOM70 N-terminal domain (NTD). Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that the orf9b dimer does not bind TOM70, but a synthetic peptide harboring a segment of orf9b (denoted C-peptide) binds TOM70 with nanomolar KD. While the interaction between C-peptide and TOM70 CTD is an endothermic process, the interaction between Hsp90 EEVD and TOM70 NTD is exothermic, which underscores the distinct binding mechanisms at NTD and CTD pockets. Strikingly, the binding affinity of Hsp90 EEVD motif to TOM70 NTD is reduced by ~29-fold when orf9b occupies the pocket of TOM70 CTD, supporting the hypothesis that orf9b allosterically inhibits the Hsp90/TOM70 interaction. Our findings shed light on the mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2 orf9b mediated suppression of interferon responses.","Gao, Xiaopan; Zhu, Kaixiang; Qin, Bo; Olieric, Vincent; Wang, Meitian; Cui, Sheng",Nat Commun,,203

288839,Impact of Covid-19 infection in high-risk coronary patients,2021,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health authorities in India presented a contradictory picture between their role in assisting the state to mitigate the global crisis and dealing coercively with the needs of its diverse populations. Conventionally, public health is viewed as an evidence-based profession that is above politics. Yet national responses to COVID-19 in India reveal the embeddedness of health and illnesses in the larger politics of the state. Although it is still early to assess the full spectrum of damage caused by lack of central-level planning, this article argues against COVID-19 being viewed as a 'great leveller'. Rather, it suggests that we inhabit somatic societies that regularly employ the vocabulary of pathology/disease to determine social health. Moreover, the Indian experience illustrates how, even during a pandemic, 'social distancing' is not an apolitical notion. It becomes a measure for the state to co-opt scientific interventions of risk mitigation and relay them to people as a metaphor for exclusion: thereby exacerbating deeper structural inequities around which access to health and well-being of the population is organised.","Rahman, Sabina Yasmin",Health Sociol Rev,,203

Demand for online learning has surged during a period of mass layoffs and transition to remote work and schooling. Can this uptake in online learning help close longstanding skills gaps in the US workforce in a sustainable and equitable manner? We answer this question by analyzing individual engagement data of DataCamp users between October 2019 and September 2020 (n = 277,425). Exploiting the staggered adoption of actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across states, we identify the causal effect at the neighborhood level. The adoption of nonessential business closures led to a 38% increase in new users and a 6% increase in engagement among existing users. We find that these increases are proportional across higher- and lower-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with a high or low share of Black residents. This demonstrates the potential for online platforms to democratize access to knowledge and skills that are in high demand, which supports job security and facilitates social mobility.","Kizilcec, Rene F; Makridis, Christos A; Sadowski, Katharine C",Proc.

We found that 93% were satisfied with using Zoom, with 18% showing high satisfaction. We see this technology as a good add-on to face-to-face teaching, as it allows participation of residents posted away from teaching hospitals, and that this method of instruction should be kept as we move past the pandemic and its restrictions. We also see this as an alternative to the use of scanned digital slides, as not all teaching centers have a digital slide scanner, in addition to the issues of viewing restriction and storage of digital slides that need to be considered.","Tang, Po Yin; New, Lee May; Leow, Wei Qiang",Proc.

291579,Herpes zoster following COVID-19: a report of three cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) is a surgical emergency with an operative mortality of up to 30%, a rate which has not changed meaningfully in over two decades. A growing body of research has highlighted several comorbidities and presenting factors in which delay or permanent deferral of surgery may be considered; however, modern comprehensive summative reviews are lacking. The urgency and timing of this review are underscored by significant challenges in resource utilization posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an update on the current understanding of risk assessment, surgical candidacy, and operative timing in patients with ATAAD. METHODS: A literature search was conducted through PubMed and Embase databases to identify relevant studies relating to risk assessment in ATAAD. Articles were selected via group consensus based on quality and relevance. RESULTS: Several patient factors have been identified which increase risk in ATAAD repair. In particular, frailty, advanced age, prior cardiac surgery, and use of novel anticoagulant medications have been studied. The understanding of malperfusion syndromes has also expanded significantly, including recommendations for surgical delay. Finally, approaches to triage have been significantly influenced by resource limitations related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While medical management remains a reasonable option in carefully selected patients at prohibitive risk for open surgery, endovascular therapies for treatment of ATAAD are rapidly evolving. CONCLUSIONS: Early surgical repair remains the preferred treatment for most patients with ATAAD, however, improvements in risk stratification should guide appropriate delay or permanent deferral of surgery in select individuals.","Sabe, Ashraf A; Percy, Edward; Kaneko, Tsuyoshi; Plichta, Ryan P; Hughes, G Chad",Ann. thorac. surg,,203

The current absence of antiviral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, might be largely due to the underuse of nanotechnologies. Elucidating the interface between nanoparticles and coronaviruses is timely, but presents the only route to the rational design of precisely targeted therapeutics for coronavirus infections.

292839,Reply: transcatheter aortic valve implantation during COVID-19 pandemic: The device also matters,2020,"BACKGROUND: Treatment recommendations for patients with penetrating abdominal injury are well established. Trauma victims with clear indications for surgery, should undergo immediate operative intervention without any delay or additional imaging. However, the optimal time for surgery remains unclear. There are some significant advantages in preoperative abdominal CT, including gathering essential information regarding a few difficult to reach anatomical areas, avoiding unnecessary explorations associated with increased morbidity and assessing the existence of extra-abdominal injuries that may have non-expectable impact on initial therapeutic plan. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of ""time-to-surgery"" on final medical outcomes in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma with normal blood pressure on admission. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using the Israeli National Trauma Registry was conducted from 2000- 2018. This study included trauma patients with penetrating injuries and a systolic blood pressure of 90mmHg or above on admission. All patients included in the study were divided into three groups according to the time that lapsed from their admission to surgery: half an hour, an hour, and two hours. We assessed the outcome for each patient, including length of hospital stay, need for intensive care and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test, ANOVA test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The study included 1,136 penetrating trauma patients. Among these, 78.0% (886) had sustained low-energy penetrating injury (SWPI) and 22.0% (250) had sustained high-energy penetrating injury (FAPI). Males accounted for 93.5% (1,062) of the patients. Mean age was 30.4. About 29% (327) of all the patients underwent surgery within 30 minutes from admission, 42% (475) within 30-60 min, and 29% (334) patients were operated within one to two hours. Patients who underwent surgery within 30 minutes, had worse ISS and GCS scores and were, therefore, more likely to have worse clinical outcomes. No other differences in outcomes were found in patients who were operated upon within 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Time to surgery within two hours from admission has no impact on final outcomes in trauma patients with penetrating injury and normal blood pressure on admission.","Hershkovitz, Y; Bodas, M; Givon, A; Kessel, B",Injury,,203

COVID-19 patients show mild, moderate or severe symptoms with the latter ones requiring access to specialized intensive care. SARS-CoV-2 infections, pathogenesis and progression have not been clearly elucidated yet, thus forcing the development of many complementary approaches to identify candidate cellular pathways involved in disease progression. Host lipids play a critical role in the virus life, being the double-membrane vesicles a key factor in coronavirus replication. Moreover, lipid biogenesis pathways affect receptor-mediated virus entry at the endosomal cell surface and modulate virus propagation. In this study, targeted lipidomic analysis coupled with proinflammatory cytokines and alarmins measurement were carried out in serum of COVID-19 patients characterized by different severity degree. Serum IL-26, a cytokine involved in IL-17 pathway, TSLP and adiponectin were measured and correlated to lipid COVID-19 patient profiles.

However, it is also crucial for clinicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza viruses. METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Two groups of COVID-19 patients (n=57) and influenza A patients (n=59) were enrolled. We analyzed and compared their clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics and treatments. RESULTS: The proportions of cough (70.2%), fever (54.4%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (14.1%) in COVID-19 patients were lower than those of influenza A patients (98.3%, P<0.001; 84.7%, P<0.001; and 35.6%, P=0.007; respectively). In addition, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower levels of leukocytes (7.87 vs. 9.89×109L-1, P=0.027), neutrophils (2.43 vs. 5.16×109L-1, P<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP; 3.7 vs. 15.1mg/L, P=0.001) and procalcitonin (PCT; 0.09 vs. 0.68mm/h, P<0.001), while lymphocyte levels (4.58 vs. 3.56×109L-1; P=0.006) were significantly higher compared with influenza A patients. In terms of CT imaging, ground-glass opacification in chest CT was more common in COVID-19 patients than in influenza A patients (42.1% vs. 15%, P=0.032). In contrast, consolidation was more common in influenza A patients (25%) than in COVID-19 patients (5.2%, P=0.025). CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations and laboratory tests of COVID-19 children are milder than those of influenza A children under 5 years. Additionally, imaging results more commonly presented as ground-glass opacities in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Ying; Wang, Haizhou; Wang, Fan; Du, Hui; Liu, Xueru; Chen, Peng; Wang, Yanli; Lu, Xiaoxia",Int J Infect Dis,,203
293806,A Plea Not to Forget Infective Endocarditis in COVID-19 Era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This was a non-systematic review of the literature on the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: Searches in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles made available in 2020, using the terms ""diagnosis"" OR ""diagnostic"" OR ""diagnostic tests"" OR ""tests"" AND ""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"" in the title. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Tests for the etiological agent identify genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 or humoral responses to it. The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of viral genome targets by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory tract materials during the first week of symptoms. Serological tests should be indicated from the second week of symptoms onwards. A wide range of different tests is available, with variable sensitivity and specificity, most of which require validation. Laboratory tests such as complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, clotting tests, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and procalcitonin identify risk of disease with greater severity, thromboembolic complications, myocardial damage, and/or worse prognosis. Imaging tests may be useful for diagnosis, especially when there is a compatible clinical picture, and other tests presented negative results or were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of genetic material of the virus by RT-PCR is the gold standard test, but its sensitivity is not satisfactory. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be based on clinical data, epidemiological history, tests for etiological diagnosis, and tests to support the diagnosis of the disease and/or its complications. New diagnostic methods with higher sensitivity and specificity, as well as faster results, are necessary.","Goudouris, Ekaterini S",,,203

It has been speculated that use of pioglitazone might increase such risk. The aim of our brief commentary is to review the safety of pioglitazone in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till May 15, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Medications, including pioglitazone, that upregulate tissue expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), might have a dual role in COVID-19; on the one hand they might increase risk of infection as SARS-CoV2 uses ACE2 as a coreceptor to enter alveolar cells, but on the other hand, by reducing angiotensin II levels, they can protect against acute lung injury. There is no evidence to date that pioglitazone upregulates ACE2 in the alveolar cells; rather, there is evidence from animal studies of upregulation of ACE2 in insulin sensitive tissues, which might have a protective effect on lung injury. Moreover by moderating the exaggerated host proinflammatory response, pioglitazone can potentially reduce SARS-CoV-2 driven hyperinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Pioglitazone has more potential for benefit than harm, and can be continued in people with T2DM and mild/moderate COVID-19, unless there are specific contraindications for its use.

This prospective study included 75 patients who completed a patient-reported outcome questionnaire. Among these, 46 patients completed an olfactory evaluation based on the duration of anosmia and dysgeusia. The olfactory evaluation revealed that 24% (Nâ¯=â¯18) of patients had mild hyposmia, 13% (Nâ¯=â¯10) had moderate hyposmia, 30% (Nâ¯=â¯23) had severe hyposmia, 32% (Nâ¯=â¯24) had anosmia, and 100% had dysgeusia (Nâ¯=â¯75). The viral load significantly decreased throughout the 17â¯days following the onset of the olfactory disorder. The purpose of this study was to understand whether patients with COVID-19 can recover olfactory and gustatory function, in contrast to patients with other rhinoviruses and inflammatory diseases such as rhinosinusitis chronic and rhinosinusitis with polyps. These preliminary clinical findings indicate that the relatively rapid recovery of olfactory and gustative function can mean a resolution of viral infection in most patients. The present study suggests that coronavirus can induce olfactory dysfunction but not permanent damage. Olfactory and gustatory functional impairment has been recognized as a hallmark of COVID-19 and may be an important predictor of clinical outcome. Our study supports the need to add anosmia and dysgeusia to the list of symptoms used in screening tools for possible COVID-19 infection.","Paolo, Gamba",Med Hypotheses,,203

A great percentage of patients with this disease developed symptoms of dry cough, malaise, and a high fever. During this time, several patients requiring assessment and treatment of endodontic emergencies were directed to the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. We examined the characteristics of these patients. METHODS: A total of 96 patients with a mean age of 42.24 ± 18.32 years visited the general and emergency department of the School and Hospital of Stomatology at Wuhan University because of endodontic emergencies during the peak period of February 22 to March 2, 2020. Patient information was collected and organized by date of visit, sex, age, and systemic disease history. Body temperature was measured and acquired for each patient, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemiologic investigation questionnaire was given to each patient, an endodontic diagnosis was determined for the offending tooth, and a verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) was used to record pain levels. RESULTS: Of the total patient visits during this period, 50.26% of visits were for endodontic treatment. No patients had a fever (>37.2°C). One patient with a confirmed COVID-19 history was admitted after recovery. Three admitted patients had been exposed to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients. Twelve admitted patients (12.5%) with a mean age of 62.42 ± 13.77 years had a history of systemic diseases. The most common age group for endodontic emergencies was 45-64 years (30.21%), and patients of this group showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score compared with that of the 6- to 19-year age group and the 20- to 34-year age group (P < .05). The majority of endodontic emergency diagnoses were diseases of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (53.10%). Patients who were diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, symptomatic apical periodontitis, and acute apical abscess showed a significantly higher mean VNRS score than that of other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Endodontic emergencies, with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis being the most common, consist of a much higher proportion of dental emergencies in a COVID-19 high-risk area than normally. Vital pulp therapy can advantageously reduce treatment time, resulting in a reduced risk of infection for vital pulp cases. Rubber dams, personal protective equipment, and patient screening are of great importance during the COVID-19 outbreak in protecting clinicians.","Yu, Jingjing; Zhang, Tian; Zhao, Dan; Haapasalo, Markus; Shen, Ya",J Endod,,203

298462,Analysis of factors affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and viral shedding duration,2020,"2020 in the United States was marked by two converging crises-the COVID-19 pandemic and the large-scale uprisings in support of Black lives. These crises were met with both a counterproductive and inadequate response from the federal government. We examine these converging crises at the individual, social, and political scales. The biological realities of COVID-19 impact different populations in widely varied ways-the poor, the elderly, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and those living with comorbidities get sick and die at the highest rates. Social distancing guidelines shifted millions of people to work-from-home and millions more lost their jobs, even as care laborers, preponderantly women, Black, Indigenous, and people of color, were asked to put their and their loved ones' lives on the line for the continuation of all of our lives. These biological, social, and economic crises have been punctuated by civil unrest, as millions took to the streets for racial justice, noting the unequal impacts of the pandemic. These converging crises have laid bare decades of neoliberal and neoconservative policies and ideologies, undergirded as they have been by racial capitalism, for their fundamental uncaringness. In this paper, we argue that this pandemic not only made a wider population more acutely aware of the necessity and importance of the need to care and for caring labors, but also that we stand at the precipice of potentiality--of producing a more caring society. To frame our argument, we draw on Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock's (1987) framework of three bodies-individual, social, and political-to unpack the multi-scalar entanglements in the differential impacts of COVID-19, questions of care, and their articulation in the current political-economic context.","Lopez, Patricia J; Neely, Abigail H",Soc Sci Med,,203
299015,Challenges and opportunities in telerheumatology in the COVID-19 era. Response to: 'Online management of rheumatoid arthritis during COVID-19 pandemic' by Zhang et al,2020,"BACKGROUNDSARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 through direct lysis of infected lung epithelial cells, which releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu causing systemic inflammation. Anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents have shown limited therapeutic efficacy. Soluble CD24 (CD24Fc) is able to blunt the broad inflammatory response induced by DAMPs in multiple models. A recent randomized phase III trial evaluating the impact of CD24Fc in patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated encouraging clinical efficacy. METHODSWe studied peripheral blood samples obtained from patients enrolled at a single institution in the SAC-COVID trial (NCT04317040) collected before and after treatment with CD24Fc or placebo. We performed high dimensional spectral flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and measured the levels of a broad array of cytokines and chemokines. A systems analytical approach was used to discern the impact of CD24Fc treatment on immune homeostasis in patients with COVID-19. FINDINGSTwenty-two patients were enrolled, and the clinical characteristics from the CD24Fc vs. placebo groups were matched. Using high-content spectral flow cytometry and network-level analysis, we found systemic hyper-activation of multiple cellular compartments in the placebo group, including CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD56+ NK cells. By contrast, CD24Fc-treated patients demonstrated blunted systemic inflammation, with a return to homeostasis in both NK and T cells within days without compromising the ability of patients to mount an effective anti-Spike protein antibody response. A single dose of CD24Fc significantly attenuated induction of the systemic cytokine response, including expression of IL-10 and IL-15, and diminished the coexpression and network connectivity among extensive circulating inflammatory cytokines, the parameters associated with COVID-19 disease severity. INTERPRETATIONOur data demonstrates that CD24Fc treatment rapidly down-modulates systemic inflammation and restores immune homeostasis in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, supporting further development of CD24Fc as a novel therapeutic against severe COVID-19.

Learning from the successes as well as the failures of the pandemic response provides some guidance. We apply several recommendations of a recent World Health Organization Policy Brief on COVID-19 response to 5 key areas of public health systems - governance, information, services, determinants, and capacity - to suggest early lessons from the coronavirus pandemic for climate change preparedness. COVID-19 has demonstrated how essential public health is to well-functioning human societies and how high the economic cost of an unprepared health system can be.

Despite the scientific community's efforts to investigate the COVID-19 disease, a drug for effectively treating or curing patients yet needs to be discovered. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiating into immune cells for defense express COVID-19 entry receptors, and COVID-19 infection hinders their differentiation. The importance of purinergic signaling in HSC differentiation and innate immunity has been recognized. The metabotropic P2Y14 receptor subtype, activated by UDP-glucose, controls HSC differentiation and mobilization. Thereon, the exacerbated activation of blood immune cells amplifies the inflammatory state observed in COVID-19 patients, specially through the continuous release of reactive oxygen species and extracellular neutrophil traps (NETs). Further, the P2Y14 subtype, robustly inhibits the infiltration of neutrophils into various epithelial tissues, including lungs and kidneys. Here we discuss findings suggesting that antagonism of the P2Y14 receptor could prevent the progression of COVID-19-induced systemic inflammation, which often leads to severe illness and death cases. Considering the modulation of neutrophil recruitment of extreme relevance for respiratory distress and lung failure prevention, we propose that P2Y14 receptor inhibition by its selective antagonist PPTN could limit neutrophil recruitment and NETosis, hence limiting excessive formation of oxygen reactive species and proteolytic activation of the kallikrein-kinin system and subsequent bradykinin storm in the alveolar septa of COVID-19 patients.","Lintzmaier Petiz, Lyvia; Glaser, Talita; Scharfstein, Julio; Ratajczak, Mariusz Z; Ulrich, Henning",Stem Cell Rev Rep,,203

The objective is to evaluate vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in COVID-19 patients, and compare the findings with healthy controls. The secondary objective is to evaluate if there are differences in OCTA parameters between COVID-19 patients with and without associated TE. METHODS: Cross-sectional case-control study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with and without TE related to the infection and age-matched healthy controls. Ophthalmological examination and OCTA were performed 12 weeks after diagnosis. Demographic data and medical history were collected. Macular OCTA parameters in the superficial retinal plexus were analyzed according to ETDRS sectors. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included, 19 (20%) COVID-19 patients with associated TE, 47 (49.5%) COVID-19 patients without TE, and 29 (30.5%) healthy controls. Fifty-three (55.7%) were male, mean age 54.4 (SD 10.2) years. COVID-19 patients presented significantly lower VD than healthy controls: central (p = 0.003), inner ring (p = 0.026), outer ring (p = 0.001). PD was also significantly decreased: outer ring (p = 0.003), full area (p = 0.001). No differences in OCTA parameters were found between COVID-19 patients with and without TE. CONCLUSIONS: OCTA represents a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of microvascular changes in COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower VD and PD compared to healthy controls. However, no differences were found between COVID-19 when considering TE. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate the retinal microvascular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the vasculature of other organs.","Guemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Donate-López, Juan; de la Muela, María Herrera; López-Guajardo, Lorenzo; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Feijoó, Julián",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,203

Medical schools in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have limited capacity to develop resources in the face of rapidly developing health emergencies. Here, a free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) was developed as a COVID-19 resource for medical students working in these settings, and its effectiveness was evaluated. METHODS: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of MOOC in teaching medical students about COVID-19. The data sources included the student registration forms, metrics quantifying their interactions within the modules, students' course feedback, and free-text responses. The data were collected from the Moodle learning management system and Google analytics from May 9 to September 15, 2020. The research team analyzed the quantitative data descriptively and the qualitative data thematically. RESULTS: Among the 16,237 unique visitors who accessed the course, only 6031 medical students from 71 medical schools registered, and about 4993 (83% of registrants) completed the course, indicating high levels of satisfaction (M = 8.17, SD = 1.49) on a 10-point scale. The mean scores of each assessment modules were > 90%. The free-text responses from 987 unique students revealed a total of 17 themes (e.g., knowing the general information on COVID-19, process management of the pandemic in public health, online platform use, and instructional design) across the elements of the RE-AIM framework. Mainly, the students characterized the MOOC as well-organized and effective. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students learned about COVID-19 using a self-paced and unmonitored MOOC. MOOCs could play a vital role in the dissemination of accurate information to medical students in LMIC in future public health emergencies. The students were interested in using similar MOOCs in the future.","Yilmaz, Yusuf; Sarikaya, Ozlem; Senol, Yesim; Baykan, Zeynep; Karaca, Ozan; Demiral Yilmaz, Nilufer; Altintas, Levent; Onan, Arif; Sayek, Iskender",BMC Med Educ,,203
303102,"Commercial Air Travel for Passengers With Cardiovascular Disease: Recommendations for Less Common Conditions, Considerations for Venous Thromboembolism, and General Guidance",2021,"Computer-aided diagnosis for the reliable and fast detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a necessity to prevent the spread of the virus during the pandemic to ease the burden on the healthcare system. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging and detection techniques. Numerous works have been reported on COVID-19 detection from a smaller set of original X-ray images. However, the effect of image enhancement and lung segmentation of a large dataset in COVID-19 detection was not reported in the literature. We have compiled a large X-ray dataset (COVQU) consisting of 18,479 CXR images with 8851 normal, 6012 non-COVID lung infections, and 3616 COVID-19 CXR images and their corresponding ground truth lung masks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest public COVID positive database and the lung masks. Five different image enhancement techniques: histogram equalization (HE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), image complement, gamma correction, and balance contrast enhancement technique (BCET) were used to investigate the effect of image enhancement techniques on COVID-19 detection. A novel U-Net model was proposed and compared with the standard U-Net model for lung segmentation. Six different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and ChexNet) and a shallow CNN model were investigated on the plain and segmented lung CXR images. The novel U-Net model showed an accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice coefficient of 98.63%, 94.3%, and 96.94%, respectively for lung segmentation. The gamma correction-based enhancement technique outperforms other techniques in detecting COVID-19 from the plain and the segmented lung CXR images. Classification performance from plain CXR images is slightly better than the segmented lung CXR images; however, the reliability of network performance is significantly improved for the segmented lung images, which was observed using the visualization technique. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and specificity were 95.11%, 94.55%, 94.56%, 94.53%, and 95.59% respectively for the segmented lung images. The proposed approach with very reliable and comparable performance will boost the fast and robust COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray images.","Rahman, Tawsifur; Khandakar, Amith; Qiblawey, Yazan; Tahir, Anas; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Abul Kashem, Saad Bin; Islam, Mohammad Tariqul; Al Maadeed, Somaya; Zughaier, Susu M; Khan, Muhammad Salman; Chowdhury, Muhammad E H",Comput Biol Med,,203

Here, we analyze the relationship between educational, occupational, and housing variables with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of 988 pregnant women in Spain. Pregnant women were recruited at the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain, among those delivering from 23 March 2020 onwards or consulting for their 12th week of pregnancy from 26 May 2020 onwards. Information on occupational variables and housing characteristics was self-reported. Pregnant women were tested for a current or past infection of SARS-CoV-2 using both PCR and antibodies detection (ELISA). Logistic regression models were used to analyze factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, adjusting for age and country of origin. Infection by SARS-CoV-2 was not associated with educational level or occupational variables, except for where the pregnant woman was a healthcare worker (odds ratio (OR) = 2.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84-9.79). Housing with four or more rooms (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 0.96-4.47), four or more people in the household (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 0.89-4.14), lack of heating (OR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.24-6.34) and less than 23 square meters per person (OR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.43-11.1) were the housing characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Housing characteristics, but not occupational or educational variables, were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This may require mid-and longterm adjustments in some policy areas, including health and demography. In current circumstances a number of measures could be implemented to improve anti-epidemic service in Russia: development and introduction of mobile application for anonymous social contacts tracking, introduction of mobile testing facilities, embedding household assistance for people that are required to isolate themselves, using hotels as hospitals for treating people with no or mild symptoms, planning investment in inpatient care facilities with respect to their possible reprofiling. Development of telemedicine technologies based on a model “physician—patient” is a useful measure for health policy. It is also possible to stimulate population’s demand by introducing governmental drug reimbursement program and earmarked grants on healthy food to people in need. Support for medical organizations is possible with calculating prices for medical services with respect to modern clinical guidelines. Finally, in order to protect patients’ rights, authority and responsibility of health insurance companies could be increased in a number of regional pilot projects. Introduction of these measures would help achieve national goals that were set by the presidential decree No. 204 from May 07, 2018.","Avxentyev, Nikolay A.; Nazarov, Vladimir S.; Sisigina, Natalia N.",Vopr.

Since 2015, high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has become widely used as an effective therapeutic support for acute respiratory failure, most recently in patients with severe COVID-19. We propose that the Berlin definition of ARDS be broadened to include patients treated with HFNO of at least 30 L/min who fulfil the other criteria for the Berlin definition of ARDS. An expanded definition would make the diagnosis of ARDS more widely applicable, allowing patients at an earlier stage of the syndrome to be recognised, independent of the need for endotracheal intubation or positive-pressure ventilation, with benefits for the testing of early interventions and the study of factors associated with the course of ARDS. We identify key questions that could be addressed in refining an expanded definition of ARDS, the implementation of which could lead to improvements in clinical practice and clinical outcomes for patients.","Matthay, Michael A; Thompson, B Taylor; Ware, Lorraine B",Lancet Respir.

In adults, the virus causes severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while in children the disease seems to be milder, although a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) has been described. The aim was to describe and compare the characteristics of the severe COVID-19 disease in adults and children. METHODS: This prospective observational cohort study included the young adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2 between March-June 2020 and admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. The two populations were analysed and compared focusing on their clinical and analytical characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included. There were 16 adults (80%) and 4 children (20%). No mortality was recorded. All the adults were admitted due to ARDS. The median age was 32 years (IQR 23.3-41.5) and the most relevant previous pathology was obesity (n = 7, 43.7%). Thirteen (81.3%) needed mechanical ventilation, with a median PEEP of 13 (IQR 10.5-14.5). Six (37.5%) needed inotropic support due to the sedation. Eight (50%) developed a healthcare-associated infection, the most frequent of which was central line-associated bloodstream infection (n = 7, 71.4%). One patient developed a partial pulmonary thromboembolism, despite him being treated with heparin. All the children were admitted due to MIS-C. Two (50%) required mechanical ventilation. All needed inotropic support, with a median vasoactive-inotropic score of 27.5 (IQR 17.5-30). The difference in the inotropic requirements between the two populations was statistically significant (37.5% vs. 100%, p < 0.001). The biomarker values were higher in children than in adults: mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin 1.72 vs. 0.78 nmol/L (p = 0.017), procalcitonin 5.7 vs. 0.19 ng/mL (p = 0.023), and C-reactive protein 328.2 vs. 146.9 mg/L (p = 0.005). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponins were higher in children than in adults (p = 0.034 and p = 0.039, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adults and children had different clinical manifestations. Adults developed severe ARDS requiring increased respiratory support, whereas children presented MIS-C with greater inotropic requirements. Biomarkers could be helpful in identifying susceptible patients, since they might change depending on the clinical features.","Girona-Alarcon, Mònica; Bobillo-Perez, Sara; Sole-Ribalta, Anna; Hernandez, Lluisa; Guitart, Carmina; Suarez, Ricardo; Balaguer, Mònica; Cambra, Francisco-Jose; Jordan, Iolanda",BMC Infect Dis,,203

This was a retrospective study using a consecutive cohort of 224 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in March 2020. Patients were divided into those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU group) and those not (no ICU group), and clinical data including usage of tocilizumab were compared. Correlation between IL-6 value at admission and at peak, and tocilizumab use, as well as clinical outcomes were also investigated. The ICU group had higher rates of pre-existing comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary disease, and higher IL-6 than no ICU group (all P < .05). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality (1.05 [1.01-1.09], P = .012; 1.001 [1.000-1.002], P = .002; 1.10 [1.03-1.18], P = .008). Receiver operating characteristics curve showed higher predictability of in-hospital mortality with IL-6 at peak than others (area under curve; IL-6 at peak: 0.875 [0.87-0.942], IL-6 at admission: 0.794 [0.699-0.889], d-dimer at peak 0.787 [0.690-0.883], d-dimer at admission 0.726 [0.625-0.827]). Incidence of fungal infections was significantly higher in patients who were given tocilizumab than those who were not (13.0% vs 1.1%, P < .001). Notably, tocilizumab did not affect in-hospital mortality after adjustment including IL-6 (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 1.00 [0.27-3.72, P = .998]). Age, peak IL-6, and peak d-dimer levels were significant predictors of in-hospital mortality.

Different from the conventional trapping behavior in solution, the assembly grows from the focus to the outside along the surface and contains needle structures expanding radially in all directions. Upon switching off the trapping laser, the assembly disperses and needle structures disappear, while the highly concentrated domain of the NPs is left for a while. The single assembly is quickly restored by switching on the laser again, where the needle structures are also reproduced but in a different way. When a single 10 µm PS microparticle (MP) is trapped in the NP solution, a single disc-like assembly containing needle structures is similarly prepared outside the MP. Based on backscattering imaging and tracking analyses of the MP at the solution surface, it is proposed that scattering and propagation of the trapping laser from the central part of the NP assembly or the MP lead to this new phenomenon.","Wu, Chi-Lung; Wang, Shun-Fa; Kudo, Tetsuhiro; Yuyama, Ken-Ichi; Sugiyama, Teruki; Masuhara, Hiroshi",Langmuir,,203

METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, we did modelling using longitudinal, self-reported data from users of the COVID Symptom Study app in England between March 24, and Sept 29, 2020. Beginning on April 28, in England, the Department of Health and Social Care allocated RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 to app users who logged themselves as healthy at least once in 9 days and then reported any symptom. We calculated incidence of COVID-19 using the invited swab (RT-PCR) tests reported in the app, and we estimated prevalence using a symptom-based method (using logistic regression) and a method based on both symptoms and swab test results. We used incidence rates to estimate the effective reproduction number, R(t), modelling the system as a Poisson process and using Markov Chain Monte-Carlo. We used three datasets to validate our models: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey, the Real-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT-1) study, and UK Government testing data. We used geographically granular estimates to highlight regions with rapidly increasing case numbers, or hotspots. FINDINGS: From March 24 to Sept 29, 2020, a total of 2&emsp14;873&emsp14;726 users living in England signed up to use the app, of whom 2&emsp14;842&emsp14;732 (98&middot;9%) provided valid age information and daily assessments. These users provided a total of 120&emsp14;192&emsp14;306 daily reports of their symptoms, and recorded the results of 169&emsp14;682 invited swab tests. On a national level, our estimates of incidence and prevalence showed a similar sensitivity to changes to those reported in the ONS and REACT-1 studies. On Sept 28, 2020, we estimated an incidence of 15&emsp14;841 (95% CI 14&emsp14;023&ndash;17&emsp14;885) daily cases, a prevalence of 0&middot;53% (0&middot;45&ndash;0&middot;60), and R(t) of 1&middot;17 (1&middot;15&ndash;1&middot;19) in England. On a geographically granular level, on Sept 28, 2020, we detected 15 (75%) of the 20 regions with highest incidence according to government test data. INTERPRETATION: Our method could help to detect rapid case increases in regions where government testing provision is lower. Self-reported data from mobile applications can provide an agile resource to inform policy makers during a quickly moving pandemic, serving as a complementary resource to more traditional instruments for disease surveillance.

Influencing an individual's susceptibility to infection include such factors as nutritional status, physical and psychosocial stressors, obesity, protein calorie malnutrition, emotional resilience, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), environmental toxins-including air pollution and first- and second-hand tobacco smoke, sleep habits, sedentary lifestyle, drug-induced nutritional deficiencies and drug-induced immunomodulatory effects, availability of nutrient dense food and empty calories. This review examines the network of interacting co-factors that influence the host-pathogen relationship, which in turn determine one's susceptibility to viral infections like COVID 19.

310504,Before attributing COVID_19-related ischemic stroke to hypercoagulability alternative causes should be excluded,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a highly contagious respiratory disease referred to as COVID-19. However, emerging evidence indicates that a small but growing number of COVID-19 patients also manifest neurological symptoms, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the nervous system under some circumstances. SARS-CoV-2 primarily enters the body through the epithelial lining of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but under certain conditions this pleiotropic virus may also infect peripheral nerves and gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is shielded by various anatomical and physiological barriers, most notably the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which functions to prevent harmful substances, including pathogens and pro-inflammatory mediators, from entering the brain. The BBB is composed of highly specialized endothelial cells, pericytes, mast cells and astrocytes that form the neurovascular unit, which regulates BBB permeability and maintains the integrity of the CNS. In this review, potential routes of viral entry and the possible mechanisms utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to penetrate the CNS, either by disrupting the BBB or infecting the peripheral nerves and using the neuronal network to initiate neuroinflammation, are briefly discussed. Furthermore, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the brain and in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with other human coronaviruses are considered. Although the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the CNS and neurovirulence are currently unknown, the potential pathways described here might pave the way for future research in this area and enable the development of better therapeutic strategies.","Alam, S B; Willows, S; Kulka, M; Sandhu, J K",Eur. j. neurol,,203

METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to U.S. otolaryngology residents. Responses to the Shirom-Melamed Burnout Measure (SMBM) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale were recorded along with data on burnout, demographics, wellness, sleep, training, and education. RESULTS: 119 U.S. otolaryngology residents representing 27 of 42 states with otolaryngology residency programs responded to the survey. 24.4% (95% CI 17.0-31.8%) self-reported some level of burnout, while 10.9% met SMBM criteria for ""clinically relevant"" burnout. 51.3% experienced more stress, and 58.8% reported more anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to males, females had a higher prevalence of burnout (38.9% vs 12.3%, P = .001) and anxiety (75.9% vs 43.8%, P < .001). PGY-2s had a greater mean SMBM index (3.64) and higher rates of self-reported burnout (54.2%) than their counterparts at other levels of training. Residents reported less time spent in the hospital, lower surgical volume, and less procedural independence. Educational didactics, primarily via videoconference, were more frequent for 63.9% of respondents. CONCLUSION: While burnout among otolaryngology residents was low early in the COVID-19 pandemic, likely due to separation from the workplace environment, trainees had higher levels of anxiety and stress. The surgical experience was negatively impacted by the pandemic, but remote didactics and educational opportunities increased. These findings may inform otolaryngology residency programs on the need to promote resident wellness and aid in devising strategies to improve the educational experience during this unique global health crisis as well as in the long term.","Chou, David W; Staltari, Giuseppe; Mullen, Michael; Chang, Jolie; Durr, Megan",Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol,,203

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using PubMed® and SCOPUS® databases, up to March 10, 2019, by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Study selection, quality assessment (modified Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool) and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. All original full papers written in English/French/Italian and dealing with the fabrication of 3D printed models of head bone structures, designed from 3D radiological data were included. Multiple parameters and data were investigated, such as author's purpose, data acquisition systems, printing technologies and materials, accuracy, haptic feedback, variations in treatment time, differences in clinical outcomes, costs, production time and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Among the 1157 retrieved abstracts, only 69 met the inclusion criteria. 3D printed bone models were mainly used as training or simulation models for tumor removal, or bone reconstruction. Material jetting printers showed best performance but the highest cost. Stereolithographic, laser sintering and binder jetting printers allowed to create accurate models with adequate haptic feedback. The cheap fused deposition modeling printers exhibited satisfactory results for creating training models. CONCLUSION: Patient-specific 3D printed models are known to be useful surgical and educational tools. Faced with the large diversity of software, printing technologies and materials, the clinical team should invest in a 3D printer specifically adapted to the final application.","Meglioli, Matteo; Naveau, Adrien; Macaluso, Guido Maria; Catros, Sylvain",3D Print Med,,203

Particularly, conventional coagulation parameters appear to be significantly altered in patients with poor prognosis. A wide-ranging cross- talk between coagulative haemostasis and inflammation, as well as the activation of coagulation cascade during viral infections, are well established. Another important evidence which may explain coagulation disorders in COVID-19 is the increase of thrombus formation under conditions of hypoxia. Despite the exact pathophysiological mechanism of coronavirus-induced thromboembolism needs to be further investigated, this finding suggests that it is good practice to assess the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients to improvethe clinical management in terms of anticoagulation therapy. Anticoagulants, mainly low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), should be tailored in patients meeting sepsis induced coagulopathy (SIC) criteria or with markedly elevated D-dimer.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter study of infants aged 2 to 7 days hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia from December 1, 2016, to June 30, 2018, using the Pediatric Health Information System. Hospital-level variation in laboratory and IVF use was evaluated after adjusting for clinical and demographic factors and associated with hospital-level outcomes by using Pearson correlation. RESULTS: We identified 4396 infants hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia. In addition to bilirubin level, the most frequently ordered laboratories were direct antiglobulin testing (45.7%), reticulocyte count (39.7%), complete blood cell counts (43.7%), ABO blood type (33.4%), and electrolyte panels (12.9%). IVFs were given to 26.3% of children. Extensive variation in laboratory testing and IVF administration was observed across hospitals (all P < .001). Increased use of laboratory testing but not IVFs was associated with a longer length of stay (P = .007 and .162, respectively). Neither supplementary laboratory use nor IVF use was associated with either readmissions or emergency department revisits. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial variation exists among hospitals in the management of infants with hyperbilirubinemia. With our results, we suggest that additional testing outside of bilirubin measurement may unnecessarily increase resource use for infants hospitalized with hyperbilirubinemia.","DePorre, Adrienne G; Hall, Matthew; Puls, Henry T; Daly, Ashley; Gay, James C; Bettenhausen, Jessica L; Markham, Jessica L",,,203

320231,Report on a lactating patient with COVID-19,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emergent coronavirus, which has adversely impacted human health and has led to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an unmet need to develop therapies against SARS-CoV-2 due to its severity and lack of treatment options. A promising approach to combat COVID-19 is through the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by therapeutic antibodies. Previously, we described a strategy to rapidly identify and generate llama nanobodies (VHH) from naïve and synthetic humanized VHH phage libraries that specifically bind the S1 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and block the interaction with the human ACE2 receptor. In this study we used computer-aided design to construct multi-specific VHH antibodies fused to human IgG1 Fc domains based on the epitope predictions for leading VHHs. The resulting tri-specific VHH-Fc antibodies show more potent S1 binding, S1/ACE2 blocking, and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization than the bi-specific VHH-Fcs or combination of individual monoclonal VHH-Fcs. Furthermore, protein stability analysis of the VHH-Fcs shows favorable developability features, which enable them to be quickly and successfully developed into therapeutics against COVID-19.","Dong, Jianbo; Huang, Betty; Wang, Bo; Titong, Allison; Gallolu Kankanamalage, Sachith; Jia, Zhejun; Wright, Meredith; Parthasarathy, Pannaga; Liu, Yue",Sci Rep,,203

320717,Mortality Comparison of Using Anti Interleukin-6 Therapy and Using Standard Treatment in Severe Covid-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is associated with adverse outcomes, including death, after coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection. Beyond the lungs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues, including the kidney, potentially contributing to acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesized that the renal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHODS: The expression of ACE 2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next-generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). RESULTS: Mean ACE 2 messenger RNA was increased approximately 2-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy control subjects (mean ± SD, 13.2±7.9 vs 7.7±3.6 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.001). No difference in transcript abundance was noted between recipients and nonrecipients of agents that block the RAAS (12.2±6.7 vs 16.2±10.7 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Increased ACE 2 messenger RNA in the diabetic kidney may increase the risk and/or severity of kidney infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of COVID-19 disease. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether this diabetes-related overexpression is generalizable to other tissues, most notably the lungs.","Gilbert, Richard E; Caldwell, Lauren; Misra, Paraish S; Chan, Kin; Burns, Kevin D; Wrana, Jeffrey L; Yuen, Darren A",Canadian journal of diabetes (Online),,203

322021,Characterization of Headache in COVID-19: a Retrospective Multicenter Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: While the COVID-19 diagnostic test has a high false negative rate, not everyone initially negative is re-tested. Michigan Medicine, a primary regional center, provided an ideal setting for studying testing patterns during the first wave of the pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To identify the characteristics of patients who underwent repeated testing for COVID-19 and determine if repeated testing was associated with downstream outcomes among positive cases. METHODS: Characteristics, test results, and health outcomes for patients presenting for a COVID-19 diagnostic test were collected. We examined whether patient characteristics differed with repeated testing and estimated a false negative rate for the test. We then studied repeated testing patterns in patients with severe COVID-19 related outcomes. RESULTS: Patient age, sex, body mass index, neighborhood poverty levels, pre-existing Type 2 diabetes, circulatory, kidney, and liver diseases, and cough, fever/chills, and pain symptoms 14 days prior to a first test were associated with repeated testing. Among patients with a positive result, age (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: (1.05, 1.34)) and pre-existing kidney diseases (OR: 2.26; 95% CI: (1.41, 3.68)) remained significant. Hospitalization (OR: 7.88; 95% CI: (5.15, 12.26)) and ICU-level care (OR: 6.93; 95% CI: (4.44, 10.92)) were associated with repeated testing. The estimated false negative rate was 23.8% (95% CI: (19.5%, 28.5%)). CONCLUSIONS: While most patients were tested once and received a negative result, a meaningful subset underwent multiple rounds of testing. These results shed light on testing patterns and have important implications for understanding the variation of repeated testing results within and between patients.","Salerno, Stephen; Zhao, Zhangchen; Prabhu Sankar, Swaraaj; Salvatore, Maxwell; Gu, Tian; Fritsche, Lars G; Lee, Seunggeun; Lisabeth, Lynda D; Valley, Thomas S; Mukherjee, Bhramar",J. intern. med,,203
322195,"The ""Infodemic"" of COVID-19",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosed. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus was performed from December 1, 2019 to May 7, 2020. Observational studies including adults with COVID-19 infection and reporting GI symptoms were included. The primary outcome was assessing the weighted pooled prevalence (WPP) of GI symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection. Secondary outcomes were WPP of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection with GI symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 78 studies with 12,797 patients were included. Among GI symptoms (at onset of illness in 6, at admission in 17, data given separately for both in 3, and data unavailable in 52 studies), the WPP of diarrhea was 12.4% (95% CI, 8.2% to 17.1%), I2=94%; nausea and/or vomiting, 9.0% (95% CI, 5.5% to 12.9%), I2=93%; loss of appetite, 22.3% (95% CI, 11.2% to 34.6%, I2=94%; and abdominal pain, 6.2% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%), I2=92%. Mortality among patients with GI symptoms (0.4%; 95% CI, 0% to 1.1%; I2=74%) was similar to overall mortality (2.1%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 4.7%; I2=94%), P=.15. Most studies had high risk of bias and overall quality of evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal symptoms are seen in up to 1 in 5 patients with COVID-19 infection. More high-quality evidence is needed to confirm these findings and explore factors causing mortality in these patients.","Tariq, Raseen; Saha, Srishti; Furqan, Fateeha; Hassett, Leslie; Pardi, Darrell; Khanna, Sahil",Mayo Clin Proc,,203

325080,Patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to COVID-19: A family cluster report,2020,"BACKGROUND: The elderly are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore need to adopt long-term social distancing measures. The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly. METHODS: An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine. RESULTS: The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1. Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.","Maggi, Gianpaolo; Baldassarre, Ivana; Barbaro, Andrea; Cavallo, Nicola Davide; Cropano, Maria; Nappo, Raffaele; Santangelo, Gabriella",Psychogeriatrics,,203

As a population, patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke face unique challenges during pandemics. These are broad in scope. Responses to these challenges through adaptation of stroke systems of care and with imaging, thrombectomy, and postprocedural care are detailed. Preservation of access to thrombectomy must be prioritized for its public health impact. While the extent of required changes will vary by region, tiered planning for both escalation and de-escalation of measures must be a part of each practice.

327872,Differential Diagnosis of Lungs Lesions in a New Coronavirus Infection COVID-19 and Diseases of Non-Viral Etiology on the Clinical Cases by Computed Tomography Scans in Outpatient CT Centers,2020,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated if interventions aimed at air travellers can delay local severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) community transmission in a previously unaffected country. METHODS: We simulated infected air travellers arriving into countries with no sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission or other introduction routes from affected regions. We assessed the effectiveness of syndromic screening at departure and/or arrival and traveller sensitisation to the COVID-2019-like symptoms with the aim to trigger rapid self-isolation and reporting on symptom onset to enable contact tracing. We assumed that syndromic screening would reduce the number of infected arrivals and that traveller sensitisation reduces the average number of secondary cases. We use stochastic simulations to account for uncertainty in both arrival and secondary infections rates, and present sensitivity analyses on arrival rates of infected travellers and the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation. We report the median expected delay achievable in each scenario and an inner 50% interval. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, introducing exit and entry screening in combination with traveller sensitisation can delay a local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by 8 days (50% interval: 3-14 days) when the rate of importation is 1 infected traveller per week at time of introduction. The additional benefit of entry screening is small if exit screening is effective: the combination of only exit screening and traveller sensitisation can delay an outbreak by 7 days (50% interval: 2-13 days). In the absence of screening, with less effective sensitisation, or a higher rate of importation, these delays shrink rapidly to <4 days. CONCLUSION: Syndromic screening and traveller sensitisation in combination may have marginally delayed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in unaffected countries.","Clifford, Samuel; Pearson, Carl A B; Klepac, Petra; Van Zandvoort, Kevin; Quilty, Billy J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Flasche, Stefan",J. travel med,,203

Proposed mechanisms of this association are hypercoagulable state, vasculitis and cardiomyopathy, together with traditional vascular risk factors. We analyzed the frequency and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 positive stroke cases during the first months of the pandemic in Latin America. Methods: A multinational study (7 countries, 18 centers) of patients admitted during the pandemic outbreak (March - June 2020). We assessed acute stroke cases associated to COVID-19 infection. Clinical characteristics, stroke etiology and severity, acute care and functional outcomes, were compared between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 cases. Results: There were a total of 1037 stroke cases;sixty-two of them (6.0%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. This group consisted of 38 men [61.3%], with a median age of 68 years [IQR 59-79 years]. From these cases, 80.6% were ischemic stroke, 16.1% hemorrhagic stroke, and 1.6% transient ischemic attack and cerebral venous thrombosis respectively. The most common etiology reported for ischemic cases was atherosclerotic large vessel occlusion (30.6% vs. 12.7% in non- COVID cases, p&lt;0.001), and undetermined etiology for hemorrhagic stroke (55.6%). Median NIHSS for COVID-stroke patients was higher (7 IQR 2-16 vs. 5 IQR 2-11, p=0.05). Five (8.1%) patients received acute reperfusion therapy, with no differences in door-to-CT, door-to-needle and door-togroin times, compared to non-COVID cases. Most characteristics did not differ from those of COVID-19 negative patients. Mortality was higher in COVID-stroke cases (20.9% vs. 9.6%,p&lt;0.001).

METHOD: This retrospective comparative case series study involved 110 right eyes of 110 patients who underwent either SMILE (55 eyes) or AF t-PRK (55 eyes). Visual acuity, manifest refractive error and corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured and analyzed at baseline, 1 month and 3 months after operation. The safety and efficacy indices, and vector parameters were also compared. RESULT: 1 month postoperatively, the mean uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and spherical equivalent refraction (SE) were better after SMILE than AF t-PRK (logMAR UDVA, - 0.03 ± 0.07 and - 0.006 ± 0.07, P = 0.050; logMAR CDVA, - 0.06 ± 0.07 and - 0.03 ± 0.07, P = 0.043; SE, - 0.04 ± 0.25 and 0.15 ± 0.26, P < 0.001). However, these parameters were comparable between the groups at 3 months after surgery. Residual astigmatism &#8804; 0.25 diopters was observed in 74.5% and 90.9% (P = 0.023) of the eyes at one month and in 87.3% and 85.5% (P = 0.781) of the eyes at 3 months after SMILE and AF t-PRK, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the vector parameters at 1 month or 3 months after surgery. Coma and total HOAs after SMILE were significantly higher than AF t-PRK (1 month coma, 0.49 ± 0.23 and 0.29 ± 0.15, P < 0.001; 1 month total RMS HOAs, 0.65 ± 0.20 and 0.54 ± 0.14, P = 0.001; 3 months coma, 0.50 ± 0.22 and 0.30 ± 0.17, P < 0.001; 3 months total RMS HOAs, 0.68 ± 0.20 and 0.55 ± 0.17, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study, both SMILE and AF t-PRK were effective and comparable for correction of low to moderate myopic astigmatism.

328444,"Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of COVID-19 in children: The role of mean platelet volume in predicting hospitalization and severity",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant health impact around the world. In the United States, there has been a difference in infection and death rates for Black Americans and other marginalized groups as compared to White Americans. Although children do not seem to be suffering infection, morbidity and mortality to the same degree as adults, there is concern that COVID-19 could have a disparate impact on children with acquired or congenital disabilities when analyzed through the lens of race and equity. The possibility that there could be a differential effect on rehabilitation services relates to: the risk of familial/parental exposure leading to secondary infection, the negative economic impact of public health measures required to control disease spread, and the pre-existing social factors that impact access to healthcare. Finally, the psychosocial stresses imposed by COVID-19 inflame risk factors for non-accidental injury, which could lead to an increased need for pediatric rehabilitation services in vulnerable populations. It is critical that individual providers, as well as the health systems in which they practice, actively focus on mitigating personal and systemic causes of racial and ethnic health outcome disparities. These efforts need to move beyond a race neutral construct to specifically anti-racist activity.","Sholas, Maurice G",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine (Online),,203

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator. A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the centre with the largest case volume. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments [40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)]. No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%). The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), P = 0.034. There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis amongst stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window. Increased public awareness and corrective measures are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on acute stroke care.","Pop, R; Quenardelle, V; Hasiu, A; Mihoc, D; Sellal, F; Dugay, M H; Lebedinsky, P A; Schluck, E; LA Porta, A; Courtois, S; Gheoca, R; Wolff, V; Beaujeux, R",Eur. j. neurol,,203

AIMS: To measure the effect of the ELA on acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to examine whether specific trauma types and frequencies of exposure are associated with a more severe acute stress reaction and increased risk of anxiety and depressive symptoms. METHOD: This investigation was performed at college students in a comprehensive University of China. The online self-report questionnaire included ELA experiences, exposure to epidemic-related events, acute stress reactions, and anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Logistic regression and stepwise regression were used to assess the associations and interactions among these variables. RESULTS: Participants with ELA reported more exposure to epidemic-related events and more severe stress reactions during the epidemics than did those with no ELA. The experience of ELA is associated with acute stress reactions, anxiety and depression in early adulthood. Furthermore, experiencing more ELA during childhood may not only increase the risk of anxiety and depression episode in early adulthood but also lead to more severe acute stress reactions during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: Regardless of specific ELA types, ELAs have longer time effects on individual's susceptibility to stress. Under this epidemic, the mental health in young adults with ELA needs more attention.","Li, Xiaojing; Lv, Qiuyue; Tang, Wanjie; Deng, Wei; Zhao, Liansheng; Meng, Yajing; Guo, Wanjun; Li, Tao",J Affect Disord,,203

330923,Venous Thromboembolic Disease in Children Associated with COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by significant in-hospital virus transmission and deaths among healthcare workers. Sources of in-hospital transmission are not fully understood, with special precautions currently reserved for procedures previously shown to generate aerosols (particles <5 µm). Pleural procedures are not currently considered AGPs (Aerosol Generating Procedures), reflecting a lack of data in this area. METHODS: An underwater seal chest drain bottle (R54500, Rocket Medical UK) was set up inside a 60-litre plastic box and connected via an airtight conduit to a medical air supply. A multichannel particle counter (TSI Aerotrak 9310 Aerosol Monitor) was placed inside the box, allowing measurement of particle count/cubic foot (pc/ft3) within six channel sizes: 0.3-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-3, 3-5, 5-10 and >10 µm. Stabilised particle counts at 1, 3 and 5 L/min were compared by Wilcoxon signed rank test; p values were Bonferroni-adjusted. Measurements were repeated with a simple anti-viral filter, designed using repurposed materials by the study team, attached to the drain bottle. The pressure within the bottle was measured to assess any effect of the filter on bottle function. RESULTS: Aerosol emissions increased with increasing air flow, with the largest increase observed in smaller particles (0.3-3 µm). Concentration of the smallest particles (0.3-0.5 µm) increased from background levels by 700, 1400 and 2500 pc/ft3 at 1, 3 and 5 L/min, respectively. However, dispersion of particles of all sizes was effectively prevented by use of the viral filter at all flow rates. Use of the filter was associated with a maximum pressure rise of 0.3 cm H2O after 24 hours of flow at 5 L/min, suggesting minimal impact on drain function. CONCLUSION: A bubbling chest drain is a source of aerosolised particles, but emission can be prevented using a simple anti-viral filter. These data should be considered when designing measures to reduce in-hospital spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Duffy, Clodagh; Kidd, Andrew; Francis, Sarah; Tsim, Selina; McNaughton, Laura; Ferguson, Katie; Ferguson, Jenny; Rodgers, K Gary; McGroarty, Claire; Sayer, Robin; Blyth, Kevin G",,,203

Clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2, and confirmed negative clinical samples were used to create sample pools. Clinical samples had 'neat' Xpert® E gene cycle threshold values ranging between 20 and 28 and all were detected qualitatively when contained in pools of 4 or 6 samples. For these samples, pooling had a median change in cycle threshold value of 2.0 in pools of 4, and of 2.9 in pools of 6.

331785,"Letter regarding ""Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19""",2021,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from Wuhan, China in December 2019 and is the strain of coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Approximately one-third of the patients with COVID-19 require intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and almost 30% of the patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as salvage therapy for severe ARDS. The role of ECMO in the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear, although there is emerging evidence that this approach may be an effective salvage therapy for severe ARDS.Case Presentation: We present a case of a previously healthy 39-year-old Hispanic male who presented to the hospital with flu-like symptoms, including headache, fatigue, and myalgia for 8 days in late April 2020. He denied dyspnea on exertion. The patient’s symptoms progressed, resulting in pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient was managed with prone positioning, convalescent plasma and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for 35 days. The patient successfully recovered and was able to ambulate independently and was discharged home from an acute care hospital without oxygen supplementation on hospital day 63.Conclusion: We present one of the first few documented cases of ECMO for severe ARDS due to COVID-19. After a prolonged hospital course requiring VV-ECMO, the patient was discharged home from an acute care hospital without oxygen requirement and ambulated independently, likely as a result of daily aggressive mobility-focused rehabilitation.","Tran, Dena H.; Peng, Carol Chiung-Hui Wolde-Rufael Daniel A.; Devkota, Hari Diaz-Abad Montserrat Baghdadi Jonathan Chow R.

333435,"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19, SARS and MERS",2020,"Despite considerable social scientific attention to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on urbanized areas, very little research has examined its impact on rural populations. Yet rural communities-which make up tens of millions of people from diverse backgrounds in the United States-are among the nation's most vulnerable populations and may be less resilient to the effects of such a large-scale exogenous shock. We address this critical knowledge gap with data from a new survey designed to assess the impacts of the pandemic on health-related and economic dimensions of rural well-being in the North American West. Notably, we find that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural populations have been severe, with significant negative impacts on unemployment, overall life satisfaction, mental health, and economic outlook. Further, we find that these impacts have been generally consistent across age, ethnicity, education, and sex. We discuss how these findings constitute the beginning of a much larger interdisciplinary COVID-19 research effort that integrates rural areas and pushes beyond the predominant focus on cities and nation-states.","Mueller, J Tom; McConnell, Kathryn; Burow, Paul Berne; Pofahl, Katie; Merdjanoff, Alexis A; Farrell, Justin",Proc.

However, there is no specific and widely accepted effective vaccines. The experience in controlling the outbreak in China has proven the effectiveness of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). OBJECTIVES: This review aims to evaluate the role of TCM in COVID-19 treatment, hoping to provide references for prevention and control of global pandemic. DATA SOURCES: China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, Baidu Scholar, ScienceDirect, Elsevier and PubMed were used to search literatures published from December 2019 to December 2020 by entering the keywords ""Traditional Chinese medicine"", ""COVID-19â³, ""Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2â³, ""Pathogenesis"", ""Syndrome differentiation"", ""Prescriptions"" and their combinations. Hence, we have performed an extensive review of research articles, reviews and primary scientific studies to identify TCM against COVID-19. RESULTS: Among clinical treatments of COVID-19, several TCM prescriptions and characteristic therapies have been effectively suggested, the underlying mechanisms of which are mainly involved in antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and organ-protective effects of multi-components acting on multi-targets at multi-pathways. CONCLUSIONS: This review may provide meaningful and feasible information that can be considered for the treatment of COVID-19 pandemic globally.","Ren, Wei; Liang, Pan; Ma, Yue; Sun, Qin; Pu, Qingrong; Dong, Li; Luo, Gang; Mazhar, Maryam; Liu, Jiali; Wang, Raoqiong; Yang, Sijin",Biomed Pharmacother,,203

One of these rapid changes involved students and professors that had to turn the traditional ""in presence"" classes into online courses facing several problems for educational delivery. OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to investigate the factors that affected both teaching/learning effectiveness and general human comfort and wellbeing after the sudden transition from classrooms to eLearning platforms due to COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS: A workshop, involving students and experts of Human Factors and Ergonomics, has been performed to identify aspects/factors that could influence online learning. Then, from workshop output and literature studies, a survey composed of two questionnaires (one for students and one for teachers) has been developed and spread out among Italian universities students and professors. RESULTS: 700 people answered the questionnaires. Data have been analysed and discussed to define the most important changes due to the new eLearning approach. Absence of interactions with colleagues and the necessity to use several devices were some of the aspects coming out from questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows an overview of factors influencing both teaching/learning effectiveness and general human comfort and wellbeing.

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are the only RCTs routinely conducted during the pandemic. Information about efficacy and safety of different vaccines represents a fertile ground for nocebo phenomena. Individual and contextual factors will be emphasized in order to understand the presence of a refusal of immunization associated with a specific vaccine considered less effective and safe. Critical aspects and some guidelines will be presented in order to counteract the nocebo effects and to improve adherence to drug treatments and the vaccination campaign.Expert opinion: The nocebo effect could explain the presence of strong resistance in European countries to immunization with a vaccine perceived as less effective, compared to others. Increased awareness of the nocebo effect would be relevant as it could lead to a greater participation in the vaccination campaign and in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Amanzio, Martina; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena; Bartoli, Massimo",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,,203

Much attention has been given to the disparity in maternal morbidity and mortality experienced by Black mothers. The disparity in Black lives lost from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further highlighted the disparity in health outcomes for Black people. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, the reason for the health disparity is the same as in maternal morbidity and mortality: implicit bias and structural racism. Implicit bias among health care professionals leads to disparities in how health care is delivered. Generations of structural racism perpetuated through racial residential segregation, economic suppression, and health care inequality have normalized the poorer health outcomes for Black Americans. It is easy to dismiss these issues as someone else's problem, because health care professionals often fail to acknowledge the effect of implicit bias in their own practices. We all need to be highly critical of our own practices and look introspectively for implicit bias to find the cure. Health care organizations must invest time and resources into investigating the structural racism that exists within our own walls.","Gillispie-Bell, Veronica",Obstet Gynecol,,203

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the association of self-reported symptoms with SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) test results in nonhospitalized individuals and to estimate the occurrence of symptoms associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in a larger nontested population. METHODS: EPICOVID19 is a self-administered cross-sectional voluntary web-based survey of adults throughout Italy who completed an anonymous questionnaire in the period of April 13 to 21, 2020. The associations between symptoms potentially related to SARS-CoV-2 infection and NPS results were calculated as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% CIs by multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, sex, education, smoking habits, and number of comorbidities. Thereafter, for each symptom and for combinations of the symptoms, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and areas under the curve (AUCs) in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the occurrence of COVID-19-like infection in the nontested population. RESULTS: A total of 171,310 people responded to the survey, of whom 102,543 (59.9%) were women; mean age 47.4 years. Out of the 4785 respondents with known NPS test results, 4392 were not hospitalized. Among the 4392 nonhospitalized respondents, those with positive NPS tests (856, 19.5%) most frequently reported myalgia (527, 61.6%), olfactory and taste disorders (507, 59.2%), cough (466, 54.4%), and fever (444, 51.9%), whereas 7.7% were asymptomatic. Multiple regression analysis showed that olfactory and taste disorders (aOR 10.3, 95% CI 8.4-12.7), fever (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 2.0-3.1), myalgia (aOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.8), and cough (aOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) were associated with NPS positivity. Having two to four of these symptoms increased the aOR from 7.4 (95% CI 5.6-9.7) to 35.5 (95% CI 24.6-52.2). The combination of the four symptoms showed an AUC of 0.810 (95% CI 0.795-0.825) in classifying positive NPS test results and then was applied to the nonhospitalized and nontested sample (n=165,782). We found that 7739 to 20,103 of these 165,782 respondents (4.4% to 12.1%) had experienced symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that self-reported symptoms are reliable indicators of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pandemic context. A nonnegligible number of symptomatic respondents (up to 12.1%) were undiagnosed and potentially contributed to the spread of the infection.

This has antifibrotic therapy implications. METHODS: Twenty patients with suspected CPFE underwent late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) thoracic magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) and HRCT. Data from twelve healthy control subjects from a previous study who underwent thoracic LGE-MRI were included for comparison. Quantitative LGE signal intensity (SI) was retrospectively compared in regions of fibrosis and emphysema in CPFE patients to similar lung regions in controls. Qualitative comparisons for the presence/extent of reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis between LGE-MRI and HRCT were assessed by two readers in consensus. RESULTS: There were significant quantitative differences in fibrosis SI compared to emphysema SI in CPFE patients (25.8, IQR 18.4-31.0 versus 5.3, IQR 5.0-8.1, p < 0.001). Significant differences were found between LGE-MRI and HRCT in the extent of reticulation (12.5, IQR 5.0-20.0 versus 25.0, IQR 15.0-26.3, p = 0.038) and honeycombing (5.0, IQR 0.0-10.0 versus 20.0, IQR 10.6-20.0, p = 0.001) but not traction bronchiectasis (10.0, IQR 5-15 versus 15.0, IQR 5-15, p = 0.878). Receiver operator curve analysis of fibrosis SI compared to similarly located regions in control subjects showed an area under the curve of 0.82 (p = 0.002). A SI cutoff of 19 yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86% in differentiating fibrosis from similarly located regions in control subjects. CONCLUSION: LGE-MRI can differentiate CPFE from pure emphysema and may be a useful adjunct test to HRCT in patients with suspected CPFE.","Fleming, Hannah; Clifford, Simon M; Haughey, Aoife; MacDermott, Roisin; McVeigh, Niall; Healy, Gerard M; Lavelle, Lisa; Abbara, Suhny; Murphy, David J; Fabre, Aurelie; McKone, Edward; McCarthy, Cormac; Butler, Marcus; Doran, Peter; Lynch, David A; Keane, Michael P; Dodd, Jonathan D",Eur Radiol Exp,,203

High-quality randomized trials to evaluate the effects of practical sodium reduction strategies are needed. METHODS: The study is a cluster randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design conducted in 48 senior residential facilities in northern China. These facilities are randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to 1 of 4 groups: stepwise salt supply control (SSSC) in which 5%-10% of the study salt supply in the institutional kitchens will be reduced every 3â¯months, replacing normal salt with salt substitute (SS); SSSC only; SS only; or neither SSSC nor SS. The interventions last for 2 years with follow-up every 6 months. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to 24â¯months. Secondary outcomes include the incidence of hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, cardiovascular events, and death. CURRENT STATUS: The study has recruited and randomized 48 senior residential facilities with 1,606 participants. Mean age at baseline was 71â¯years, and 76% are male. Both types of salt intervention were initiated in the study facilities between January and April 2018. CONCLUSION: The study is well placed to define the effects of 2 practical and scalable sodium reduction strategies for blood pressure reduction and will provide important new data about safety of these strategies among older adults in China.","Jin, Aoming; Liu, Kiang; Labarthe, Darwin R; Feng, Xiangxian; Zhang, Ruijuan; Wang, Hongxia; Qiao, Qianku; Li, Huijuan; Li, Jiayu; Gao, Pei; Fang, Hai; Duan, Peifen; Wang, Yuqi; Zhang, Hui; Cao, Lae; Neal, Bruce; Chen, Junshi; Wu, Yangfeng",Am Heart J,,203

Sirt1 is decreased in obese patients and increased in weight loss. Its decreased expression explains part of the pathomechanisms of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DT2), cardiovascular diseases and nonalcoholic liver disease. Sirt1 plays an important role in the differentiation of adipocytes and in insulin signaling regulated by Foxo1 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Its overexpression attenuates inflammation and macrophage infiltration induced by a high fat diet. Its decreased expression plays a prominent role in the heart, liver and brain of rat as manifestations of fetal programming produced by deficit in vitamin B12 and folate during pregnancy and lactation through imbalanced methylation/acetylation of PGC1&#945; and altered expression and methylation of nuclear receptors. The decreased expression of Sirt1 produced by impaired cellular availability of vitamin B12 results from endoplasmic reticulum stress through subcellular mislocalization of ELAVL1/HuR protein that shuttles Sirt1 mRNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Preclinical and clinical studies of Sirt1 agonists have produced contrasted results in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. A preclinical study has produced promising results in the treatment of inherited disorders of vitamin B12 metabolism.","Kosgei, Viola J; Coelho, David; Guéant-Rodriguez, Rosa-Maria; Guéant, Jean-Louis",,,203

In light of this situation, the Japanese Government declared a state of emergency in seven regions of Japan on 7 April 2020 under the provisions of the law. The medical care delivery system has been under pressure. Although various surgical societies have published guidelines on which to base their surgical decisions, it is not clear how general anesthesia has been performed and will be performed in Japan. Materials and Methods: One of the services provided by the social network service Twitter is a voting function-Twitter Polls-through which anonymous surveys were conducted. We analyzed the results of a series of surveys 17 times over 22 weeks on Twitter on the status of operating restrictions using quadratic programming to solve the mathematical optimizing problem, and public data provided by the Japanese Government were used to estimate the current changes in the number of general anesthesia performed in Japan. Results: The minimum number of general anesthesia cases per week was estimated at 67.1% compared to 2015 on 27 April 2020. The timeseries trend was compatible with the results reported by the Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (correlation coefficient r = 0.69, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The number of general anesthesia was reduced up to two-thirds during the pandemic of COVID-19 in Japan and was successfully quantitatively estimated using a quick questionnaire on Twitter.","Fujii, Yosuke; Daijo, Hiroki; Hirota, Kiichi",Medicina (Kaunas),,203

The virus infects cells via a glycosylated spike protein located on its surface. The protein primarily binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, using glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) as co-receptors. Here, we performed bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulations of the spike protein to investigate the existence of additional GAG binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), separate from previously reported heparin-binding sites. A putative GAG binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the protein was identified, encompassing residues 245-246. We hypothesized that GAGs of a sufficient length might bridge the gap between this site and the PRRARS furin cleavage site, including the mutation S247R. Docking studies using GlycoTorch Vina and subsequent MD simulations of the spike trimer in the presence of dodecasaccharides of the GAGs heparin and heparan sulfate supported this possibility. The heparan sulfate chain bridged the gap, binding the furin cleavage site and S247R. In contrast, the heparin chain bound the furin cleavage site and surrounding glycosylation structures, but not S247R. These findings identify a site in the spike protein that favors heparan sulfate binding that may be particularly pertinent for a better understanding of the recent UK and South African strains. This will also assist in future targeted therapy programs that could include repurposing clinical heparan sulfate mimetics.","Schuurs, Zachariah P; Hammond, Edward; Elli, Stefano; Rudd, Timothy R; Mycroft-West, Courtney J; Lima, Marcelo A; Skidmore, Mark A; Karlsson, Richard; Chen, Yen-Hsi; Bagdonaite, Ieva; Yang, Zhang; Ahmed, Yassir A; Richard, Derek J; Turnbul, Jeremy; Ferro, Vito; Coombe, Deirdre R; Gandhi, Neha S",,,203

OBJECTIVES: This study compared the results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR using different simple nucleic acid extraction methods on nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens. STUDY DESIGN: Fifty nasopharyngeal swab and saliva specimens previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved. Three different methods of nucleic acid extraction were compared. The first method involves incubating the specimen with proteinase K, and then heat treatment at 98â¯°C for 5â¯min (PKH); the second method involves heat treatment at 98â¯°C for 5â¯min without proteinase K pre-incubation (heat only); the third method involves no pre-processing steps (direct). The products from all 3 methods were tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: PKH had significantly higher positive rate in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (80 %) than those of heat only (58 %; Pâ¯=â¯0.001) or direct (56 %; Pâ¯=â¯0.002). The median Ct value was significantly earlier for PKH (median Ct: 37.0, IQR 31.7-40) than that of heat only (median Ct: 40, IQR 36.2-41; Pâ¯<â¯0.0001) and direct (median Ct, 37.5; IQR 33.9-41.0; Pâ¯=â¯0.0049). Subgroup analysis showed that PKH had higher detection rate, lower limit of detection and earlier Ct values than the other two groups for both NPS and saliva specimens. CONCLUSIONS: PKH pre-processing resulted in the highest detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, and represents an alternative method for nucleic acid extraction when commercial extraction kits are not available.","Chu, Allen Wing-Ho; Chan, Wan-Mui; Ip, Jonathan Daniel; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",J Clin Virol,,203

CoV infection mostly occurs during winter and spring in temperate countries; the virus has high transmission efficiency and may have severe infection outcomes. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak exhibited transboundary transmission due to international transportation, trade, and economic exchange. Animal hosts provide a persistent source for CoVs and their recombination. Domestic camels have been shown to be one of the hosts of CoVs, while livestock, poultry and other warm-blooded animals may act as intermediate hosts for CoVs. This paper outlines the biological and epidemiological characteristics and diagnosis of CoVs and describes the origin, transmission route, animal-source food risk, and control measures for CoVs. Such knowledge can be used to prevent CoVs from harming consumers through animal-sourced foods and can help to prevent new zoonoses from occurring.

Here, we performed comprehensive differential molecular profiling between TMJ fibrous and bony ankylosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Six sheep were used and a bilateral different degree of TMJ trauma was performed to induce fibrous ankylosis in one side and bony ankylosis in the other side. The ankylosed calluses were harvested at days 14 and 28 postoperatively and analyzed by Affymetrix OviGene-1_0-ST microarrays. DAVID was used to perform the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis for the different expression genes (DEGs). The DEGs were also typed into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to get the interaction data. Ten DEGs, including 7 hub genes from PPI analysis, were confirmed by real-time PCR. RESULTS We found 90 and 323 DEGs at least 2-fold at days 14 and 28, respectively. At day 14, bony ankylosis showed upregulated DEGs, such as TLR8, SYK, NFKBIA, PTPRC, CD86, ITGAM, and ITGAL, indicating a stronger immune and inflammatory response and cell adhesion, while genes associated with anti-adhesion (PRG4) and inhibition of osteoblast differentiation (SFRP1) had higher expression in fibrous ankylosis. At day 28, bony ankylosis showed increased biological process related to new bone formation, while fibrous ankylosis was characterized by a prolonged immune and inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSIONS This study provides a differential gene expression profile between TMJ fibrous and bony ankylosis. Further study of these key genes may provide new ideas for future treatment of TMJ bony ankylosis.","Zhang, Tong-Mei; Yang, Kun; Liang, Su-Xia; Tian, Yuan-Yuan; Xu, Zhao-Yuan; Liu, Hao; Yan, Ying-Bin",Med Sci Monit,,203

The pathogenetic role of the ""cytokine storm"" has been confirmed by the efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs such as corticosteroids along with antiviral drugs in the treatment of the severe forms of this disease. Phenylmethimazole (C10) is a derivative of methimazole with anti-inflammatory properties. Studies performed both in vitro and in vivo have shown that C10 is able to block the production of multiple cytokines, chemokines, and other proinflammatory molecules involved in the pathogenesis of inflammation. Particularly, C10 is effective in reducing the increased secretion of cytokines in animal models of endotoxic shock. We hypothesize that these effects are not limited to the endotoxic shock, but can also be applied to any disease characterized by the presence of a ""cytokine storm"". Therefore, C10 may be a potential drug to be used alternatively or in association with the corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents in the severe forms of COVID-19 as well as other viral diseases that induce a ""cytokine storm"".

However, it often decreases the spatial resolution. The ability of high spatial resolution kernels (harder kernels) to compensate for the decrease in the spatial resolution of hybrid IRs was investigated. METHODS: An elliptic cylindrical phantom simulating an adult abdomen was used. Two types of rod-shaped objects with ~330 and ~130 HU were inserted to simulate contrasts of arteries in CT angiography. Two multi-slice CT systems were used to scan the phantoms with 120 kVp and scan doses of 20 and 10 mGy. The task transfer functions (TTFs) were measured from the circular edges of the rod images. The noise power spectrum (NPS) was measured from the images of the water-only section. The CT images were reconstructed using a filtered back projection (FBP) with baseline kernels and two levels of hybrid IRs with harder kernels. The profiles of the clinical images across the aortic dissection flaps were measured to evaluate actual spatial resolutions. RESULTS: The TTF degradation of each hybrid IR was recovered by the harder kernels, whereas the noise reduction effect was retained, for both the 20 and 10 mGy. The profiles of the dissection flaps for the FBP were maintained by using the harder kernels. Even with the best combination of hybrid IR and harder kernel, the noise level at 10 mGy was not reduced to the level of FBP at 20 mGy, suggesting no capability of a 50% dose reduction while maintaining noise.","Sugisawa, Koichi; Ichikawa, Katsuhiro; Urikura, Atsushi; Minamishima, Kazuya; Masuda, Shota; Hoshino, Takashi; Nakahara, Akiko; Yamada, Yoshitake; Jinzaki, Masahiro",Phys Med,,203

The long-standing relationship between the clinic and neighborhood residents has facilitated ongoing management of physical and mental health conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the clinic's history of confronting infectious diseases has equipped it to adapt preventive services to meet patients' needs during the pandemic. Our academic-community partnership used a multidisciplinary approach, relying on analysis of historical data, ethnographic data, and direct clinical experience. We identify specific prevention strategies alongside areas for improvement.

Here we report the discovery of a neutralizing nanobody, VHH60, directly produced from a humanized synthetic nanobody library. VHH60 competes with human ACE2 to bind the receptor binding domain of the Spike protein with a KD of 2.56 nM, inhibits infections of both live SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped viruses harboring wildtype, escape mutations and prevailing variants at nanomolar level. VHH60 also suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection and propagation 50-fold better and protects mice from death two times longer than that of control group after live virus inoculation on mice. VHH60 therefore is a powerful synthetic nanobody with a promising profile for disease control against COVID19.","Liu, Qianyun; Cai, Chenguang; Huang, Yanyan; Zhou, Li; Guan, Yanbin; Fu, Shiying; Lin, Youyou; Yang, Ting; Liang, Xiaohua; Wang, Nanyan; Zhang, Fengzhi; Sun, Qi; Bai, Ying; Chen, Yu; Yan, Huan; Zhang, Zhen; Lan, Ke; Li, Xiang; Hou, Shin-Chen; Xiong, Yi",,,203

354346,Safety and immunogenicity of one versus two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 for patients with cancer: interim analysis of a prospective observational study,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Spain is in a situation of indefinite lockdown due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. One of the consequences of this lockdown is delays in medical and surgical procedures for common diseases. The aim of this study was to model the impact on survival of tumor growth caused by such delays in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study. We constructed an exponential growth model for both SCC and melanoma to estimate tumor growth between patient-reported onset and surgical excision at different time points. RESULTS: Data from 200 patients with SCC of the head and neck and 1000 patients with cutaneous melanoma were included. An exponential growth curve was calculated for each tumor type and we estimated tumor size after 1, 2, and 3 months of potential surgical delay. The proportion of patients with T3 SCC (diameter >4cm or thickness >6mm) increased from 41.5% (83 patients) in the initial study group to an estimated 58.5%, 70.5%, and 72% after 1, 2, and 3 months of delay. Disease-specific survival at 2, 5, and 10 years in patients whose surgery was delayed by 3 months decreased by 6.2%, 8.2%, and 5.2%, respectively. The proportion of patients with ultrathick melanoma (>6mm) increased from 6.9% in the initial study group to 21.9%, 30.2%, and 30.2% at 1, 2, and 3 months. Five- and 10-year disease-specific survival both decreased by 14.4% in patients treated after a potential delay of 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment of SCC and melanoma in the current lockdown situation in Spain, we can expect to see to a considerable increase in large and thick SCCs and melanomas. Efforts must be taken to encourage self-examination and facilitate access to dermatologists in order to prevent further delays.","Tejera-Vaquerizo, A; Cañueto, J; Toll, A; Santos-Juanes, J; Jaka, A; Ferrandiz-Pulido, C; Sanmartín, O; Ribero, S; Moreno-Ramírez, D; Almazán, F; Fuente, M J; Podlipnik, S; Nagore, E",Actas dermo-sifiliogr.

355163,The Prevalence of Arterial Hypertension among Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Information about the long-term effects of hand hygiene (HH) interventions is needed. We aimed to investigate the change in HH compliance (HHC) of healthcare workers (HCWs) once a data-driven feedback intervention was stopped, and to assess if the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the HH behavior. METHODS: We conducted an observational, extension trial in a surgical department between January 2019-December 2020. Doctors (n = 19) and nurses (n = 53) were included and their HHC was measured using an electronic HH monitoring system (EHHMS). We compared the changes in HHC during 3 phases: (1) Intervention (data presentation meetings), (2) Prepandemic follow-up and (3) Follow-up during COVID-19. RESULTS: The HHC during phase 1 (intervention), phase 2 (prepandemic follow-up) and phase 3 (follow-up during COVID-19) was 58%, 46%, and 34%, respectively. Comparison analyses revealed that the HHC was significantly lower in the prepandemic follow-up period (46% vs 58%, P < .0001) and in the follow-up period during COVID-19 (34% vs 58%, P < .0001) compared with the intervention period (phase 1). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the HHC of the HCWs significantly decreased over time once the data presentation meetings from management stopped. This study demonstrates that HCWs fall back into old HH routines once improvement initiatives are stopped.","Stangerup, Marie; Hansen, Marco B; Hansen, Rosa; Sode, Louise P; Hesselbo, Bjørn; Kostadinov, Krassimir; Olesen, Bente S; Calum, Henrik",Am. j. infect. control,,203

356897,The risk of QTc-interval prolongation in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine,2020,"Purpose: While it is particularly important that professional programs help teachers become members of a community of practice, especially in crisis situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a lack of research about strategies to effectively encourage the development of a community of practice and to support teachers’ transformation of their way of teaching. Thus, this paper aims to report on lessons learned from a blended professional development (PD) program for elementary and middle school teachers in Japan focused on computer programming education. In particular, the authors explored how application of the creative learning principles in the blended teacher PD may have helped to nurture a community of practice among teachers in Japan, and how the creative learning principles may be a valuable framework for designing online or blended teacher PD to support teachers’ transition into emergency remote education. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on the lessons learned from two iterations of blended teacher PD situated within a larger design-based research project on applying creative learning pedagogy in teacher PD. Creative learning is a learning approach focused on engagement in personally meaningful projects by tinkering with materials and learning from peers. A total of 26 teachers and coaches participated, all of whom work in elementary or middle schools across Nagano prefecture in Japan. Participant experiences were evaluated based on a pre-survey and a post-survey conducted before and after the in-person kick-off camp; observation notes taken; a final report submitted by each teacher; a debrief meeting at the end of the program; and semi-structured interviews with three selected participants after the program concluded. For this paper, the authors focus on two participants who fully and actively engaged in the program, and they introduce their stories to highlight the outcomes from the PD. Findings: The results highlight how a blended PD designed to support creative learning of teachers provided teachers with opportunities to gain help from other teachers and cultivate their expertise. The results also illustrated that how a community of practice emerged from the PD program, providing teachers with moral support when they tried new lesson designs. This paper offers several recommendations for designing professional learning experiences for instructional designers and professional developers that incorporate remote learning technologies. Originality/value: While an increased number of studies have shown the values of online and blended communities of practice for teacher PD, there are still limited insights on different strategies to support teachers in transforming their teaching practices. They generally do not provide teachers with opportunities to continue learning with and from one another beyond the program itself. This study examined the teachers’ experiences in a unique PD that implemented a creative learning approach into a blended learning environment for teachers.","Murai, Yumiko; Muramatsu, Hiroyuki",inform.Learn.Sci,,203

356913,Viral Load Dynamics in Sputum and Nasopharyngeal Swab in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"The infection by COVID-19 is a serious global public health problem. An efficient way to improve this disease's clinical management would be to characterize patients at higher risk of progressing to critically severe infection using prognostic biomarkers. The telomere length could be used for this purpose. Telomeres are responsible for controlling the number of maximum cell divisions. The telomere length is a biomarker of aging and several diseases. We aimed to compare leukocyte telomere length (LTL) between patients without COVID-19 and patients with different clinical severity of the infection. Were included 53 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR divided in four groups. The first group was composed by patients with a negative diagnosis for COVID-19 (n = 12). The other three groups consisted of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 divided according to the severity of the disease: mild (n = 15), moderate (n = 17) and severe (n = 9). The LTL was determined by Q-PCR. The severe group had the shortest LTL, followed by the moderate group. The negative and mild groups showed no differences. There is an increase of patients with hypertension (p = 0.0099) and diabetes (p = 0.0067) in moderate and severe groups. Severe group was composed by older patients in comparison with the other three groups (p = 0.0083). Regarding sex, there was no significant difference between groups (p = 0.6279). In an ordinal regression model, only LTL and diabetes were significantly associated with disease severity. Shorter telomere length was significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection, which can be useful as a biomarker or to better understand the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology.","Arantes dos Santos, Gabriel Pimenta Ruan Viana Nayara I.; Guimarães, Vanessa R.; Romão, Poliana Candido Patrícia de Camargo Juliana A.; Hatanaka, Diná M.; Queiroz, Paula G.

In response, the Australian and New Zealand governments activated their respective emergency plans and hospital frameworks to deal with the potential increased demand on scarce resources. Surgical triage formed an important part of this response to protect the healthcare system's capacity to respond to COVID-19. METHOD: A rapid review methodology was adapted to search for all levels of evidence on triaging surgery during the current COVID-19 outbreak. Searches were limited to PubMed (inception to 10 April 2020) and supplemented with grey literature searches using the Google search engine. Further, relevant articles were also sourced through the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons COVID-19 Working Group. Recent government advice (May 2020) is also included. RESULTS: This rapid review is a summary of advice from Australian, New Zealand and international speciality groups regarding triaging of surgical cases, as well as the peer-reviewed literature. The key theme across all jurisdictions was to not compromise clinical judgement and to enable individualized, ethical and patient-centred care. The topics reported on include implications of COVID-19 on surgical triage, competing demands on healthcare resources (surgery versus COVID-19 cases), and the low incidence of COVID-19 resulting in a possibility to increase surgical caseloads over time. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergency surgery must continue. A carefully staged return of elective surgery should align with a decrease in COVID-19 caseload. Combining evidence and expert opinion, schemas and recommendations have been proposed to guide this process in Australia and New Zealand.","Babidge, Wendy J; Tivey, David R; Kovoor, Joshua G; Weidenbach, Kristin; Collinson, Trevor G; Hewett, Peter J; Hugh, Thomas J; Padbury, Robert T A; Hill, Nicola M; Maddern, Guy J",ANZ j.

358551,COVID-19 and Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Coinfection: A Case Report,2021,"The emergence of a pandemic affecting the respiratory system can result in a significant demand for face masks. This includes the use of cloth masks by large sections of the public, as can be seen during the current global spread of COVID-19. However, there is limited knowledge available on the performance of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks. Importantly, there is a need to evaluate filtration efficiencies as a function of aerosol particulate sizes in the 10 nm to 10 µm range, which is particularly relevant for respiratory virus transmission. We have carried out these studies for several common fabrics including cotton, silk, chiffon, flannel, various synthetics, and their combinations. Although the filtration efficiencies for various fabrics when a single layer was used ranged from 5 to 80% and 5 to 95% for particle sizes of <300 nm and >300 nm, respectively, the efficiencies improved when multiple layers were used and when using a specific combination of different fabrics. Filtration efficiencies of the hybrids (such as cotton-silk, cotton-chiffon, cotton-flannel) was >80% (for particles <300 nm) and >90% (for particles >300 nm). We speculate that the enhanced performance of the hybrids is likely due to the combined effect of mechanical and electrostatic-based filtration. Cotton, the most widely used material for cloth masks performs better at higher weave densities (i.e., thread count) and can make a significant difference in filtration efficiencies. Our studies also imply that gaps (as caused by an improper fit of the mask) can result in over a 60% decrease in the filtration efficiency, implying the need for future cloth mask design studies to take into account issues of ""fit"" and leakage, while allowing the exhaled air to vent efficiently. Overall, we find that combinations of various commonly available fabrics used in cloth masks can potentially provide significant protection against the transmission of aerosol particles.","Konda, Abhiteja; Prakash, Abhinav; Moss, Gregory A; Schmoldt, Michael; Grant, Gregory D; Guha, Supratik",ACS Nano,,203
358898,COVID19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic; however, effective treatment for COVID-19 remains to be established. Along with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), new and old cardiovascular injuries are important causes of significant morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Exploring new approaches managing cardiovascular complications is essential in controlling the disease progression and preventing long-term complications. Oxytocin (OXT), an immune-regulating neuropeptide, has recently emerged as a strong candidate for treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pandemic. OXT carries special functions in immunologic defense, homeostasis and surveillance. It suppresses neutrophil infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release, activates T-lymphocytes, and antagonizes negative effects of angiotensin II and other key pathological events of COVID-19. Additionally, OXT can promote Î³-interferon expression to inhibit cathepsin L and increases superoxide dismutase expression to reduce heparin and heparan sulphate fragmentation. Through these mechanisms, OXT can block viral invasion, suppress cytokine storm, reverse lymphocytopenia, and prevent progression to ARDS and multiple organ failures. Importantly, besides prevention of metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, OXT can protect the heart and vasculature through suppressing hypertension and brain-heart syndrome, and promoting regeneration of injured cardiomyocytes. Unlike other therapeutic agents, exogenous OXT can be used safely without the side-effects seen in remdesivir and corticosteroid. Importantly, OXT can be mobilized endogenously to prevent pathogenesis of COVID-19. This article summarizes our current understandings of cardiovascular pathogenesis caused by COVID-19, explores the protective potentials of OXT against COVID-19-associated cardiovascular diseases, and discusses challenges in applying OXT in treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets lung epithelium cells, there is growing evidence that the intestinal epithelium is also infected. Here, using both colon-derived cell lines and primary non-transformed colon organoids, we engage in the first comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle in human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). Our results demonstrate that hIECs fully support SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and production of infectious de novo virus particles. We found that viral infection elicits an extremely robust intrinsic immune response where interferon-mediated responses are efficient at controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication and de novo virus production. Taken together, our data demonstrate that hIECs are a productive site of SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggest that the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 may participate in the pathologies observed in COVID-19 patients by contributing to increasing patient viremia and fueling an exacerbated cytokine response.","Stanifer, Megan L; Kee, Carmon; Cortese, Mirko; Zumaran, Camila Metz; Triana, Sergio; Mukenhirn, Markus; Kraeusslich, Hans-Georg; Alexandrov, Theodore; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Boulant, Steeve",Cell Rep,,203

360480,Implications of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer management: A multidisciplinary perspective,2020,"PURPOSE: The onset of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Italy induced a dramatic increase in the need for intensive care unit (ICU) beds for a large proportion of patients affected by COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The aim of the present study was to describe the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at 90 days after ICU discharge in a cohort of COVID-19 patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation and to compare it with an age and sex-matched sample from the general Italian and Finnish populations. Moreover, the possible associations between clinical, demographic, social factors, and HRQoL were investigated. METHODS: COVID-19 ARDS survivors from 16 participating ICUs were followed up until 90 days after ICU discharge and the HRQoL was evaluated with the 15D instrument. A parallel cohort of age and sex-matched Italian population from the same geographic areas was interviewed and a third group of matched Finnish population was extracted from the Finnish 2011 National Health survey. A linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate potential associations between the evaluated factors and HRQoL. RESULTS: 205 patients answered to the questionnaire. HRQoL of the COVID-19 ARDS patients was significantly lower than the matched populations in both physical and mental dimensions. Age, sex, number of comorbidities, ARDS class, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and occupational status were found to be significant determinants of the 90 days HRQoL. Clinical severity at ICU admission was poorly correlated to HRQoL. CONCLUSION: COVID-19-related ARDS survivors at 90 days after ICU discharge present a significant reduction both on physical and psychological dimensions of HRQoL measured with the 15D instrument.

361394,Implications of left ventricular function on short-term outcomes in COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury,2021,"Importance: Understanding the effect of serum antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on susceptibility to infection is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for vaccine deployment. Objective: The study purpose was to evaluate evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) among patients with positive vs negative test results for antibodies in an observational descriptive cohort study of clinical laboratory and linked claims data. Design, Setting, and Participants: The study created cohorts from a deidentified data set composed of commercial laboratory tests, medical and pharmacy claims, electronic health records, and hospital chargemaster data. Patients were categorized as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in the database. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end points were post-index diagnostic NAAT results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of the index antibody test, including recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence of coronavirus 2019 (COVID) diagnoses or positive NAAT results and recorded comorbidities. Results: The cohort included 3â¯257â¯478 unique patients with an index antibody test; 56% were female with a median (SD) age of 48 (20) years. Of these, 2â¯876â¯773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, and 378â¯606 (11.6%) had a positive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test result were older than those with a positive result (mean age 48 vs 44 years). Of index-positive patients, 18.4% converted to seronegative over the follow-up period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (95% CI) of positive NAAT results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index vs those with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (95% CI, 2.73-2.97) at 0 to 30 days, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.6-0.74) at 31 to 60 days, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) at 61 to 90 days, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19) at more than 90 days. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, patients with positive antibody test results were initially more likely to have positive NAAT results, consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but became markedly less likely to have positive NAAT results over time, suggesting that seropositivity is associated with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown, and protection may wane over time.","Harvey, Raymond A; Rassen, Jeremy A; Kabelac, Carly A; Turenne, Wendy; Leonard, Sandy; Klesh, Reyna; Meyer, William A; Kaufman, Harvey W; Anderson, Steve; Cohen, Oren; Petkov, Valentina I; Cronin, Kathy A; Van Dyke, Alison L; Lowy, Douglas R; Sharpless, Norman E; Penberthy, Lynne T",JAMA intern. med.

To this end, data from the national COVID-19 vaccination register was added to the national register of COVID-19 hospitalizations. For the study period 4 April - 29 August 2021, 15,571 hospitalized people with COVID-19 were included in the analysis, of whom 887 (5.7%) were fully vaccinated. Incidence rates of hospitalizations and ICU admissions per age group and vaccination status were calculated, and VE was estimated as 1-incidence rate ratio, adjusted for calendar date and age group in a negative binomial regression model. VE against hospitalization for full vaccination was 94% (95%CI 93-95%) in the Alpha period and 95% (95%CI 94-95%) in the Delta period. The VE for full vaccination against ICU admission was 93% (95%CI 87-96%) in the Alpha period and 97% (95%CI 97-98%) in the Delta period. VE was high in all age groups and did not show waning with time since vaccination up to 20 weeks after full vaccination.","Gier, Brechje de; Kooijman, Marjolein; Kemmeren, Jeanet; Keizer, Nicolette de; Dongelmans, Dave; Iersel, Senna C.J.L. van; Kassteele, Jan van de; Andeweg, Stijn P.; team, - the RIVM COVID-19 epidemiology and surveillance; Melker, Hester E. de; Hahné, Susan J.M.; Knol, Mirjam J.; Hof, Susan van den",,,203

362281,Association of right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension with adverse 30-day outcomes in COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in regions endemic for both Dengue and Chikungunya is still not fully understood. Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. METHODS: Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020. FINDINGS: Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya.","Stringari, Lorenzzo Lyrio; de Souza, Michel Norbim; de Medeiros Junior, Nésio Fernandes; Goulart, Jaqueline Pegoretti; Giuberti, Camila; Dietze, Reynaldo; Ribeiro-Rodrigues, Rodrigo",PLoS One,,203

While SMS text message outreach has been used to build health literacy and provide social support, few studies have explored the benefits of SMS text messaging combined with visual stories to influence health behaviors and build knowledge and self-efficacy. In particular, this approach can be used to provide vital information, resources, empathy, and support to the most vulnerable populations.

The infection causes COVID-19, a disease of the respiratory system of divergent severity. Here, the humoral immune response of a cohort of 143 COVID-19 patients from the University Hospital Frankfurt/Main, Germany was characterized. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SARS-CoV-2 and hCoV NL63 neutralization activity was analyzed with pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. RESULTS: COVID-19 severity increased with age and male patients encountered more serious symptoms than females. Disease severity correlated with the amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and IgA and the neutralization activity of the antibodies. The amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies decreased with time after PCR conformation of the infection and antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein waned faster than spike directed antibodies. In contrast, for the common flu coronavirus NL63, COVID19 disease severity seemed to correlate with low NL63-neutralizing activities, suggesting the possibility of cross-reactive protection. CONCLUSION: The results describe the humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and might aid the identification of correlates of protection needed for vaccine development.","Henss, Lisa; Scholz, Tatjana; von Rhein, Christine; Wieters, Imke; Borgans, Frauke; Eberhardt, Fabian J; Zacharowski, Kai; Ciesek, Sandra; Rohde, Gernot; Vehreschild, Maria; Stephan, Christoph; Wolf, Timo; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Scheiblauer, Heinrich; Schnierle, Barbara S",,,203

We collected health department costs for video DOT (VDOT; live and recorded), and in-person DOT (field- and clinic-based). Time-motion surveys estimated provider time and cost. A separate survey collected patient costs. We used a regression model to estimate cost by DOT type.Results. Between August 2017 and June 2018, 343 DOT sessions were captured from 225 patients; 87 completed a survey. Patient costs were lowest for VDOT live ($1.01) and highest for clinic DOT ($34.53).

The objective of this case series is to describe early neonatal outcomes and inpatient management in U.S. hospitals. STUDY DESIGN: We solicited cases of mother-infant dyads affected by novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from the Better Outcomes through Research for Newborns (BORN) Network members. Using a structured case template, participating sites contributed deidentified, retrospective birth hospitalization data for neonates &#8805;35 weeks of gestation at birth with mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 before delivery. We describe demographic and clinical characteristics, clinical management, and neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: Sixteen U.S. hospitals contributed 70 cases. Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for 66 (94%) neonates in which 4 (6%) required admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. None required evaluation or treatment for infection, and all who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 were negative (n = 57). Half of the dyads were colocated (n = 34) and 40% directly breastfed (n = 28). Outpatient follow-up data were available for 13 neonates, all of whom remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: In this multisite case series of 70 neonates born to women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical outcomes were overall good, and there were no documented neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Clinical management was largely inconsistent with contemporaneous U.S. COVID-19 guidelines for nursery care, suggesting concerns about the acceptability and feasibility of those recommendations. Longitudinal studies are urgently needed to assess the benefits and harms of current practices to inform evidence-based clinical care and aid shared decision-making. KEY POINTS: · Birth hospitalizations were uncomplicated for late preterm and term infants with maternal COVID-19.. · Nursery management of dyads affected by COVID-19 varied between hospitals.. · Adherence to contemporaneous U.S. clinical guidelines for nursery care was low.. · Breastfeeding rates were lower for dyads roomed separately than those who were colocated..","Congdon, Jayme L; Kair, Laura R; Flaherman, Valerie J; Wood, Kelly E; LoFrumento, Mary Ann; Nwaobasi-Iwuh, Eberechi; Phillipi, Carrie A",Am J Perinatol,,203
368615,Quantitative assessment of retinal changes in COVID-19 patients,2021,"The ongoing pandemic of global concern has killed about three million humans and affected around 151 million people worldwide, as of April 30, 2021. Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area. We have summarized and illustrated the significance and the potential of the siRNA therapeutics available as of April 30, 2021 to combat the ongoing viral pandemic and the emerging new variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Numerous successful in vitro studies and several investigations to address the clinical application of siRNA therapeutics provide great hope in this field. This seminal Review describes the significance of siRNA-based therapy to treat diverse viral infections in addition to the current coronavirus challenge. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the patents approved for coronaviruses, the major challenges in siRNA therapy, and the potential approaches to address them, followed by innovation and prospects.","Sajid, Muhammad Imran; Moazzam, Muhammad; Cho, Yeseom; Kato, Shun; Xu, Ava; Way, J J; Lohan, Sandeep; Tiwari, Rakesh K",Mol. pharm,,203
368822,Unilateral livedo reticularis in COVID-19 patient: Case with fatal outcome,2020,"ObjectivesTo calculate the observed rates of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, infection with SARS-CoV-2, and to compare them to background (expected) rates in the general population. DesignCohort study using routinely collected primary care records. SettingRoutine practice in the United Kingdom. ParticipantsTwo mutually exclusive vaccinated cohorts included people vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 between 8 December 2020 and 6 March 2021. A third cohort consisted of people newly infected with SARS-Cov-2 identified by a first positive RT-PCR test between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2021. The fourth general population cohort for background rates included those people with a visit between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019. In total, we included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population. InterventionsFirst-dose of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 Main outcome measuresOutcomes included venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia. Outcome rates were estimated for recipients of the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines, for people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and background rates in the general population. Indirectly standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were estimated. ResultsWe included 1,868,767 ChAdOx1 and 1,661,139 BNT162b2 vaccinees, 299,311 people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 2,290,537 people from the general population for background rates. The SIRs for pulmonary embolism were 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39] after vaccination with ChAdOx1, 1.21 [1.07-1.36] after vaccination with BNT162b2, and 15.31 [14.08 to 16.65] for infection with SARS-CoV-2. The SIRs for thrombocytopenia after vaccination were 1.25 [1.19 to 1.31] for ChAdOx1 and 0.99 (0.94 to 1.04) for BNT162b2. Rates of deep vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis were similar among those vaccinated and the general population. ConclusionsChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 had broadly similar safety profiles. Thrombosis rates after either vaccine were mostly similar to those of the general population.

369550,Which role for chest x-ray score in predicting the outcome in COVID-19 pneumonia?,2020,"The first case of 2019-nCoV pneumonia infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, South China Seafood Market in December 2019. As a group with a high probability of infection, health workers are faced with a certain degree of psychological challenges in the process of facing the epidemic. This study attempts to evaluate the impact of 2019-nCoV outbreak on the psychological state of Chinese health workers and to explore the influencing factors. During the period from 31 January 2020 to 4 February 2020, the 'Questionnaire Star' electronic questionnaire system was used to collect data. The 2019-nCoV impact questionnaire and The Impact of Event Scale (IES) were used to check the psychological status of health workers in China. A total of 442 valid data were collected in this study. Seventy-four (16.7%) male and 368 (83.3%) female individuals participated in this study. The average score of high arousal dimension was 5.15 (s.d. = 4.71), and the median score was 4.0 (IQR 2.0, 7.0). The average score of IES was 15.26 (s.d. = 11.23), and the median score was 13.5 (IQR 7.0, 21.0). Multiple regression analysis showed that there were critical statistical differences in high arousal scores among different gender groups (male 3.0 vs. female 5.0, P = 0.075). Whether being quarantined had significant statistical differences of IES scores (being quarantined 16.0 vs. not being quarantined 13.0, P = 0.021). The overall impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak on health workers is at a mild level. Chinese health workers have good psychological coping ability in the face of public health emergencies.","Sun, Dandan; Yang, Dongliang; Li, Yafen; Zhou, Jie; Wang, Wenqing; Wang, Quanliang; Lin, Nan; Cao, Ailin; Wang, Haichen; Zhang, Qingyun",Epidemiol Infect,,203

370204,Acute Pancreatitis During COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), continues to be a pressing health concern. In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host microRNA (miRNA) populations in three human lung-derived cell lines, as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We did not detect any major and consistent differences in host miRNA levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we unexpectedly discovered a viral miRNA-like small RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a transcript. Its abundance ranges from low to moderate as compared to host miRNAs. vmiR-5p functionally associates with Argonaute proteins -- core components of the RNA interference pathway -- leading to downregulation of host transcripts. One such host messenger RNA encodes Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2 (BATF2), which is linked to interferon signaling. We demonstrate that vmiR-5p production relies on cellular machinery, yet is independent of Drosha protein, and is enhanced by the presence of a strong and evolutionarily conserved hairpin formed within the ORF7a sequence. Significance statementWe discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) expresses a small viral non-coding RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the ORF7a transcript. vmiR-5p associates with the cellular RNA interference machinery to regulate host transcripts likely via target silencing. The production of vmiR-5p relies on cellular machinery and the formation of a strong hairpin within ORF7a sequences. This newly-described vmiR-5p may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and could become a target for therapeutic intervention.","Pawlica, Paulina; Yario, Therese; White, Sylvia; Wang, Jianhui; Moss, Walter; Hui, Pei; Vinetz, Joseph M.; Steitz, Joan A",,,203
370360,Early-onset symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery in the setting of COVID-19 infection,2021,"Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus have boosted the need of knowledge about inactivation mechanisms to minimize the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 virus can be disabled by heating, the exposure time for total inactivation depending on the reached temperature (e.g. more than 45 min at 329 K or less than 5 min at 373 K. In spite of recent crystallographic structures, little is known about the molecular changes induced by the temperature. Here, we unravel the molecular basis of the effect of the temperature over the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which is a homotrimer with three identical monomers, by executing atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at 298, 310, 324, 338, 358 and 373 K. Furthermore, both the closed down and open up conformational states, which affect the accessibility of receptor binding domain, have been considered. Our results suggest that the spike homotrimer undergoes drastic changes in the topology of the hydrogen bonding interactions and important changes on the secondary structure of the receptor binding domain (RBD), while electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt bridges) are mainly preserved. The proposed inactivation mechanism has important implications for engineering new approaches to fight the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, as for example, cleaving or reorganizing the hydrogen bonds through chaotropic agents or nanoparticles with local surface resonant plasmon effect.","Martí, Didac; Torras, Juan; Bertran, Oscar; Turon, Pau; Alemán, Carlos",,,203
370414,Prognostic Value and Reproducibility of AI-assisted Analysis of Lung Involvement in COVID-19 on Low-Dose Submillisievert Chest CT: Sample Size Implications for Clinical Trials,2020,"BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy (ET)-based regimens are the mainstay of treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer. With the introduction of new treatment classes, it is important to examine patient symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the start of this changing therapeutic landscape. This real-world study describes the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ET-based regimens who were naïve to systemic treatment in the advanced setting across five European countries (EU5). METHODS: Data were collected between March and July 2017 from surveyed oncologists and their patients at a single time point using the multinational Adelphi Advanced Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme&#8482;. Patients completed PRO questionnaires on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), pain severity and interference, and work and activity impairment. A multiple linear regression model explored factors associated with HRQoL. RESULTS: Across EU5, 226 physicians provided data on 781 women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer taking their first ET-based regimen for advanced disease, of whom 252 provided PRO data. This subset had a mean age of 67.1 years, 94% were postmenopausal, 89% were diagnosed with advanced breast cancer at initial presentation, 79% had stage IV disease (66% of these patients had bone metastases and 38% had visceral metastases, including 18% with liver metastases) and 77% were on endocrine-only therapy as their initial treatment for advanced disease. The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 global health score (50.9) was worse than the reference value for patients with advanced breast cancer (60.2). Fatigue, pain, and insomnia were the most severe symptoms, and mean functioning scores were also worse than reference values. ""Worst pain"" and ""pain interference"" were moderate/severe for 42 and 80% of patients. Mean activity impairment was 44%, and greater activity impairment was associated with poorer HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Despite receiving first-line ET-based regimens for advanced disease, these women had a poor HRQoL and high levels of symptoms, pain, pain interference and activity impairment. New treatments that maintain a stable disease state and reduce activity impairment may have a positive effect on the HRQoL of those living with advanced breast cancer.","Davie, Alison; Carter, Gebra Cuyun; Rider, Alex; Pike, James; Lewis, Katie; Bailey, Abigail; Price, Gregory L; Ringeisen, Francois; Pivot, Xavier",BMC Cancer,,203

To this end, we describe how a computer-based monitoring system can support the delivery of the New Beginnings Program (NBP), a parent-focused evidence-based prevention program for divorcing parents. METHOD: We present NBP from a novel systems approach that incorporates social system informatics and engineering, both necessary when utilizing feedback loops, ubiquitous in implementation research and practice. Examples of two methodological challenges are presented: how to monitor implementation, and how to provide feedback by evaluating system-level changes due to implementation. RESULTS: We introduce and relate systems concepts to these two methodologic issues that are at the center of implementation methods. We explore how these system-level feedback loops address effectiveness, efficiency, and equity principles. These key principles are provided for designing an automated, low-burden, low-intrusive measurement system to aid fidelity monitoring and feedback that can be used in practice. DISCUSSION: As the COVID-19 pandemic now demands fewer face-to-face delivery systems, their replacement with more virtual systems for parent training interventions requires constructing new implementation measurement systems based on social system informatics approaches. These approaches include the automatic monitoring of quality and fidelity in parent training interventions. Finally, we present parallels of producing generalizable and local knowledge bridging systems science and engineering method. This comparison improves our understanding of system-level changes, facilitates a program's implementation, and produces knowledge for the field.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results, and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID-19 children, were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male-female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground-glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia (manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-&#945;. There were no differences in treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing, and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID-19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID-19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy, and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared with all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B, and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels, and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subset numbers, and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, and laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID-19 in children.","Du, Hui; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin-Jin; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Akdis, Mubeccel; Huang, Pei-Qi; Chen, Hong-Wei; Li, Ying; Liu, Guang-Hui; Akdis, Cezmi A; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,,203

We sought to determine whether this form of asthma is characterised by any unique physiological features. Methods: Spirometry, body plethysmography, multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) and methacholine challenge were performed in four subject groups: Lean Control (n=11), Lean Asthma (n=11), Obese Control (n=11) and LONA Obese Asthma (n=10). The MBNW data were fitted with a novel computational model that estimates functional residual capacity (FRC), dead space volume (VD), the coefficient of variation of regional specific ventilation (CV,V'E) and a measure of structural asymmetry at the level of the acinus (sacin). Results: Body mass index and waist circumference values were similar in both obese groups, and significantly greater than in lean asthmatic individuals and controls. Forced vital capacity was significantly lower in the LONA Asthma group compared with the other groups (p<0.001). Both asthma groups exhibited similar hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. FRC was reduced in the Obese LONA Asthma group as measured by MBNW, but not in obese controls, whereas FRC was reduced in both obese groups as measured by plethysmography. VD, CV,V'E and sacin were not different between groups. Conclusions: Chronic lung compression characterises all obese subjects, as reflected by reduced plethysmographic FRC. Obese LONA asthma is characterised by a reduced ability to recruit closed lung units, as seen by reduced MBNW FRC, and an increased tendency for airway closure as seen by a reduced forced vital capacity.","Dixon, Anne E; Peters, Ubong; Walsh, Ryan; Daphtary, Nirav; MacLean, Erick S; Hodgdon, Kevin; Kaminsky, David A; Bates, Jason H T",ERJ open res,,203

Thus, the objective of the present study was to holistically analyze the well-being of children during a period of full lockdown in Spain, by considering physical, emotional, social, and academic indicators. The scale “Well-being of Children in Lockdown” (WCL) was used to measure the well-being of 1225 children from 2 to 12 years old from Northern Spain. The survey was completed by the parents and was designed to analyze children’s well-being in terms of physical, emotional, social and academic aspects. The results suggest that the general well-being of children during lockdown was at an intermediate level. Analysis of the various measures of well-being revealed that the lowest levels were obtained for physical activity, along with creative and playful activities. Girls, younger children, and those who have access to an outdoor space showed the greatest levels of well-being.

RESULTS: The percentage of participants who reported use during pregnancy was 6.7 % for alcohol, 4.3 % for cannabis, 4.9 % for tobacco, and 0.3 % for illicit drugs; 2.6 % were using multiple substances. Higher depression symptoms and financial difficulties were associated with more cannabis and/or tobacco use as well as the co-use of substances. There were no associations between alcohol use and mental health or COVID-19 concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported rates of use and co-use were lower or comparable to previous research, perhaps reflecting pandemic-related circumstances or the demographics of this sample. Depression symptoms and pandemic-related financial difficulties were associated with more tobacco use, cannabis use, and substance co-use. It remains important to maintain access to perinatal, mental health, and financial supports during the pandemic to mitigate prenatal alcohol and substance use and prevent poor perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes for children.","Kar, Preeti; Tomfohr-Madsen, Lianne; Giesbrecht, Gerald; Bagshawe, Mercedes; Lebel, Catherine",Drug Alcohol Depend,,203

374978,Implicit Gradient Regularization,2020-09-23,"Temperature dependence of band gap is one of the most fundamental properties for semiconductors, and has strong influences on many applications. The renormalization of the band gap at finite temperatures is due to the lattice expansion and the phonon-induced atomic vibrations. In this work, we apply the recently-developed electron-phonon renormalization (EPR) method to study the temperature-dependent band gap in some classical covalent (diamond, Si, and SiC) and ionic semiconductors (MgO and NaCl). The contributions from both the lattice expansion and the phonon-induced atomic vibrations at finite temperatures are considered. The results show that the band gapsEgall decrease as temperatureTincreases, consistent with the experiments and other theoretical studies (e.g., from 0 K to 1500 K, the reductions are ~ 0.451 eV for diamond and ~ 1.148 eV for MgO, respectively). The covalent compounds investigated show weaker temperature dependences ofEgs than the ionic compounds, due to the much weaker lattice expansions and therefore low contributions from these. The zero-point motion effect has greater influence on the band gap in semiconductors with light atoms, such as diamond (reduction ~ 0.437 eV), due to larger atomic displacements. By decomposing the EPR effect into respective phonon modes, it is found that the high-frequency optical phonon vibrations dominate the temperature-dependent band gap in both covalent and ionic compounds. Our work provides the fundamental understandings on the temperature-dependent band gaps caused by lattice dynamics.","Zhang, Yiming; Wang, Ziyu; Xi, Jinyang; Yang, Jiong",J. phys. condens. matter,,203
375049,Dynamic changes in monocytes subsets in COVID-19 patients,2020,"Emission from Sgr A* is highly variable at both X-ray and infrared (IR) wavelengths. Observations over the last ~20 years have revealed X-ray flares that rise above a quiescent thermal background about once per day, while faint X-ray flares from Sgr A* are undetectable below the constant thermal emission. In contrast, the IR emission of Sgr A* is observed to be continuously variable. Recently, simultaneous observations have indicated a rise in IR flux density around the same time as every distinct X-ray flare, while the opposite is not always true (peaks in the IR emission may not be coincident with an X-ray flare). Characterizing the behaviour of these simultaneous X-ray/IR events and measuring any time lag between them can constrain models of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and the flare emission mechanism. Using 100+ hours of data from a coordinated campaign between the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we present results of the longest simultaneous IR and X-ray observations of Sgr A* taken to date. The cross-correlation between the IR and X-ray light curves in this unprecedented dataset, which includes four modest X-ray/IR flares, indicates that flaring in the X-ray may lead the IR by approximately 10-20 minutes with 68% confidence. However, the 99.7% confidence interval on the time-lag also includes zero, i.e., the flaring remains statistically consistent with simultaneity. Long duration and simultaneous multiwavelength observations of additional bright flares will improve our ability to constrain the flare timing characteristics and emission mechanisms, and must be a priority for Galactic Center observing campaigns.","Boyce, H.; Haggard, D.; Witzel, G.; Willner, S.

It can be synthetized by many yeast species in a one-step reduction of xylose. Arabinose is a common contaminant found in xylose and there is ongoing interest in finding biocatalysts that selectively produce xyltiol. From a screen of 99 yeasts, Barnettozyma populi Y-12728 was found to selectively produce xylitol from both mixed sugars and corn stover hemicellulosic hydrolysate. Here, fermentation conditions for xylitol production from xylose by B. populi were optimized. The medium for xylitol production was optimized through response surface methodology. The yeast produced 31.2 ± 0.4 g xylitol from xylose (50 g L-1) in 62 h using the optimized medium. The optimal pH for xylitol production was 6.0. Glucose (10 g L-1), acetic acid (6.0 g L-1), HMF (4 mM) and ethanol (2.0 g L-1) inhibited the xylitol production. The glucose inhibition was entirely mitigated by using a 2-stage aeration strategy, indicating that the yeast was inhibited by ethanol produced from glucose under low aeration. This culture strategy will greatly benefit xylitol production from hemicellulosic hydrolysates, which often contain glucose. This is the first report on optimization of xylitol production by a Barnettozyma species.","Saha, Badal C; Kennedy, Gregory J",Prep Biochem Biotechnol,,203

378326,Turbocharging NIV: how to increase oxygen delivery in home mechanical ventilators,2020,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have been highlighted as important risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. However, insufficient data exist on the wider context of infectious diseases in people with NCDs. We aimed to investigate the association between NCDs and the risk of death from any infection before the COVID-19 pandemic (up to Dec 31, 2019). METHODS: For this observational study, we used data from the UK Biobank observational cohort study to explore factors associated with infection death. We excluded participants if data were missing for comorbidities, body-mass index, smoking status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation, and if they were lost to follow-up or withdrew consent. Deaths were censored up to Dec 31, 2019. We used Poisson regression models including NCDs present at recruitment to the UK Biobank (obesity [defined by use of body-mass index] and self-reported hypertension, chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, other neurological disease, psychiatric disorder, and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease), age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and socioeconomic deprivation. Separate models were constructed with individual NCDs replaced by the total number of prevalent NCDs to define associations with multimorbidity. All analyses were repeated with non-infection-related death as an alternate outcome measure to establish differential associations of infection death and non-infection death. Associations are reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR) accompanied by 95% CIs. FINDINGS: After exclusion of 9210 (1·8%) of the 502â505 participants in the UK Biobank cohort, our study sample comprised 493â295 individuals. During 5â273â731 person-years of follow-up (median 10·9 years [IQR 10·1-11·6] per participant), 27â729 deaths occurred, of which 1385 (5%) were related to infection. Advancing age, male sex, smoking, socioeconomic deprivation, and all studied NCDs were independently associated with the rate of both infection death and non-infection death. Compared with White ethnicity, a pooled Black, Asian, and minority ethnicity group was associated with a reduced risk of infection death (IRR 0·64, 95% CI 0·46-0·87) and non-infection death (0·80, 0·75-0·86). Stronger associations with infection death than with non-infection death were observed for advancing age (age 65 years vs 45 years: 7·59, 95% CI 5·92-9·73, for infection death vs 5·21, 4·97-5·48, for non-infection death), current smoking (vs never smoking: 3·69, 3·19-4·26, vs 2·52, 2·44-2·61), socioeconomic deprivation (most vs least deprived quintile: 2·13, 1·78-2·56, vs 1·38, 1·33-1·43), class 3 obesity (vs non-obese: 2·21, 1·74-2·82, vs 1·55, 1·44-1·66), hypertension (1·36, 1·22-1·53, vs 1·15, 1·12-1·18), respiratory disease (2·21, 1·96-2·50, vs 1·28, 1·24-1·32), chronic kidney disease (5·04, 4·28-7·31, vs 2·50, 2·20-2·84), psychiatric disease (1·56, 1·30-1·86, vs 1·23, 1·18-1·29), and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatological disease (2·45, 1·99-3·02, vs 1·41, 1·32-1·51). Accrual of multimorbidity was also more strongly associated with risk of infection death (five or more comorbidities vs none: 9·53, 6·97-13·03) than of non-infection death (5·26, 4·84-5·72). INTERPRETATION: Several NCDs are associated with an increased risk of infection death, suggesting that some of the reported associations with COVID-19 mortality might be non-specific. Only a subset of NCDs, together with the accrual of multimorbidity, advancing age, smoking, and socioeconomic deprivation, were associated with a greater IRR for infection death than for other causes of death. Further research is needed to define why these risk factors are more strongly associated with infection death, so that more effective preventive strategies can be targeted to high-risk groups.

379160,Vitamin D deficiency in association with endothelial dysfunction: Implications for patients with COVID-19,2020,"Medicine and public health have traditionally separated the prevention and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged this paradigm, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Overall, individuals with underlying CVD who acquire severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 experience up to a 10-fold higher case-fatality rate compared with the general population. Although the impact of the pandemic on cardiovascular health continues to evolve, few have defined this association from a frontline, public health perspective of populations disproportionately affected by CVD and COVID-19. Louisiana is ranked within the bottom 5 states for cardiovascular health, and it is home to several parishes that have experienced among the highest COVID-19 case-fatality rates nationally. Herein, we review CVD prevention and implications of COVID-19 in New Orleans, LA, a city holding a sobering yet resilient history with previous public health disasters. In particular, we discuss potential pandemic-driven changes in access to health care, preventive pharmacotherapy, and lifestyle behaviors, all of which may adversely affect CVD prevention and management, while amplifying racial disparities. Through this process, we highlight proposed recommendations for how CVD prevention efforts can be improved in the midst of the current COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.","Razavi, Alexander C; Kelly, Tanika N; He, Jiang; Fernandez, Camilo; Whelton, Paul K; Krousel-Wood, Marie; Bazzano, Lydia A",J Am Heart Assoc,,203

We assessed the ability of laboratory-confirmed deaths to capture mortality in the EU during the 2009 pandemic, and examined the likelihood that these findings are applicable to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: We present unpublished results from the Global Pandemic Mortality (GLaMOR) project, in which country-specific mortality estimates were made for the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic. These estimates were compared with laboratory-confirmed deaths during the 2009 pandemic to estimate the ability of surveillance systems to capture pandemic mortality. RESULTS: For the 2009 influenza H1N1p pandemic, we estimated that the proportion of true pandemic deaths captured by laboratory-confirmed deaths was approximately 67%. Several differences between the two pandemics (e.g. age groups affected) make it unlikely that this capture rate will be equally high for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: The surveillance of laboratory-confirmed deaths in the EU during the 2009 pandemic was more accurate than previously assumed. We hypothesize that this method is less reliable for SARS-CoV-2. Near-real-time excess all-cause mortality estimates, routinely compiled by EuroMOMO, probably offer a better indicator of pandemic mortality. We urge more countries to join this project and that national-level absolute mortality numbers are presented.","Staadegaard, Lisa; Taylor, Robert J; Spreeuwenberg, Peter; Caini, Saverio; Simonsen, Lone; Paget, John",Int J Infect Dis,,203

To improve its scalability, a number of automated contact tracing (ACT) solutions have proposed and some of them have been deployed. Despite the dedicated efforts, security and privacy issues of these solutions are still open and under intensive debate. In this paper, we examine the ACT concept from a broader perspective, by focusing on not only security and privacy issues but also functional issues such as interface, usability and coverage. We first elaborate on these issues and particularly point out the inevitable privacy leakages in existing BLE-based ACT solutions. Then, we propose a venue-based ACT concept, which only monitors users' contacting history in virus-spreading-prone venues and is able to incorporate different location tracking technologies such as BLE and WIFI. Finally, we instantiate the venue-based ACT concept and show that our instantiation can mitigate most of the issues we have identified in our analysis.","Tang, Qiang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.13462v1.pdf,203

Here, a novel algorithm is proposed using one-hot encoding and iterative shuffling with the loss estimation and risk minimization techniques, to balance both the utility and privacy. In this work, after collecting one-hot encoded data from different sources and clients, a step of novel attribute shuffling technique using iterative shuffling (based on the query asked by the analyst) and loss estimation with an updation function and risk minimization produces a utility and privacy balanced differential private report. During empirical test of balanced utility and privacy, BUDS produces $\epsilon = 0.02$ which is a very promising result.

The versatile ruthenium-catalyzed C7-H activations were characterized by gram-scale syntheses and the traceless removal of the directing group, thus providing easy access to pharmaceutically relevant scaffolds. Detailed mechanistic studies through spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses shed light on the unique nature of the robust ruthenium catalysis for the functionalization of the C7-H position of indoles.","Choi, Isaac; Messinis, Antonis M; Ackermann, Lutz",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,,203

382788,Effect of Asthma and Asthma Medication on the Prognosis of Patients with COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is commonly used to treat severe COVID-19, although the clinical outcome of such treatment remains unclear. This study evaluated the effectiveness of IVIG treatment in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study evaluated 28-day mortality in severe COVID-19 patients with or without IVIG treatment. Each patient treated with IVIG was matched with one untreated patient. Logistic regression and inverse probability weighting(IPW)was used to control confounding factors. RESULTS: The study included 850 patients (421 IVIG treated patients and 429 non-IVIG treated patients). After matching, 406 patients per group remained. No significant difference in 28-day mortality was observed after IPW analysis (ATE = 0.008, 95% CI -0.081-0.097, p = 0.863). There were no significant differences between the IVIG group and non-IVIG group for acute respiratory distress syndrome, diffuse intravascular coagulation, myocardial injury, acute hepatic injury, shock, acute kidney injury, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation except for prone position ventilation (ATE = -0.022, 95% CI -0.041- -0.002, p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: IVIG treatment was not associated with significant changes in 28-day mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. The effectiveness of IVIG in treating patients with severe COVID-19 needs to be further investigated through future studies.","Liu, Jiao; Chen, Yizhu; Li, Ranran; Wu, Zhixiong; Xu, Qianghong; Li, Zhongyi; Annane, Djillali; Feng, Huibin; Huang, Sisi; Guo, Jun; Zhang, Lidi; Ye, Xiaofei; Zhu, Wei; Du, Hangxiang; Liu, Yong039; an,; Wang, Tao; Chen, Limin; Wen, Zhenliang; Teboul, Jean-Louis; Chen, Dechang",Clin. microbiol. infect,,203

We use statistical models to estimate the number of cases with disease onset on a given day and use back-projection techniques to obtain the number of new infections per day. The respective time series are analysed by a trend regression model with change points. The change points are estimated directly from the data. We carry out the analysis for the whole of Germany and the federal state of Bavaria, where we have more detailed data. Both analyses show a major change between 9 and 13 March for the time series of infections: from a strong increase to a decrease. Another change was found between 25 March and 29 March, where the decline intensified. Furthermore, we perform an analysis stratified by age. A main result is a delayed course of the pandemic for the age group 80 + resulting in a turning point at the end of March. Our results differ from those by other authors as we take into account the reporting delay, which turned out to be time dependent and therefore changes the structure of the epidemic curve compared to the curve of newly reported cases.","Küchenhoff, Helmut; Günther, Felix; Höhle, Michael; Bender, Andreas",Epidemiol Infect,,203

The lockdown norms laid down by the government have impacted the nature of social interaction and various forms of behavior including participation in prosocial activities. The present study explores the determinants of helping in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures. The theory of planned behavior framework was taken to predict youth’s intentions and actual help for two kinds of helping behavior: donation for the people affected by the pandemic and feeding stray animals during lockdown. University students (N = 200) volunteered for the online survey, scales were used to measure their attitude, normative beliefs, perceived behavioral control, intention to help, and self-reported help during COVID-19 lockdown. The path analysis was used to test the model. Attitude and perceived behavioral control had a strong effect on the intention to help which further predicts actual self-reported help. Results also showed that since the nature of both helping behaviors was different so the relationship between the two was not strong. The results and implications are discussed in light of the present context. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Rai, K.; Maheshwari, S.",Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment,,203

Health care workers (HCWs) are at the forefront of any health care system and thus especially at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to their potentially frequent and close contact with patients suffering from COVID-19. Serum samples from 198 HCWs with direct patient contact of a regional medical center and several outpatient facilities were collected during the early phase of the pandemic (April 2020) and tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Commercially available IgA- and IgG-specific ELISAs were used as screening technique, followed by an in-house neutralization assay for confirmation. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected in seven of 198 (3.5%) tested HCWs. There was no significant difference in seroprevalence between the regional medical center (3.4%) and the outpatient institution (5%). The overall seroprevalence of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in HCWs in both a large regional medical center and a small outpatient institution was low (3.5%) at the beginning of April 2020. The findings may indicate that the timely implemented preventive measures (strict hygiene protocols, personal protective equipment) were effective to protect from transmission of an airborne virus when only limited information on the pathogen was available.","Muller, K.; Girl, P.; Ruhnke, M.; Spranger, M.; Kaier, K.; von Buttlar, H.; Dobler, G.; Borde, J.

384430,The hidden value of a CHA2DS2-VASc score,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic with high morbidity and mortality and with a reported high risk of severe disease in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). AIM: We aimed to report the largest number of COVID-19-positive cases in KTR in a single center and to discuss their demographics, management, and evolution. METHODS: We enrolled all the two thousand KTR followed up in our center in Kuwait and collected the data of all COVID-19-positive KTR (104) from the start of the outbreak till the end of July 2020 and have reported the clinical features, management details, and both patient and graft outcomes. RESULTS: Out of the one hundred and four cases reported, most of them were males aged 49.3 ± 14.7 years. Eighty-two of them needed hospitalization, of which thirty-one were managed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Main comorbidities among these patients were hypertension in 64.4%, diabetes in 51%, and ischemic heart disease in 20.2%. Management strategies included anticoagulation in 56.7%, withdrawal of antimetabolites in 54.8%, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) withdrawal in 33.7%, the addition of antibiotics in 57.7%, Tocilizumab in 8.7%, and antivirals in 16.3%. During a follow-up of 30 days, the reported number of acute kidney injury (AKI) was 28.7%, respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy 46.2%, and overall mortality rate was 10.6% with hospital mortality of 13.4% including an ICU mortality rate of 35.5%. CONCLUSION: Better outcome of COVID-19-positive KTR in our cohort during this unremitting stage could be due to the younger age of patients and early optimized management of anticoagulation, modification of immunosuppression, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial infections. Mild cases can successfully be managed at home without any change in immunosuppression.","AlOtaibi, Torki M; Gheith, Osama A; Abuelmagd, Mohammed M; Adel, Mohammed; Alqallaf, Ahmed K; Elserwy, Nabil A; Shaker, Mohamed; Abbas, Ahmad M; Nagib, Ayman M; Nair, Prasad; Halim, Medhat A; Mahmoud, Tarek; Khaled, Mahmoud M; Hammad, Mohamed A; Fayyad, Zoheer A; Atta, Ahmed F; Mostafa, Ahmed Y; Draz, Ahmed S; Zakaria, Zakaria E; Atea, Khaled A; Aboatya, Hasaneen H; Ameenn, Mohamed E; Monem, Mohamed A; Mahmoud, Amro M",Clin Transplant,,203

It has already infected more than 54.5 million people worldwide, currently leading to more than 1.3 million deaths. Although it causes a mild flu-like disease in most patients, lethality may increase to more than 20% in elderly subjects, especially in those with comorbidities, like hypertension, diabetes, or lung and cardiac disease, and the mechanisms are still elusive. Common symptoms at the onset of illness are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, headache, and diarrhea or constipation. Interestingly, respiratory viruses have also placed themselves as relevant agents for central nervous system (CNS) pathologies. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 has already been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Here, we discuss several clinical features related to CNS infection during COVID-19. Patients may progress from headaches and migraines to encephalitis, stroke, and seizures with leptomeningitis. However, the pathway used by the virus to reach the brain is still unknown. It may infect the olfactory bulb by retrograde neuronal transportation from olfactory epithelium, or it could be transported by the blood. Either way, neurological complications of COVID-19 add greatly to the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Neurological signs and symptoms must alert physicians not only to worst outcomes but also to future possible degenerative diseases.","Bandeira, Isabelle Pastor; Schlindwein, Marco Antônio Machado; Breis, Leticia Caroline; Peron, Jean Pierre Schatzmann; Gonçalves, Marcus Vinícius Magno",Adv Exp Med Biol,,203

The aim of our study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG anti-bodies. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among workers of two hospitals and Territorial Medical and Administrative services in Northern Italy. From 8 May to 3 June 2020, 2252 subjects were tested. Seroprevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for all individuals who were stratified by job title, COVID-19 risk of exposure, direct contact with patients, unit ward, and intensity of care. RESULTS: Median age was 50 years, and 72% of subjects were female. The overall seroprevalence was 17.11% [95% CI 15.55-18.67]. Around 20% of healthcare assistants were seropositive, followed by physicians and nurses (16.89% and 15.84%, respectively). HCWs with high risk of exposure to COVID-19 were more frequently seropositive (28.52%) with respect to those with medium and low risks (16.71% and 12.76%, respectively). Moreover, personnel in direct contact had higher prevalence (18.32%) compared to those who did not (10.66%). Furthermore, the IgG were more frequently detected among personnel of one hospital (19.43%). CONCLUSION: The high seroprevalence observed can be partially explained by the timing and the population seroprevalence; the study was conducted in an area with huge spread of the infection.","Airoldi, Chiara; Patrucco, Filippo; Milano, Fulvia; Alessi, Daniela; Sarro, Andrea; Rossi, Maicol Andrea; Cena, Tiziana; Borrè, Silvio; Faggiano, Fabrizio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203

Methods: In this case series, we identified patients with COVID-19 admitted to 3 Partners Healthcare hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts between March 7th, 2020, and March 30th, 2020. Patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes were determined. Findings: A total of 247 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified; the median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR]: 50-76 years), 58% were men, 30% of Hispanic ethnicity, 21% enrolled in Medicaid, and 12% dual-enrolled Medicare/Medicaid. The median estimated household income was $66,701 [IQR: $50,336-$86,601]. Most patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (72%), and statins (76%; newly initiated in 34%). During their admission, 103 patients (42%) required intensive care. At the end of the data collection period (June 24, 2020), 213 patients (86.2%) were discharged alive, 2 patients (0.8%) remain admitted, and 32 patients (13%) have died. Among those discharged alive (n = 213), 70 (32.9%) were discharged to a post-acute facility, 31 (14.6%) newly required supplemental oxygen, 19 (8.9%) newly required tube feeding, and 34 (16%) required new prescriptions for antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, methadone, or opioids. Over a median post-discharge follow-up of 80 days (IQR, 68-84), 22 patients (10.3%) were readmitted.

386564,Complicated Course of Coronavirus COVID-19 Infection in the old Patient with Severe Cardiac Pathology: a Clinical Case Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 emerged as a public health crisis that disrupted normal patterns of health care in the New York City metropolitan area. In preparation for a large influx of critically ill patients, operating rooms (ORs) at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center (NYP-Columbia) were converted into a novel intensive care unit area, the ORICU. METHODS: 23 ORs were converted into an 82-bed ORICU. Adaptations to the OR environment permitted the delivery of standard critical care therapies. Non-intensive-care-trained staff were educated on the basics of critical care and deployed in a hybrid staffing model. Anesthesia machines were repurposed as critical care ventilators, with accommodations to ensure reliable function and patient safety. To compare ORICU survivorship to outcomes in more traditional environments, we performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of all patients cared for in the ORICU, censoring data at the time of ORICU closure. We hypothesized that age, gender, and obesity may have influenced the risk of death. Thus, we estimated hazard ratios for death using Cox proportional hazard regression models with age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) as covariables and, separately, using older age (65 years and older) adjusted for gender and BMI. RESULTS: The ORICU cared for 133 patients from March 24 - May 14, 2020. Patients were transferred to the ORICU from other ICUs, inpatient wards, the Emergency Department, and other institutions. Patients remained in the ORICU until either transfer to another unit or death. As the hospital patient load decreased, patients were transferred out of the ORICU. This process was completed on May 14, 2020. At time of data censoring, 55 (41.4%) of patients had died. The estimated probability of survival 30 days after admission was 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 - 0.69). Age was significantly associated with increased risk of mortality (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 - 1.08, p < 0.001 for a 1 year increase in age). Patients who were 65 years or older were an estimated 3.17 times more likely to die than younger patients (95% CI 1.78 - 5.63, p < 0.001) when adjusting for gender and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of critically ill Covid-19 patients were cared for in the ORICU, which substantially increased ICU capacity at NYP-Columbia. The estimated ORICU survival rate at 30 days was comparable to other reported rates, suggesting this was an effective approach to manage the influx of critically ill Covid-19 patients during a time of crisis.","Mittel, Aaron M; Panzer, Oliver; Wang, David S; Miller, Steven E; Schaff, Jacob E; Hastie, Maya Jalbout; Sutherland, Lauren; Brentjens, Tricia E; Sobol, Julia B; Cabredo, Almarie; Hastie, Jonathan",,,203

We hypothesized that the uphill training will affect endurance muscle performance outcomes, whereas the downhill training will affect power muscle performance outcomes. Fourteen physically active volunteers were randomly assigned into either the Uphill group (UG; n = 7; uphill interval running at +10% incline) or the Downhill group (DG; n = 7; downhill interval running at -10% incline) and completed 16 training sessions. Each session consisted of ten 30 s treadmill runs at 90% of maximum aerobic speed (MAS) with a work to rest ratio of 1:2. Vertical jump performance, isometric (MVC) and isokinetic torque of knee extensors and flexors, and fatigue of knee extensors were evaluated pre and post-training. Moreover, body composition (via bioimpedance) and vastus lateralis muscle architecture (via ultrasonography) were assessed pre and post-training. Relative lean tissue mass, relative fat mass, and squat jump (cm) significantly (p < .05) changed from baseline values by +4.5 ± 4.0%, -11.5 ± 9.6%, and +9.5 ± 11.7%, respectively, only in the DG. Similarly, DG improved absolute values of knee extension rate of torque development and impulse (p < .05), whereas knee flexion peak torque angle significantly decreased in both groups (p < .05). On the other hand, the UG increased the number of repetitions achieved during the fatigue protocol and total work by 21.2 ± 32.6% and 13.8 ± 21.2%, respectively (p < .05). No differences were found between groups in muscle architecture.

387587,Initial CT scan and its relationship with Covid-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Information regarding availability of electronic healthcare databases in the Asia-Pacific region is critical for planning vaccine safety assessments particularly, as COVID-19 vaccines are introduced. This study aimed to identify data sources in the region, potentially suitable for vaccine safety surveillance. This manuscript is endorsed by the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE). METHODS: Nineteen countries targeted for database reporting were identified using published country lists and review articles. Surveillance capacity was assessed using two surveys: a 9-item introductory survey and a 51-item full survey. Survey questions related to database characteristics, covariate and health outcome variables, vaccine exposure characteristics, access and governance, and dataset linkage capability. Other questions collated research/regulatory applications of the data and local publications detailing database use for research. RESULTS: Eleven databases containing vaccine-specific information were identified across 8 countries. Databases were largely national in coverage (8/11, 73%), encompassed all ages (9/11, 82%) with population size from 1.4 to 52 million persons. Vaccine exposure information varied particularly for standardized vaccine codes (5/11, 46%), brand (7/11, 64%) and manufacturer (5/11, 46%). Outcome data were integrated with vaccine data in 6 (55%) databases and available via linkage in 5 (46%) databases. Data approval processes varied, impacting on timeliness of data access. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in vaccine data availability, complexities in data access including, governance and data release approval procedures, together with requirement for data linkage for outcome information, all contribute to the challenges in building a distributed network for vaccine safety assessment in the Asia-Pacific and globally. Common data models (CDMs) may help expedite vaccine safety research across the region.","Duszynski, Katherine M; Stark, James H; Cohet, Catherine; Huang, Wan-Ting; Shin, Ju-Young; Lai, Edward Chia-Cheng; Man, Kenneth K C; Choi, Nam-Kyong; Khromava, Alena; Kimura, Tomomi; Huang, Kui; Watcharathanakij, Sawaeng; Kochhar, Sonali; Chen, Robert T; Pratt, Nicole L",Pharmacoepidemiol. durg saf,,203

Direct damage to the cardiovascular system has been reported and recently, acute myocardial injury has been identified as a risk factor for mortality. Transthoracic echocardiography is a non-invasive tool that allows the detection of myocardial damage with validated markers (left ventricular ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain). Herein, we present the echocardiographic findings in four patients with COVID-19. All cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome (100%). Three out of four had elevated levels of creatine kinase and creatine kinase myocardial band. One case had ventricular concentric remodeling (25%). All cases (100%) had altered ventricular function: two had a reduced ejection fraction (50%) and, of those available for global longitudinal strain analysis, all had abnormal global longitudinal strain (100%). One case was found to have a tricuspid vegetation of 12 x 10 mm with no other manifestation of endocarditis. All of our cases had left ventricular dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography. One of our patients had a vegetation in the tricuspid valve. Two of our cases had a reduced ejection fraction. The importance of acute cardiac injury in COVID-19 has recently been established. A recent study found it to be an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with this disease. Information regarding echocardiographic characteristics of this population is scarce. Further research to elucidate the impact of these characteristics on morbidity and mortality is urgently needed.","Vera-Pineda, Raymundo; Carrizales-Sepulveda, Edgar Francisco; Camacho-Ortiz, Adrian; Nuzzolo-Shihadeh, Laura; Cruz-Ramos, Francisco; Ordaz-Farias, Alejandro; Benavides-Gonzalez, Mario Alberto; Carranza-Villegasa, Gabriel",Cardiol.

METHODS: Cytokine and chemokine levels and characterisation of immune cell subsets from 20 COVID-19 cases after hospital admission (17 critically ill and 3 severe patients) and 16 convalescent patients were determined using a multiplex immunoassay and flow cytometry, respectively. RESULTS: IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were significantly higher in acute severe/critically ill patients with COVID-19, whereas were normal in patients who had reached convalescence. CD8 T cells in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients expressed high levels of cytotoxic granules (granzyme B and perforin)and was hyperactivated as evidenced by the high proportions of CD38. Furthermore, the cytotoxic potential of natural killer (NK) cells, and the frequencies of myeloid dendritic cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells was reduced in patients with severe and critical COVID-19; however, these dysregulations were found to be restored in convalescent phases. CONCLUSION: Thus, elicitation of the hyperactive cytokine-mediated inflammatory response, dysregulation of CD8 T and NK cells, and deficiency of host myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs, may contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and strategies.","Chen, Qigao; Yu, Baodan; Yang, Yihao; Huang, Jiewen; Liang, Ying; Zhou, Jing; Li, Lianzhong; Peng, Xuechun; Cheng, Bolin; Lin, Yongping",Int Immunopharmacol,,203

The outbreak of this virus (SARS-CoV-2) is strongly compromising worldwide healthcare systems, social behavior, and everyone's lives. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 and isolation of positive cases has proven to be fundamental in containing the spread of the infection. Even though the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods remain the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, the urgent demand for rapid and wide-scale diagnosis precipitated the development of alternative diagnostic approaches. The millions of tests performed every day worldwide are still insufficient to achieve the desired goal, that of screening the population during daily life. Probably the most appealing approach to consistently monitor COVID-19 spread is the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from exhaled breath. For instance, the challenging incorporation of reliable, highly sensitive, and cost-efficient detection methods in masks could represent a breakthrough in the development of portable and noninvasive point-of-care diagnosis for COVID-19. In this perspective paper, we discuss the critical technical aspects related to the application of breath analysis in the diagnosis of viral infection. We believe that, if achieved, it could represent a game-changer in containing the pandemic spread.","Giovannini, Giorgia; Haick, Hossam; Garoli, Denis",ACS Sens,,203

In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation approach for mask detection from speech. Our approach is based on (i) training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with cycle-consistency loss to translate unpaired utterances between two classes (with mask and without mask), and on (ii) generating new training utterances using the cycle-consistent GANs, assigning opposite labels to each translated utterance. Original and translated utterances are converted into spectrograms which are provided as input to a set of ResNet neural networks with various depths. The networks are combined into an ensemble through a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. With this system, we participated in the Mask Sub-Challenge (MSC) of the INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics Challenge, surpassing the baseline proposed by the organizers by 2.8%. Our data augmentation technique provided a performance boost of 0.9% on the private test set. Furthermore, we show that our data augmentation approach yields better results than other baseline and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.","Ristea, Nicolae-Cuatualin; Ionescu, Radu Tudor",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10147v1.pdf,203

From a cohort including 3060 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 109 (3.4%) cancer patients were included in this study. Among them, 23 (21.1%) patients died in the hospital. Cancer patients, especially those with hematological malignancies (41.6%), urinary carcinoma (35.7%), malignancies of the digestive system (33.3%), gynecological malignancies (20%), and lung cancer (14.3%), had a much higher mortality than patients without cancer. A total of 19 (17.4%) cancer patients were infected in the hospital. The clinical characteristics of deceased cancer patients were compared with those of recovered cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that a Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS2002) score â©¾ 3 (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 11.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.60-26.32; P < 0.001), high-risk type (adjusted HR 18.81; 95% CI 4.21-83.93; P < 0.001), tumor stage IV (adjusted HR 4.26; 95% CI 2.34-7.75; P < 0.001), and recent adjuvant therapy (< 1 month) (adjusted HR 3.16; 95% CI 1.75-5.70; P < 0.01) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, comorbidities, D-dimer, and lymphocyte count. In conclusion, cancer patients showed a higher risk of COVID-19 infection with a poorer prognosis than patients without cancer. Cancer patients with high-risk tumor, NRS2002 score â©¾ 3, advanced tumor stage, and recent adjuvant therapy (< 1 month) may have high risk of mortality.","Liang, Junnan; Jin, Guannan; Liu, Tongtong; Wen, Jingyuan; Li, Ganxun; Chen, Lin; Wang, Wei; Wang, Yuwei; Liao, Wei; Song, Jia; Ding, Zeyang; Chen, Xiao-Ping; Zhang, Bixiang",Front Med,,203

As assay protocols and primer sequences become widely known, many laboratories perform diagnostic tests using methods such as RT-PCR or reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP). Here, we report an RT-LAMP isothermal assay for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and demonstrate the assay on clinical samples using a simple and accessible point-of-care (POC) instrument. We characterized the assay by dipping swabs into synthetic nasal fluid spiked with the virus, moving the swab to viral transport medium (VTM), and sampling a volume of the VTM to perform the RT-LAMP assay without an RNA extraction kit. The assay has a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 RNA copies per µL in the VTM solution within 30 min. We further demonstrate our assay by detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses from 20 clinical samples. Finally, we demonstrate a portable and real-time POC device to detect SARS-CoV-2 from VTM samples using an additively manufactured three-dimensional cartridge and a smartphone-based reader. The POC system was tested using 10 clinical samples, and was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 from these clinical samples by distinguishing positive samples from negative samples after 30 min. The POC tests are in complete agreement with RT-PCR controls. This work demonstrates an alternative pathway for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics that does not require conventional laboratory infrastructure, in settings where diagnosis is required at the point of sample collection.","Ganguli, Anurup; Mostafa, Ariana; Berger, Jacob; Aydin, Mehmet Y; Sun, Fu; Ramirez, Sarah A Stewart de; Valera, Enrique; Cunningham, Brian T; King, William P; Bashir, Rashid",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,203

We present state spending trends in eight categories of public health activity from 2008 through 2018. We obtained data from the Census Bureau for all states except California and coded the data by public health category. Although overall national health expenditures grew by 4.3 percent in this period, state governmental public health spending saw no statistically significant growth between 2008 and 2018 except in injury prevention. Moreover, state spending levels on public health were not restored after cuts experienced during the Great Recession, leaving states ill equipped to respond to COVID-19 and other emerging health needs.","Alfonso, Y Natalia; Leider, Jonathon P; Resnick, Beth; McCullough, J Mac; Bishai, David",Health Aff (Millwood),,203

Although public health countermeasures effectively controlled the epidemic in China, non-pharmaceutical interventions can neither be maintained indefinitely nor conveniently implemented globally. Vaccination is mainly used to prevent COVID-19, and most current antiviral treatment evaluations focus on clinical efficacy. Therefore, we conducted population-based simulations to assess antiviral treatment effectiveness among different age groups based on its clinical efficacy. METHODS: We collected COVID-19 data of Wuhan City from published literature and established a database (from 2 December 2019 to 16 March 2020). We developed an age-specific model to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment in patients with COVID-19. Efficacy was divided into three types: (1) viral activity reduction, reflected as transmission rate decrease [reduction was set as v (0-0.8) to simulate hypothetical antiviral treatments]; (2) reduction in the duration time from symptom onset to patient recovery/removal, reflected as a 1/Î³ decrease (reduction was set as 1-3 days to simulate hypothetical or real-life antiviral treatments, and the time of asymptomatic was reduced by the same proportion); (3) fatality rate reduction in severely ill patients (fc) [reduction (z) was set as 0.3 to simulate real-life antiviral treatments]. The population was divided into four age groups (groups 1, 2, 3 and 4), which included those aged &#8804; 14; 15-44; 45-64; and &#8805; 65 years, respectively. Evaluation indices were based on outbreak duration, cumulative number of cases, total attack rate (TAR), peak date, number of peak cases, and case fatality rate (f). RESULTS: Comparing the simulation results of combination and single medication therapy s, all four age groups showed better results with combination medication. When 1/Î³ = 2 and v = 0.4, age group 2 had the highest TAR reduction rate (98.48%, 56.01-0.85%). When 1/Î³ = 2, z = 0.3, and v = 0.1, age group 1 had the highest reduction rate of f (83.08%, 0.71-0.12%). CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatments are more effective in COVID-19 transmission control than in mortality reduction. Overall, antiviral treatments were more effective in younger age groups, while older age groups showed higher COVID-19 prevalence and mortality. Therefore, physicians should pay more attention to prevention of viral spread and patients deaths when providing antiviral treatments to patients of older age groups.","Lin, Sheng-Nan; Rui, Jia; Chen, Qiu-Ping; Zhao, Bin; Yu, Shan-Shan; Li, Zhuo-Yang; Zhao, Ze-Yu; Wang, Yao; Zhu, Yuan-Zhao; Xu, Jing-Wen; Yang, Meng; Liu, Xing-Chun; Yang, Tian-Long; Luo, Li; Deng, Bin; Huang, Jie-Feng; Liu, Chan; Li, Pei-Hua; Liu, Wei-Kang; Xie, Fang; Chen, Yong; Su, Yan-Hua; Zhao, Ben-Hua; Chiang, Yi-Chen; Chen, Tian-Mu",Infect Dis Poverty,,203

OBJECTIVES: We explored perceived changes in alcohol consumption, their association with sociodemographic characteristics and past year alcohol consumption, and self-reported reasons for change after CO-VID-19 restrictions in Norway. METHOD: A web-based survey was sent to Norwegians aged 18 years and older in June-July 2020. Respondents reporting any past year alcohol use (n = 1,200) were asked whether they drank less, approximately the same, or more after the COVID-19 restrictions compared to before and reasons for drinking less or more. RESULTS: Almost a third (29.9%) reported they drank less, whereas 13.3% reported they drank more. Females, younger respondents, and Oslo residents were more likely to report both less and more drinking (p values between 0.001 and 0.029). Past year alcohol use was associated with less drinking (OR = 0.93; p < 0.001) and more drinking (OR = 1.07; p < 0.001). More drinking was also associated with living with child(ren) (p = 0.023) and high educational level (p = 0.029). The most frequently reported reasons for drinking less pertained to fewer social occasions and less on-premise drinking, whereas reasons for drinking more pertained to treating oneself to something good and fewer consequences of drinking more. CONCLUSIONS: After the COVID-19 restrictions were implemented, a substantial proportion of Norwegians changed their drinking behaviour.","Bramness, Jørgen G; Bye, Elin K; Moan, Inger Synnøve; Rossow, Ingeborg",Eur Addict Res,,203

Wearing protective equipment like mask and gloves, washing hands via soap, frequent use of antiseptic solution and maintaining social distance are being applied globally to reduce the transmission rate. Therefore, this study was intended to investigate water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) behaviour, protective equipment use and their disposal practices among Bangladeshi residents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the study aims, data were collected mainly via an online survey and analysed through a set of statistical tools including T test, one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis (PCA). This study found that almost 89.80% of the respondents reported to know about the COVID-19 and its preventive measures. WASH status of the respondents is found quite good, where 94.60% stated to have available potable water, 99% have improved toilet facilities, 95% wash their hands via soap, and 79.80% clean their house and toilets by antiseptic solutions properly. Moreover, nearly 94.50% and 54.80% people reported to use face mask and hand gloves, respectively, but the disposal practice of these protective equipment is inappropriate. More than 50% of people reported disposing of their used mask, gloves and tissue with other household wastes, which is alarming for public health and environmental perspective. Moreover, the WASH and waste disposal practices of the marginal people were found very poor and not at a satisfactory level. The results of statistical analysis focused on WASH and waste disposal practices as well as the factors which influence these practices. It is found that gender, occupation, area of residence, and level of education of the participants mainly influence the WASH and waste disposal practices. It is expected that this study exposed the necessity to introduce proper infectious waste management policy and also the increase in awareness level among mass people regarding the preventive measures of COVID-19 infection to combat against disease transmission and environmental pollution.

These changes were attributed to both artifactual changes related to declines in routine health seeking for respiratory illness as well as real changes in influenza virus circulation because of widespread implementation of measures to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Data from clinical laboratories in the United States indicated a 61% decrease in the number of specimens submitted (from a median of 49,696 per week during September 29, 2019-February 29, 2020, to 19,537 during March 1-May 16, 2020) and a 98% decrease in influenza activity as measured by percentage of submitted specimens testing positive (from a median of 19.34% to 0.33%). Interseasonal (i.e., summer) circulation of influenza in the United States (May 17-August 8, 2020) is currently at historical lows (median = 0.20% tests positive in 2020 versus 2.35% in 2019, 1.04% in 2018, and 2.36% in 2017). Influenza data reported to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) FluNet platform from three Southern Hemisphere countries that serve as robust sentinel sites for influenza from Oceania (Australia), South America (Chile), and Southern Africa (South Africa) showed very low influenza activity during June-August 2020, the months that constitute the typical Southern Hemisphere influenza season. In countries or jurisdictions where extensive community mitigation measures are maintained (e.g., face masks, social distancing, school closures, and teleworking), those locations might have little influenza circulation during the upcoming 2020-21 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The use of community mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, plus influenza vaccination, are likely to be effective in reducing the incidence and impact of influenza, and some of these mitigation measures could have a role in preventing influenza in future seasons. However, given the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty of continued community mitigation measures, it is important to plan for seasonal influenza circulation in the United States this fall and winter. Influenza vaccination of all persons aged &#8805;6 months remains the best method for influenza prevention and is especially important this season when SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus might cocirculate (1).","Olsen, Sonja J; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Budd, Alicia P; Brammer, Lynnette; Sullivan, Sheena; Pineda, Rodrigo Fasce; Cohen, Cheryl; Fry, Alicia M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,203

392009,"International Forum on the Collection and Use of COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma: Protocols, Challenges and Lessons Learned: Summary",2021,"The recent emergence of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a global pandemic has prompted scientists to address an urgent need for defining mechanisms of disease pathology and treatment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19, employs angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its primary target for cell surface attachment and likely entry into the host cell. Thus, understanding factors that may regulate the expression and function of ACE2 in the healthy and diseased body is critical for clinical intervention. Over 66% of all adults in the United States are currently using a prescription drug and while earlier findings have focused on possible upregulation of ACE2 expression through the use of renin angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, mounting evidence suggests that various other widely administered drugs used in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemias, coagulation disorders, and pulmonary disease may also present a varied risk for COVID-19. Specifically, we summarize mechanisms on how heparin, statins, steroids and phytochemicals, besides their established therapeutic effects, may also interfere with SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into cells. We also describe evidence on the effect of several vitamins, phytochemicals, and naturally occurring compounds on ACE2 expression and activity in various tissues and disease models. This comprehensive review aims to provide a timely compendium on the potential impact of commonly prescribed drugs and pharmacologically active compounds on COVID-19 pathology and risk through regulation of ACE2 and RAS signaling.","Oz, Murat; Lorke, Dietrich Ernst; Kabbani, Nadine",Pharmacol Ther,,203

MethodsWe conducted an observational study to develop and validate a clinical score to predict ED and in-hospital mortality among consecutive non-palliative COVID-19 patients. We recruited from 44 hospitals participating in the Canadian COVID-19 ED Rapid Response Network (CCEDRRN) between March 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. We randomly assigned hospitals to derivation or validation, and pre-specified clinical variables as candidate predictors. We used logistic regression to develop the score in a derivation cohort, and examined its performance in predicting ED and in-hospital mortality in a validation cohort. ResultsOf 8,761 eligible patients, 618 (7{middle dot}01%) died. The score included age, sex, type of residence, arrival mode, chest pain, severe liver disease, respiratory rate, and level of respiratory support. The area under the curve was 0{middle dot}92 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0{middle dot}91-0{middle dot}93) in derivation and 0{middle dot}92 (95%CI 0{middle dot}89-0{middle dot}93) in validation.

Lab tests confirmed COVID-19, and showed lymphocytopenia and elevated markers of inflammation and coagulopathy. Chest X-ray showed bilateral mid-lung opacities, and the patient required intubation early in his disease course. Imaging and clinical findings were consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with inflammation. The patient was treated with different combinations of antivirals (hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir), cytokine inhibitors (anakinra and tocilizumab), glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone), and an anticoagulant (enoxaparin). Inflammatory markers decreased before clinical improvement in lung aeration.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the antinflammatory effects of pLMWH could translate in lower rate of clinical progression in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients admitted to a COVID-hospital in Rome with SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild/moderate pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was the time from hospital admission to orotracheal intubation/death (OTI/death). A total of 449 patients were included: 39% female, median age 63 (IQR, 50-77) years. The estimated probability of OTI/death for patients receiving pLMWH was: 9.5% (95% CI 3.2-26.4) by day 20 in those not receiving pLMWH vs. 10.4% (6.7-15.9) in those exposed to pLMWH; p-value = 0.144. This risk associated with the use of pLMWH appeared to vary by PaO2/FiO2 ratio: aHR 1.40 (95% CI 0.51-3.79) for patients with an admission PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300 mmHg and 0.27 (0.03-2.18) for those with PaO2/FiO2 > 300 mmHg; p-value at interaction test 0.16. pLMWH does not seem to reduce the risk of OTI/death mild/moderate COVID-19 pneumonia, especially when respiratory function had already significantly deteriorated.

Due to the easy spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus when in direct contact with the patients, health care workers are at an increased risk of infection. Nurses and auxiliary staff, as well as medical doctors, were most frequently infected. The prevalence of infection depends on the adopted reporting method, including the diagnostic test used to recognize the infection, the nature of the work performed, but also on the gender, knowledge, and individual behavior of employees while performing their professional duties. It ranges from 5-30% depending on the country and the occupational group, and the highest rates were recorded in the initial phase of the pandemic. A review of the literature shows the lack of a uniform, transparent system of reporting infections in health care workers, which makes a reliable assessment of the epidemiological situation in this area difficult.","Wojczyk, Marek; Kowalska, Malgorzata",Przegl Epidemiol,,203

METHODS: We included patients admitted to emergency department with COVID-19 and available concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients were classified for each biomarker into two groups (low vs. high concentrations) according to their best cut-off point, and 30-day all-cause death was evaluated. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, cTnI &#8805;21 ng/L, D-dimer &#8805;1112 ng/mL, CRP &#8805;10 mg/dL and LDH &#8805;334 U/L at admission were associated with an increased risk of 30-day all-cause death (hazard ratio (HR) 4.30; 95% CI 1.74-10.58; p = 0.002; HR 3.35; 95% CI 1.58-7.13; p = 0.002; HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.13-4.50; p = 0.021; HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.04-3.84; p = 0.039, respectively). The area under the curve for cTnI was 0.825 (95% CI 0.759-0.892) and, in comparison, was significantly better than CRP (0.685; 95% CI 0.600-0.770; p = 0.009) and LDH (0.643; 95% CI 0.534-0.753; p = 0.006) but non-significantly better than D-dimer (0.756; 95% CI 0.674-0.837; p = 0.115).

393740,Association of history of cerebrovascular disease with severity of COVID-19,2020,"The WC1 cell surface family of molecules function as hybrid gamma delta (Î³Î´) TCR co-receptors, augmenting cellular responses when cross-linked with the TCR, and as pattern recognition receptors, binding pathogens. It is known that following activation, key tyrosines are phosphorylated in the intracytoplasmic domains of WC1 molecules and that the cells fail to respond when WC1 is knocked down or, as shown here, when physically separated from the TCR. Based on these results we hypothesized that the colocalization of WC1 and TCR will occur following cellular activation thereby allowing signaling to ensue. We evaluated the spatio-temporal dynamics of their interaction using imaging flow cytometry and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy. We found that in quiescent Î³Î´ T cells both WC1 and TCR existed in separate and spatially stable protein domains (protein islands) but after activation using Leptospira, our model system, that they concatenated. The association between WC1 and TCR was close enough for fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Prior to concatenating with the WC1 co-receptor, Î³Î´ T cells had clustering of TCR-CD3 complexes and exclusion of CD45. Î³Î´ T cells may individually express more than one variant of the WC1 family of molecules and we found that individual WC1 variants are clustered in separate protein islands in quiescent cells. However, the islands containing different variants merged following cell activation and before merging with the TCR islands. While WC1 was previously shown to bind Leptospira in solution, here we showed that Leptospira bound WC1 proteins on the surface of Î³Î´ T cells and that this could be blocked by anti-WC1 antibodies. In conclusion, Î³Î´ TCR, WC1 and Leptospira interact directly on the Î³Î´ T cell surface, further supporting the role of WC1 in Î³Î´ T cell pathogen recognition and cellular activation.","Gillespie, Alexandria; Gervasi, Maria Gracia; Sathiyaseelan, Thillainayagam; Connelley, Timothy; Telfer, Janice C; Baldwin, Cynthia L",Front Immunol,,203

394554,Steroids: A Therapeutic Option for COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients With ESRD?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic led to a complete renewal of clinical activities of Italian hospitals. During the lockdown, all hospitals in Italy had to suspend non-urgent clinical activities. The prolonged suspension of elective activities could have caused a series of problems. METHODS: A new ad hoc protocol was designed. Single-day fast-imaging protocol with regadenoson-stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin imaging was preferred. Patients were contacted by phone 4 days before the test and answered to a questionnaire which will be repeated on the day of the exam. Body temperature <37.5 degrees C and no Covid-19 symptoms were necessary to enter the unit. Patients wore surgical mask and gloves. Social distancing was maintained throughout the examination. Healthcare professionals wore a personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were studied from April 7 to May 15, 2020, before the publication of the recommendations from ASNC and SNMMI. None of the patients experienced complications. Follow-up of patients discharged was carried by phone. No Covid-19 infection symptoms were reported. On May 18, 2020 all the healthcare providers of nuclear cardiology department underwent serological testing IgG and IgM and none were positive. CONCLUSION: Strict ad hoc hygiene protocol for Covid-19 pandemic avoids diagnostic-therapeutic delay and lengthening of waiting lists. Our experience confirms that pursuing WHO recommendations and recent indication of ASNC and SNMMI is safe for both health providers and patients. Moreover, the incidence of significant inducible ischemia rises when correct stratification of patients is performed.","Scrima, Giovanni; D039,; Amico, Maurizio; Bertuccio, Giovanni; Canavese, Giacomo; De Sanctis, Paolo",J. nucl. cardiol,,203

397843,Cardiovascular complications of COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: With the COVID-19 pandemic, chemosensory dysfunction are among the most prevalent symptoms. Most reports are subjective evaluations, which have been suggested to be unreliable. The objective is to test chemosensory dysfunction and recovery based on extensive psychophysical tests in COVID-19 during the course of the disease. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A total of 111 patients from four centers participated in the study. All tested positive for SARS-COV-2 with RT-PCR. They were tested within 3 days of diagnosis and 28 to 169 days after infection. Testing included extensive olfactory testing with the Sniffin' Sticks test for threshold, discrimination and identification abilities, and with the Taste Sprays and Taste Strips for gustatory function for quasi-threshold and taste identification abilities. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in olfactory function during and after infection. During infection 21% were anosmic, 49% hyposmic, and 30% normosmic. After infection only 1% were anosmic, 26% hyposmic, and 73% normosmic. For gustatory function, there was a difference for all taste qualities, but significantly in sour, bitter, and total score. Twenty-six percent had gustatory dysfunction during infection and 6.5% had gustatory dysfunction after infection. Combining all tests 22% had combined olfactory and gustatory dysfunction during infection. After infection no patients had combined dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensory dysfunction is very common in COVID-19, either as isolated smell or taste dysfunction or a combined dysfunction. Most people regain their chemosensory function within the first 28 days, but a quarter of the patients show persisting dysfunction, which should be referred to specialist smell and taste clinics for rehabilitation of chemosensory function.

Cluster modelling is an essential step to investigate the properties of a group of viruses, and an automatic approach is required for massive 3D data processing. The morphological complexity of individual virus limits the application of smooth function algorithms with a regular-shaped assumption. This paper proposed a voxel-based redistribution approach to generate the virus cluster with COVID-19 input automatically. Representative elementary volume analysis was performed to address the statistical influence from the digital sample size. Coordination number analysis and surface density measurement were conducted with COVID-19 input and spherical input for comparison. The proposed approach is in natural compatibility with the lattice Boltzmann method for fluid dynamics analysis. A virtual permeation simulation was performed with the COVID-19 cluster and spherical cluster to demonstrate the necessity to include spike protein structure in the cluster modelling.","Wang, Mingzhi Liu Yushi Qi Beimeng Wang Wei",Powder Technology,,203
402356,What is causing the 'long-hauler' phenomenon after COVID-19?,2021,"Coronavirus infection disease-2019 (COVID-19) gained worldwide fame after deadly outbreak in China and its subsequent spread to many countries. So far, COVID-19 is not fully contained, and new cases are arising on daily bases in various countries. Due to zoonotic nature and human-to-human spread, COVID-19 is considered pandemic with more causalities in developing countries. Full genome analysis revealed its resemblance with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus with minor variation in non-structural proteins. Both viruses use the common angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor to attach to the epithelial cells of the target organs. Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with drugs that are used for lungs infections. However, ACE2 has high expression in other human organs such as kidney and testes. Thus, it is assumed that, like SARS, it may have adverse effects on other vital organs, which have dominant expression of ACE2. In testis, SARS affected patients displayed peritubular fibrosis, extensive germ cell disruption, damage of blood-testis barrier integrity and more frequent occurrence of apoptosis. Here, we critically discuss the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the testes of patients along with future precautions to overcome the complications of reproductive organs.

METHODS: This paper describes CopeColumbia, a peer support program developed by faculty in a large urban medical center's Department of Psychiatry to support emotional well-being and enhance the professional resilience of HCW. RESULTS: Grounded in evidence-based clinical practice and research, peer support was offered in three formats: groups, individual sessions, and town halls. Also, psychoeducational resources were centralized on a website. A Facilitator's Guide informed group and individual work by including: (1) emotional themes likely to arise (e.g., stress, anxiety, trauma, grief, and anger) and (2) suggested facilitator responses and interventions, drawing upon evidence-based principles from peer support, stress and coping models, and problem-solving, cognitive behavioral, and acceptance and commitment therapies. Feedback from group sessions was overwhelmingly positive. Approximately 1/3 of individual sessions led to treatment referrals. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons learned include: (1) there is likely an ongoing need for both well-being programs and linkages to mental health services for HCW, (2) the workforce with proper support, will emerge emotionally resilient, and (3) organizational support for programs like CopeColumbia is critical for sustainability.","Mellins, Claude A; Mayer, Laurel E S; Glasofer, Deborah R; Devlin, Michael J; Albano, Anne Marie; Nash, Sara Siris; Engle, Erin; Cullen, Colleen; Ng, Warren Y K; Allmann, Anna E; Fitelson, Elizabeth M; Vieira, Aaron; Remien, Robert H; Malone, Patrice; Wainberg, Milton L; Baptista-Neto, Lourival",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,203

407746,Cohorting Asymptomatic Patients by COVID-19 Status - Beware of False Negative RT-PCR Test Results and Inevitable Racial Segregation,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on social network sites (SNS) use and to explore whether SNS use is associated with body image disturbances and low self-esteem. METHODS: A total of 2601 women living in Spain aged 14-35 years completed questionnaire measures of SNS use, self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. In the survey, participants were asked about their use of SNS at the moment of answering the survey and before lockdown. RESULTS: A statistically significant increase was found in the frequency of use of all studied SNS (Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook) during lockdown, as well as in the number of women following appearance-focused Instagram accounts. Moreover, significant relationships were found between the frequency of Instagram use and body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness and low self-esteem in the younger age group (14-24), and between the frequency of Instagram use and drive for thinness in the older age group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram was related to body dissatisfaction and drive for thinness in the younger group, and only to drive for thinness in the older group (25-35). Following appearance-focused accounts on Instagram and a higher frequency of use of Instagram significantly predicted higher levels of drive for thinness. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lockdown has had an impact on SNS use, and this might be linked to increased drive for thinness and eating disorder risk among adolescent and young women.","Vall-Roqué, Helena; Andrés, Ana; Saldaña, Carmina",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,203

In our study, we aimed to measure the knowledge level, attitude to protective measures, perspective of education and medicolegal issues of obstetricians - gynecologists (OB-GYN) and pediatricians on pregnant and newborn health about COVID-19. Material-Methods: A cross-sectional, online-survey consisted of 22 questions. Age, academic degree, duration of the profession in the first three questions, level of knowledge about COVID-19 in the next 14 questions, attitude to protective measures, perspective of education and medicolegal issues in the last five questions were queried. Results: The questionnaire was applied to 145 physicians. 65.5% of them were pediatricians, 34.4% were OB-GYN. The level of having adequate knowledge about COVID-19 was determined as 44% and 34.7% for OB-GYN and pediatricians. No statistically significant relationship was found between the way of acquiring knowledge and academic degree in both physician groups (p&gt;0.05). Positive attitude of OB-GYN about preventive measures during - after the pandemic were 94% - 90%, 96.8% - 92.6% for pediatricians.

While these measures were crucial to stop the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, numerous voices highlighted their disorderly psychological, social, and economic impacts on food consumption behavior and lifestyle. Therefore, this paper aims to understand how consumers' food-related habits in Russia have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential problems and opportunities this might bring for the Russian food system. The study is based on an online cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Russian through the Survey Monkey platform. A total of 1297 valid answers was collected. The results reveal that diet and food shopping, preparation, and use have been widely affected. Indeed, the survey results suggested (i) a change in the modality of acquiring food, consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and buying more on each trip to minimize store visits; (ii) a surge of stockpiling of non-perishable food items; (iii) a shift toward healthier diets; (iv) an increase in culinary capabilities; (v) a decrease of food waste. The results are expected to inform current emergency plans as well as long-term food-related strategies in Russia.","Ben Hassen, Tarek; El Bilali, Hamid; Allahyari, Mohammad S; Berjan, Sinisa; Fotina, Oksana",Appetite,,203
408776,COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients in Colombia: Report of seven cases,2020,"Dornase alfa, the recombinant form of the human DNase I enzyme, breaks down neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) that include a vast amount of DNA fragments, histones, microbicidal proteins and oxidant enzymes released from necrotic neutrophils in the highly viscous mucus of cystic fibrosis patients. Dornase alfa has been used for decades in patients with cystic fibrosis to reduce the viscoelasticity of respiratory tract secretions, to decrease the severity of respiratory tract infections, and to improve lung function. Previous studies have linked abnormal NET formations to lung diseases, especially to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is well known that novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia progresses to ARDS and even multiple organ failure. High blood neutrophil levels are an early indicator of COVID-19 and predict severe respiratory diseases. Also it is reported that mucus structure of COVID-19 is very similar to cystic fibrosis due to the accumulation of excessive NET in the lungs. In this study, we showed the recovery of three COVID-19 patients after including Dornase alfa in their treatment. We followed clinical improvement in the radiological analysis (2-of-3 cases), oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate, disappearing of dyspnea, coughing and a decrease in NET formation and SARS-CoV-2 viral load after the treatment. Also here, we share our preliminary results suggesting that Dornase alfa has an anti-viral effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a green monkey kidney cell line, Vero, and a bovine kidney cell line, MDBK without determined cytotoxicity on healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells.","Okur, Hacer Kuzu; Yalcin, Koray; Tastan, Cihan; Demir, Sevda; Yurtsever, Bulut; Sir, Gozde; Kancagi, Derya Dilek; Abanuz, Selen; Seyis, Utku; Zengin, Rehile; Hemsinlioglu, Cansu; Kara, Mujdat; Yildiz, Mehmet Erdem; Deliceo, Elif; Birgen, Nur; Pelit, Nil Banu; Cuhadaroglu, Caglar; Kocagoz, Ayse Sesin; Ovali, Ercument",New Microbes New Infect,,203

409001,In-Hospital and Long-Term outcomes after Open-Heart Surgery in Turkish Octogenarians: a Single-Center Study,2021,"Integrating interdisciplinary studies with Human Capital Management Accounting (HCMA) refers to the dynamics of organized interdisciplinary action that are transversal or cross-cutting. This approach requires the mastery of a certain number of technical skills and disciplines, as well as the capacity to use them in a process to solve problems of financial performance. This is accomplished through the specific interaction tasks that are performed by each management function and operational unit, which act in real time with others, in the same direction as an organizational team, using a selected risk appetite threshold base. Putting business fields side by side, (i.e., business disciplines silos, as is normally the case in MBA programs), is not enough to create the transversal interaction dynamic needed for firms to achieve expected financial performance goals. As a result, few graduates today have the cross-cutting or vertical skills required to act, in real time, from their workstation in accordance with the pyramid shape of the organization chart in order to create value.

410263,Utility of chest CT in diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: A notable feature of COVID-19 is that children are less susceptible to severe disease. Children are known to experience more infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) compared to adults. Little is known whether HCoV infections lead to cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS: We investigated the presence of cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (to spike(S)1, S1-receptor-binding receptor (S1-RBD) and nucleocapsid protein(NP)), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and neutralizing activity by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay, in pre-pandemic sera collected from children(n=50) and adults(n=45), and compared with serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients(n=16). RESULTS: A significant proportion of children (up to 40%) had detectable cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1, S1-RBD and NP antigens, and the anti-S1 and -S1-RBD antibody levels correlated with anti-HCoV-HKU1 and -OC43 S1 antibody titers in pre-pandemic samples(p<0.001). There were marked increases of anti-HCoV-HKU1 and -OC43 S1 (but not anti-NL63 and -229E S-RBD) antibody titres in serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients(p<0.001), indicating an activation of cross-reactive immunological memory to ß-coronavirus spike. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic serum samples from children and young adults. Promoting this cross-reactive immunity and memory response derived from common HCoV may be an effective strategy against SARS-COV-2 and future novel coronaviruses.","Sharwani, Khalid; Sharma, Ravi; Krishnan, Madhan; Jones, Terry; Mayora-Neto, Martin; Cantoni, Diego; Temperton, Nigel A; Dobson, Susan L; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; McNamara, Paul S; Cunliffe, Nigel A; Turtle, Lance; Zhang, Qibo",J. infect. dis,,203

METHODS: A questionnaire regarding COVID-19 symptoms and exposure history was administered to all individuals contacting the Israeli Defence Forces Corona call-centre, before PCR testing. Surveyed symptoms included cough, fever, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, loss of taste or smell, chest pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. Factors were compared between positive and negative cases based on confirmatory test results, and positive likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated. Results were stratified by sex, body mass index, previous medical history and dates of questioning, and a multivariable analysis for association with positive test was conducted. RESULTS: Of 24 362 respondents, 59.1% were men with a median age of 20.5 years (interquartile range 19.6-22.4 years). Significant positive LRs were associated with loss of taste or smell (LR 3.38, 95% CI 3.01-3.79), suspected exposure (LR 1.33, 95% CI 1.28-1.39) and fever (LR 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36). Those factors were also associated with positive PCR result in a multivariable analysis (OR 3.51, 95% CI 3.04-4.06; OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.65-2.09; and OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.19-1.51, respectively). Reports of loss of taste or smell increased gradually over time and were significantly more frequent during the late period of the study (63/5231, 1.21%; 156/7941, 1.96%; and 1505/11 190, 13.45%: p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Loss of taste or smell, report of a suspicious exposure and fever (>37.5°C) were consistently associated with positive LRs for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result, in a population of predominantly young and healthy adults.","Nitecki, Maya; Taran, Boris; Ketko, Itay; Geva, Gil; Yosef, Roey; Toledo, Itay; Twig, Gilad; Avramovitch, Eva; Gordon, Barak; Derazne, Estela; Fink, Noam; Furer, Ariel",Clin. microbiol. infect,,203

411120,Prospective: Evolution of Chinese Medicine to Treat COVID-19 Patients in China,2020,"Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is an important food crop with a diverse gene pool residing in its wild relatives. A total of 15 sorghum accessions from the unexploited wild gene pool of the Sorghum genus, representing the five subgenera, were sequenced, and the complete chloroplast genomes and 99 common single-copy concatenated nuclear genes were assembled. Annotation of the chloroplast genomes identified a total of 81 protein-coding genes, 38 tRNA, and four rRNA genes. The gene content and gene order among the species was identical. A total of 153 nonsynonymous amino acid changes in 40 genes were identified across the species. Phylogenetic analysis of both the whole chloroplast genome and nuclear genes revealed a similar topology with two distinct clades within the genus. The species within the subgenera Eusorghum, Chaetosorghum, and Heterosorghum clustered in one clade, whereas the species within the subgenera Parasorghum and Stiposorghum clustered in a second clade. However, the subgenera Parasorghum and Stiposorghum were not monophyletic, suggesting the need for further research to resolve the relationships within this group. The close relationship between the two monotypic subgenera Chaetosorghum and Heterosorghum suggests that species within these subgenera could be considered as one group. This analysis provides an improved understanding of the genetic relationships within the Sorghum genus and defines diversity in wild sorghum species that may be useful for crop improvement.","Ananda, Galaihalage; Norton, Sally; Blomstedt, Cecilia; Furtado, Agnelo; Møller, Birger; Gleadow, Roslyn; Henry, Robert",Plant Genome,,203

They are considered promising targets of numerous diseases including chronic pain and cancer. Modulators of these proteins, in particular TRPV1-4, TRPM8 and TRPA1, have reached clinical development, but none has been approved for clinical practice yet. AREAS COVERED: The therapeutic potential of targeting thermoTRP channels is discussed. The discussion is centered on our experience and on available data found in SciFinder, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov database from the past decade. This review focuses on the therapeutic progress concerning this family of channels, including strategies to improve their therapeutic index for overcoming adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Although thermoTRPs are pivotal drug targets, translation to the clinic has faced two key problems, (i) unforeseen side effects in Phase I trials and, (ii) poor clinical efficacy in Phase II trials. Thus, there is a need for (i) an enhanced understanding of the physiological role of these channels in tissues and organs and (ii) the development of human-based pre-clinical models with higher clinical translation. Furthermore, progress in nanotechnology-based delivery strategies will positively impact thermoTRP human pharmacology.","Fernández-Carvajal, Asia; González-Muñiz, Rosario; Fernández-Ballester, Gregorio; Ferrer-Montiel, Antonio",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,,203

412461,Imaging findings in COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"Background: COVID-19 was first recognized in late 2019 in China, at which time school closures forced most students to isolate at home or maintain social distance, both of which increased smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and post traumatic disorder (PTSD) risks. However, to date, no research has fully explored these behavioral risks or the consequences. Methods: Two thousand and ninety home-confined students from two Chinese high schools participated in an online-based questionnaire battery that assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related exposures, daytime sleepiness, problematic smartphone use, and PTSD. The subsequent data were subjected to mediation analysis, and structural equation models (SEM) were employed to explore the variable relationships. Results: The problematic smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and PTSD prevalence were respectively 16.4%, 20.2% and 6.9%. The number of COVID-19 related exposure was directly associated with problematic smartphone use and PTSD symptoms. Problematic smartphone use was found to be a mediator between COVID-19 related exposure and PTSD symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was found to partially mediate the associations between problematic smartphone use and PTSD. Conclusions: The more exposure associated with the pandemic, the more psychological and behavioral problems the adolescents had. The relatively high rate of problematic smartphone use in home isolated adolescents possibly increased the risk of daytime sleepiness and psychological problems. Therefore, targeted improvements are needed to reduce the risk of psychological problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents.","Hu, Tao; Wang, Ying; Lin, Ling; Tang, Wanjie",Child Youth Serv Rev,,203
412533,Updated Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations in Response to COVID-19 Vaccination,2021,"The clinical presentation of COVID-19 is very heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe, which could lead to the need for mechanical ventilation or even death.We analyzed the serum levels of IL-6 in patients with COVID-19 diagnosis and its relationship with the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation and with patient mortality. We assessed IL-6 in a cohort of 50 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia with different degrees of disease severity, and compared it with clinical and laboratory findings. We found higher levels of IL-6 in patients with more severe pneumonia according to CURB-65 scale (p = 0.001), with ICU mechanical ventilation requirements (p = 0.02), and who subsequently died (p = 0.003). Of the clinical and analytical parameters analyzed in the current study, the serum levels of IL-6 was the most effective predictor of disease severity. From the data obtained in ROC curve analysis, we defined a cut-off point for serum IL-6 levels of 35 pg/mL above which both the risk of mortality (OR = 20.00, 95 % CI 4.214-94-912, p = 0.0001) and ICU admission (OR = 12.750, 95 % CI 2,159-75,3,3, p = 0.005) were increased. Starting from blood IL-6 levels 27 out of 50 patients, with high levels and more severe symptoms, were treated with the IL-6 receptor antagonist Tocilizumab. IL-6 serum levels appear to be a useful prognostic biomarker in patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. A cut-off point of 35 pg/mL could clearly differentiate patients a with more severe disease.","Guirao, Jose J; Cabrera, Carmen M; Jiménez, Natalia; Rincón, Laura; Urra, José M",Mol Immunol,,203

Our data reveal transcriptomic profiles indicative of defective antigen presentation and interferon (IFN) responsiveness in monocytes from ARDS patients, which contrasts with higher responsiveness to IFN signaling in lymphocytes. Furthermore, genes involved in cytotoxic activity are suppressed in both natural killer (NK) and CD8 T lymphocytes, and B cell activation is deficient, which is consistent with delayed viral clearance in severely ill COVID-19 patients.

The analysis was guided by four overarching questions: 1) What were robots used for in the COVID-19 response? 2) When were they used? 3) How did different countries innovate? and 4) Did having a national policy on robotics influence a country's innovation and insertion of robotics for COVID-19? The findings indicate that robots were used for six different sociotechnical work domains and 29 discrete use cases. When robots were used varied greatly on the country; although many countries did report an increase at the beginning of their first surge. To understand the findings of how innovation occurred, the data was examined through the lens of the technology's maturity according to NASA's Technical Readiness Assessment metrics. Through this lens, findings note that existing robots were used for more than 78% of the instances; slightly modified robots made up 10%; and truly novel robots or novel use cases constituted 12% of the instances. The findings clearly indicate that countries with a national robotics initiative were more likely to use robotics more often and for broader purposes. Finally, the dataset and analysis produces a broad set of implications that warrant further study and investigation. The results from this analysis are expected to be of value to the robotics and robotics policy community in preparing robots for rapid insertion into future disasters.","Murphy, Robin R.; Gandudi, Vignesh B.M.; Amin, Trisha; Clendenin, Angela; Moats, Jason",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02509v1.pdf,203

415888,Reaching academic library users during the COVID-19 pandemic: New and adapted approaches in access services,2021,"Quasiparticles of the Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain - spinons - represent the best experimentally accessible example of fractionalized excitations known to date. Dynamic spin response of the spin chain is typically dominated by the broad multi-spinon continuum that often masks subtle features, such as edge singularities, induced by the interaction between spinons. This, however, is not the case in the small momentum region of the magnetized spin chain where strong interaction between spinons leads to {\em qualitative} changes to the response. Here we report experimental verification of the recently predicted collective modes of spinons in a model material K$_2$CuSO$_4$Br$_2$ by means of the electron spin resonance (ESR). We exploit the unique feature of the material - the uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction between chain's spins - in order to access small momentum regime of the dynamic spin susceptibility. By measuring interaction-induced splitting between the two components of the ESR doublet we directly determine the magnitude of the marginally irrelevant backscattering interaction between spinons for the first time. We find it to be in an excellent agreement with the predictions of the effective field theory. Our results point out an intriguing similarity between the one-dimensional interacting liquid of neutral spinons and the Landau Fermi liquid of electrons.","Povarov, Kirill Yu.; Soldatov, Timofei A.; Wang, Ren-Bo; Zheludev, Andrey; Smirnov, Alexander I.; Starykh, Oleg A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02835v1.pdf,203

The absence of previous knowledge of COVID-19 has made decision-making difficult for all in health care, including surgical departments. We reviewed the management recommendations for surgical activity and changes to surgical practice, identifying concordances and discrepancies, based on the literature published in the early phase of the pandemic. METHOD: We searched the electronic datasets, PubMed Database, Google, and Google Scholar, using the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""surgery"", ""recommendations"", ""guideline"", and ""triage"". The search was limited to the first 2 months after the pandemic began and was closed on May 6, 2020. RESULTS: Twenty papers were included in the analysis and their recommendations are divided into the following categories: 1. general aspects, such as maintaining the safety of health personnel and indications for surgery. 2. The preoperative phase, with recommendations about activating different care pathways for COVID-19 positive patients. 3. The operative phase, with recommendations about activating safety measures for aerosol-generating procedures. 4. The postoperative phase, with recommendations for managing operating theatres and patient transfers. CONCLUSION: The recommendations proposed in the revised documents are considered good practices aimed at keeping patients and healthcare professionals safe. However, these recommendations must be contextualized in each individual hospital.","Bresadola, Vittorio; Biddau, Carlo; Puggioni, Alessandro; Tel, Alessandro; Robiony, Massimo; Hodgkinson, Jonathan; Leo, Cosimo Alex",Surg Today,,203

Our data indicated that the rate of emergence of early confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hubei province outside Wuhan was dependent on migration population, and the second-generation of patients were family clusters originating from Wuhan travelers. Epidemiological investigation indicated that the reproductive number (R0) under containment strategies was 1.81, and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers were contagious with a transmission rate of 10.7%. Among the 176 patients, 53 were admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Hubei University of Medicine. The clinical characteristics of these 53 patients were collected and compared based on a positive RT-PCR test and presence of pneumonia. Clinical data showed that 47.2% (25/53) of COVID-19 patients were co-infected with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-19 patients coinfected with M. pneumoniae had a higher percentage of monocytes (P < 0.0044) and a lower neutrophils percentage (P < 0.0264).

Reply,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein, which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6324 viral genome sequences, we create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.","Nguyen, Thanh Thi; Pathirana, Pubudu N; Nguyen, Thin; Nguyen, Quoc Viet Hung; Bhatti, Asim; Nguyen, Dinh C; Nguyen, Dung Tien; Nguyen, Ngoc Duy; Creighton, Douglas; Abdelrazek, Mohamed",Sci Rep,,203
419235,Evaluation of adjunctive photobiomodulation (PBMT) for COVID-19 pneumonia via clinical status and pulmonary severity indices in a preliminary trial,2021,"BACKGROUND: Low-income countries have reduced health care system capacity and are therefore at risk of substantially higher COVID-19 case fatality rates than those currently seen in high-income countries. Handwashing is a key component of guidance to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior systematic reviews have indicated the effectiveness of handwashing to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses. In low-income countries, reduction of transmission is of paramount importance, but social distancing is challenged by high population densities and access to handwashing facilities with soap and water is limited. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to estimate global access to handwashing with soap and water to inform use of handwashing in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. METHODS: We utilized observational surveys and spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression modeling in the context of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study to estimate access to a handwashing station with available soap and water for 1,062 locations from 1990 to 2019. RESULTS: Despite overall improvements from 1990 {33.6% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 31.5, 35.6] without access} to 2019, globally in 2019, 2.02 (95% UI: 1.91, 2.14) billion people, 26.1% (95% UI: 24.7, 27.7) of the global population, lacked access to handwashing with available soap and water. More than 50% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania were without access to handwashing in 2019, and in eight countries, 50 million or more persons lacked access. DISCUSSION: For populations without handwashing access, immediate improvements in access or alternative strategies are urgently needed, and disparities in handwashing access should be incorporated into COVID-19 forecasting models when applied to low-income countries. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7200.","Brauer, Michael; Zhao, Jeff T; Bennitt, Fiona B; Stanaway, Jeffrey D",Environ Health Perspect,,203

Modulating the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) may be an enforceable strategy for atherosclerosis prevention. Therefore, we investigated the potential mechanisms of N. nucifera leaf polyphenol extract (NLPE) and its active ingredient gallic acid (GA) in VSMC proliferation and migration. A7r5 rat aortic VSMCs were provoked using 50 ng mL-1 tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;; the NLPE or GA reduced the TNF-&#945;-induced migration by inhibiting the transforming protein RhoA/cell division cycle protein 42 pathway. The NLPE or GA suppressed the TNF-&#945;-induced VSMC proliferation by inhibiting the Ras pathway and increasing the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), kinase suppressor of Ras 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The NLPE or GA increased PTEN expression by downregulating microRNA (miR)-21 expression and reduced Ras and RhoA expression by upregulating miR-143 and miR-145 expression. The NLPE and GA use potentially prevents atherosclerosis by inhibiting the VSMC migration and proliferation. The mechanisms involve the regulation of the miRNA in PTEN, the Ras/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway, and Rho family proteins.","Chung, Dai-Jung; Wu, Yi-Liang; Yang, Mon-Yuan; Chan, Kuei-Chuan; Lee, Huei-Jane; Wang, Chau-Jong",Food Funct,,203

The ability of COVID-19 to cause chronic illness, sarcopenia, and physical deconditioning may be underestimated and go beyond the anticipated respiratory sequelae. Myalgia, lethargy, and anorexia are common symptoms even in mild to moderate cases and have the potential to exacerbate frailty. How this impacts on risk-stratification for patients requiring surgery for time-critical conditions, such as malignancy, requires further urgent investigation. MAIN BODY: The deleterious effect of sarcopenia and poor physical capacity are well recognised in cancer surgery. This review commentary highlights current evidence which suggests skeletal muscle as an under recognised cause of COVID-19-related functional deconditioning. The mechanisms behind this are via direct (viral induced myositis, nutritional decline, cytokine-mediated myopathy) and indirect mechanisms (social isolation, inactivity, and psychological consequences). CONCLUSION: Further mechanistic research is required to explore the processes behind the deconditioning effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how this impacts on treatment of malignant disease.","Casey, Patrick; Ang, Yeng; Sultan, Javed",World J Surg Oncol,,203

In order for patients to continue to benefit from CR, programs need to rapidly adapt to the current environment. This review highlights ways CR has evolved, and reviews the history of CR and recent advancements in telemedicine including remote patient monitoring, and mobile health that can be applied to CR. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite that initial studies indicate that home-based CR (HBCR) is safe and effective, HBCR has faced several challenges that have prevented it from becoming more widely implemented. Many previous concerns can now be addressed through the use of new innovations in home-based healthcare delivery. Since its inception, CR has become increasingly recognized as an important tool to improve patient mortality and quality of life in a broad range of cardiac diseases. While there has been little need to modify the delivery of CR since the 1950s, COVID-19 now serves as the necessary impetus to make HBCR an equal alternative to CBCR.","Epstein, Elizabeth; Patel, Neeja; Maysent, Kathryn; Taub, Pam R",Curr Cardiol Rep,,203

Questions evaluated interest in de-escalation trial participation, perceived barriers/facilitators to participation, and language describing de-escalation. RESULTS: Sixteen patient advocates and 24 patients were interviewed. Key barriers to de-escalation included fear of recurrence, worry about decision regret, lack of clinical trial interest, and dislike for focus on less treatment. Facilitators included trust in physician recommendation, toxicity avoidance, monitoring for progression, perception of good prognosis, and impact on daily life. Participants reported that the COVID-19 pandemic made them more likely to avoid chemotherapy if possible. Of 91 survey respondents, many (43%) patients would have been unwilling to participation in a de-escalation clinical trial. The most commonly reported barrier to participation was fear of recurrence (85%). Few patients (19%) considered clinical trials themselves as a barrier to de-escalation trial participation. The most popular terminology describing chemotherapy de-escalation was ""lowest effective chemotherapy dose"" (53%); no patients preferred the term ""de-escalation."" CONCLUSIONS: Fear of recurrence is a common concern among breast cancer survivors and patient advocates, contributing to resistance to de-escalation clinical trial participation. Additional research is needed to understand how to engage patients in de-escalation trials.","Rocque, Gabrielle B; Williams, Courtney P; Andrews, Courtney; Childers, Timothy C; Wiseman, Kimberly D; Gallagher, Kathleen; Tung, Nadine; Balch, Alan; Lawhon, Valerie M; Ingram, Stacey A; Brown, Thelma; Kaufmann, Tara; Smith, Mary L; DeMichele, Angela; Wolff, Antonio C; Wagner, Lynne",Cancer Med,,203

Differing from other coronavirus (CoV) genera, which mainly infect birds or mammals, deltacoronaviruses (Î´-CoVs) reportedly infect both animal types. Recent studies show that a novel Î´-CoV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), can also infect calves and chickens with the potential to infect humans, raising the possibility of cross-species transmission of Î´-CoVs. Here, we explored the deep phylogenetic history and cross-species transmission of Î´-CoVs. Virus-host co-phylogenetic analyses showed that Î´-CoVs have undergone frequent host switches in birds, and sparrows may serve as the unappreciated hubs for avian to mammal transmission. Our molecular clock analyses show that PDCoV possibly originated in Southeast Asia in the 1990s, and that the PDCoV cluster shares a common ancestor with Sparrow-CoV of around 1810. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the diversification, evolution, and interspecies transmission of Î´-CoVs and the origin of PDCoV, providing a model for exploring the relationships of Î´-CoVs in birds and mammals.","Ye, Xu; Chen, Yingjin; Zhu, Xinyu; Guo, Jiahui; Da, Xie; Hou, Zhenzhen; Xu, Shangen; Zhou, Junwei; Fang, Liurong; Wang, Dang; Xiao, Shaobo",,,203
420783,Global comparison of changes in the number of test-positive cases and deaths by coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the world,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic presents a great public health challenge worldwide, especially given the urgent need to identify effective drugs and develop a vaccine in a short period of time. Globally, several drugs and vaccine candidates are in clinical trials. However, because these drugs and vaccines are still being tested, there is still no definition of which ones will succeed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the opinions of over 1000 virus researchers with knowledge on the prevention and treatment of coronavirus-related human diseases to determine the most promising drug and vaccine candidates to address COVID-19. METHODS: We mapped the clinical trials related to COVID-19 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. These data were used to prepare a survey questionnaire about treatments and vaccine candidates for COVID-19. In May 2020, a global survey was conducted with authors of recent scientific publications indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection related to viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses, and COVID-19. RESULTS: Remdesivir, immunoglobulin from cured patients, and plasma were considered to be the most promising treatments in May 2020, while ChAdOx1 and mRNA-1273 were considered to be the most promising vaccine candidates. Almost two-thirds of the respondents (766/1219, 62.8%) believed that vaccines for COVID-19 were likely to be available in the next 18 months. Slightly fewer than 25% (289/1219, 23.7%) believed that a vaccine was feasible, but probably not within 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The issues addressed in this study are constantly evolving; therefore, the current state of knowledge has changed since the survey was conducted. However, for several months after the survey, the respondents' expectations were in line with recent results related to treatments and vaccine candidates for COVID-19.","Cabral, Bernardo Pereira; Braga, Luiza; Mota, Fabio",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,203

The aim of this study was an exploration of dilemmas experienced by elderly care physicians (ECPs) as a result of the COVID-19 driven restrictive visiting policy. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: ECPs working in Dutch NHs. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory study was performed using an open-ended questionnaire. A thematic analysis was applied. Data were collected between April 17 and May 10, 2020. RESULTS: Seventy-six ECPs answered the questionnaire describing a total of 114 cases in which they experienced a dilemma. Thematic analysis revealed 4 major themes: (1) The need for balancing safety for all through infection prevention measures versus quality of life of the individual residents and their loved ones; (2) The challenge of assessing the dying phase and how the allowed exception to the strict visitor restriction in the dying phase could be implemented; (3) The profound emotional impact on ECPs; (4) Many alternatives for visits highlight the wish to compensate for the absence of face-to-face contact opportunities. Many alternatives for visits highlight the wish to compensate for the absence of face-to-face opportunities but given the diversity of NH residents, alternatives were often only suitable for some of them. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: ECPs reported that the restrictive visitor policy deeply impacts NHs residents, their loved ones, and care professionals. The dilemmas encountered as a result of the policy highlight the wish by ECPs to offer solutions tailored to the individual residents. We identified an overview of aspects to consider when drafting future visiting policies for NHs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sizoo, Eefje M; Monnier, Annelie A; Bloemen, Maryam; Hertogh, Cees M P M; Smalbrugge, Martin",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,203

This study aimed to assess the expression of NKG2A inhibitory receptor on natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in COVID-19 patients and correlate the results with disease severity defined according to the criteria established by the world health organization, in a trial to understand the immunological response towards COVID-19 infection. The study enrolled 30 COVID-19 patients classified into 2 groups that comprised 15 subjects each;moderate and severe based on clinical, radiological, and laboratory findings. Ten age and sex matched apparently healthy individuals were included in this study as a control group. About 1 ml EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples were collected for measuring expression of NKG2A/CD159a on CD56+ CD3- NK and CD3+CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower NK and CD8+ T cell counts compared to healthy subjects. Severe cases had significantly lower CD8+ T counts compared to moderate ones. Percentages of NK and CD8+T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Comparison between severe and moderate cases revealed that although the percentages of NK cells expressing NKG2A receptor were not significantly higher in severe cases, the mean fluorescence intensity was significantly higher. The percentages of CD8 +T cells expressing NKG2A receptor were significantly higher in severe cases with higher mean fluorescence intensity. In conclusion, our results indicate that elevated NKG2A expression on cytotoxic lymphocytes correlates with disease severity in COVID-19 patients, and may serve as a potential marker for prognosis. Additionally, the blockade of NKG2A should be investigated as means of enhancing NK cell and cytotoxic T cells antiviral immunity in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.

423921,"Response by Tsao and Manning to Letter Regarding Article, ""COVID-19-Associated Stress (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy""",2020,"Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a paradigm-shifting immunotherapy modality in oncology; however, unique toxicities such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome limit its ability to be implemented more widely in the outpatient setting or at smaller-volume centers. Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period. In this review, we explore potential niches for digital innovations that can improve the implementation of CAR-T therapy in each of these domains. These tools include patient-facing technologies and provider-facing platforms: for example, wearable devices and mobile health apps to screen for fevers and encephalopathy, electronic patient-reported outcome assessments-based workflows to assist with symptom management, machine learning algorithms to predict emerging CRS in real time, clinical decision support systems to assist with toxicity management, and digital coaching to help maintain wellness. Televisits, which have grown in prominence since the novel coronavirus pandemic, will continue to play a key role in the monitoring and management of CAR-T-related toxicities as well. Limitations of these strategies include the need to ensure care equity and stakeholder buy-in, both operationally and financially. Nevertheless, once developed and validated, the next-generation implementation of CAR-T therapy using these digital tools may improve both its safety and accessibility.","Banerjee, Rahul; Shah, Nina; Dicker, Adam P",JCO Clin Cancer Inform,,203

Our study sought to compare disease severity measures for patients in Ireland hospitalised with COVID-19 against those hospitalised with seasonal influenza. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. METHODS: COVID-19 hospital episodes and seasonal influenza hospital episodes were identified using relevant International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes from the Irish national hospitalisation dataset. The occurrences of key metrics of disease severity, length of stay, intensive care admission, ventilatory support, haemodialysis and in-hospital mortality were measured and compared between the two groups using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), stratified by age. RESULTS: Hospitalised COVID-19 episodes had a mean length of stay more than twice as long as hospitalised influenza episodes (17.7 days vs 8.3 days). The likelihood of all measures of disease severity was greater in COVID-19 episodes, and the odds of in-hospital mortality were five-fold higher in this group compared with seasonal influenza episodes (OR 5.07, 95% CI 4.29-5.99, P < 0.001). Greater likelihood of increased disease severity was observed for COVID-19 episodes in most age groups. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is a more severe illness than seasonal influenza in hospitalised cohorts. It is imperative that public health professionals ensure that evidence-based advocacy is part of the response to COVID-19 to tackle a dangerous ""infodemic"" that can undermine public health control measures.","Beatty, K; Hamilton, V; Kavanagh, P M",Public Health,,203
424238,Peripapillary retinal vascular involvement in early post-covid-19 patients,2020,"The Corona virus disease has significantly affected lives of people around the world. Existing quarantine policies led to large-scale lock-downs because of the slow tracking of the infection paths, and indeed we see new waves of the disease. This can be solved by contact tracing combined with efficient testing policies. Since the number of daily tests is limited, it is crucial to exploit them efficiently to improve the outcome of contact tracing (technological or human-based epidemiological investigations). We develop a controlled testing framework to achieve this goal. The key is to test individuals with high probability of being infected to identify them before symptoms appear. These probabilities are updated based on contact tracing and test results. We demonstrate that the proposed method could reduce the quarantine and morbidity rates compared to existing methods by up to a 50%. The results clearly demonstrate the necessity of accelerating the epidemiological investigations by using technological contact tracing. Furthermore, proper use of the testing capacity using the proposed controlled testing methodology leads to significantly improved results under both small and large testing capacities. We also show that for small new outbreaks controlled testing can prevent the large spread of new waves.

However, its role in mutation analysis remains unclear. To examine the feasibility of analyzing GIST mutations using mRNA obtained with EUS-FNA, we prospectively enrolled 41 patients with subepithelial lesion from which EUS-FNA was successfully acquired tissue sample. Thirty-two, 5, and 4 subepithelial lesions were diagnosed as GISTs, schwannomas, and leiomyomas, respectively. After RNA was extracted from FNA sample, RNA was converted to cDNA. Full-length sequence of the KIT cDNA amplified via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was successful in 31 (96.9%) out of 32 GIST and three out of 9 non-GIST (33.3%). The KIT mutation statuses of 31 GISTs in which KIT cDNA was amplified were successfully determined through directional sequencing. Furthermore, 15 of 16 surgically excised GISTs exhibited the same mutation status in both the EUS-FNA and resected samples. In vitro experiment, the minimum number of cells required to amplify full-length of KIT cDNA from RNA was one-tenth of that required to amplify KIT exon11 gene from DNA. This study clarifies that mutation analysis using RNA obtained with EUS-FNA is feasible and reliable. Moreover, our data would support that RNA-based mutation is superior to DNA-based mutation analysis in GIST.","Funasaka, Kohei; Miyahara, Ryoji; Furukawa, Kazuhiro; Sawada, Tsunaki; Maeda, Keiko; Yamamura, Takeshi; Ishikawa, Takuya; Ohno, Eizaburo; Nakamura, Masanao; Kawashima, Hiroki; Hirooka, Yoshiki; Ohmiya, Naoki; Fujishiro, Mitsuhiro",Transl Oncol,,203

METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a registry study that examined the efficacy and safety of antipsychotics for advanced cancer patients with delirium. A total of 818 patients were recruited from 39 specialized palliative care services in Japan. The severity of delirium was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale-Palliative care version, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (DRS-R-98), and the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) on Day 3. Data from 302 patients with motor anxiety with an Agitation Distress Scale score &#8805;2 on Day 0 were analyzed for this study. The patients were categorized into four treatment response groups: complete response (CR: no agitation and fully communicative), partial response (PR: no/mild agitation and partially communicative), unconscious/non-communicative (UC), and no change (NC). RESULTS: On Day 3, 29 (10%; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 7-13) and 2 (1%; 95% CI, 0-2) patients became unconscious and non-communicative, respectively.

428951,Study on clinical characteristics of 173 cases of COVID-19 and effect of glucocorticoid on nucleic acid negative conversion,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been mutating since it was first sequenced in early January 2020. The genetic variants have developed into a few distinct clusters with different properties. Since the United States (US) has the highest number of viral infected patients globally, it is essential to understand the US SARS-CoV-2. Using genotyping, sequence-alignment, time-evolution, $k$-means clustering, protein-folding stability, algebraic topology, and network theory, we reveal that the US SARS-CoV-2 has four substrains and five top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in China (2 cases), Singapore (2 cases), and the United Kingdom (1 case). The next three top US SARS-CoV-2 mutations were first detected in the US. These eight top mutations belong to two disconnected groups. The first group consisting of 5 concurrent mutations is prevailing, while the other group with three concurrent mutations gradually fades out. Our analysis suggests that female immune systems are more active than those of males in responding to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We identify that one of the top mutations, 27964C$>$T-(S24L) on ORF8, has an unusually strong gender dependence. Based on the analysis of all mutations on the spike protein, we further uncover that three of four US SASR-CoV-2 substrains become more infectious.

429023,Decline in mild stroke presentations and intravenous thrombolysis during the COVID-19 pandemic: the society of vascular and interventional neurology registry,2021,"The ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly on a global scale. Although it is clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is transmitted through human respiratory droplets and direct contact, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1-3. Here we investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols that was detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the most public areas was undetectable, except in two areas that were prone to crowding; this increase was possibly due to individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions; however, these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted through aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.

Int J Lab Hematol. 2020;00:1-5. https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13425,2021,"Background: Currently, SARS-CoV-2 liver invasion, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral drugs are widely thought to be associated with liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Besides, previous studies indicated that ACEI/ARB drugs can increase the expression of hepatic ACE2, a cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. This study aims to investigate whether ACEI/ARB aggravates liver injury and the association of inflammatory cytokines and antiviral drugs with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.Method: This retrospective study included 127 hypertensive patients with long-term use or nonuse of ACEI/ARBs hospitalized for COVID-19 from January 30 to April 7, 2020, in Tongji hospital of Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected.Results: Of the 127 patients with COVID-19 and hypertension, 43 taking long-term of ACEI/ARBs and 84 without using ACEI/ARBs. Abnormal liver function was observed in part of ACEI/ARB and non-ACEI/ARB users but without significant differences between these two groups. Serum inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF&#945;, as well as inflammation-related markers, ferritin, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein, were significantly elevated in patients with liver dysfunction. IL-6 level was positively correlated with liver function tests on admission and highly consistent with the changes of abnormal ALT, AST, and GGT during hospitalization, but the correlations of other inflammatory cytokines were low. There was no significant association between the use of antiviral drugs and liver dysfunction in these patients.Conclusion: The elevation of inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, but not ACEI/ARB and antiviral drugs, is closely associated with liver dysfunction in patients with hypertension and COVID-19.","Xiang, Dong; Ren, Xiuhua; Chen, Qian; Yu, Hengyi; Li, Xiping; Liu, Dong",Clin Exp Hypertens,,203

METHODS: A retrospective review of the UK Transplant Registry (UKTR) and national survey of UK lung transplant centers has been performed. RESULTS: There was geographic variation in the prevalence of COVID-19 infection across the UK. The number of donors fell by 48% during the early pandemic period. Lung utilization fell to 10% (compared with 24% for the same period of 2019). The number of lung transplants performed fell by 77% from 53, March to May 2019, to 12. Seven (58%) of these were performed in a single-center, designated ""COVID-light."" The number of patients who died on the lung transplant waiting list increased, compared to the same period of 2019 (p = .0118). Twenty-six lung transplant recipients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: As the pandemic continues, reviewing practice and implementing the lessons learned during this period, including the use of robust donor testing strategies and the provision of ""COVID-light"" hospitals, are vital in ensuring the safe continuation of our lung transplant program.","Hardman, Gillian; Sutcliffe, Ruth; Hogg, Rachel; Mumford, Lisa; Grocott, Laura; Mead-Regan, Sarah-Jane; Nuttall, Jane; Dunn, Stephanie; Seeley, Philip; Clark, Stephen; Quigley, Richard; Al-Attar, Nawwar; Booth, Karen; Dark, John H; Fisher, Andrew J",Clin Transplant,,203
429573,Skin Manifestations in COVID-19: Prevalence and Relationship with Disease Severity,2020,"In tropical Africa, SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is poorly described because of lack of access to testing and weak surveillance systems. Since April 2020, we followed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in plasma samples across the Kenya National Blood Transfusion Service. We developed an IgG ELISA against full length spike protein. Validated in locally-observed, PCR-positive COVID-19 cases and in pre-pandemic sera, sensitivity was 92.7% and specificity was 99.0%. Using sera from 9,922 donors, we estimated national seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies at 4.3% in April-June 2020 and 9.1% in August-September 2020. Kenyas second COVID-19 wave peaked in November 2020. Here we estimate national seroprevalence in early 2021. Between January 3 and March 15, 2021, we collected 3,062 samples from donors aged 16-64 years. Among 3,018 samples that met our study criteria, 1,333 were seropositive (crude seroprevalence 44.2%, 95% CI 42.4-46.0%). After Bayesian test-performance adjustment and population weighting to represent the national population distribution, the national estimate of seroprevalence was 48.5% (95% CI 45.2-52.1%). Seroprevalence varied little by age or sex but was higher in Nairobi (61.8%), the capital city, and lower in two rural regions. Almost half of Kenyas adult donors had evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection by March 2021. Although high, the estimate is corroborated by other population-specific estimates in country. Between March and June, 2% of the population were vaccinated against COVID-19 and the country experienced a third epidemic wave. Natural infection is outpacing vaccine delivery substantially in Africa, and this reality needs to be considered as objectives of the vaccine programme are set.","Uyoga, Sophie; Adetifa, Ifedayo M.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search on PubMed/LitCovid, Scopus, and Web of Sciences databases for papers in the English language only, up to 1 January 2021. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist developed for cross-sectional studies to appraise the quality of the included studies. All stages of the review conducted by two independent reviewers and potential discrepancies were solved with a consultation with a third reviewer. We reported the result as number and percentage. A meta-analysis conducted using a random effect model with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies encompassing 76,848 participants were included in this review. 56.53% of the participants were female. The mean age of the participants was 33.7 years. 85.42% of the included studies were scored as good quality, 12.50% as fair quality, and the remaining (2.08%) as low quality. About 87.5% examined all three components of the KAPs model. The knowledge component was reported as good and poor in 89.5% and 10.5% of the included studies, respectively. Of the studies that examined the attitude component, 100% reported a positive attitude. For the practice component, 93.2% reported satisfactory practice, and 6.8% poor practice. The result of the meta-analysis showed that the overall score of KAPs components about COVID-19 were 78.9, 79.8, and 74.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the overall KAP components in the included studies were at an acceptable level. In general, knowledge was at a good level, the attitude was positive and practice was at a satisfactory level. Using an integrated international system can help better evaluate these components and compare them between countries.

433447,Role of testosterone in COVID-19 patients - a double-edged sword?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Experiences of care and satisfaction are intrinsically linked, as user's experiences of care may directly impact satisfaction, or indirectly impact user's expectations and values. Both experiences of care and satisfaction are important to measure so that quality can be monitored and improved. Globally, women experience mistreatment during childbirth at facilities; however, there is limited evidence exploring the mistreatment and women's satisfaction with care during childbirth. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey within the WHO study 'How women are treated during facility-based childbirth' exploring the mistreatment of women during childbirth in Ghana, Guinea, Myanmar and Nigeria. Women's experiences of mistreatment and satisfaction with care during childbirth was explored. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was conducted to evaluate the association between mistreatment, women's overall satisfaction with the care they received, and whether they would recommend the facility to others. RESULTS: 2672 women were included in this analysis. Despite over one-third of women reporting experience of mistreatment (35.4%), overall satisfaction for services received and recommendation of the facility to others was high, 88.4% and 90%, respectively. Women who reported experiences of mistreatment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with care: women were more likely to be satisfied if they did not experience verbal abuse (adjusted OR (AOR) 4.52, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.85), or had short waiting times (AOR 5.12, 95% CI 3.94 to 6.65). Women who did not experience any physical or verbal abuse or discrimination were more likely to recommend the facility to others (AOR 3.89, 95% CI 2.98 to 5.06). CONCLUSION: Measuring both women's experiences and their satisfaction with care are critical to assess quality and provide actionable evidence for quality improvement. These measures can enable health systems to identify and respond to root causes contributing to measures of satisfaction.","Maung, Thae Maung; Mon, Nwe Oo; Mehrtash, Hedieh; Bonsaffoh, Kwame Adu; Vogel, Joshua P; Aderoba, Adeniyi Kolade; Irinyenikan, Theresa Azonima; Balde, Mamadou Dioulde; Pattanittum, Porjai; Tuncalp, Özge; Bohren, Meghan A",,,203
433606,Original Article: Evaluation of eosinopenia as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19 infection,2021,"Importance: Understanding how the electronic health record (EHR) system changes clinician work, productivity, and well-being is critical. Little is known regarding global variation in patterns of use. Objective: To provide insights into which EHR activities clinicians spend their time doing, the EHR tools they use, the system messages they receive, and the amount of time they spend using the EHR after hours. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study analyzed the deidentified metadata of ambulatory care health systems in the US, Canada, Northern Europe, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania from January 1, 2019, to August 31, 2019. All of these organizations used the EHR software from Epic Systems and represented most of Epic Systems's ambulatory customer base. The sample included all clinicians with scheduled patient appointments, such as physicians and advanced practice practitioners. Exposures: Clinician EHR use was tracked by deidentified and aggregated metadata across a variety of clinical activities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Descriptive statistics for clinician EHR use included time spent on clinical activities, note documentation (as measured by the percentage of characters in the note generated by automated or manual data entry source), messages received, and time spent after hours. Results: A total of 371 health systems were included in the sample, of which 348 (93.8%) were located in the US and 23 (6.2%) were located in other countries. US clinicians spent more time per day actively using the EHR compared with non-US clinicians (mean time, 90.2 minutes vs 59.1 minutes; P < .001). In addition, US clinicians vs non-US clinicians spent significantly more time performing 4 clinical activities: notes (40.7 minutes vs 30.7 minutes; P < .001), orders (19.5 minutes vs 8.75 minutes; P < .001), in-basket messages (12.5 minutes vs 4.80 minutes; P < .001), and clinical review (17.6 minutes vs 14.8 minutes; P = .01). Clinicians in the US composed more automated note text than their non-US counterparts (77.5% vs 60.8% of note text; P < .001) and received statistically significantly more messages per day (33.8 vs 12.8; P < .001). Furthermore, US clinicians used the EHR for a longer time after hours, logging in 26.5 minutes per day vs 19.5 minutes per day for non-US clinicians (P = .01). The median US clinician spent as much time actively using the EHR per day (90.1 minutes) as a non-US clinician in the 99th percentile of active EHR use time per day (90.7 minutes) in the sample. These results persisted after controlling for organizational characteristics, including structure, type, size, and daily patient volume. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that US clinicians compared with their non-US counterparts spent substantially more time actively using the EHR for a wide range of clinical activities or tasks. This finding suggests that US clinicians have a greater EHR burden that may be associated with nontechnical factors, which policy makers and health system leaders should consider when addressing clinician wellness.","Holmgren, A Jay; Downing, N Lance; Bates, David W; Shanafelt, Tait D; Milstein, Arnold; Sharp, Christopher D; Cutler, David M; Huckman, Robert S; Schulman, Kevin A",JAMA Intern Med,,203
433607,Original Article: Evaluation of eosinopenia as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in COVID-19 infection,2021,"PURPOSE: The study aimed to compare the incidence of interstitial pneumonia on [18F]-FDG PET/CT scans between two 6-month periods: (a) the COVID-19 pandemic peak and (b) control period. Secondly, we compared the incidence of interstitial pneumonia on [18F]-FDG PET/CT and epidemiological data from the regional registry of COVID-19 cases. Additionally, imaging findings and the intensity of [18F]-FDG PET/CT uptake in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were compared. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed [18F]-FDG PET/CT scans performed in cancer patients referred to nuclear medicine of Humanitas Gavazzeni in Bergamo from December 2019 to May 2020 and from December 2018 to May 2019. The per month incidence of interstitial pneumonia at imaging and the epidemiological data were assessed. To evaluate the differences between the two symmetric groups (period of COVID-19 pandemic and control), the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used. Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and t test or Wilcoxon test were performed to compare the distributions of categorical and continuous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, 1298 patients were included in the study. The two cohorts-COVID-19 pandemic (n = 575) and control (n = 723)-did not statistically differ in terms of age, disease, or scan indication (p > 0.05). Signs of interstitial pneumonia were observed in 24 (4.2%) and 14 patients (1.9%) in the COVID-19 period and the control period, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.013). The level of statistical significance improved further when the period from January to May was considered, with a peak in March (7/83 patients, 8.4% vs 3/134 patients, 2.2%, p = 0.001). The curve of interstitial pneumonia diagnosis overlapped with the COVID-19 incidence in the area of Lombardy (Spearman correlation index was equal to 1). Imaging data did not differ among the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Significant increase of interstitial lung alterations at [18F]-FDG PET/CT has been demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the incidence curve of imaging abnormalities resulted in resembling the epidemiological data of the general population. These data support the rationale to adopt [18F]-FDG PET/CT as sentinel modality to identify suspicious COVID-19 cases to be referred for additional confirmatory testing. Nuclear medicine physicians and staff should continue active surveillance of interstitial pneumonia findings, especially when new infection peak is expected.","Setti, Lucia; Bonacina, Manuela; Meroni, Roberta; Kirienko, Margarita; Galli, Francesca; Dalto, Serena Camilla; Erba, Paola Anna; Bombardieri, Emilio",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,,203

Aiming to reduce the impact of these diseases, in this work a methodology is developed that allows the early detection and prevention of potential hypoxemic clinical cases in patients vulnerable to respiratory diseases. Starting from the methodology proposed by the authors in a previous work and grounded in the definition of a set of expert systems, the methodology can generate alerts about the patient's hypoxemic status by means of the interpretation and combination of data coming both from physical measurements and from the considerations of health professionals. A concurrent set of Mamdani-type fuzzy-logic inference systems allows the collecting and processing of information, thus determining a final alert associated with the measurement of the global hypoxemic risk. This new methodology has been tested experimentally, producing positive results so far from the viewpoint of time reduction in the detection of a blood oxygen saturation deficit condition, thus implicitly improving the consequent treatment options and reducing the potential adverse effects on the patient's health.","Comesaña-Campos, Alberto; Casal-Guisande, Manuel; Cerqueiro-Pequeño, Jorge; Bouza-Rodríguez, José-Benito",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203

Here we report 4 cases of patients with heart transplant who presented with COVID-19 infection in late 2020. Patients presented with symptoms similar to those seen in the general population. All 4 patients were admitted to the hospital, and they were all treated with dexamethasone. In addition, 2 patients received remdesivir. Immunosuppressive medications were adjusted to maintain adequate levels of immunosuppression but at the same time allow for an adequate immune response against the infection. All patients were discharged alive from the hospital.

PPM consistently expresses Trefoil-Factor 2 (TFF2), which is histochemically detecteble (TFF2-IHC). AIMS: Intra- and inter-observer consistency in assessing PPM was examined using both hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) and TFF2-IHC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-four oxyntic biopsy samples obtained from autoimmune gastritis were considered. Two serial histological sections obtained from the paraffin-embedded tissue-samples were stained with H&E and TFF2-IHC. Three pathologists (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) independently scored PPM by both staining and the Intra- and inter-observer consistency (H&E versus TFF2-IHC) was calculated using k-statistics and/or Spearman's coefficient. RESULTS: Based on H&E-stain versus TFF2-IHC, intra-observer consistency in PPM assessement was ranked as consistently ""good"" (k-values: Alpha=0.79; Beta=0.78; Gamma=0.75). Based on H&E, the overall PPM inter-observer consistency among the 3 observers was ranked as ""good"" (k=0.77) (the inter-observer consistency for pairs of observers was as follows: Alpha versus Beta k=0.88; Alpha versus Gamma k=0.87; Beta versus Gamma k=0.80).

436452,The impact of covid-19 on patients presenting with lung cancer-the missing fifth,2021,"Abstract: Background: Patients have seemingly become more aggressive against healthcare workers when seeking their demands during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic Violence against healthcare workers is multifactorial and one that strongly associates with the burnout syndrome Objectives: The aim of this study was to draw a conclusion from the previously published literature about the association of violence against Health Care Workers (HCWs) and their burnout syndrome And also, to find out other associated factors and possible solutions for this phenomenon Results: HCWs are subject to stressful situations and high pressure, alongside highly infectious diseases (SARS-CoV2), shortage of PPE, working for more than 24 hr, without payment or reward, difficulties at the workplace, and a poor workplace administration , which can all lead to what is known as a “burnout syndrome ‿ On the other hand, patients have high expectations of their needs Their attendants’ (co-patients) are generally anxious about their patients’ medical fate Also, patients or co-patients perceive a doctor as their only savior, and so any unexpected or unpleasant behaviorfrom the burnt-out HCWs can be counteracted by aggressiveness and violence Conclusion: Violence against HCWs is associated with burnout syndrome and vice versa A real attempt should be made focusing on the radical solution for the problem of burnout syndrome rather than enacting laws to punish the aggressors against HCWs","Elhadi, M.

436935,The impact of COVID-19 on acute ischemic stroke admissions: Analysis from a community-based tertiary care center,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is causing mass disruption to our daily lives. We integrate mobility data from mobile devices and area-level data to study the walking patterns of 1.62 million anonymous users in 10 metropolitan areas in the United States. The data covers the period from mid-February 2020 (pre-lockdown) to late June 2020 (easing of lockdown restrictions). We detect when users were walking, distance walked and time of the walk, and classify each walk as recreational or utilitarian. Our results reveal dramatic declines in walking, particularly utilitarian walking, while recreational walking has recovered and even surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Our findings also demonstrate important social patterns, widening existing inequalities in walking behavior. COVID-19 response measures have a larger impact on walking behavior for those from low-income areas and high use of public transportation. Provision of equal opportunities to support walking is key to opening up our society and economy.","Hunter, Ruth F; Garcia, Leandro; de Sa, Thiago Herick; Zapata-Diomedi, Belen; Millett, Christopher; Woodcock, James; Pentland, Alex 039; Sandy039,; Moro, Esteban",Nat Commun,,203
437196,Quantitative CT Extent of Lung Damage in COVID-19 Pneumonia Is an Independent Risk Factor for Inpatient Mortality in a Population of Cancer Patients: A Prospective Study,2020,"Despite the burden of disease of CVD and DM, there is a lack of experimentally validated literature exploring their association with exacerbation of COVID-19. Target receptors of medications commonly used to treat CVD and DM may be involved in the viral entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. We propose the potential protective effects of these medications in COVID-19 infections, highlighting the need for further research. Firstly, AMPK mediated phosphorylation of ACE-2 by metformin as well as the drug's alkaline properties may interrupt the natural disease progression. Secondly, DPP4 receptor involvement in the putative viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 may be prevented by DPP4i. Finally, recent studies have shown that statins' ability to inhibit the cytokine storm may outweigh concerns of statin mediated ACE-2 upregulation in COVID-19. The complex interplay of factors affecting CVD and DM in COVID-19 patients makes the direct effects of medications difficult to examine. Therefore, further research is needed, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and the molecular pathways it exploits, to potentially repurpose such pre-existing drugs for their use in COVID-19.","Bangi, Shifa; Barve, Rajas; Qamar, Amna",SN Compr Clin Med,,203

We demonstrate an additional advantage of the balloon guide catheter during intra-arterial endovascular treatment of d-CCF. METHODS: Two cases of d-CCF are presented in this report. A balloon guide catheter is used to help achieve successful coil embolization of the fistula in both cases. RESULTS: Microcatheter positioning into the fistulous point can be easier after balloon inflation. Balloon inflation can help with coil deployment. CONCLUSIONS: Using a balloon guiding catheter can reduce ICA flow near the fistula point at the cavernous segment of the ICA. As a result, better identification of the fistula point can be made, which allows easier placement of the microcatheter into the fistula point and more stable coil deployment.","Son, Wonsoo; Kang, Dong-Hun; Park, Jaechan; Kwak, Youngseok; Kim, Myungsoo; Kim, Byung-Jun",World neurosurgery (Online),,203

441288,The determination of release from isolation of COVID-19 patients requires ultra-high sensitivity nucleic acid test technology,2020,"On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As of February 29, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported 79,389 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 34 provinces. The masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza. It is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent. China has a population of 1.4 billion. Assuming that two-thirds of the people in China must wear a mask every day, the daily demand for masks will reach 900 million. The Chinese government has taken many measures to solve these problems. Additionally, more measures should be taken to properly dispose of mask garbage. Although the outbreak originated in China, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, which means that it can be spread to anywhere in the world if prevention measures fail. The issues regarding face mask shortages and garbage in China, therefore, deserve worldwide attention.","Wang, M-W; Zhou, M-Y; Ji, G-H; Ye, L; Cheng, Y-R; Feng, Z-H; Chen, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,203
441380,Guideline-directed management of COVID-19: Do's and Don'ts,2021,"ABSTRACT Objective: To analyze computed tomography scans of paranasal sinuses of a series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019, and correlate the findings with the disease. Methods: Computed tomography scans of 95 adult patients who underwent a polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 were analyzed. Clinical data were obtained from patients' records and telephone calls. Paranasal sinus opacification was graded and compared according to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positivity. Results: Of the patients 28 (29.5%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (median age 52 [range 26-95] years) and 67 were negative (median age 50 [range 18-95] years). Mucosal thickening was present in 97.4% of maxillary sinuses, 80% of anterior ethmoid air cells, 75.3% of posterior ethmoid air cells, 74.7% of frontal sinuses, and 66.3% of sphenoid sinuses. Minimal or mild mucosal thickening (score 1)and normally aerated sinuses (score 0) corresponded to 71.4% and 21.3% of all paranasal sinuses, respectively. The mean score of each paranasal sinus among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative patients was 0.85±0.27 and 0.87±0.38, respectively (p=0.74). Median paranasal sinus opacification score among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients was 9 (interquartile range 8-10) compared to 9 (interquartile range 5-10) in negative patients (p=0.89). There was no difference in mean score adjusted for age and sex. Nasal congestion was more frequent in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive than negative patients (p=0.05). Conclusion: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was associated with patient recall of nasal congestion, but showed no correlation with opacification of paranasal sinuses.","Sumi, Daniel Vaccaro; Loureiro, Rafael Maffei; Collin, Simon Michael; Deps, Patrícia Duarte; Bezerra, Lorena Lima; Gomes, Regina Lúcia Elia; Daniel, Mauro Miguel",Einstein (Säo Paulo),,203
441382,Management of elective aortic valve replacement over the long term in the era of COVID-19,2020,"This paper, based on the notion of Trade in Value Added (TiVA), combines the global trade analysis project (GTAP) model with the value-added model in seeking to simulate and assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on China's manufacturing sector in global value chain (GVC) reconfiguration. The empirical study provides three major results. First, at the macroeconomic level, the pandemic wreaks a negative impact on all the economies, including the U.S., in regard to import & export trade, GDP and social welfare policy. Second, nation-level simulation shows that there's a remarkable disparity across different pandemic scenarios in the level of division of labor and of GVC participation for China and its trade partners. Third, sector-level analysis shows that the impacts of the pandemic include promoting the level of GVC participation and of labor division in China's manufacturing sector (electromechanical equipment and computer goods). This paper also provides policy advice for Chinese government: participation in higher-end GVCs, introduction of further structural reforms and retention of foreign investors, and active responses to GVC reconfiguration and cross-border capital flow.","Song, Yuegang; Hao, Xiazhen; Hu, Yilin; Lu, Zhou",Front Public Health,,203

442119,Deregulated cellular circuits driving immunoglobulins and complement consumption associate with the severity of COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is frequently complicated by venous thromboembolism (VTE). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest-primarily usually conducted as low-dose, non-contrast enhanced CT-plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 pneumonia. Performed as contrast-enhanced CT pulmonary angiography, it can reliably detect or rule-out pulmonary embolism (PE). Several imaging characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia have been described for chest CT, but no study evaluated CT findings in the context of VTE/PE. PURPOSE: In our retrospective study, we analyzed clinical, laboratory and CT imaging characteristics of 50 consecutive patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT at two tertiary care medical centers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with RT-PCR proven COVID-19 pneumonia and contrast-enhanced chest CT performed at two tertiary care hospitals between March 1st and April 20th 2020 were retrospectively identified. Patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), symptoms, date of symptom onset, RT-PCR results, imaging results of CT and leg ultrasound, laboratory findings (C-reactive protein, differential blood count, troponine, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), fibrinogen, interleukin-6, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase muscle-brain (CKmb) and lactate,) and patient outcome (positive: discharge or treatment on normal ward; negative: treatment on intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), or death) were analyzed. Follow-up was performed until May 10th. Patients were assigned to two groups according to two endpoints: venous thromboembolism (VTE) or no VTE. For statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression models were calculated. RESULTS: This study includes 50 patients. In 14 out of 50 patients (28%), pulmonary embolism was detected at contrast-enhanced chest CT. The majority of PE was detected on CTs performed on day 11-20 after symptom onset. Two patients (14%) with PE simultaneously had evidence of deep vein thrombosis. 15 patients (30%) had a negative outcome (need for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or death), and 35 patients (70%) had a positive outcome (transfer to regular ward, or discharge). Patients suffering VTE had a statistically significant higher risk of an unfavorable outcome (p = 0.028). In univariate analysis, two imaging characteristics on chest CT were associated with VTE: crazy paving pattern (p = 0.024) and air bronchogram (n = 0.021). Also, elevated levels of NT-pro BNP (p = 0.043), CK (p = 0.023) and D-dimers (p = 0.035) were significantly correlated with VTE. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pneumonia is frequently complicated by pulmonary embolism (incidence of 28% in our cohort), remarkably with lacking evidence of deep vein thrombosis in nearly all thus affected patients of our cohort. As patients suffering VTE had an adverse outcome, we call for a high level of alertness for PE and advocate a lower threshold for contrast-enhanced CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. According to our observations, this might be particularly justified in the second week of disease and if a crazy paving pattern and / or air bronchogram is present on previous non-enhanced CT.","Meiler, Stefanie; Hamer, Okka Wilkea; Schaible, Jan; Zeman, Florian; Zorger, Niels; Kleine, Henning; Rennert, Janine; Stroszczynski, Christian; Poschenrieder, Florian",PLoS One,,203
442476,International Variations and Sex Disparities in the Treatment of Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease: A Report from VASCUNET and the International Consortium of Vascular Registries,2020,"INTRODUCTION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, high-risk patient groups might have practiced social distancing and sheltering, and hospitals may have changed or postponed treatments and examinations. We aimed to explore health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with haematological diseases during the early phase of the pandemic and their acceptability of using telehealth. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey among patients at the Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Denmark. Eligible participants were patients receiving either active treatment or survivors in a follow-up program. The survey was open from 22 May to 13 June 2020. The survey contained questions on concerns and the impact of COVID-19 and acceptability on telehealth in addition to the assessment of health-related QoL. The later was assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire with the subdomains Global QoL, emotional functioning (EF) and social functioning (SF) being of primary interest. Further, anxiety during COVID-19 was assessed by use of an adapted version of the generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. RESULTS: 4420 patients were eligible to participate. The response rate was 53% (n = 2239) of which 37% where in a treatment program and 63% where in a follow-up program. The majority (80%) of patients were concerned about contracting COVID-19. The global QoL score (69.0, ±SD 22.6) was markedly lower than EF (84.5, ±SD 18.9) and SF (85.0, ±SD 23.4). Regression analysis showed that being concerned (a little, moderately, very, extremely) about contracting COVID-19 correlated with lower scores of global QoL (-3.86 to -22.76), EF (-3.81 to -26.41) and SF (-1.14 to -22.49). The GAD-7 score showed that approximately 20% of patients had symptoms of COVID-19 associated generalised anxiety. Finally, 67% of the patients were positive towards replacing face-to-face consultancies with phone calls, but video consultations were less preferred (47%). CONCLUSION: Danish patients with haematological cancer presented with low global QoL during the early phase of COVID-19, and 20% of the patients showed symptoms of generalised anxiety. Patients were overall positive towards the implementation of telehealth consultancies.","Ellehuus, Charlotte; Jeppesen, Stefan Starup; Eckhoff, Lise; Vestergaard, Hanne; Therkildsen, Ditte Naundrup; Frederiksen, Henrik; Eshoj, Henrik Rode",Acta Oncol,,203

In the first part, several liquid phase microextraction (LPME) and magnetic solid phase extraction (MSPE) methods were compared to each other in order to observe their extraction ability for the analyte. VA-SFDF-LPME method was selected as an efficient and easy extraction method due to its higher extraction efficiency. Optimization studies were carried out for the parameters such as extraction solvent type, sodium hydroxide volume/concentration, sample volume, spraying number and mixing type/period. Tukey's method based on post hoc test was applied to all experimental data for the selection of optimum values. Optimum extraction parameters were found to be 12 mL initial sample volume, two sprays of dichloromethane, 0.75 mL of 60 g/kg sodium hydroxide and 15 s vortex. Under the optimum conditions, limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ) were calculated as 2.8 and 9.2 µg/kg, respectively. Detection power of the GC-MS system was increased by approximately 317 folds with the developed extraction/preconcentration method. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated by spiking experiments and percent recovery results for human urine, serum and saliva samples were found in the range of 90.9% and 114.0% with low standard deviation values (1.9-9.4).","Bodur, Süleyman; Erarpat, Sezin; Günkara, Ömer Tahir; Bakirdere, Sezgin",J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods,,203

445092,Reply: Iron chelation may harm patients with COVID-19,2020,"We introduce general data-driven decision-making algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art \emph{dynamic regret} bounds for non-stationary bandit settings. It captures applications such as advertisement allocation and dynamic pricing in changing environments. We show how the difficulty posed by the (unknown \emph{a priori} and possibly adversarial) non-stationarity can be overcome by an unconventional marriage between stochastic and adversarial bandit learning algorithms. Our main contribution is a general algorithmic recipe that first converts the rate-optimal Upper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) algorithm for stationary bandit settings into a tuned Sliding Window-UCB algorithm with optimal dynamic regret for the corresponding non-stationary counterpart. Boosted by the novel bandit-over-bandit framework with automatic adaptation to the unknown changing environment, it even permits us to enjoy, in a (surprisingly) parameter-free manner, this optimal dynamic regret if the amount of non-stationarity is moderate to large or an improved (compared to existing literature) dynamic regret otherwise. In addition to the classical exploration-exploitation trade-off, our algorithms leverage the power of the""forgetting principle""in their online learning processes, which is vital in changing environments. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic data and the CPRM-12-001: On-Line Auto Lending dataset provided by the Center for Pricing and Revenue Management at Columbia University to show that our proposed algorithms achieve superior dynamic regret performances.","Cheung, Wang Chi; Simchi-Levi, David; Zhu, Ruihao",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01461v1.pdf,203

The study also investigated the moderating effect of a customer's product involvement, which is a personal characteristic. The results reveal that high satisfaction with the VF experience had a positive effect only on mobile purchase intentions. Brand advocacy formed after the VF experience had a positive effect on both mobile and offline purchase intentions and showed a mediating effect in the relationship between VF experience satisfaction and purchase intention. The moderating effect of product involvement was also confirmed. Moreover, a significantly negative influence of VF experience satisfaction on offline purchase intention was detected for customers who were more involved in sneakers products. These results indicate that VF, which is used as a tool in shopping apps, can achieve customer satisfaction and drive mobile purchases, thus leading to offline purchases based on brand advocacy.","Rhee, H.

In vitro studies reported that ARS has anticancer effects; however, its detrimental action on cancer cells may also play a role in its toxicity toward normal cells and its potential toxicity has not been sufficiently researched. In this study, we investigated the possible cytotoxic effects using normal BRL-3A and AML12 liver cells. The results showed that ARS dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and arrested the G0/G1 phase cell cycle in both BRL-3A and AML12 liver cells. Western blotting demonstrated that ARS induced a significant downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2), CDK4, cyclin D1, and cyclin E1 in various levels and then caused apoptosis when the Bcl-2/Bax ratio decreased. Conversely, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine can significantly inhibit cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induced by ARS. Thus, the data confirmed that ARS exposure impairs normal liver cell proliferation by inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and this detrimental action may be associated with intracellular ROS accumulation. Collectively, the possible side effects of ARS on healthy normal cells cannot be neglected when developing therapies.","Yin, S; Yang, H; Zhao, X; Wei, S; Tao, Y; Liu, M; Bo, R; Li, J",Hum Exp Toxicol,,203

It aims to summarize the epidemiological, clinical, diagnostical, and therapeutical characteristics of COVID-19, from a practical perspective, to ease COVID-19 management to non-physician staff. RECENT FINDINGS: We performed a narrative review of the literature regarding COVID-19, updated to May 8th, 2020, at PubMed and COVID resource platforms of the main scientific editorials. COVID-19, characterized by fever, myalgias, dyspnea, and dry cough, varies widely from asymptomatic infection to death. Arrhythmias and thrombotic events are prevalent. Lymphopenia and inflammatory reactant elevation on laboratory, as well as bilateral and peripheral ground-glass opacities or consolidations on X-Ray, are usually found in its assessment. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 immunology. To date, no therapy has demonstrated efficacy in COVID-19. Of-level or compassionate-use therapies are prescribed in the context of clinical trials. We should become familiar with specific adverse events and pharmacological interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic has paralyzed the urological activity, and its long-term consequences are unpredictable. Despite not being used to deal with respiratory diseases, the urologists become easily qualified to manage COVID-19 by following protocols and being integrated into multidisciplinary teams, helping to overcome the pandemic.","Sánchez-González, Álvaro; López-Fando Lavalle, Luis; Esteban-Fernández, Alberto; Ruiz, Mercedes; Hevia, Vital; Comeche, Belén; Sánchez Conde, Matilde; Álvarez, Sara; Lorca Álvaro, Javier; Fraile Poblador, Agustín; Hevia Palacios, Manuel; Domínguez Gutiérrez, Ana; Artiles Medina, Alberto; Sanz Mayayo, Enrique; Duque, Gemma; Gómez Dos Santos, Victoria; Moreno-Guillén, Santiago; Burgos Revilla, Javier",Curr Urol Rep,,203

In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may impact general cardiovascular risk for years to come, and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions. From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence. Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute cardiovascular events. Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and mis-information may have negatively impacted adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents. From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to income loss, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse cardiovascular risk-factor control and outcomes. We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health impacts of COVID-19.","Lau, Darren; McAlister, Finlay A",Can. j. cardiol,,203

The application of intersectionality theory extends beyond the convergence of multiple social identities. It provides an invaluable framework to examine the convergence of social identities, the social determinants of health and a global pandemic in communities of historically marginalized and underrepresented persons. The purpose of this paper is to examine how the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the disparities experienced by African American and Latinx persons using the principles of intersectionality theory as the schema. Design/methodology/approach A literature review was performed on the scholarly articles examining the disproportionate incidence and mortality rates of African Americans and Latinx persons in America. Findings The current literature confirms that the disparities which existed prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic have been magnified by systemic oppression and racism of historically marginalized and underrepresented persons in America. The coronavirus pandemic has spotlighted the disparities in sustainable employment and access to health care for African American and Latinx persons. Originality/value Employing a social justice theoretical framework of intersectionality provides an opportunity to examine the lived experiences of African American and Latinx persons without race/ethnicity being the primary focal point. Future research will illustrate the urgent need for public health policy reform to eradicate the disparities experienced by African American and Latinx populations.","Williams, L.

Our aim is to describe sociodemographic and transmission profile of COVID-19 cases that were transmitted before and after the introduction of the decree in the Bologna Local Health Authority. METHODS: Cases were classified as transmitted before or after the decree according to the date of last contact with a COVID-19 case or, if this date was unavailable, we used the date of onset of symptoms considering the incubation period. Sociodemographic, clinical and epidemiological information was collected by using the infectious disease monitoring database, hospital discharge, deprivation index and long term care facility databases. RESULTS: In the period after the publication of the decree, there were more elderly, females, strangers, retired, residents in nursing homes and deprived people than in the first period. There were also more health care personnel and less professionals/managers, sales or office workers. In both phases, family is mentioned as the first community attended although less frequently in the second group.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physician-delivered prevention messages affect knowledge and information-seeking behavior of Black and Latinx individuals and whether this differs according to the race/ethnicity of the physician and tailored content. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. (Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04371419; American Economic Association RCT Registry, AEARCTR-0005789). SETTING: United States, 13 May 2020 to 26 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 14 267 self-identified Black or Latinx adults recruited via Lucid survey platform. INTERVENTION: Participants viewed 3 video messages regarding COVID-19 that varied by physician race/ethnicity, acknowledgment of racism/inequality, and community perceptions of mask wearing. MEASUREMENTS: Knowledge gaps (number of errors on 7 facts on COVID-19 symptoms and prevention) and information-seeking behavior (number of web links demanded out of 10 proposed). RESULTS: 7174 Black (61.3%) and 4520 Latinx (38.7%) participants were included in the analysis. The intervention reduced the knowledge gap incidence from 0.085 to 0.065 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.737 [95% CI, 0.600 to 0.874]) but did not significantly change information-seeking incidence. For Black participants, messages from race/ethnicity-concordant physicians increased information-seeking incidence from 0.329 (for discordant physicians) to 0.357 (IRR, 1.085 [CI, 1.026 to 1.145]). LIMITATIONS: Participants' behavior was not directly observed, outcomes were measured immediately postintervention in May 2020, and online recruitment may not be representative. CONCLUSION: Physician-delivered messages increased knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms and prevention methods for Black and Latinx respondents. The desire for additional information increased with race-concordant messages for Black but not Latinx respondents. Other tailoring of the content did not make a significant difference.

This study aims to discover the naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors from herbal constituents, as well as to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the newly identified efficacious SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Following screening of the inhibitory potentials of eighty herbal products against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBLE) was found with the most potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activity (IC50â¯=â¯6.68â¯µg/mL). Inhibition assays demonstrated that the ginkgolic acids (GAs) and the bioflavones isolated from GBLE displayed relatively strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities (IC50â¯<â¯10â¯µM). Among all tested constituents, GA C15:0, GA C17:1 and sciadopitysin displayed potent 3CLpro inhibition activities, with IC50 values of less than 2â¯µM. Further inhibition kinetic studies and docking simulations clearly demonstrated that two GAs and sciadopitysin strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLprovia a reversible and mixed inhibition manner. Collectively, this study found that both GBLE and the major constituents in this herbal product exhibit strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities, which offer several promising leading compounds for developing novel anti-COVID-19 medications via targeting on 3CLpro.","Xiong, Yuan; Zhu, Guang-Hao; Wang, Hao-Nan; Hu, Qing; Chen, Li-Li; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Li, Hui-Liang; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Tang, Hui; Ge, Guang-Bo",Fitoterapia,,203

451457,"Temporal immunological marker risk model for predicting severity of COVID-19 outcomes: early risers, late bloomers and general giants",2021,"Since the beginning of 2020, the whole world has been struggling with the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147, which are expressed on host cells. Several studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2 might be a risk factor of COVID-19 infection. Genotypes affect ACE2 structure, its serum concentration, and levels of circulating angiotensin (1-7). Moreover, there is evidence that ACE genotype affects the outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment, the most severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 morbidity, infection course, and mortality might depend on ACE D allele frequency. The aim of this narrative review was to analyze and identify the mechanisms of ACE-I and ARBs with particular emphasis on angiotensin receptors and their polymorphism in the light of COVID-19 pandemic as these medications are commonly prescribed to elderly patients. There is no direct evidence yet for ACE-I or ARBs in the treatment of COVID-19. However, for those already taking these medications, both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing the treatment, because at present, there is no clear clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of ACE-I or ARBs. Individualized treatment decisions should be based on the clinical condition and co-morbidities of each patient.","Sienko, Jerzy; Kotowski, Maciej; Bogacz, Anna; Lechowicz, Kacper; Drozdzal, Sylwester; Rosik, Jakub; Sietnicki, Marek; Sienko, Magdalena; Kotfis, Katarzyna",Clin Interv Aging,,203
451585,Remdesivir for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19: A Community Hospital's Experience,2020,"One of the basic measures of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is a lockdown policy with reduced contacts and physical distance. This presents a challenge, especially for fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) supply chains, which are characterized by a large number of physical contacts between employees in production, physical distribution, wholesale, and retail. One of the ways to comply with the prescribed measures with the smooth functioning of the supply chain is the complete digitalization and automation of all business activities and operations based on the application of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this regard, this paper aims to analyze the setbacks to the digitalization of business processes and the sustainability of the FMCG supply chain based on the implementation of IoT. The research has been conducted among the participants in the standardization chain in the sectors of production, physical distribution, wholesale, and retail of FMCG in the Western Balkans region during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed significant differences between business sectors in terms of the intensity of setbacks to successful IoT implementation. Based on the obtained results, a set of measures and incentives was proposed that the competent institutions and the management of the FMCG supply chain should apply to encourage the digitalization process. Suggestions for future research are given in the paper.","Koncar, J.; Grubor, A.; Maric, R.; Vucenovic, S.; Vukmirovic, G.",Sustainability,,203
451805,Lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A pilot retrospective study,2021,"With the relative ubiquity of smartphones, contact tracing and exposure notification apps have been looked to as novel methods to help reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Many countries have created apps that lie across a spectrum from privacy-first approaches to those that have very few privacy measures. The level of privacy incorporated into an app is largely based on the societal norms and values of a particular country. Digital health technologies can be highly effective and preserve privacy at the same time, but in the case of contact tracing and exposure notification apps, there is a trade-off between increased privacy measures and the effectiveness of the app. In this article, examples from various countries are used to highlight how characteristics of contract tracing and exposure notification apps contribute to the perceived levels of privacy awarded to citizens and how this impacts an app's effectiveness. We conclude that finding the right balance between privacy and effectiveness, while critical, is challenging because it is highly context-specific.","Seto, Emily; Challa, Priyanka; Ware, Patrick",J Med Internet Res,,203
451806,Lopinavir-ritonavir alone or combined with arbidol in the treatment of 73 hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A pilot retrospective study,2021,"Climate scientists have long emphasized the importance of climate tipping points like thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, and changes in atmospheric circulation. Yet, save for a few fragmented studies, climate economics has either ignored them or represented them in highly stylized ways. We provide unified estimates of the economic impacts of all eight climate tipping points covered in the economic literature so far using a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure. The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling. Collectively, climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by â¼25% in our main specification. The distribution is positively skewed, however. We estimate an â¼10% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling the SCC. Accordingly, climate tipping points increase global economic risk. A spatial analysis shows that they increase economic losses almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost. Most of our numbers are probable underestimates, given that some tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been covered in the literature so far; however, our method of structural meta-analysis means that future modeling of climate tipping points can be integrated with relative ease, and we present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.","Dietz, Simon; Rising, James; Stoerk, Thomas; Wagner, Gernot",Proc.

The service has received an increase in referrals during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodMethods: Team member and client semi structured interviews were conducted with answers transcribed in real time and analysed. Patient clinical records were accessed via PARIS and analysed in order to identify patient demographics within each group and whether these had changed during the pandemic. Clinical outcome measures and client feedback were evaluated to see whether the change in groups is impacting their clinical effectiveness.ResultResults: Innovations made by the CPT include: groups becoming virtual, launching of the new Circle of Security Group which helps women tackle the ‘Ghosts in the Nursery’ and strengthen maternal bonds, restructuring existing groups, breakout room forums and incorporating communication platform apps such as Whatsapp. The Wellbeing and Lifestyle Group increased in size and reach (7 women from 7 areas in 2019 vs 12 women from 12 areas in 2021) with an increased retention rate (71% in 2019 vs 100% in 2021) and a decreased attrition rate (29% in 2019 to 0% in 2021). The Emotional Coping Skills group experienced similar changes (10 areas represented in 2019 vs 15 different areas in 2021) with an increased retention rate (58% in 2019 vs 100% in 2021) and decreased attrition rate (42% in 2019 vs 0% in 2021).ConclusionThe Hertfordshire Community Perinatal Team has responded to the pandemic by innovating existing groups and creating new forums;many of which will continue on even after the pandemic ceases.

452998,Perspective of patients with autoimmune diseases on COVID-19 vaccination,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on practical activities and didactic teaching of residents and fellows. This survey aimed to propose long-term changes for ophthalmology training based on the changes experienced by trainees and their perception of new training opportunities. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to ophthalmology trainees in multiple countries. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: A total of 504 analyzable responses were collected from 32 different countries. The current impact of COVID-19 pandemic was described as ""severe"" by most trainees (55.2%); however, the future perspective was more optimistic as demonstrated by the greater number of responses reporting a presumed ""moderate"" (37.3%), ""mild"" (14.1%) or ""slight"" (4.2%) long-term impact. The vast majority of trainees reported a decrease &#8805;50% of clinical activity (76.4%) and >75% of surgical activity (74.6%). Although an initial gap in didactic teaching has been experienced by many (55.4%), regular web-based teaching was reportedly attended by 67.7% of the respondents. A strong agreement was found regarding the worthwhile role of web-based case-presentations in clinical training (91.7%), web-based discussion of edited surgical videos (85.7%) and simulation-based practice (86.9%) in surgical training. CONCLUSIONS: This survey, focusing on trainees' perspective, strongly reinforces the need to promptly include new technology-based training tools, such as web-based teaching, virtual surgical simulators, and telementoring, in long-term reorganisation of ophthalmology training to ensure its continuity and effectiveness, which would remain available even in the face of another unpredictable crisis within the health system.","Ferrara, Mariantonia; Romano, Vito; Steel, David H; Gupta, Rajen; Iovino, Claudio; van Dijk, Elon H C; Romano, Mario R",Eye (Lond),,203

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the preprint server MedRxiv from their inception until May 11, 2020, using the terms anosmia or hyposmia or dysosmia or olfactory dysfunction or olfaction disorder or smell dysfunction or ageusia or hypogeusia or dysgeusia or taste dysfunction or gustatory dysfunction or neurological and COVID-19 or 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2. The references of included studies were also manually screened. Only studies involving patients with diagnostic-confirmed COVID-19 infection were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with data from 8438 patients with test-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 13 countries were included. The pooled proportions of patients presenting with olfactory dysfunction and gustatory dysfunction were 41.0% (95% CI, 28.5% to 53.9%) and 38.2% (95% CI, 24.0% to 53.6%), respectively. Increasing mean age correlated with lower prevalence of olfactory (coefficient = -0.076; P=.02) and gustatory (coefficient = -0.073; P=.03) dysfunctions. There was a higher prevalence of olfactory dysfunctions with the use of objective measurements compared with self-reports (coefficient = 2.33; P=.01). No significant moderation of the prevalence of OGDs by sex was observed. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of OGDs among patients infected with COVID-19. Routine screening for these conditions could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, to better inform population screening measures, further studies are needed to establish causality.","Agyeman, Akosua Adom; Chin, Ken L; Landersdorfer, Cornelia B; Liew, Danny; Ofori-Asenso, Richard",Mayo Clin Proc,,203

455176,Immunothrombosis in severe COVID-19,2020,"Brown and subcutaneous adipose tissues play a key role in non-shivering thermogenesis both in mice and human, and their activation by adrenergic stimuli promotes energy expenditure, reduces adiposity, and protects against age-related metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). Low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance characterize T2D. Even though the decline of thermogenic adipose tissues is well-established during ageing, the mechanisms by which this event affects immune system and contributes to the development of T2D is still poorly defined. It is emerging that activation of thermogenic adipose tissues promotes type 2 immunity skewing, limiting type 1 inflammation. Of note, metabolic substrates sustaining type 1 inflammation (e.g. glucose and succinate) are also used by activated adipocytes to promote thermogenesis. Keeping in mind this aspect, a nutrient competition between adipocytes and adipose tissue immune cell infiltrates could be envisaged. Herein, we reviewed the metabolic rewiring of adipocytes during thermogenesis in order to give important insight into the anti-inflammatory role of thermogenic adipose tissues and delineate how their decline during ageing may favor the setting of low-grade inflammatory states that predispose to type 2 diabetes in elderly. A brief description about the contribution of adipokines secreted by thermogenic adipocytes in modulation of immune cell activation is also provided. Finally, we have outlined experimental flow chart procedures and provided technical advices to investigate the physiological processes leading to thermogenic adipose tissue impairment that are behind the immunometabolic decline during aging.","Lettieri-Barbato, Daniele; Aquilano, Katia",Ageing Res Rev,,203

Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of individual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput of a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known and studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on unrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only objective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the case of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of this procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently repeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a computational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of false negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests, especially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001 the number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of individual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more than 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests in the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the expected number of false negatives, respectively. This makes the proposed procedure an interesting choice for screening tests in the case of diseases like COVID-19.","Jaszkiewicz, Andrzej",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00673v1.pdf,203

This research intended to delve into miR-183-5p changes in mepivacaine-mediated SH-SY5Y cell injury, as well as its modulatory mechanism on cell apoptosis. RT-qPCR was adopted for assaying miR-183-5p and PDCD4 mRNA expression. Our team respectively transfected miR-183-5p mimic and inhibitor to enhance or inhibit miR-183-5p function. We employed Western blot for detecting PDCD4 protein levels, as well as flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342/PI double staining for determining cell apoptosis rate. Additionally, our crew applied an ELISA kit for measuring TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-8 contents. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was examined by the Image-iT LIVE Green ROS detection Kit. As well as dual-luciferase reporter experiment for verifying the targeting link of miR-183-5p with PDCD4. In mepivacaine-induced cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, miR-183-5p expression was down-regulated. TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, and IL-8 contents were elevated. The rate of apoptosis increased visibly, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax levels waxed, whereas Bcl-2 level waned. MiR-183-5p could alleviate the damaging impact of mepivacaine. Dual-luciferase reporter experiments demonstrated that miR-183-5p directly targeted PDCD4. Collectively, we concluded that a high concentration of mepivacaine can cause SH-SY5Y cell damage, miR-183-5p functions crucially in mepivacaine-mediated cell damage. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of mepivacaine-induced nerve cell damage, and overexpressed miR-183-5p likely become a novel strategy to combat mepivacaine-induced nerve damage.Abbreviations:miRNA: Micro RNA; PDCD4: Programmed Cell Death 4; MDA: Malondialdehyde; SOD: Superoxide Dismutase; ROS: Reactive Oxygen Species; WT: Wild Type; Mut: Mutant; UTR: Untranslated Region; IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-1ß: Interleukin-1ß; TNF-&#945;: Tumor Necrosis Factor-&#945;; IL-8: Interleukin-8; COX-2: Cyclooxygenase-2; iNOS: inducible NOS; MEP: Mepivacaine.","Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Ling",Bioengineered,,203

We aimed to assess an intervention to deal with the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the operations of a rapid response team (RRT). INITIAL ASSESSMENT: An observational study with medical record review, was carried out at a large tertiary care hospital in Fortaleza, a 400-bed quaternary hospital, 96 of which are ICU beds. All adult patients admitted to hospital wards, treated by the RRTs during the study period, were included, and a total of 15,461 RRT calls were analyzed. CHOICE OF SOLUTION: Adequacy of workforce sizing. IMPLEMENTATION: The hospital adjusted the size of its RRTs during the period, going from 2 to 4 simultaneous on-duty medical professionals. EVALUATION: After the beginning of the pandemic, the number of treated cases in general went from an average of 30.6 daily calls to 79.2, whereas the extremely critical cases went from 3.5 to 22 on average. In percentages, the extremely critical care cases went from 10.47 to 20%, with p <0.001. Patient mortality remained unchanged. The number of critically-ill cases and the number of treated patients increased two-fold in relation to the pre-pandemic period, but the effectiveness of the RRT in relation to mortality was not affected.

We executed an interactome screen of 564 human cell-surface and secreted proteins, most of which are immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) proteins, using a high-throughput, automated ELISA-based screening platform employing a pooled-protein strategy to test all 318,096 PPI combinations. Screen results, augmented by phylogenetic homology analysis, revealed â¼380 previously unreported PPIs. We validated a subset using surface plasmon resonance and cell binding assays. Observed PPIs reveal a large and complex network of interactions both within and across biological systems. We identified new PPIs for receptors with well-characterized ligands and binding partners for ""orphan"" receptors. New PPIs include proteins expressed on multiple cell types and involved in diverse processes including immune and nervous system development and function, differentiation/proliferation, metabolism, vascularization, and reproduction. These PPIs provide a resource for further biological investigation into their functional relevance and may offer new therapeutic drug targets.","Wojtowicz, Woj M; Vielmetter, Jost; Fernandes, Ricardo A; Siepe, Dirk H; Eastman, Catharine L; Chisholm, Gregory B; Cox, Sarah; Klock, Heath; Anderson, Paul W; Rue, Sarah M; Miller, Jessica J; Glaser, Scott M; Bragstad, Melisa L; Vance, Julie; Lam, Annie W; Lesley, Scott A; Zinn, Kai; Garcia, K Christopher",Cell,,203

Sleep is an intimate experience, and state-of-the-art sleep monitoring solutions are highly-personalized to individual users. With a motivation to expand sleep monitoring at a large-scale and contribute sleep data to public health understanding, we present WiSleep, a sleep monitoring and analytics platform using smartphone network connections that are passively sensed from WiFi infrastructure. We propose an unsupervised ensemble model of Bayesian change point detection to predict sleep and wake-up times. Then, we validate our approach using ground truth from a user study in campus dormitories and a private home. Our results find WiSleep outperforming established methods for users with irregular sleep patterns while yielding comparable accuracy for regular sleepers with an average 79.5\% accuracy. This is comparable to client-side based methods, albeit utilizing only coarse-grained information. Finally, we show that WiSleep can process data from 20,000 users on a single commodity server, allowing it to scale to large campus populations with low server requirements.","Mammen, Priyanka Mary; Zakaria, Camellia; Molom-Ochir, Tergel; Trivedi, Amee; Shenoy, Prashant; Balan, Rajesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03690v1.pdf,203

460917,High Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients With Cancer,2021,"BACKGROUND: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 2.58 million deaths worldwide with over 500,000 of those in the US, at the time of this writing. Older adults (65 years of age) and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of death. Since March 2020, preventive measures including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine and social distancing have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact mental and physical health. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify the impact of the ""Stay-at-Home"" order on older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in Southern California. METHODS: Methods: Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom communications platform during May 2020 with 21 CCSHC residents participating. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the ""stay-at-home"" mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data including: 1 - Impact of Quarantine on Health and Well-Being; 2 - Communication Innovation and Technology Use; 3 - Effective Ways of Coping with Quarantine; and 4 - Improving Access to Technology and Training. Participants reported a threat to their mental and physical health directly tied to quarantine and exacerbated by social isolation and decreased physical activity. Technology was identified as a lifeline for many who are socially isolated from friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Technology access, connectivity, and literacy are potential game-changers to supporting the mental and physical health of older adults and must be prioritized.","Daly, Jessica; Depp, Colin; Graham, Sarah A; Jeste, Dilip V; Kim, Ho-Cheol; Lee, Ellen E; Nebeker, Camille",,,203
460919,High Prevalence of Gastrointestinal Manifestations of COVID-19 Infection in Hospitalized Patients With Cancer,2020,"Despite a growing body of research examining correlates and consequences of COVID-19, few findings have been published among military veterans. This limitation is particularly concerning as preliminary data indicate that veterans may experience a higher rate of mortality compared to their civilian counterparts. One factor that may contribute to increased rates of death among veterans with COVID-19 is tobacco use. Indeed, findings from a recent meta-analysis highlight the association between lifetime smoking status and COVID-19 progression to more severe or critical conditions including death. Notably, prevalence rates of tobacco use are higher among veterans than civilians. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to examine demographic and medical variables that may contribute to likelihood of death among veterans testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, we examined the unique influence of lifetime tobacco use on veteran mortality when added to the complete model. Retrospective chart reviews were conducted on 440 veterans (80.5% African American/Black) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (7.3% deceased) at a large, southeastern Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital between March 11, 2020 and April 23, 2020, with data analysis occurring from May 26, 2020 to June 5, 2020. Older age, male gender, immunodeficiency, endocrine, and pulmonary diseases were positively related to the relative risk of death among SARS-CoV-2 positive veterans, with lifetime tobacco use predicting veteran mortality above and beyond these variables. Findings highlight the importance of assessing for lifetime tobacco use among SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and the relative importance of lifetime tobacco use as a risk factor for increased mortality.","Raines, Amanda M; Tock, Jamie L; McGrew, Shelby J; Ennis, Chelsea R; Derania, Jessa; Jardak, Christina L; Lim, Jennifer H; Boffa, Joseph W; Houtsma, Claire; Jones, Kenneth R; Martin-Klinger, Caitlin; Widmer, Kyle; Schapira, Ralph; Zvolensky, Michael J; Hoerger, Michael; Constans, Joseph I; Franklin, C Laurel",Addict Behav,,203

461198,Analysis of chemical drugs applied for clinical trial for the treatment of COVID-19/ 药学学报,2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has created a devastating effect on public health. As “social distance” is a highly effective preventive measure of this pandemic, close contact between a patient and physician is strongly discouraged where possible. Consequently, mobile health (mHealth) technology is taking its momentum to fulfil this gap. The purpose of this study is, therefore, to empirically investigate the moderating as well as the direct role of situational constraint and health consciousness in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) constructs to understand the adoption and use behavior of mHealth care services amid pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from existing mHealth users using an online survey questionnaire in Bangladesh. SmartPLS 3.0 and SPSS 23.0 were used for partial least squares-structural equation modeling. Findings: Situational constraint and health consciousness both have strong direct positive effects on both behavioral intention (in all models) and use behavior (in Models 2 and 3). Further, this study revealed that effort expectancy remains insignificant in both direct and interaction effects whereas social influence becomes insignificant in interaction effects from direct significant effect (Models 1 and 2). Besides, the study reported that the relationship between behavioral intention and use behavior is moderated by situational constraint. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first in terms of mHealth empirical investigation considering the current pandemic situation. The incorporation of the situational constraint and health consciousness into the UTAUT model provides a holistic framework to understand the influence of the adoption and use behavior of mHealth amid pandemic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Barua, Z.; Barua, A.",Journal of Enabling Technologies,,203

Discovering the mechanisms of action of COVID-19 and coping at the cellular level with this disease can have better effects. Including the target tissues of this disease are the lungs and the immune system. It is stated that COVID-19 easily infiltrates into alveoli through its receptors and then starts to proliferate. Subsequently, with the weakening of immune cells and increase inflammatory cytokines, it increases the rate of inflammation in the body. Strengthening the immune system and inhibiting COVID-19 receptors can play a preventive or even therapeutic role for this disease. Nigella sativa (N. sativa) is one of the herbal medicines to possess numerous pharmacological effects related to several organs of the body. Among the extraordinary properties of this plant is improving asthma and several lung diseases. The recent studies have shown that N. sativa at the cellular level can inhibit COVID-19 receptors. It was also stated that performing regular exercise training (especially moderate-intensity exercise training) can modulate the immune system and have an anti-inflammatory effect. Since the use of herbal supplements with exercise can have tremendous therapeutic effects at the cellular level, the hypothesis to use the Nigella sativa along with exercise training to prophylaxis and treatment COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper.","Shirvani, Hossein; Rostamkhani, Fatemeh; Arabzadeh, Ehsan; Mohammadi, Faezeh; Mohammadi, Fatemeh",Sport Sci Health,,203

We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Personal contact remains essential to ascertain adherence to teletreatment. SUMMARY: The availability of different telemedicine tools for remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment is increasing. Future research should establish whether telemedicine improves outcomes in routine clinical care, and further underpin its merits both as intervention and outcome in research settings.","van den Bergh, Robin; Bloem, Bastiaan R; Meinders, Marjan J; Evers, Luc J W",Curr Opin Neurol,,203

465443,Analysis of Peripheral Blood IL-6 and Leukocyte Characteristics in 364 COVID-19 Patients of Wuhan,2020,"COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. In the absence of specific vaccines or therapeutics available, COVID-19 cases are managed empirically with the passive immunity approach and repurposing of drugs used for other conditions. Recently, a concept that bacilli Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination could confer protection against COVID-19 has emerged. The foundation for this widespread attention came from several recent articles, including the one by Miller et al. submitted to MedRxiv, a pre-print server. The authors of this article suggest that a correlation exists between countries with a prolonged national BCG vaccination program and the morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19. Further, clinical BCG vaccination trials are currently ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, the UK, and Germany with the hope of reducing mortality due to COVID-19. Although BCG vaccination helps protect children against tuberculosis, experimental studies have shown that BCG can also elicit a non-specific immune response against viral and non-mycobacterial infections. Here, we summarize the pros and cons of BCG vaccination and critically analyze the evidence provided for the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 and highlight the confounding factors in these studies.","Gopalaswamy, Radha; Ganesan, Natarajan; Velmurugan, Kalamani; Aravindhan, Vivekanandhan; Subbian, Selvakumar",,,203

467452,Diabetes predicts severity of COVID-19 infection in a retrospective cohort: A mediatory role of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) put the dental health care professionals (DHCPs) at a greater risk for acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In late June 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised elective dental procedures provision to asymptomatic patients while mandating strict infection control protocol and suggested the use of preprocedural testing as an adjunct. A cost-effective method for mass preprocedural testing is pool testing, which has specificity and sensitivity similar to polymerase chain reaction. This article aims to assess the outcomes and utility of incorporating preprocedural testing protocol for SARS-CoV-2 in dental clinics before providing AGPs. METHOD: The patients who were recommended AGPs where rubber dam placement was not possible were advised to undergo preprocedural testing for SARS-CoV-2. Pool testing strategy was employed, and patients were asked to get tested 48 h before the day of the procedure. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1,000 patients, who presented from June 2020 to late July 2020, 464 were recommended dental procedures. In 194 of 464, AGPs could not be performed under rubber dam isolation; therefore, the patients were advised to get a preprocedural pool test. In total, 111 patients deferred the procedure and testing. Out of 83 who got tested, 7 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 5 of whom were tested in early June 2020 and 2 in late July 2020. CONCLUSION: Pool testing within its limitations can be a useful preprocedure test in asymptomatic low-risk patients for AGP in dentistry, especially when the disease prevalence is low or moderate (<10%). It has the potential of reducing testing costs significantly while conserving reagent and other resources. Preprocedure testing, however, also gives rise to certain ethical concerns that also need to be addressed. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study can be used by clinicians when deciding which preprocedure testing approach they wish to use when performing aerosol-generating procedures in asymptomatic patients with consideration of cost sensitivity and specificity values.","Umer, F; Arif, A",JDR Clin Trans Res,,203

468164,Computed tomography manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to mental health problems worldwide. Nurses are particularly prone to stress because they directly care for individuals with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. The aims of this study were (a) to explore the association between the mental health promotion strategies used by nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak and their symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress; (b) to compare the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses; and (c) to compare the frequency of use of mental health strategies of mental health nurses to those of non-mental health nurses. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 821 nurses. Univariate and multivariate regression models were developed to identify potential protective factors of depression, anxiety, and stress. The chi-square test was also used to compare the use of strategies among mental health and non-mental health nurses. Portuguese nurses demonstrated high symptoms of depressive symptoms, stress, and anxiety. Healthy eating, physical activity, rest between shifts, maintaining social contacts, verbalizing feelings/emotions, and spending less time searching for information about COVID-19 were associated with better mental health. Mental health nurses had less depression, anxiety, and stress, and used more strategies to promote mental health than other nurses. We consider it important to promote nurses' mental health literacy by encouraging them to develop skills and strategies aimed at improving their resilience and ability to deal with difficult situations while caring for the population.","de Pinho, Lara Guedes; Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia; Fonseca, César; Lopes, Manuel José",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203
469307,Experiences of Patients With Rheumatic Diseases in the United States During Early Days of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Prior studies reported that 5 ~ 32% COVID-19 patients were critically ill, a situation that poses great challenge for the management of the patients and ICU resources. We aim to identify independent risk factors to serve as prediction markers for critical illness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Fifty-two critical and 200 non-critical SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive patients hospitalized in 15 hospitals outside Wuhan from January 19 to March 6, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Multivariable logistic regression and LASSO logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for critical illness. RESULTS: Age older than 60 years, dyspnea, respiratory rate > 24 breaths per min, leukocytosis > 9.5 × 109/L, neutrophilia > 6.3 × 109/L, lymphopenia < 1.1 × 109/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio > 3.53, fibrinogen > 4 g/L, d-dimer > 0.55 µg/mL, blood urea nitrogen > 7.1 mM, elevated aspartate transaminase, elevated alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin > 21 µM, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score &#8805; 2 were identified as risk factors for critical illness. LASSO logistic regression identified the best combination of risk factors as SOFA score, age, dyspnea, and leukocytosis. The Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve values for the risk factors in predicting critical illness were 0.921 for SOFA score, 0.776 for age, 0.764 for dyspnea, 0.658 for leukocytosis, and 0.960 for the combination of the four risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings advocate the use of risk factors SOFA score &#8805; 2, age > 60, dyspnea and leukocytosis > 9.5 × 109/L on admission, alone or in combination, to determine the optimal management of the patients and health care resources.","Cheng, Sijing; Wu, Dingfeng; Li, Jie; Zou, Yifeng; Wan, Yunle; Shen, Lihan; Zhu, Lixin; Shi, Mang; Hou, Linlin; Xu, Tao; Jiao, Na; Li, Yichen; Huang, Yibo; Tang, Zhipeng; Xu, Mingwei; Jiang, Shusong; Li, Maokun; Yan, Guangjun; Lan, Ping; Zhu, Ruixin",Respir Res,,203

The diagnosis is still histopathologic, and it is done on the basis of the findings on biopsy samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fusion biopsy is a relatively new technique that allows the operator to perform the biopsies in office instead of the MRI gantry, without losing the detection capability of MRI. The T2-wighted images obtained during a previous mpMRI are merged with the real-time ones of the TRUS. RESULTS: Fusion biopsy in comparison with the systematic standard biopsy has a better detection rate of clinically significant cancers and of any cancers. CONCLUSION: EAU 2020 guidelines still do offer a list of indications of when the biopsy should be performed, but it still appeared to be overperformed. The aim of our study is to underline how, in accordance with the recent literature result, fusion biopsy has showed a better detection rate of any cancer and clinically significant disease with a reduced numbers of samplings, and no substantial difference between the multiple software.","Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Di Meglio, Letizia; Petrillo, Mario; Arrichiello, Antonio; Pandolfi, Marco; Rodà, Giovanni Maria; Granata, Giuseppe; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Donat, Daniela; Paolucci, Aldo; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Acta Biomed,,203

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The existing MIS MEDIS.NET, currently used in the largest health center in the Balkans, has been adapted and further developed. RESULTS: During the adaptation of existing MIS MEDIS.NET 4 new and 9 existing modules were developed. A quick questionnaire for the smart triage of patients was also implemented. DISCUSSION: The adapted MIS successfully influenced the reduction of social contacts within the Health Center Nis. The need for the arrival of children and their parents to receive appropriate health certificates for the school enrolment is reduced. The therapy of chronic patients has been prolonged for 6 months via an electronic prescription. An online service for the communication between patients and the chosen physicians is provided. Possible social contacts and exposure to the viral environment of patients are reduced by making appointments in extended slots and at determined physical locations. Patients are notified per SMS or email about the availability of chosen and physician on duty. The social distancing of patients and physicians is also established by sending laboratory analyses per email or SMS. Keeping the central registry for COVID-19 is enabled throughout the country. CONCLUSION: The smart adaptation of MIS, and its collaboration with other state systems can significantly influence the reduction of social contacts and thus mitigate the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic.","Milenkovic, Aleksandar; Jankovic, Dragan; Rajkovic, Petar",Int J Med Inform,,203

The study used quantitative survey methods and a sample size of 1134 Nigerian students of the three types of higher institutions in Nigeria: universities, polytechnics, and colleges of higher education based on student state residential location. The respondents completed a questionnaire via Google Forms in June and July 2020. The study found that students are not satisfied with virtual learning embarked upon by many higher institutions throughout the country during the COVID-19 lockdown and would not want the online learning to continue after the pandemic due to poor internet infrastructure and lack of electricity. The study concluded that students of higher education in Nigeria have a low acceptance of online learning technology, preferring instead the traditional classroom setting, and thus putting them in the ?Laggards adopter categorization? of the diffusion innovation theory, i.e., the group that is highly conservative and extremely slow to accept new technological innovations. The study recommends that universities should engage students more interactively not only through texts but also video (e.g. camera demonstrations), increase their online learning during the pandemic so as not to lag academically, and spend more time on online learning to get the best possible level of instruction until traditional learning resumes. Also, it is recommended that administrators of Nigerian higher institutions should return to a traditional learning format as soon as the pandemic is over as well as an overhaul and restructuring of the internet and power grid nationwide.","Egielewa, Peter Idogho Philipa O.; Iyalomhe, Felix O.; Cirella, Giuseppe T.",E-Learning and Digital Media,,203

OBJECTIVE: This manuscript aims to advance knowledge on COVID-19 preventive perceptions and behaviors and their main predictors, including digital health information-seeking behavior (HISB), political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. METHODS: Two cross-sectional online surveys of US millennials were conducted from April 10 to 14, 2020 (N=274) (ie, Study 1), and from April 27 to May 7, 2020 (N=1037) (ie, Study 2). In the regression models, dependent variables included preventive behaviors (eg, wearing a face mask and social distancing) as well as four preventive perceptions: severity (ie, a person's conception of the seriousness of COVID-19), susceptibility (ie, a person's conception of the likelihood of being infected with COVID-19), self-efficacy (ie, a person's perception that he or she can wear a face mask and perform social distancing to prevent COVID-19 infection), and response efficacy (ie, a person's perception of whether wearing a face mask and social distancing can prevent COVID-19 infection). Key independent variables included digital HISB for self, digital HISB for another person, political party identification, and COVID-19 testing status. RESULTS: Millennials reported lower levels of perceived susceptibility than the other three preventive perceptions (ie, severity, self-efficacy, and response efficacy), as well as fairly high levels of preventive behaviors. Unlike HISB for another person, digital HISB for self was positively associated with preventive perceptions and behaviors. In Study 1, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (ß=.22, P<.001), self-efficacy (ß=.15, P=.02), and response efficacy (ß=.25, P<.001) as well as, at nearing significance, higher perceptions of susceptibility (ß=.11, P=.07). In Study 2, respondents with higher levels of digital HISB for self had significantly higher perceptions of severity (ß=.25, P<.001), susceptibility (ß=.14, P<.001), and preventive behaviors (ß=.24, P<.001). Preventive behaviors did not vary significantly according to political party identification, but preventive perceptions did. In Study 1, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of self-efficacy (ß=-.14, P=.02) and response efficacy (ß=-.13, P=.03) and, at nearing significance, lower perceptions of severity (ß=-.10, P=.08) and susceptibility (ß=-.12, P=.06). In Study 2, respondents who identified as being more Republican had significantly lower perceptions of severity (ß=-.08, P=.009). There were mixed effects of COVID-19 testing status on preventive perceptions, with respondents who had tested positive for COVID-19 having significantly higher perceptions of susceptibility in Study 1 (ß=.17, P=.006) and significantly lower perceptions of severity in Study 2 (ß=-.012, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: As the largest and most digitally savvy generation, US millennials saw COVID-19 as a severe threat, but one that they were less susceptible to. For millennials, digital HISB for self, but not for another person, was critical to the development of preventive perceptions and behaviors.","Beaudoin, Christopher E; Hong, Traci",J Med Internet Res,,203

477072,Physiologic and biochemical rationale for treating COVID-19 patients with hyperbaric oxygen,2021,"BACKGROUND: Recent emergence of COVID-19 caused by a new human coronavirus (CoV) strain (SARS-CoV2), which originated from the China, poses future emergence of additional CoVs. In most of the cases of emergence of human CoVs bats, palm civets, raccoon dogs and camels have been identified as the sources of human infections and reservoir hosts. A review of comparative genomic and phenotypic characteristics of human CoV strains vis-à-vis their comparison with the corresponding animal isolates shall provide the clues regarding the potential genomic, phenotypic and molecular factors responsible for host-switching, which may lead to prospective emergence and reemergence of human CoV outbreaks in future. METHODS: The seven known human strains of CoV were analyzed for the host and viral factors responsible for human outbreaks. The molecular factors responsible for host-susceptibility, virulence and pathogenesis were reviewed to predict emergence and re-emergence of additional human CoV strains. CoV spike protein was evaluated as a potential viral receptor for host switching and the target for pharmaceutical design. RESULTS: Review of the factors associated with host-susceptibility, virulence and pathogenesis of seven known human CoV strains present significant possibilities for emergence of new CoV strain(s), leading to more human outbreaks. Continuous exposure of animals' handlers to the infected animals, environmental changes, improper sanitations, nondisposal of the solid waste and resumption of exotic animals markets provide favorable conditions for ""host switching"" and emergence of new and potentially more virulent human CoV strains. Mutations in target genes (like spike protein), which facilitate the viral entry into the host-cells, provide potential ""molecular switch"" for preferences of new hostreceptors, genetic diversity, genetic-recombination and high virulence. Additionally, the clinical and environmental factors, asymptomatic carriers, paucity of efficacious vaccines & therapeutics, inefficient disease management and infection control measures, lack of public awareness, and effective communication of information about more virulent human-adapted virus isolates are critical factors for emergence of new and virulent SARS-CoV strains with high mortality and varied incubation period in the near future. Small molecules binding with conserved druggable regions of the CoV spike proteins may be effective against multiple strains of CoVs. CONCLUSIONS: High propensity of mutations and ""molecular adaptations"" in coronaviruses create the hot spots and high potential for ""host switching"" leading to emergence of more virulent strains human CoVs. The public/global health agencies, medical communities and research scientists should be prepared for emergence and reemergence of new human CoV strain(s) leading to potential disease outbreaks. The inhibitors binding with conserved druggable regions of spike proteins from multiple strains CoV may have utility as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs to combat future emergence of CoVs.","Ahmad, Fahim; Kamal, Mohammad A; Tekwani, Babu L",Curr. pharm. des,,203
477388,A Risk Prediction Model for Evaluating the Disease Progression of COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The Choosing Wisely® initiative, led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in collaboration with national professional medical societies, aims to help patients choose care that is essential, free from harm, and evidence-based. The American Society of Hematology has advocated practices specific to hematology for physicians and patients to examine carefully. Here, we summarize various barriers to adopting these practices, interventions used to improve adoption, and challenges in measuring the effectiveness of these interventions. RECENT FINDINGS: The Choosing Wisely® campaign has become an international effort with more than 20 countries worldwide having embraced it. Such widespread interest indicates that the campaign initiated an important dialog between patients and physicians about overutilization of resources. Evidence showing the positive impact of interventions on adopting these practices is accumulating, but their effect on improving clinical outcomes is uncertain. Decreasing overuse of resources is a cultural change in perspective for practitioners and patients alike. We believe that healthcare delivery is transitioning from being volume-based to value-based. As we continue to support the Choosing Wisely® campaign, we need to implement strategies to document and measure the influence of our value-based recommendations on physician practices, patient care and attitudes, and healthcare costs.","Hilal, Talal; Munoz, Javier",Curr Hematol Malig Rep,,203

Here, we report the clinical features, management, and short-term outcomes of COVID-19 patients in Wenzhou, China, an area outside Wuhan. METHODS: Patients admitted to the Infectious Diseases Department of Ruian People's Hospital in Wenzhou, from January 21 to February 7, 2020, were recruited. Medical data on epidemiological history, demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, chest computerized tomography (CT) examination, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively reviewed. Blood biochemistry and routine tests were examined using standard methods and automatic machines. CT examination was performed several times during hospitalization as necessary. RESULTS: A total of 67 confirmed COVID-19 cases were diagnosed; 64 (95.4%) were common cases and three (4.5%) were severe cases. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (86.6%), cough (77.6%), productive cough (52.2%), chest distress (17.9%), and sore throat (11.9%), followed by diarrhea (7.4%), headache (7.4%), shortness of breath (6.0%), dizziness (4.5%), muscular soreness (4.5%), and running nose (4.5%). Thirty patients (47.8%) had increased C-reactive protein levels. The CT radiographs at admission showed abnormal findings in 54 (80.6%) patients. The patients were treated mainly by oxygen therapy and antiviral drugs. By March 3, 2020, all 67 patients completely recovered and had negative nucleic acid tests. The patients were discharged from the hospital and transferred to a medical observation isolation center for further observation. CONCLUSION: Cases of COVID-19 in Wenzhou are milder and have a better prognosis, compared to those in Wuhan. Timely and appropriate screening, diagnosis, and treatment are the key to achieve good outcomes.","Hong, Liang; Ye, Enling; Sun, Gangqiang; Wang, Xiaoyang; Zhang, Shengguo; Wu, Yanghe; Xie, Xiangao; Xia, Shichun; Zheng, Xudong; Dong, Ling; Cai, Fujing; Lou, Xixian; Zhao, Renguo; Hu, Yongqi; Ruan, Zhanwei; Ding, Jiguang; Sun, Qingfeng",BMC Infect Dis,,203

This infectious and communicable disease has become one of the major public health challenges in the world. The clinical management of COVID-19 has been limited to infection prevention and control measures associated with supportive care such as supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Meanwhile efforts to find an effective treatment to inhibit virus replication, mitigate the symptoms, increase survival and decrease mortality rate are ongoing. Several classes of drugs, many of them already in use for other diseases, are being evaluated based on the body of clinical knowledge obtained from infected patients regarding to the natural history and evolution of the infection. Herein we will provide an updated overview of the natural history and current knowledge on drugs and therapeutic agents being tested for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. These include different classes of drugs such as antiviral agents (chloroquine, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, remdesivir, tocilizumab), supporting agents (Vitamin C, Vitamin D, azithromycin, corticosteroids) and promising investigational vaccines. Considering the controversies and excessive number of compounds being tested and reported in the literature we hope that this review can provide useful and updated consolidated information on potential drugs used to prevent, control and treat COVID-19 patients worldwide.","Dos Santos, Wagner Gouvea",Biomed Pharmacother,,203

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) protocols are formulary tools that allow for provider-selected interchange from a nonformulary preadmission medication to a formulary equivalent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the application of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ATS can decrease ATS errors at admission, but there are limited data describing the impact of CDS on discharge errors. The objective of this study was to describe the impact of CDS-supported interchanges on discharge prescription duplications or omissions. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients admitted between June 2017 and August 2019 were included if they were 18 years or older at admission, underwent an ATS protocol-approved interchange for 1 of the 9 included medication classes, and had a completed discharge medication reconciliation. The primary outcome was difference in incidence of therapeutic duplication or omission at discharge between the periods before and after CDS implementation. RESULTS: A total of 737 preimplementation encounters and 733 postimplementation encounters were included. CDS did not significantly decrease the incidence of discharge duplications or omissions (12.1% vs 11.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.3% to 4.2%) nor the incidence of admission duplication or inappropriate reconciliation (21.4% vs 20.7%; 95% CI, -3.4% to 4.8%) when comparing the pre- and postimplementation periods. Inappropriate reconciliation was the primary cause of discharge medication errors for both groups. CONCLUSION: CDS implementation was not associated with a decrease in discharge omissions, duplications, or inappropriate reconciliation. Findings highlight the need for thoughtful medication reconciliation at the point of discharge.","Maxwell, Erin; Amerine, James; Carlton, Glenda; Cruz, Jennifer L; Pappas, Ashley L; Heindel, Gregory A",Am. j. health system pharm,,203

The study of RAS dysregulation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection is fundamentally important for a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and risk factors associated with COVID-19 coronavirus disease and to design effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, we developed a mathematical model of RAS based on data regarding protein and peptide concentrations; the model was tested on clinical data from healthy normotensive and hypertensive individuals. We used our model to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on RAS, which we modeled through a downregulation of ACE2 as a function of viral load. We also used it to predict the effect of RAS-targeting drugs, such as RAS-blockers, human recombinant ACE2, and angiotensin 1-7 peptide, on COVID-19 patients; the model predicted an improvement of the clinical outcome for some drugs and a worsening for others. Our model and its predictions constitute a valuable framework for in silico testing of hypotheses about the COVID-19 pathogenic mechanisms and the effect of drugs aiming to restore RAS functionality.","Pucci, Fabrizio; Bogaerts, Philippe; Rooman, Marianne",Viruses,,203

In this study, unsupervised neural networks of the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) type were used to assess the spatial and temporal spread of COVID-19 in Brazil, according to the number of cases and deaths in regions, states, and cities. Materials and methods: The SOM applied in this context does not evaluate which measures applied have helped contain the spread of the disease, but these datasets represent the repercussions of the country's measures, which were implemented to contain the virus' spread. Results: This approach demonstrated that the spread of the disease in Brazil does not have a standard behavior, changing according to the region, state, or city. The analyses showed that cities and states in the north and northeast regions of the country were the most affected by the disease, with the highest number of cases and deaths registered per 100,000 inhabitants. Conclusions: The SOM clustering was able to spatially group cities, states, and regions according to their coronavirus cases, with similar behavior. Thus, it is possible to benefit from the use of similar strategies to deal with the virus' spread in these cities, states, and regions.","Galvan, Diego; Effting, Luciane; Cremasco, Hágata; Conte-Junior, Carlos Adam",Medicina (Kaunas),,203

As of September 30, 2020, it has caused a pandemic outbreak with more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, inadequate past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic data. Still, forecasters' predictions are useful for the effective allocation of healthcare resources and will act as an early-warning system for government policymakers.","Chakraborty, Tanujit; Ghosh, Indrajit; Mahajan, Tirna; Arora, Tejasvi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05079v1.pdf,203

The COVID-19 pandemic has violently impacted the European continent, first involving only some European countries, Italy in particular, and then spreading to all member states, albeit in different ways and times. The ways SARS-CoV-2 spreads are still partly unknown; to quantify and adequately respond to the pandemic, various parameters and reporting systems have been introduced at national and European levels to promptly recognize the most alarming epidemiological situations and therefore limit the impact of the virus on the health of the population. The relevant key points to implement adequate measures to face the epidemic include identifying the population groups most involved in terms of morbidity and mortality, identifying the events mostly related to the spreading of the virus and recognizing the various viral mutations. The main objective of this work is to summarize the epidemiological situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and Italy almost a year after the first reported case in our continent. The secondary objectives include the definition of the epidemiological parameters used to monitor the epidemic, the explanation of superspreading events and the description of how the epidemic has impacted on health and social structures, with a particular focus on Italy.","Gabutti, Giovanni; d039,; Anchera, Erica; De Motoli, Francesco; Savio, Marta; Stefanati, Armando",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203

In HIV-1 infection cases, assessing the efficacy of treatment interventions that are superimposed on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has benefited tremendously from the development of sensitive HIV-1 DNA and RNA quantitation assays. Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of Rhesus macaques is similar in many key aspects to human HIV-1 infection and consequently this non-human primate (NHP) model has and continues to prove instrumental in evaluating HIV prevention, treatment and eradication approaches. Cell and tissue associated HIV-1 viral nucleic acids have been found to serve as useful predictors of disease outcome and indicators of treatment efficacy, highlighting the value of and the need for sensitive detection of viruses in cells/tissues from infected individuals or animal models. However, viral nucleic acid detection and quantitation in such sample sources can often be complicated by high nucleic acid input (that is required to detect ultralow level viruses in, for example, cure research) or inhibitors, leading to reduced detection sensitivity and under-quantification, and confounded result interpretation. Here, we present a step-by-step procedure to quantitatively recover cell/tissue associated viral DNA and RNA, using SIV-infected Rhesus macaque cells and tissues as model systems, and subsequently quantify the viral DNA and RNA with an ultrasensitive SIV droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay and reverse transcription ddPCR (RT-ddPCR) assay, respectively, on the Raindance ddPCR platform. The procedure can be readily adapted for a broad range of applications where highly sensitive nucleic acid detection and quantitation are required.","Long, Samuel; Berkemeier, Brian",Methods (S.

We aim to describe our hospital and Department of Surgery's experience in preparing for the COVID-19 pandemic and caring for surgical patients during this unprecedented time. STUDY DESIGN: This is a descriptive study outlining the strategy of a single academic health system for addressing the following 4 critical issues facing surgical departments during the COVID-19 pandemic: developing a cohesive leadership team and system for frequent communication throughout the department; ensuring adequate hospital capacity to care for an anticipated influx of COVID-19 patients; safeguarding supplies of blood products and personal protective equipment to protect patients and providers; and preparing for an unstable workforce due to illness and competing personal priorities, such as childcare. RESULTS: Through collaborative efforts within the Department of Surgery and hospital, we provided concise and regular communication, reduced operating room volume by 80%, secured a 4-week supply of personal protective equipment, and created reduced staffing protocols with back-up staffing plans. CONCLUSIONS: By developing an enabling infrastructure, a department can nimbly respond to crises like COVID-19 by promoting trust among colleagues and emphasizing an unwavering commitment to excellent patient care.

We consider power formulas for both cross-sectional and longitudinal models and allow for covariates. An illustrative power analysis provides guidance on appropriate sample sizes. The key finding is that accounting for treatment timing increases required sample sizes. Further, DID estimators have considerably more power than standard CITS and ITS estimators.

However, the transmission of hundreds of megabytes of Sectional Medical Images (SMIs) from hospital's Intranet to the Internet has the problems of efficiency, cost, and security. This article proposes a novel lightweight sharing scheme for permitting Internet users to quickly and safely access the SMIs from a hospital using an Internet computer anywhere but without relying on a virtual private network or another complex deployment. Methods: A four-level endpoint network penetration scheme based on the existing hospital network facilities and information security rules was proposed to realize the secure and lightweight sharing of SMIs over the Internet. A ""Master-Slave"" interaction to the interactive characteristics of multiplanar reconstruction and maximum/minimum/average intensity projection was designed to enhance the user experience. Finally, a prototype system was established. Results: When accessing SMIs with a data size ranging from 251.6 to 307.04 MB with 200 kBps client bandwidth (extreme test), the network response time to each interactive request remained at approximately 1 s, the original SMIs were kept in the hospital, and the deployment did not require a complex process; the imaging quality and interactive experience were recognized by radiologists. Conclusions: This solution could serve Internet medicine at a low cost and may promote the diversified development of mobile medical technology. Under the current COVID-19 epidemic situation, we expect that it could play a low-cost and high-efficiency role in remote emergency support.","Qiao, Liang; Wu, Hao; Wu, Yi; Wu, Wenjing; Yang, Jingyi; Nian, Yongjian; Chen, Mingsheng; Bai, Sen; Huang, Hao; Qiu, Mingguo",J Healthc Eng,,203

487909,Multifactor analysis of severe COVID-19 and diagnostic value of laboratory indicators,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This research aims to evaluate the impact of eligibility criteria on recruitment and observable clinical outcomes of COVID-19 clinical trials using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: On June 18, 2020, we identified frequently used eligibility criteria from all the interventional COVID-19 trials in ClinicalTrials.gov (n = 288), including age, pregnancy, oxygen saturation, alanine/aspartate aminotransferase, platelets, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. We applied the frequently used criteria to the EHR data of COVID-19 patients in Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (March 2020-June 2020) and evaluated their impact on patient accrual and the occurrence of a composite endpoint of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and in-hospital death. RESULTS: There were 3251 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from the CUIMC EHR included in the analysis. The median follow-up period was 10 days (interquartile range 4-28 days). The composite events occurred in 18.1% (n = 587) of the COVID-19 cohort during the follow-up. In a hypothetical trial with common eligibility criteria, 33.6% (690/2051) were eligible among patients with evaluable data and 22.2% (153/690) had the composite event. DISCUSSION: By adjusting the thresholds of common eligibility criteria based on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients, we could observe more composite events from fewer patients. CONCLUSIONS: This research demonstrated the potential of using the EHR data of COVID-19 patients to inform the selection of eligibility criteria and their thresholds, supporting data-driven optimization of participant selection towards improved statistical power of COVID-19 trials.","Kim, Jae Hyun; Ta, Casey N; Liu, Cong; Sung, Cynthia; Butler, Alex M; Stewart, Latoya A; Ena, Lyudmila; Rogers, James R; Lee, Junghwan; Ostropolets, Anna; Ryan, Patrick B; Liu, Hao; Lee, Shing M; Elkind, Mitchell S V; Weng, Chunhua",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,203

First studies indicate altered lymphocyte counts and function. However, interactions of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms remain elusive. In the current study we characterized the immune responses in patients suffering from severe COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Methods: This was a single-center retrospective study in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with confirmed COVID-19 between March 14th and May 28th 2020 (n = 39). Longitudinal data were collected within routine clinical care, including flow-cytometry of lymphocyte subsets, cytokine analysis and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15). Antibody responses against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein were analyzed. Results: All patients suffered from severe ARDS, 30.8% died. Interleukin (IL)-6 was massively elevated at every time-point. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was concomitantly upregulated with IL-6. The cellular response was characterized by lymphocytopenia with low counts of CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) and naïve T helper cells. CD8+ T and NK cells recovered after 8 to 14 days. The B cell system was largely unimpeded. This coincided with a slight increase in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD immunoglobulin (Ig) G and a decrease in anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD IgM. GDF-15 levels were elevated throughout ICU treatment. Conclusions: Massively elevated levels of IL-6 and a delayed cytotoxic immune defense characterized severe COVID-19-induced ARDS. The B cell response and antibody production were largely unimpeded. No obvious imbalance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms was observed, with elevated GDF-15 levels suggesting increased tissue resilience.","Notz, Quirin; Schmalzing, Marc; Wedekink, Florian; Schlesinger, Tobias; Gernert, Michael; Herrmann, Johannes; Sorger, Lena; Weismann, Dirk; Schmid, Benedikt; Sitter, Magdalena; Schlegel, Nicolas; Kranke, Peter; Wischhusen, Jörg; Meybohm, Patrick; Lotz, Christopher",Front Immunol,,203
488988,Pulmonary Findings of COVID-19 Identified at Cardiac MRI,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Personal protective equipment (PPE) use is frequently construed as inconvenient and disturbing by healthcare professionals (HCPs). We hypothesized that new-onset symptoms among HCPs may be associated with extended use of PPE and aimed to investigate risk factors related with new-onset symptoms. In addition, the effects of new-onset symptoms on working performance were evaluated. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 315 participants filled out a questionnaire that contains four main parts: 1) Demographics, 2) New-onset symptoms with PPE use, 3) PPE usage hours, 4) Personal opinion about the effect of sensed symptoms on working performance. RESULTS: The mean age was 31.58 ± 4.6 years, and 50.5% (n=159) were female. New-onset symptom rate was 66% (n=208). The most common new-onset symptom was headache (n=115, 36.5%) followed by breathing difficulty-palpitation (n=79, 25.1%) and dermatitis (n=64, 20.3%). Extended use of PPE, smoking, and overweight were independently associated with developing new-onset symptoms. A clear majority of symptomatic participants pointed out impact on working performance (193/208, 92.7%). CONCLUSION: Hospitals should take the necessary precautions (e.g. shorter shifts and more often breaks) to prevent symptoms associated with PPE and ensure that HCPs comply with these precautions.","Çaglar, Ahmet; Kaçer, Ilker; Hacimustafaoglu, Muhammet; Öztürk, Berkant; Öztürk, Kemal",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,203

489578,A Unique Case of COVID-19-related Acute Coronary Thrombosis Complicated by Severe Hypokalemia,2021,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated a change in the manner outpatient fracture clinics are conducted due to the need to reduce footfall in hospitals. While studies regarding virtual fracture clinics have shown these to be useful and effective, they focus exclusively on remote consultations. However, our service was bespoke to the patient - either a face-to-face, a telephone consultation or both, depending on patient need - a 'hybrid virtual fracture clinic' (HVFC). We report patient satisfaction and outcomes with this service from the first wave of the pandemic. Methods We retrospectively interviewed patients who availed of the HVFC service at our institution during the first two weeks of national lockdown in England from March 23 to April 5, 2020. The number and type of consultations, patient vulnerability to COVID-19, and type of management (surgical vs non-surgical) were among the factors taken into consideration. Patient experience was assessed using the Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Effort Score (CES), and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS) on a scale of 0-10. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the EuroQol-5D-5L score (including EQ Visual Analogue Scale {EQVAS} scoring on a scale of 0-1(X)). Results The mean overall NPS, CES, and CSS for the service were 7.32, 7.24, and 7.49, respectively. The mean self-reported EQ-VAS rating was 77.5. Of 442 consultations, 246 were conducted virtually;10% were face-to-face, 29% virtual, and 61% were hybrid consultations. The HVFC resulted in a 55.65% reduction in footfall. Statistical analysis showed no significant difference across any outcome measure when compared between hybrid, virtual, and face-to-face consultations. Patients vulnerable to COVID-19 and those who did not require surgery tended to report better overall scores. Conclusion Our study indicates that the HVFC format can reduce patient footfall significantly (&gt;50%) while providing effective and satisfactory outpatient care. There appears to be no difference in patient-reported outcomes between face-to-face consultations and hybrid or virtual consultations. Patients would recommend HVFC to family and friends, found it was easy to use, and reported good satisfaction with the service.","Sharma, A.; Butt, M.

493572,The Darcy problem with porosity depending exponentially on the pressure,2020-11-05,"The effect of gradually increasing supplemental levels of blueberry extract on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and fatty acid composition of breast and thigh muscles of broiler chickens was investigated. One hundred ninety-two 7-day-old chickens were randomly distributed into four groups having four replicates with 12 birds in each replicate. Basal diets were prepared for starter (days 8 to 21) and finisher (days 22 to 42). Basal diets were offered to the control group only, whereas other treatments received basal diets fortified with 0.5, 1, and 2% blueberry extract (BB0.5, BB1, and BB2 groups, respectively). The duration of experiment was 35 days (days 8 to 42). During finisher and overall growth phases, broilers in the BB2 group had greater body weight gain than those in the BB0.5 and control groups, whereas the BB1 group had higher body weight gain than the control group (P < 0.001). Body weight gain remained unaffected during the starter phase. Feed intake was greater in the BB2 group than in the control group at days 8 to 21, 22 to 42, and 8 to 42 (P = 0.002, P = 0.035, and P = 0.001, respectively). The control group had poor FCR than the BB2 group in the starter phase (P = 0.034). At days 22 to 42, feeding blueberry extract (BB0.5, BB1, and BB2) improved the FCR of broilers compared with the control group, whereas the BB2 group had better FCR than the BB0.5 group (P < 0.001). At 8 to 42 days, broilers in the control group had poor FCR compared with the BB1 and BB2 groups, whereas the BB0.5 group had poor FCR than the BB2 group (P < 0.001). Slaughter weight was lower in the control group than in the blueberry extract groups, whereas the BB2 group had greater slaughter weight than the BB0.5 group (P < 0.001). Dressing percentage of broilers in the control and BB0.5 groups was lower than that in other groups (P < 0.001). Gizzard yield was higher in the BB0.5 and BB2 groups than in the control group (P = 0.021). In addition, feeding 2% blueberry extract increased the concentration of different fatty acids in breast and thigh meat of broiler chickens. Findings suggest that feeding 2% blueberry extract may improve growth performance, carcass characteristics, and fatty acid composition of breast and thigh muscles of broilers.","Ölmez, Mükremin; Sahin, Tarkan; Karadagoglu, Özlem; Yörük, Mehmet Akif; Kara, Kanber; Dalga, Sakine",Trop Anim Health Prod,,203

494621,Retraction: Noteworthy Neurological Manifestations Associated With COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) is an important pathogenic factor that inhibits host protein translation by means of its C terminus. However, its N-terminal function remains elusive. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the N terminus (amino acids [aa] 11 to 125) of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 at a 1.25-Å resolution. Further functional assays showed that the N terminus of SARS-CoVs Nsp1 alone loses the ability to colocalize with ribosomes and inhibit protein translation. The C terminus of Nsp1 can colocalize with ribosomes, but its protein translation inhibition ability is significantly weakened. Interestingly, fusing the C terminus of Nsp1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or other proteins in place of its N terminus restored the protein translation inhibitory ability to a level equivalent to that of full-length Nsp1. Thus, our results suggest that the N terminus of Nsp1 is able to stabilize the binding of the Nsp1 C terminus to ribosomes and act as a nonspecific barrier to block the mRNA channel, thus abrogating host mRNA translation.","Zhao, Kaitao; Ke, Zunhui; Hu, Hongbing; Liu, Yahui; Li, Aixin; Hua, Rong; Guo, Fangteng; Xiao, Junfeng; Zhang, Yu; Duan, Ling; Yan, Xin-Fu; Gao, Yong-Gui; Liu, Bing; Xia, Yuchen; Li, Yan",Microbiol Spectr,,203

496100,How the pandemic has affected Turkish housing affordability: why the housing running cost is so important,2021,"Accumulating evidence supports that the viral-induced hyper-inflammatory immune response plays a central role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. It might be involved in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure leading to death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the immune-inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19, then determine optimal thresholds for assessing severe and fatal forms of this disease.153 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL2R&#945;), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin were measured using chemiluminescence assay. Complete blood count was performed by Convergys 3X® hematology analyzer. Our results demonstrated that the peripheral blood levels of IL6, PCT, CRP, ferritin, IL2R&#945;, white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEU), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (d-NLR) were significantly higher in severe forms of COVID-19. The ROC curve analysis showed that IL6 was the most accurate inflammatory biomarker. The calculated cutoff of IL6 (42 pg/ml) could correctly classify > 90% of patients regarding their risk of severity (area under ROC curve (AUROC) = 0.972) and the threshold value of 83 pg/ml was highly predictive of the progression to death (AUROC = 0.94, OR = 184) after a median of 3 days. Besides, IL-6 was positively correlated with other inflammatory markers and the kinetic analysis highlighted its value for monitoring COVID-19 patients. PCT and NLR had also a high prognostic relevance to assess severe forms of COVID-19 with corresponding AUROC of 0.856, 0.831 respectively. Furthermore the cut-off values of PCT (0.16 ng/ml) and NLR (7.4) allowed to predict mortality with high accuracy (se = 96.3%, sp = 70.5%,OR = 61.2)' (se = 75%, sp = 84%, OR = 14.6).The levels of these parameters were not influenced by corticosteroid treatment, which make them potential prognostic markers when patients are already undergoing steroid therapy.","Sayah, Wafa; Berkane, Ismahane; Guermache, Imène; Sabri, Mohamed; Lakhal, Fatma Zahra; Yasmine Rahali, Sarah; Djidjeli, Asma; Lamara Mahammed, Lydia; Merah, Fatma; Belaid, Brahim; Berkani, Lilya; Lazli, Nouzha Zhor; Kheddouci, Lylia; Kadi, Ahmed; Ouali, Mourad; Khellafi, Rachida; Mekideche, Dalila; Kheliouen, Assia; Hamidi, Réda Malek; Ayoub, Soraya; Raaf, Nabil Beramtane; Derrar, Fawzi; Gharnaout, Merzak; Allam, Ines; Djidjik, Réda",Cytokine,,203
496285,Practical guide for pediatric pulmonologists on imaging management of pediatric patients with COVID-19,2020,"The paper builds on the classical understanding of the interplay between material processes and political conflicts, but generalises it in several key respects. This approach does not assume relevant political-economic aggregations ex ante (such as industries or ‘classes’); rather, it explores different possible ways of aggregating social groups and defining their interests depending on the situation under investigation. Moreover, interdependencies in the economy impose the need to keep conflicts within boundaries that are compatible with the viability of the system. Because sectors and groups can be aggregated in different ways, dynamics also depends on how actors represent the system and their position therein, and hence what they understand their interest to be. Different representations give rise to different definitions of competing interests and viability requirements, which in turn generate different endogenous dynamics of the political-economic system. The approach is illustrated through the examples of the Eurozone crisis and Covid-19 crisis.","Cardinale, Ivano; Landesmann, Michael",Struct. Change Econ. Dyn.,,203

Over a very short time span, remote working arrangements have become the norm, and meetings have shifted online. Physical distancing measures have accelerated a trend toward digital communication and social exchange. At the same time, the work of epidemiologists has been held under a magnifying glass by journalists, governments and the general public, in a way not previously seen. With social media becoming an integral part of our society over the last decade, Twitter is now a key communication tool and platform for social networking among epidemiologists (#EpiTwitter). In this article, we reflect on the use of Twitter by field epidemiologists and public health microbiologists for rapid professional exchange, public communication of science and professional development during the pandemic and the associated risks. For those field epidemiologists new to social media, we discuss how Twitter can be used in a variety of ways, both at their home institutions and during field deployment.

Effective vaccines are one of the most important strategies to limit the pandemic. Here, we report a construction strategy of DNA vaccine candidates expressing full length wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, S1 or S2 region and their immunogenicity in mice. All DNA vaccine constructs of pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2 induced high levels of specific binding IgG that showed a balance of IgG1/IgG2a response. However, only the sera from mice vaccinated with pCMKkan-S or -S1 DNA vaccines could inhibit viral RBD and ACE2 interaction. The highest neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer was found in pCMVkan-S group, followed by -S1, while -S2 showed the lowest PRNT50 titers. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) were 2,551, 1,005 and 291 for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively. pCMVkan-S construct vaccine also induced the highest magnitude and breadth of T cells response. Analysis of IFN-Î³ positive cells after stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide pools were 2,991, 1,376 and 1,885 SFC/106 splenocytes for pCMVkan-S, -S1 and -S2, respectively.

Yet, relatively little is known on characteristics and outcome of patients managed in Internal Medicine Units (IMU). To address this gap, the Italian Society of Internal Medicine has conducted a nationwide cohort multicentre study on death outcome in adult COVID-19 patients admitted and managed in IMU. This study assessed 3044 COVID-19 patients at 41 referral hospitals across Italy from February 3rd to May 8th 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, organ dysfunction, treatment, and outcomes including death were assessed. During the study period, 697 patients (22.9%) were transferred to intensive care units, and 351 died in IMU (death rate 14.9%). At admission, factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality were age (OR 2.46, p = 0.000), productive cough (OR 2.04, p = 0.000), pre-existing chronic heart failure (OR 1.58, p = 0.017) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.17, p = 0.048), the number of comorbidities (OR 1.34, p = 0.000) and polypharmacy (OR 1.20, p = 0.000). Of note, up to 40% of elderly patients did not report fever at admission. Decreasing PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission was strongly inversely associated with survival. The use of conventional oxygen supplementation increased with the number of pre-existing comorbidities, but it did not associate with better survival in patients with PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 100. The latter, significantly benefited by the early use of non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Our study identified PaO2/FiO2 ratio at admission and comorbidity as the main alert signs to inform clinical decisions and resource allocation in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to IMU.","Corradini, Elena; Ventura, Paolo; Ageno, Walter; Cogliati, Chiara Beatrice; Muiesan, Maria Lorenza; Girelli, Domenico; Pirisi, Mario; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Angeli, Paolo; Querini, Patrizia Rovere; Bosi, Emanuele; Tresoldi, Moreno; Vettor, Roberto; Cattaneo, Marco; Piscaglia, Fabio; Brucato, Antonio Luca; Perlini, Stefano; Martelletti, Paolo; Pontremoli, Roberto; Porta, Massimo; Minuz, Pietro; Olivieri, Oliviero; Sesti, Giorgio; Biolo, Gianni; Rizzoni, Damiano; Serviddio, Gaetano; Cipollone, Francesco; Grassi, Davide; Manfredini, Roberto; Moreo, Guido Luigi; Pietrangelo, Antonello",Intern Emerg Med,,203

Associated with each crossing point (or Weyl node) is a topological invariant known as the Berry monopole charge. The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a helicity-dependent photocurrent, is a notable example of a macroscopic property that emerges directly from the topology of the Weyl semimetal band structure. Recently, it was predicted that the amplitude of the CPGE associated with optical transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge. In chiral Weyl systems, nodes of opposite charge are nondegenerate, opening a window of wavelengths where the CPGE resulting from uncompensated Berry charge can emerge. Here, we report measurements of CPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi, revealing a CPGE response in an energy window that closes at 0.65 eV, in agreement with the predictions of density functional theory.","Rees, Dylan; Manna, Kaustuv; Lu, Baozhu; Morimoto, Takahiro; Borrmann, Horst; Felser, Claudia; Moore, J E; Torchinsky, Darius H; Orenstein, J",Sci Adv,,203

500500,Case series of COVID-19 presenting with massive hemoptysis,2020,"In the past two decades, novel viruses capable of airborne transmission have emerged with alarming frequency, including SARS-CoV-1 in 2003, H1N1 in 2009, MERS in 2012, and SAR-CoV-2 in 2019. Yet, in many countries, controls on airborne transmission were not widely adopted until the COVID-19 pandemic. To optimize strategies for curbing the transmission of existing airborne viruses and to prepare for outbreaks of novel viruses in the future, the efficacy of three key controls -- face masks, ventilation, and physical distancing -- must be well understood. In this study, we used the new Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD) to quantify the efficacy of controls across thousands of scenarios that represent the wide variability in factors governing airborne transmission. We show that, while the efficacy of any individual control was highly variable among scenarios, the combination of universal mask-wearing and distancing of at least 1~m reduced the median risk of initial infection in the susceptible person by 99\% relative to a close (0.5~m), unmasked conversation. Increasing ventilation rates by 4~air changes per hour led to further reductions in the median risk of infection by more than 70\% if the two people were distanced by 2~m or more. The combination of face masks, distancing, and increased ventilation reduced the risk of infection by more than 98\% in more than 95\% of scenarios. These findings suggest that layering controls is highly effective for reducing transmission of airborne pathogens and will be critical for curbing outbreaks of novel viruses in the future.","Fierce, Laura; Robey, Alison; Hamilton, Cathrine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.02683v1.pdf,203
500863,Could a family history of type 2 diabetes be a risk factor to the endothelial damage in the patient with COVID-19?,2020,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a large number of residents in China to be infected with a highly contagious pneumonia recently. Despite active control measures taken by the Chinese government, the number of infected patients is still increasing day by day. At present, the changing trend of the epidemic is attracting the attention of everyone. Based on data from 21 January to 20 February 2020, six rolling grey Verhulst models were built using 7-, 8- and 9-day data sequences to predict the daily growth trend of the number of patients confirmed with COVID-19 infection in China. The results show that these six models consistently predict the S-shaped change characteristics of the cumulative number of confirmed patients, and the daily growth decreased day by day after 4 February. The predicted results obtained by different models are very approximate, with very high prediction accuracy. In the training stage, the maximum and minimum mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) are 4.74% and 1.80%, respectively; in the testing stage, the maximum and minimum MAPEs are 4.72% and 1.65%, respectively. This indicates that the predicted results show high robustness. If the number of clinically diagnosed cases in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, where COVID-19 was first detected, is not counted from 12 February, the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in China will reach a maximum of 60,364-61,327 during 17-22 March; otherwise, the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China will be 78,817-79,780.","Zhao, Yu-Feng; Shou, Ming-Huan; Wang, Zheng-Xin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,203
501075,Comparison of the CO-RADS and the RSNA chest CT classification system concerning sensitivity and reliability for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. The virus uses ACE2 receptor for viral entry. ACE2 is part of the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is also expressed in the lower respiratory tract along the alveolar epithelium. There is, however, significant controversy regarding the role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Some have argued that decreasing ACE2 expression would result in decreased susceptibility to the virus by decreasing available binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 and restricting viral entry into the cells. Others have argued that, like the pathogenesis of other viral pneumonias, including those stemming from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, once SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it downregulates ACE2 expression. Lack of the favourable effects of ACE2 might exaggerate lung injury by a variety of mechanisms. In order to help address this controversy, we conducted a literature search and review of relevant preclinical and clinical publications pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, viral pneumonia, SARS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. Our review suggests, although controversial, that patients at increased susceptibility to COVID-19 complications may have reduced baseline ACE2, and by modulating ACE2 expression one can possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes. Herein, we elucidate why and how this potential mechanism might work.","Chaudhry, Farhan; Lavandero, Sergio; Xie, Xiang; Sabharwal, Basera; Zheng, Ying-Ying; Correa, Ashish; Narula, Jagat; Levy, Phillip",,,203

We sought to quantify epithelial cell death in patients with COVID-19, with an estimation of relative contributions of apoptosis and necrosis. METHODS: Blood samples were collected prospectively from adult patients presenting to the emergency department. Circulating levels of caspase-cleaved (apoptosis) and total cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) (total cell death) were determined using M30 and M65 enzyme assays, respectively. Intact CK-18 (necrosis) was estimated by subtracting M30 levels from M65. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients and 27 matched sick controls (with respiratory symptoms not due to COVID-19) were enrolled. Compared with sick controls, COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p = 0.046, total cell death) and M30 (p = 0.0079, apoptosis). Hospitalised COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.014) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.004, necrosis) than discharged patients. Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted COVID-19 patients had higher levels of M65 (p= 0.004), M30 (p= 0.004) and intact CK-18 (p= 0.033) than hospitalised non-ICU admitted patients. In multivariable logistic regression, elevated levels of M65, M30 and intact CK-18 were associated with increased odds of ICU admission (OR=22.05, p=0.014, OR=19.71, p=0.012 and OR=14.12, p=0.016, respectively). CONCLUSION: Necrosis appears to be the main driver of hospitalisation, whereas apoptosis and necrosis appear to drive ICU admission. Elevated levels CK-18 levels are independent predictors of severe disease, and could be useful for risk stratification of COVID-19 patients and in assessment of therapeutic efficacy in early-phase COVID-19 clinical trials.","Henry, Brandon Michael; Cheruiyot, Isaac; Benoit, Stefanie W; Sanchis-Gomar, Fabian; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin",J. clin. pathol,,203

At this juncture, this paper examines the determinants of the adoption of mobile payment services among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China. The study proposes four-dimensional factors (business factors, technological competence, environment, and consumers' intentions) based on the literature review findings to understand the challenges of adopting mobile payment. A questionnaire is designed to solicit information from the participants. The findings reveal that business factors, technological competencies of SMEs in China, and the environment positively influence mobile payment adoption. Consumer intention has almost no influence on the adoption of mobile payment. Potential implications for the COVID-19 era are also discussed.","Cao, Tianming",Front Public Health,,203
502259,COVID-19: Leave politics out of practicing medicine,2020,"BACKGROUND: The pork tapeworm, Taenia solium, is a serious public health problem in rural low-resource areas of Latin America, Africa and Asia, where the associated conditions of nuerocysticercosis (NCC) and porcine cysticercosis cause substantial health and economic harms. An accurate and validated transmission model for T. solium would serve as an important new tool for control and elimination, as it would allow for comparison of available intervention strategies, and prioritization of the most effective strategies for control and elimination efforts. METHODS: We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model (ABM) for T. solium (""CystiAgent"") that differs from prior T. solium models by including a spatial framework and behavioral parameters such as pig roaming, open human defecation, and human travel. In this article, we introduce the structure and function of the model, describe the data sources used to parameterize the model, and apply sensitivity analyses (Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC)) to evaluate model parameters. RESULTS: LHS-PRCC analysis of CystiAgent found that the parameters with the greatest impact on model uncertainty were the roaming range of pigs, the infectious duration of human taeniasis, use of latrines, and the set of ""tuning"" parameters defining the probabilities of infection in humans and pigs given exposure to T. solium. CONCLUSIONS: CystiAgent is a novel ABM that has the ability to model spatial and behavioral features of T. solium transmission not available in other models. There is a small set of impactful model parameters that contribute uncertainty to the model and may impact the accuracy of model projections. Field and laboratory studies to better understand these key components of transmission may help reduce uncertainty, while current applications of CystiAgent may consider calibration of these parameters to improve model performance. These results will ultimately allow for improved interpretation of model validation results, and usage of the model to compare available control and elimination strategies for T. solium.","Pray, Ian W; Wakeland, Wayne; Pan, William; Lambert, William E; Garcia, Hector H; Gonzalez, Armando E; O039,; Neal, Seth E",Parasit Vectors,,203

503133,The emerging association between COVID-19 and acute stroke,2021,"Every day we are surrounded by spoken dialog. This medium delivers rich diverse streams of information auditorily; however, systematically understanding dialog can often be non-trivial. Despite the pervasiveness of spoken dialog, automated speech understanding and quality information extraction remains markedly poor, especially when compared to written prose. Furthermore, compared to understanding text, auditory communication poses many additional challenges such as speaker disfluencies, informal prose styles, and lack of structure. These concerns all demonstrate the need for a distinctly speech tailored interactive system to help users understand and navigate the spoken language domain. While individual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text summarization methods already exist, they are imperfect technologies; neither consider user purpose and intent nor address spoken language induced complications. Consequently, we design a two stage ASR and text summarization pipeline and propose a set of semantic segmentation and merging algorithms to resolve these speech modeling challenges. Our system enables users to easily browse and navigate content as well as recover from errors in these underlying technologies. Finally, we present an evaluation of the system which highlights user preference for hierarchical summarization as a tool to quickly skim audio and identify content of interest to the user.","Li, Daniel; Chen, Thomas; Tung, Albert; Chilton, Lydia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09597v1.pdf,203

We hypothesize that patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may develop a hypermetabolic state, which may be a major contributing factor to the extraordinary ventilatory and oxygenation demands in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Resting energy expenditure (REE), carbon dioxide production (VCO2 ), and oxygen consumption (VO2 ) were measured by indirect calorimetry on 7 critically ill patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: The median measured REE was 4044 kcal/d, which was 235.7% ± 51.7% of predicted. The median VCO2 was 452 mL/min (range, 295-582 mL/min), and the median VO2 was 585 mL/min (range, 416-798 mL/min). CONCLUSION: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 are in an extreme hypermetabolic state. This may explain the high failure rates for mechanical ventilation for these patients and highlights the potential need for increased nutrition requirements for such patients.","Yu, Pey-Jen; Cassiere, Hugh; DeRosa, Sarah; Bocchieri, Karl; Yar, Shiraz; Hartman, Alan",JPEN J. parenter. enteral nutr,,203

We evaluated 518 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and classified according to severity as asymptomatic (16.2%), mild (59.6%), moderate (20.2%), and critical/severe (3.9%) cases. We analyzed patients in four groups in terms of ages: <4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-17 years. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of &#8710;Ct value among age groups, different gender and the existence of underlying diseases in each disease course. The &#8710;Ct values were relatively lower in the first 2 days of symptoms than after days in all groups. Our study has indicated that children with COVID-19 have similar amount of viral load in all disease courses irrespective of the age and underlying disease.

506173,Increased Serum Levels of Hepcidin and Ferritin Are Associated with Severity of COVID-19,2020,"Objective: Measures are ongoing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and treat it with medicines and personal protective equipment (PPE). However, there has been considerable controversy surrounding treatments such as hydroxychloroquine with misinformation fuelling prices hikes and suicides. Shortages have also appreciably increased costs of PPE, potentially catastrophic among lower- and middle-income countries such as Nigeria with high copayment levels. Consequently, a need to investigate changes in availability, utilization, and prices of relevant medicines and PPE during the pandemic in Nigeria. Methods: Exploratory study among community pharmacists with a survey tool comprising four sections including questions on changes in consumption, prices, and shortages of medicines and PPE from the beginning of March 2020 to the end of June 2020. In addition, suggestions from community pharmacists and co-authors on ways to reduce misinformation. Findings: 30 out of 34 pharmacists participated giving a response rate of 88.2%. Significant increases were seen (3-fold or more increase) in the consumption of hydroxychloroquine (100%), vitamins/immune boosters (96.7%) and antibiotics (46.7%) as well as PPE (100%). Considerable price increases (50% increase or greater) also seen for antimalarials (96.7%), antibiotics (93.3%), vitamins/immune boosters (66.7%), and PPE (100%). Shortages are also seen for hydroxychloroquine and vitamins/immune boosters but most severe for PPE (80% of pharmacies). Conclusion: Encouraging to see increases in the utilization of vitamins/immune boosters and PPE. However, a considerable increase in the utilization and prices of antimicrobials is a concern that needs addressing including misinformation. Community pharmacists have a key role in providing evidence-based advice and helping moderate prices.","Haque, M.; Abubakar, A.; Ogunleye, O.; Sani, I.; Sefah, I.; Kurdi, A.; Islam, S.; Godman, B.",Journal of Research in Pharmacy Practice,,203

To meet this challenge, new classes of antimicrobial agents and the redesign of existing ones will be required. This review summarizes some of the studies that have been carried out in my own laboratories involving membrane-disrupting agents. A major discovery that we made, using a Triton X-100 as a prototypical membrane-disrupting molecule and cholesterol-rich liposomes as model systems, was that membrane disruption can occur by two distinct processes, depending on the state of aggregation of the attacking agent. Specifically, we found that monomers induced leakage, while attack by aggregates resulted in a catastrophic rupture of the membrane. This discovery led us to design of a series of derivatives of the clinically important antifungal agent, Amphotericin B, where we demonstrated the feasibility of separating antifungal from hemolytic activity by decreasing the molecule's tendency to aggregate, i.e., by controlling its monomer concentration. Using an entirely different approach (i.e., a ""taming"" strategy), we found that by covalently attaching one or more facial amphiphiles (""floats"") to Amphotericin B, its aggregate forms were much less active in lysing red blood cells while maintaining high antifungal activity. The possibility of applying such ""monomer control"" and ""taming"" strategies to other membrane-disrupting antimicrobial agents is briefly discussed.","Regen, Steven L",Molecules (Basel),,203

Daily data on US dollar-based exchange rate returns and the global fear index for COVID-19 pandemic for the period 10-02-2020–02-04-2021 were used. Symmetric and asymmetric wild bootstrap likelihood ratio tests were employed in testing the relationship. The symmetric test results showed that pandemic-induced fear is capable of predicting the exchange rate returns of the Swiss franc, yuan, and the EURO. Specifically, negative relationships were recorded between their returns and the global fear index for pandemics. The asymmetric test results however showed that increasing pandemic-induced fear leads to decreases in the returns of the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, yuan and EURO. Overall, this study showed that pandemic-induced fear is a predictor of exchange rate returns. It is therefore suggested that the maintenance of stability in the financial system should be treated as an integral part of policy responses designed to mitigate the adverse effects of pandemics. This way, economic agents will not be forced to move their investments to foreign currency-denominated assets due to fear of investment losses.

We show that expression of ELF5, a transcription factor critical for normal mammary development, is downregulated in mammary luminal epithelia with age. DNA-methylation of the ELF5 promoter is negatively correlated with expression in an age-dependent manner. Both ELF5 methylation and gene expression were used to build biological clocks to estimate chronological ages of mammary epithelia. ELF5 clock-based estimates of biological age in luminal epithelia from average-risk women were within 3 years of chronological age. Biological ages of breast epithelia from BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, who were high risk for developing breast cancer, suggested they were accelerated by two decades relative to chronological age. The ELF5 DNA methylation clock had better performance at predicting biological age in luminal epithelial cells as compared to two other epigenetic clocks based on whole tissues. We propose that the changes in ELF5 expression or ELF5-proximal DNA methylation in luminal epithelia are emergent properties of at-risk breast tissue and constitute breast-specific biological clocks.","Miyano, Masaru; Sayaman, Rosalyn W; Shalabi, Sundus F; Senapati, Parijat; Lopez, Jennifer C; Angarola, Brittany Lynn; Hinz, Stefan; Zirbes, Arrianna; Anczukow, Olga; Yee, Lisa D; Sedrak, Mina S; Stampfer, Martha R; Seewaldt, Victoria L; LaBarge, Mark A",Cancer prev. res.

In addition, nutritional factors are other key regulators for the homeostasis of host immunity, but whether and how nutrition affects the homeostatic generation of thymocytes remains to be established. Here, we showed that vitamin B1 deficiency resulted in a bias toward the maturation of Î³Î´ thymocytes accompanied by decreased differentiation into double-positive thymocytes during thymic involution. These events were mediated through the increased production of TGF-ß superfamily members due to the accumulation of branched-chain &#945;-keto acids in thymic stromal cells. These findings revealed essential roles of vitamin B1 in the appropriate differentiation of T cells through the metabolism of thymic stromal cells.","Hirata, So-Ichiro; Sawane, Kento; Adachi, Jun; Isoyama, Junko; Sugiura, Yuki; Matsunaga, Ayu; Hosomi, Koji; Tomonaga, Takeshi; Suematsu, Makoto; Nagatake, Takahiro; Kunisawa, Jun",iScience,,203

While robust biomarkers for early diagnosis are still missing, recent work indicates that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has the potential to overcome this bottleneck by monitoring microcirculatory alterations. Automated machine learning-based diagnosis of sepsis based on HSI data, however, has not been explored to date. Given this gap in the literature, we leveraged an existing data set to (1) investigate whether HSI-based automated diagnosis of sepsis is possible and (2) put forth a list of possible confounders relevant for HSI-based tissue classification. While we were able to classify sepsis with an accuracy of over $98\,\%$ using the existing data, our research also revealed several subject-, therapy- and imaging-related confounders that may lead to an overestimation of algorithm performance when not balanced across the patient groups.

Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we present the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-CTD) spike (S) protein in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2), which reveals a hACE2-binding mode similar overall to that observed for SARS-CoV. However, atomic details at the binding interface demonstrate that key residue substitutions in SARS-CoV-2-CTD slightly strengthen the interaction and lead to higher affinity for receptor binding than SARS-RBD. Additionally, a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against SARS-CoV-S1/receptor-binding domain (RBD) were unable to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, indicating notable differences in antigenicity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Here, we use Twitter as a distributed news and opinion aggregation source to identify and track the dynamics of the dominant day-scale stories around Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. Working with a data set comprising around 20 billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage frequencies to those of a year before, to create day- and week-scale timelines for Trump stories for 2016 onwards. We measure Trump's narrative control, the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy -- the rate at which a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that 2017 was the most turbulent year for Trump, and that story generation slowed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Trump story turnover for 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was on par with that of 3 days in September 2017.

513081,Possible effect of epinephrine in minimizing COVID-19 severity: a review,2020,"In an era of Freddie Gray and Black Lives Matter, a long history of structural racism, combined with disproportionate rates of COVID-19, the African American community has seen a lot of reasons to demand social justice, equal treatment and immediate access to solutions to health disparities. Despite the promise of COVID-19 vaccines, the community is highly distrustful of the vaccine and institutions given a history of mistreatment and many other current concerns. Trusted messengers such as Black pastors are crucial to protecting the community that faces a disproportionate amount of disease. We present a framework to build trust and acceptance including understanding history and context; listening and empathy; engaging pastors as trusted messengers; creating partnerships with shared responsibility and power; and co-creation of solutions with faith leaders and their community, governments and institutions to create sustainable, long-term change. Efforts to support vaccine acceptance must be customized to the variety of needs and realities of the African American community, not just the topic of concern to the institution. Evaluations are needed to help ensure the community is engaged and feeling heard. Pastors and other religious leaders can work with government and institutions to bring information, facilitate discussion, build trust and develop measurable improvement efforts. Although acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines may not be achieved overnight, the process of focusing on issues that are important to the community is an important step in laying the foundation for both COVID-19 vaccines and future interventions.","Privor-Dumm, Lois; King, Terris",J Health Commun,,203

Free GMs could bind not only with the active site of &#945;-glucosidase (competitive inhibition character), but also with the non-active sites (uncompetitive one); however, the former binding interaction was stronger than the latter one. All polyphenols that had inhibitory effects quenched &#945;-glucosidase fluorescence in a static mode through forming a polyphenol-enzyme complex. The number of amino acid residues involved in polyphenol-enzyme binding interactions (hydrogen bonding and &#960;-conjugations) increased with the inhibitory activity increasing.

While reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for acquiring individual behaviors, the time needed to acquire each skill makes the prospect of a generalist robot trained with RL daunting. In this paper, we study how a large-scale collective robotic learning system can acquire a repertoire of behaviors simultaneously, sharing exploration, experience, and representations across tasks. In this framework new tasks can be continuously instantiated from previously learned tasks improving overall performance and capabilities of the system. To instantiate this system, we develop a scalable and intuitive framework for specifying new tasks through user-provided examples of desired outcomes, devise a multi-robot collective learning system for data collection that simultaneously collects experience for multiple tasks, and develop a scalable and generalizable multi-task deep reinforcement learning method, which we call MT-Opt. We demonstrate how MT-Opt can learn a wide range of skills, including semantic picking (i.e., picking an object from a particular category), placing into various fixtures (e.g., placing a food item onto a plate), covering, aligning, and rearranging. We train and evaluate our system on a set of 12 real-world tasks with data collected from 7 robots, and demonstrate the performance of our system both in terms of its ability to generalize to structurally similar new tasks, and acquire distinct new tasks more quickly by leveraging past experience.

While the risks and benefits of noninvasive techniques versus early invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) are intensely debated, actual evidence is lacking. We sought to assess the risks and benefits of different respiratory support strategies, employed in intensive care units during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic on intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates. METHODS: Subanalysis of a prospective, multinational registry of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were subclassified into standard oxygen therapy &#8805;10 L/min (SOT), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIV), and early IMV, according to the respiratory support strategy employed at the day of admission to ICU. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. RESULTS: Initially, 1421 patients were assessed for possible study inclusion. Of these, 351 patients (85 SOT, 87 HFNC, 87 NIV, and 92 IMV) remained eligible for full analysis after propensity score matching. 55% of patients initially receiving noninvasive respiratory support required IMV. The intubation rate was lower in patients initially ventilated with HFNC and NIV compared to those who received SOT (SOT: 64%, HFNC: 52%, NIV: 49%, p = 0.025). Compared to the other respiratory support strategies, NIV was associated with a higher overall ICU mortality (SOT: 18%, HFNC: 20%, NIV: 37%, IMV: 25%, p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19, a trial of HFNC appeared to be the most balanced initial respiratory support strategy, given the reduced intubation rate and comparable ICU mortality rate. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, SOT and early IMV represented safe initial respiratory support strategies. The presented findings, in agreement with classic ARDS literature, suggest that NIV should be avoided whenever possible due to the elevated ICU mortality risk.","Wendel Garcia, Pedro D; Aguirre-Bermeo, Hernán; Buehler, Philipp K; Alfaro-Farias, Mario; Yuen, Bernd; David, Sascha; Tschoellitsch, Thomas; Wengenmayer, Tobias; Korsos, Anita; Fogagnolo, Alberto; Kleger, Gian-Reto; Wu, Maddalena A; Colombo, Riccardo; Turrini, Fabrizio; Potalivo, Antonella; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Rodríguez-García, Raquel; Castro, Pedro; Lander-Azcona, Arantxa; Martín-Delgado, Maria C; Lozano-Gómez, Herminia; Ensner, Rolf; Michot, Marc P; Gehring, Nadine; Schott, Peter; Siegemund, Martin; Merki, Lukas; Wiegand, Jan; Jeitziner, Marie M; Laube, Marcus; Salomon, Petra; Hillgaertner, Frank; Dullenkopf, Alexander; Ksouri, Hatem; Cereghetti, Sara; Grazioli, Serge; Bürkle, Christian; Marrel, Julien; Fleisch, Isabelle; Perez, Marie-Helene; Baltussen Weber, Anja; Ceruti, Samuele; Marquardt, Katharina; Hübner, Tobias; Redecker, Hermann; Studhalter, Michael; Stephan, Michael; Selz, Daniela; Pietsch, Urs; Ristic, Anette",Crit Care,,203
513917,COVID-19 in a patient with HIV infection,2020,"Official case counts suggest Africa has not seen the expected burden of COVID-19 as predicted by international health agencies, and the proportion of asymptomatic patients, disease severity, and mortality burden differ significantly in Africa from what has been observed elsewhere. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was extremely limited early in the pandemic and likely led to under-reporting of cases leaving important gaps in our understanding of transmission and disease characteristics in the African context. SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence and serologic response data could help quantify the burden of COVID-19 disease in Africa to address this knowledge gap and guide future outbreak response, adapted to the local context. However, such data are widely lacking in Africa. We conducted a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey among 1,192 individuals seeking COVID-19 screening and testing in central Cameroon using the Innovita antibody-based rapid diagnostic. Overall immunoglobulin prevalence was 32%, IgM prevalence was 20%, and IgG prevalence was 24%. IgM positivity gradually increased, peaking around symptom day 20. IgG positivity was similar, gradually increasing over the first 10 days of symptoms, then increasing rapidly to 30 days and beyond. These findings highlight the importance of diagnostic testing and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Cameroon, which likely resulted in artificially low case counts. Rapid antibody tests are a useful diagnostic modality for seroprevalence surveys and infection diagnosis starting 5-7 days after symptom onset. These results represent the first step towards better understanding the SARS-CoV-2 immunological response in African populations.","Fai, Karl Njuwa; Corine, Tchoula Mamiafo; Bebell, Lisa M; Mbroingong, Akenji Blaise; Nguimbis, E B P Taa; Nsaibirni, Robert; Mbarga, Nicoule Fouda; Eteki, Lucrece; Nikolay, Birgit; Essomba, Rene Ghislain; Ndifon, Mark; Ntone, Rodrigue; Hamadou, Achta; Matchim, Lucrece; Tchiasso, Dora; Abbah, Aristide; Essaka, Rachel; Peppa, Solange; Crescence, Fouda; Ouamba, Jean Patrick; Koku, Modeste Tamakloé; Mandeng, Nadia; Fanne, Mahamat; Eyangoh, Sarah; Mballa, Georges Alain Etoundi; Esso, Linda; Epée, Emilienne; Njouom, Richard; Okomo, Marie Claire; Boum, Yap",Sci Afr,,203

This study considers quantitative COVID-19 dashboard data with sustainable determinants; old age group, people exposed to air pollution, and countries with the most international travelers. Applying linear regression examines that COVID-19 behavior concerning the aging population and countries host the most international travelers, more positively significant than people exposed to PM2.5% air pollution, respectively. This study made a novel contribution by analyzing two variables' interaction; first, the aging population and the countries that host the most international travelers. Secondly, the aging population and people exposed to air pollution are vulnerable to COVID-19 globally, a novel concept comprehensively. Results show that countries with aging populations are more exposed to COVID-19, and its interaction term host the most international travelers. It also analyses that the aging population and its interaction with people exposed to air pollution are also vulnerable to COVID-19 but marginally lesser than the former. However, their behavior varies from country to country, making room for future study to analyze a more in-depth analysis. It gives a different dimension to consider other risk factors of COVID-19 by bearing in mind its unique contagious characteristics, which will help policymakers draft a sound epidemic preparedness policy to tackle the unforeseen crisis.

515594,Is computed tomography really the future of biology for diagnosing COVID-19 infection?,2020,"One promising approach to improving thermoelectric energy conversion is to use nanostructured interfaces that enhance Seebeck coefficient while reducing thermal conductivity. Here, we synthesized Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanoparticles with different shell thicknesses by controlling the precursor concentration in solution. The Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanoparticles are about 37-53 nm in size, and the cores of the nanostructures are composed of Au nanoparticles with sizes of ~11 nm. The effect of shell thickness on the thermoelectric properties of core-shell nanocomposites is investigated after sintering the core-shell nanoparticles into pellets using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The power factor was optimized by synergetic effect of the improvement of Seebeck coefficient by energy filtering in the Au/Cu2Se interface and the effective tuning of carrier concentration by Ohmic contact in the interface. The lattice thermal conductivity of core-shell nanocomposites is reduced by coherent phonon scattering, which is caused by the wave-like interference of phonons due to the phase shift in the core-shell interface. The highest ZT value of 0.61 is obtained at 723 K for Au-Cu2Se core-shell nanocomposites with a shell thickness of 21 nm, which is higher than that of pure Cu2Se nanocomposite or a mixture of Au and Cu2Se particles.","Jin, Yingshi; Hwang, Junphil; Han, Mi-Kyung; Son, WonHyuk; Rhyee, Jong-Soo; Kim, Sung-Jin",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,203

Current vaccines aiming at controlling the COVID-19 pandemic are mostly directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. To promote virus entry and facilitate immune evasion, spikes must be dynamic. Interactions with host receptors and coreceptors trigger a cascade of conformational changes/structural rearrangements in spikes, which bring virus and host membranes in proximity for membrane fusion required for virus entry. Spike-mediated viral membrane fusion is a dynamic, multi-step process, and understanding the structure-function-dynamics paradigm of virus spikes is essential to elucidate viral membrane fusion, with the ultimate goal of interventions. However, our understanding of this process primarily relies on individual structural snapshots of endpoints. How these endpoints are connected in a time-resolved manner, and the order and frequency of conformational events underlying virus entry, remain largely elusive. Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) has provided a powerful platform to connect structure-function in motion, revealing dynamic aspects of spikes for several viruses: SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, influenza, and Ebola.

Telehealth systems that include health coaching and remote monitoring are making inroads in managing chronic conditions and may be especially suited for older populations. OBJECTIVE: This literature review aimed to investigate the current status of health coaching interventions incorporating telehealth technology and the associated effectiveness of this intervention to deliver health care with an emphasis on older adults (aged 65 and older). METHODS: A literature review was conducted to identify the research conducted on health coaching combined with remote monitoring for delivering health care to older adults. The Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL databases were queried using a combination of relevant search terms (including middle aged, aged, older adult, elderly, health coaching, and wellness coaching). The search retrieved 196 papers published from January 2010 to September 2019 in English. Following a systematic review process, the titles and abstracts of the papers retrieved were screened for applicability to health coaching for older adults to define a subset for further review. Papers were excluded if the studied population did not include older adults. The full text of the 42 papers in this subset was then reviewed, and 13 papers related to health coaching combined with remote monitoring for older adults were included in this review.

Through online self-report questionnaires, we aimed to discover the psychological effects of the pandemic and its associated risk factors for developing mental health symptoms in young people. We disseminated a mental health survey through online social media, WeChat, and QQ in the five Chinese provinces with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the late stage of the country-wide lockdown. We used a self-made questionnaire that queried children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 on demographic information, psychological status, and other lifestyle and COVID-related variables. A total of 17,740 children and adolescents with valid survey data participated in the study. 10,022 (56.5%), 11,611 (65.5%), 10,697 (60.3%), 6,868 (38.7%), and 6,225 (35.1%) participants presented, respectively, more depressive, anxious, compulsive, inattentive, and sleep-related problems compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. High school students reported a greater change in depression and anxiety than did middle school and primary school students. Despite the fact that very few children (0.1%) or their family members (0.1%) contracted the virus in this study, the psychological impact of the pandemic was clearly profound. Fathers anxiety appeared to have the strongest influence on a childrens psychological symptoms, explaining about 33% of variation in the childs overall symptoms. Other factors only explained less than 2% of the variance in symptoms once parents anxiety was accounted for. The spread of COVID-19 significantly influenced the psychological state of children and adolescents. It is clear that children and adolescents, particularly older adolescents, need mental health support during the pandemic. The risk factors we uncovered suggest that reducing fathers anxiety is particularly critical to addressing young peoples mental health disorders in this time.","Ma, Jing; Ding, Jun; Hu, Jiawen; Wang, Kai; Xiao, Shuaijun; Luo, Ting; Yu, Shuxiang; Liu, Chuntao; Xu, Yubxuan; Liu, Yingxian; Wang, Changhong; Guo, Suqin; Yang, Xiaohua; Song, Haidong; Geng, Yaoguo; Jin, Yu; Chen, Huayun; Liu, Chunyu",,,203

The number of manuscripts on preprint servers is soaring and peer-reviewed publications using MS-based proteomics are beginning to emerge. To facilitate proteomic research on SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, this report presents deep-scale proteomes (10,000 proteins; >130,000 peptides) of common cell line models, notably Vero E6, Calu-3, Caco-2, and ACE2-A549 that characterize their protein expression profiles including viral entry factors such as ACE2 or TMPRSS2. Using the 9 kDa protein SRP9 and the breast cancer oncogene BRCA1 as examples, we show how the proteome expression data can be used to refine the annotation of protein-coding regions of the African green monkey and the Vero cell line genomes. Monitoring changes of the proteome on viral infection revealed widespread expression changes including transcriptional regulators, protease inhibitors, and proteins involved in innate immunity. Based on a library of 98 stable-isotope labeled synthetic peptides representing 11 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we developed PRM (parallel reaction monitoring) assays for nano-flow and micro-flow LC-MS/MS. We assessed the merits of these PRM assays using supernatants of virus-infected Vero E6 cells and challenged the assays by analyzing two diagnostic cohorts of 24 (+30) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 28 (+9) negative cases. In light of the results obtained and including recent publications or manuscripts on preprint servers, we critically discuss the merits of MS-based proteomics for SARS-CoV-2 research and testing.","Zecha, Jana; Lee, Chien-Yun; Bayer, Florian P; Meng, Chen; Grass, Vincent; Zerweck, Johannes; Schnatbaum, Karsten; Michler, Thomas; Pichlmair, Andreas; Ludwig, Christina; Kuster, Bernhard",Mol Cell Proteomics,,203

The present study summarises data from the first 2 weeks of the study. METHODS: COVED is an ongoing prospective cohort study that commenced on 1 April 2020. It includes all adult patients presenting to a participating ED who undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2. Data are collected prospectively and entered into a bespoke registry. Outcomes include a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test result and requirement for intensive respiratory support. RESULTS: In the period 1-14 April 2020, 240 (16%) of 1508 patients presenting to The Alfred Emergency and Trauma Centre met inclusion criteria. Of these, 11 (5%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean age of patients was 60 years and the commonest symptoms were acute shortness of breath (n = 122 [67%]), cough (n = 108 [56%]) or fever (n = 98 [51%]). Overseas travel or known contact with a confirmed case was reported by 24 (14%) and 16 (10%) patients, respectively. Fever or hypoxia was recorded in 23 (10%) and 11 (5%) patients, respectively. Eleven (5%) patients received mechanical ventilation in the ED, of whom none tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients presenting to a tertiary ED with suspected COVID-19, only a small proportion tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the low incidence of positive cases currently precludes the development of predictive tools, the COVED Project demonstrates that the rapid establishment of an agile clinical registry for emergency care is feasible.","O039,; Reilly, Gerard M; Mitchell, Rob D; Rajiv, Prithi; Wu, Jamin; Brennecke, Helen; Brichko, Lisa; Noonan, Michael P; Hiller, Ryan; Mitra, Biswadev; Luckhoff, Carl; Paton, Andrew; Smit, De Villiers; Santamaria, Mark J; Cameron, Peter A",Emerg Med Australas,,203
519890,P053 Impact of COVID-19 in a Cohort of Patients With Inflammatory Intestinal Disease,2020,"Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the gateway for COVID-19 virus into the cells, have been implicated in worse COVID-19 outcomes associated with aging and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Data on age-associated differences in circulating ACE2 levels in humans and the role of CVD and medications is limited. We analyzed data from 967 participants of the InCHIANTI study, a community-dwelling cohort in the Chianti region, Italy. Relative abundance of ACE2 in plasma was assessed using a proteomics platform. CVD diagnoses, use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonists: ACEi, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists, were ascertained. Multiple linear analyses were performed to examine the independent association of ACE2 with age, CVD, and RAAS antagonist use. Age was independently associated with lower log (ACE2) in persons aged &#8805; 55 years (STD ß = - 0.12, p = 0.0002). ACEi treatment was also independently associated with significantly lower ACE2 levels, and ACE2 was inversely associated with weight, and positively associated with peripheral artery disease (PAD) status. There was a trend toward higher circulating ACE2 levels in hypertensive individuals, but it did not reach statistical significance. In a stratified analysis, the association between log (ACE2) and log (IL-6) was more evidenced in participants with PAD. Circulating ACE2 levels demonstrate curvilinear association with age, with older individuals beyond the sixth decade age having lower levels. ACEi was associated with greater circulating ACE2 levels. Interestingly, ACE2 was elevated in PAD and positively associated with inflammatory markers, suggesting compensatory upregulation in the setting of chronic inflammation. Further studies are needed to comprehensively characterize RAAS components with aging and disease, and assess its prognostic role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes.","AlGhatrif, Majd; Tanaka, Toshiko; Moore, Ann Zenobia; Bandinelli, Stefania; Lakatta, Edward G; Ferrucci, Luigi",Geroscience,,203

In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.","Nascimento, Marcelo de Maio",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,,203

520491,Evaluation of the nutritional status in patients with COVID-19,2020,"Current wastewater worker guidance from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) aligns with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recommendations and states that no additional specific protections against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infections, are recommended for employees involved in wastewater management operations with residuals, sludge, and biosolids at water resource recovery facilities. The USEPA guidance references a document from 2002 that summarizes practices required for protection of workers handling class B biosolids to minimize exposure to pathogens including viruses. While there is no documented evidence that residuals or biosolids of any treatment level contain infectious SARS-CoV-2 or are a source of transmission of this current pandemic strain of coronavirus, this review summarizes and examines whether the provided federal guidance is sufficient to protect workers in view of currently available data on SARS-CoV-2 persistence and transmission. No currently available epidemiological data establishes a direct link between wastewater sludge or biosolids and risk of infection from the SARS-CoV-2. Despite shedding of the RNA of the virus in feces, there is no evidence supporting the presence or transmission of infectious SARS-CoV-2 through the wastewater system or in biosolids. In addition, this review presents previous epidemiologic data related to other non-enveloped viruses. Overall, the risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2, or any pathogen, decreases with increasing treatment measures. As a result, the highest risk of exposure is related to spreading and handling untreated feces or stool, followed by untreated municipal sludge, the class B biosolids, while lowest risk is associated with spreading or handling Class A biosolids. This review reinforces federal recommendations and the importance of vigilance in applying occupational risk mitigation measures to protect public and occupational health.","Brisolara, Kari Fitzmorris; Maal-Bared, Rasha; Sobsey, Mark D; Reimers, Robert S; Rubin, Albert; Bastian, Robert K; Gerba, Charles; Smith, James E; Bibby, Kyle; Kester, Greg; Brown, Sally",Sci Total Environ,,203

Thus, the transfusion of these antibodies to deteriorating patients could theoretically help boost their immune system. Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. First, convalescent subjects must meet donor selection plasma criteria and comply with national health requirements and known standard routine procedures. Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. METHOD: The proposed framework is illustrated on the basis of two distinct and consecutive phases (i.e. testing and development). In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. The development phase includes patient and donor sides. In the patient side, prioritisation is performed using a contracted patient decision matrix constructed between 'serological/protein biomarkers and the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to fractional inspired oxygen criteria' and 'patient list based on novel MCDM method known as subjective and objective decision by opinion score method'. Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. RESULT: An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments. DISCUSSION: The proposed framework implies the benefits of providing effective care and prevention of the extremely rapidly spreading COVID-19 from affecting patients and the medical sector.","Albahri, O S; Al-Obaidi, Jameel R; Zaidan, A A; Albahri, A S; Zaidan, B B; Salih, Mahmood M; Qays, Abdulhadi; Dawood, K A; Mohammed, R T; Abdulkareem, Karrar Hameed; Aleesa, A M; Alamoodi, A H; Chyad, M A; Zulkifli, Che Zalina",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,203
522888,Reply to Letter to the Editor: COVID-19-Related Liver Injury and Clinical Outcomes: Does It Really Exist?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Viral infections can cause significant morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could therefore have a serious impact on the health of people with CF (pwCF). METHODS: We used the 38-country European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) to collect case data about pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Up to 30 June 2020, 16 countries reported 130 SARS-CoV-2 cases in people with CF, yielding an incidence of 2.70/1000 pwCF. Incidence was higher in lung-transplanted patients (n=23) versus non-transplanted patients (n=107) (8.43 versus 2.36 cases/1000). Incidence was higher in pwCF versus the age-matched general population in the age groups <15, 15-24, and 25-49 years (p<0.001), with similar trends for pwCF with and without lung transplant. Compared to the general population, pwCF (regardless of transplantation status) had significantly higher rates of admission to hospital for all age groups with available data, and higher rates of intensive care, although not statistically significant. Most pwCF recovered (96.2%), however 5 died, of whom 3 were lung transplant recipients. The case fatality rate for pwCF (3.85%, 95% CI: 1.26-8.75) was non-significantly lower than that of the general population (7.46%; p=0.133). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in severe illness and death for pwCF, even for younger patients and especially for lung transplant recipients. PwCF should continue to shield from infection and should be prioritized for vaccination.","Naehrlich, Lutz; Orenti, Annalisa; Dunlevy, Fiona; Kasmi, Irena; Harutyunyan, Satenik; Pfleger, Andreas; Keegan, Svetlana; Daneau, Géraldine; Petrova, Guergana; Tjesic-Drinkovic, Duska; Yiallouros, Panayiotis; Bilkova, Alena; Olesen, Hanne Vebert; Burgel, Pierre-Régis; Parulava, Tsitsino; Diamantea, Filia; Párniczky, Andrea; McKone, Edward F; Mei-Zahav, Meir; Salvatore, Marco; Colombo, Carla; Aleksejeva, Elina; Malakauskas, Kestutis; Schlesser, Marc; Fustik, Stojka; Turcu, Oxana; Zomer-van Ommen, Domenique; Wathne, Anita Senstad; Wozniacki, Lukasz; Pereira, Luísa; Pop, Liviu; Kashirskaya, Nataliya; Rodic, Milan; Kayserova, Hana; Krivecs, Uro; Mondejar-Lopez, Pedro; de Monestrol, Isabelle; Dogru, Deniz; Makukh, Halyna; Cosgriff, Rebecca; van Koningsbruggen-Rietschel, Silke; Jung, Andreas",J. cyst. fibros,,203

Compared with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, COVID-19 spreads more rapidly owing to increased globalization, longer incubation period, and unobvious symptoms. As the coronavirus has the characteristics of strong transmission and weak lethality, and since the large-scale increase of infected people may drag down the healthcare systems, efforts are needed to treat critical patients, track and manage the health status of residents, and isolate suspected patients. The application of emerging health technologies and digital practices in healthcare such as artificial intelligence, telemedicine/telehealth, mobile health, big data, 5G, and the internet of things have become powerful ""weapons"" to fight against the pandemic and provide strong support in pandemic prevention and control. Applications and evaluations of all of these technologies or health delivery services are highlighted.","Ye, Jiancheng",,,203
523179,Backcalculating the incidence of infection with covid-19 on the diamond princess,2020,"Two-dimensional transition metal carbides/carbonitrides known as MXenes are rapidly growing as multimodal nanoplatforms in biomedicine. Here, taking SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we explored the antiviral properties and immune-profile of a large panel of four highly stable and well-characterized MXenes - Ti3C2Tx, Ta4C3T x , Mo2Ti2C3T x and Nb4C3T x . To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti3C2T x in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo2Ti2C3T x also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology. MXene immune profiling revealed i) the excellent bio and immune compatibility of the material, as well as the ability of MXene ii) to inhibit monocytes and iii) to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect elicited by MXene. We here report a selection of MXenes and viral SARS-CoV-2 genotypes/mutations, a series of the computational, structural and molecular data depicting deeply the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of inhibition, as well as high dimensional single-cell immune-MXene profiling. Taken together, our results provide a compendium of knowledge for new developments of MXene-based multi-functioning nanosystems as antivirals and immune-modulators.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bayrakdar, Fatma; Fusco, Laura; Besbinar, Omur; Shuck, Christopher E; Yalcin, Süleyman; Erken, Mine Turktas; Ozkul, Aykut; Gurcan, Cansu; Panatli, Oguzhan; Summak, Gokce Yagmur; Gokce, Cemile; Orecchioni, Marco; Gazzi, Arianna; Vitale, Flavia; Somers, Julia; Demir, Emek; Yildiz, Serap Suzuk; Nazir, Hasan; Grivel, Jean-Charles; Bedognetti, Davide; Crisanti, Andrea; Akcali, Kamil Can; Gogotsi, Yury; Delogu, Lucia Gemma; Yilmazer, Açelya",Nano Today,,203

We used commercial online electronic services for medical students to learn sexual history-taking skills. METHODS: A total of 174 medical students viewed a lecture on sexual history taking and the PLISSIT model (Permission, Limited Information, Specific Suggestion, Intensive Therapy) and were then randomized into dyads. They arranged a time to meet online on Zoom with their partner, chose a simple sexual history case-history (male or female) from a small selection, and recorded the 5- to 6-minute sexual history within a 1-week time frame. Each student played a ""provider"" or ""patient"" and then switched roles with a new case. One of the course tutors, all sexual health practitioners, downloaded 10 videos randomly assigned to them asynchronously and viewed and commented on the interaction of each ""provider"" along with comments on what to improve in the sexual history. 2 weeks later after the remainder of the lectures in the course, a second, more complex set of 8 cases were provided, so students could move at their comfort pace and choose 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Students were required to make 1 online post and 1 comment on another student's post for each case, on the experience, and associated issues arising, positive or negative. All comments were downloaded and analyzed by theme. RESULTS: Major themes included developing comfort in using sexual language, using simpler sexual terms suitable for patients, feeling confidence and mastery, excitement using technology developing clinical skills, surprise watching their performances and body language, observation of how they appeared to the ""patient,"" organizing sexual histories and incorporating PLISSIT model, ability to ask about context and relationships, and seeing the exercise as building on existing clinical skills training. Some expressed anxiety and nervousness, which by the second case had largely or completely dissipated. CONCLUSION: A readily replicable, secure, cheap cloud-based model to integrate sexual history training asynchronously was provided, with tutors' comments, and student skills development, and performance evaluated.

590329,The Target Sign and Its Variant in COVID-19 Pneumonia,2020-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced side effects may have a negative effect on nutrition intake, thus increasing the risk of malnutrition and consequently, other serious complications for patients with cancer. The prevalence of malnutrition is common among patients with colorectal cancer. Nurse-led empowering education may have a positive effect on self-care activity in this patient group. Therefore, our purpose is to develop an empowering educational nursing intervention and test its effect on self-care activation and knowledge level among patients with colorectal cancer during chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes are quality of life and risk of malnutrition. METHODS: An interdisciplinary expert group developed a face-to-face empowering educational intervention using teach-back method. A two-arm, single-centre, superiority trial with stratified randomisation (1:1) and pre-post measures will be used to assess the effect of the intervention compared to standard care. Patients (N = 40 + 40) will be recruited in one university hospital outpatient clinic in Finland. Eligibility criteria are adult patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer starting oral fluoropyrimidine or combination chemotherapy treatment. A registered nurse experienced in oncology will deliver the intervention 2 weeks after the first chemotherapy. Outcomes are measured before intervention (M0) and after a two-month follow-up period (M1). DISCUSSION: This study will assess whether nurse-led empowering education using teach-back method is effective on self-care activity among patients with colorectal cancer. If the intervention has a positive effect, it may be implemented into patient education in a corresponding context.

More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreak. Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.","Rahimi, Farid; Bezmin Abadi, Amin Talebi",Arch Med Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440920305257?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440920305257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32381375/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2020.04.012,203

Forecasting them may allow for business managers plan stores operation in the near future in an efficient way. This work presents a regression method that is able to predict these three indicators based on previous data. The previous data includes values for the indicators in the recent past; therefore, it is a requirement to have gathered them in a suitable manner. The previous data also considers other values that are easily obtained, such as the day of the week and hour of the day of the indicators. The novelty of the approach that is presented here is that it provides a confidence interval for the predicted information and the importance of each parameter for the predicted output values, without additional processing or analysis. Real data gathered by Follow Up, a customer experience company, was used to test the proposed method. The method was tried for making predictions for up to one month in the future. The results of the experiments show that the proposed method has a comparable performance to the best methods proposed in the past that do not provide confidence intervals or parameter rankings.

Internet of Things solutions require careful management of devices and the risk mitigation of potential vulnerabilities within cyber-physical systems. The Internet of Things concept, its implementations, and applications are frequently discussed on social media platforms. This research illuminates the public view of the Internet of Things through a content-based and network analysis of contemporary conversations occurring on the Twitter platform. Tweets can be analyzed with machine learning methods to converge the volume and variety of conversations into predictive and descriptive models. We have reviewed 684,503 tweets collected in a 2-week period. Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods, we have identified trends within the realm of IoT and their interconnecting relationships between the most mentioned industries. We have identified characteristics of language sentiment which can help to predict the popularity of IoT conversation topics. We found the healthcare industry as the leading use case industry for IoT implementations. This is not surprising as the current COVID-19 pandemic is driving significant social media discussions. There was an alarming dearth of conversations towards cybersecurity. Recent breaches and ransomware events denote that organizations should spend more time communicating about risks and mitigations. Only 12% of the tweets relating to the Internet of Things contained any mention of topics such as encryption, vulnerabilities, or risk, among other cybersecurity-related terms.

591557,"Scrofuloderma, cutaneous and pulmonary tuberculosis associated with COVID-19. Report of one case",2021,"TOPIC: Critical Care TYPE: Medical Student/Resident Case Reports INTRODUCTION: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a rare but severe life-threatening condition characterized by widespread bleeding of the pulmonary vasculature into the alveolar space. DAH have a myriad of underlying etiologies. Rheumatic diseases have shown association with DAH. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the complexity associated with diagnosing DAH. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the endothelium using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor causing a lymphocytic endotheliitis. The increased inflammatory state secondary to COVID-19 has been associated with development of vasculitis syndromes. Although systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been linked to recurrent DAH, there is scarce evidence associating COVID-19 and SSc with DAH. CASE PRESENTATION: A 61-year-old female with a past medical history of SSc, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and DAH presented with worsening shortness of breath of 2 days duration. She was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of thorax showed diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities. SARS-Cov-2 polymerase chain reaction was positive. She was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, dexamethasone and received two units of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated. A decline in her hemoglobin prompted a diagnostic bronchoscopy that showed increasing frank blood in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Antinuclear antibody with centromere pattern and rheumatoid factor were positive with low complement C3 and C4. Steroids were switched to high-dose IV methylprednisolone. Three cycles of plasmapheresis were given with no clinical improvement. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 pandemic has changed the traditional approach to dyspnea. This change in the paradigm, as a result of limited resources and increased occupational risk, may hinder the diagnosis of complex disorders like SSc-ILD and DAH. It's of paramount importance to test rapidly for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ILD is a common complication of SSc. The high-resolution CT similarities between the 2 diseases make it difficult to distinguish COVID-19-ILD superinfection from worsening of SSc-ILD. Bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy should always be weighed against their possible complications, occupational exposure and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may overlap and complicate the diagnosis of SSc-ILD. COVID-19 associated acute respiratory distress syndrome is attributed to cytokines release (cytokine storm). This likely worsens the underlying inflammatory process in SSc-ILD and could explain the development of DAH. Although there is limited evidence to guide specific treatment, steroid therapy has proven to have mortality benefit in severe COVID-19. The role of steroids, plasmapheresis, immunomodulators and antifibrotic therapy in COVID-19 with SSc-ILD complicated with DAH is unknown.

The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of Chloroquine and its potent derivative Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. At the same time screening was performed for some chemically synthesized derivatives of Chloroquine and compared their binding efficacy with chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives through in silico approaches. For the purpose of the study, some essential viral proteins and enzymes were selected that are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiplication as putative drug targets. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and some of their chemically synthesized derivatives, taken from earlier published studies were selected as drug molecules. We have conducted molecular docking and related studies between Chloroquine and its derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and the findings show that both Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can bind to specific structural and non-structural proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different efficiencies. Our current study also shows that some of the chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives can also potentially inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins by binding to them and concomitantly effectively disrupting the active site of these proteins. These findings bring into light another possible mechanism of action of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and also pave the way for further drug repurposing and remodeling.

Examine age differences in SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from primary cases and infection risk among household contacts, and symptoms among those with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS. People with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Nashville, Tennessee and central and western Wisconsin and their household contacts were followed daily for 14 days to ascertain symptoms and secondary transmission events. Households were enrolled between April 2020 and April 2021. Secondary infection risks (SIR) by age of the primary case and contacts were estimated using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS. The 226 primary cases were followed by 198 (49%) secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections among 404 household contacts. Age group-specific SIR among contacts ranged from 36% to 53%, with no differences by age. SIR was lower from primary cases aged 12–17 years than from primary cases 18–49 years (risk ratio [RR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19–0.91). SIR was 55% and 45%, respectively, among primary case-contact pairs in the same versus different age group (RR 1.47; 95% CI 0.98–2.22). SIR was highest among primary case-contacts pairs aged ≥65 years (76%) and 5–11 years (69%). Among secondary SARS-CoV-2 infections, 19% were asymptomatic; there was no difference in the frequency of asymptomatic infections by age group. CONCLUSIONS. Both children and adults can transmit and are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In this study the Poles’ knowledge about COVID-19 as well as people’s behaviours, attitudes and fears during the pandemic were assessed. Changes in these between the outset of the pandemic and the imposition of the strictest lockdown measures in Poland were investigated. METHODS: Physicians, nurses, students of medicine-oriented faculties, non-medical professionals, students of non-medicine-oriented faculties and secondary school students were surveyed by an anonymous online questionnaire two times: at the onset of the pandemic and in the second week of the strictest lockdown. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests – Pearson Chi Square, Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: In total 2618 responses were collected. At the beginning people knew that the respiratory system was attacked (97.9%); correctly identified the major symptoms of COVID-19 (95.0%) and ways to prevent infection: hand washing (99.8%), covering mouth (85.9%) and the need to call sanitary-epidemiological services if one experienced COVID-19-like symptoms (92.1%). The biggest changes between the first and second phase of the study concerned behaviours: more people wearing facial masks (+ 37.5%) and staying at home (+ 66.1%). Respondents in the second wave of the survey were also more scared of the pandemic (+ 19.6%), economic crisis (+ 64.1%), and worried about their families (+ 26.5%). However, they were less afraid of the quarantine (lockdown) (− 18.2%). Nurses and physicians were the most worried groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that even at the outset of the pandemic Polish population had a good initial knowledge about symptoms, transmission, and preventive behaviours regarding COVID-19. People revealed more short-term concerns, such as the worries about coping with quarantine and isolation. After a month, the knowledge and the concerns among the respondents changed. A shift towards long-term pandemic management issues was observed. Respondents reported to experience more fears concerning the pandemic in general, as well as economic and healthcare crises. Medical professionals reported higher level of fear of the pandemic than other groups included in this study.

593020,Mendelian randomization analyses show that higher acetyl-carnitine and carnitine levels in blood protect against severe Covid19,2021-05-31,"Abstract As the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 cases in the United States the initial test was developed and performed at the Center for Disease Control (CDC). As the number of cases increased the demand for tests multiplied, leading the CDC to utilize the Emergency Utilization Authorization to allow clinical and commercial laboratories to develop tests to detect the presence of the virus. Many nucleic acid tests based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were developed, each with different techniques, specifications and turnaround time. As the illnesses turned into a pandemic, testing became more crucial. The test supply became inadequate to meet the need that it had to be prioritized according to guidance. For surveillance, the need for serologic tests emerged. Here we review the timeline of test development, the turn-around times, the various approved tests and compare them as regards the genes they detect. We concentrate on the point-of-care tests and discuss the basis for new serologic tests. We discuss the testing guidance for prioritization and their application in a hospital setting. As SARS-CoV-2 virus arrived in the USA causing the COVID-19 illness, one of the most talked about issues in the management of the disease and the resulting pandemic has been clinical testing. A unique situation arose of a communicable and highly contagious disease necessitating the rapid diagnosis of patients and the identification of non-symptomatic infected persons. Unfortunately, the USA did not have a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved laboratory test for the illness. The FDA ultimately utilized its Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) on February 4, 2020 to allow for more rapid and widespread development and implementation of in-vitro testing.1 Indeed, companies and organizations utilized the EUA to file applications for new tests based on different methodologies, amounting to 48 applications in the span of 3 months from the beginning of February to the end of April 2020. In addition, multiple other tests were put in place under a separate authorization by a Presidential memorandum in early March allowing laboratories that carry Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification to put tests in place without an EUA from the FDA. This created an unprecedented situation where the medical community and the public may not be familiar with the various new tests for COVID-19 that are offered to patients and hospitals. The purpose of this review is to provide information, up-to-date as of the date of submission of the manuscript to the journal, on the various tests that have been developed, their scientific basis and their interpretation. We give a real-world example demonstrating the time lag in the return of test results and review testing prioritization guidance since the supply of tests remains below the perceived need.","Ward, Stephanie; Lindsley, Andrew; Courter, Josh; Assa’ad, Amal",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920307296; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.05.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920307296?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32445839/,203

593488,A Case of a COVID-19-positive Patient,2020-04-09,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies to the Quebec isolate of bovine coronavirus were produced and characterized. Monoclonal antibodies to both the E2 and the E3 glycoproteins were found to efficiently neutralize virus in vitro. None of the monoclonal antibodies directed against the E1 glycoprotein neutralized virus infectivity. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein were all found to immunoprecipitate gpl90, gpl00, and their intracellular precursor protein gp170. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein immunoprecipitated gp124 and showed differential reactivity to its precursor proteins gp59 and gpl 18. These monoclonal antibodies also showed differential reactivity to an apparent degradation product of E3. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to E2 bound to two distinct nonoverlappig antigenic domains as defined by competitive binding assays. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the E3 glycoprotein also bound to two distinct antigenic sites as defined by competitive binding assays plus a third site which overlapped these regions. Other results indicated that one domain on the E3 glycoprotein could be further subdivided into two epitopes. Thus four epitopes could be defined by E3-specific monoclonal antibodies.","Deregt, Dirk; Babiuk, Lorne A.",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682287901346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2446421/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682287901346,203

It is obvious to healthcare workers and policymakers alike that an effective critical care surge response must be nested within the overall care delivery model. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted key elements of emergency preparedness. These include having national or regional strategic reserves of personal protective equipment, intensive care unit (ICU) devices, consumables and pharmaceuticals, as well as effective supply chains and efficient utilization protocols. ICUs must also be prepared to accommodate surges of patients and ICU staffing models should allow for fluctuations in demand. Pre-existing ICU triage and end-of-life care principles should be established, implemented and updated. Daily workflow processes should be restructured to include remote connection with multidisciplinary healthcare workers and frequent communication with relatives. The pandemic has also demonstrated the benefits of digital transformation and the value of remote monitoring technologies, such as wireless monitoring. Finally, the pandemic has highlighted the value of pre-existing epidemiological registries and agile randomized controlled platform trials in generating fast, reliable data. The COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder that besides our duty to care, we are committed to improve.

In mice, a lymphocyte proliferative response and a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to IBV were induced upon immunization with this nucleocapsid protein. Next, we studied the role of the expressed nucleocapsid protein in induction of a protective immune response to IBV in chickens. Chickens were primed with nucleocapsid protein and subsequently boosted with inactivated IBV, strain M41. Proliferative responses of blood mononuclear cells corresponded with increased mean haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization titres. Finally, an increased tracheal protection against challenge with live IBV was observed. These results indicate that infectious bronchitis virus nucleocapsid protein is a relevant target for immune recognition in both the mouse and the chicken.","Boots, A.M.H.; Benaissa-Trouw, B.

It has been suggested that intestinal microflora composition plays a role in this disease because of the following: (i) its relevance to an efficient immune system response; (ii) the fact that 5–10% of the patients present gastrointestinal symptoms; and (iii) because it is modulated by intestinal angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (which is the virus receptor). In addition, it is known that the most severely affected patients (those who stay longer in hospital, who require intensive care, and who eventually die) are older people with pre-existing cardiovascular, metabolic, renal, and pulmonary diseases, the same people in which the prevalence of gut microflora dysbiosis is higher. The COVID-19 patients presenting poor outcomes are also those in which the immune system’s hyperresponsiveness and a severe inflammatory condition (collectively referred as “cytokine storm”) are particularly evident, and have been associated with impaired microbiota phenotype. In this article, we present the evidence existing thus far that may suggest an association between intestinal microbiota composition and the susceptibility of some patients to progress to severe stages of the disease.","Ferreira, Carolina; Viana, Sofia D.; Reis, Flávio",Microorganisms,https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33379162/,203

Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from blood-derived DNA genotyping, are structural somatic variants associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality(3–11). Whether mCAs represent independent risk factors for infection is unknown. Here we use genome-wide genotyping of blood DNA to show that mCAs predispose to diverse infectious diseases. We analyzed mCAs from 767,891 individuals without hematological cancer at DNA acquisition across four countries. Expanded mCA (cell fraction >10%) prevalence approached 4% by 60 years of age and was associated with diverse incident infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization. A genome-wide association study of expanded mCAs identified 63 significant loci. Germline genetic alleles associated with expanded mCAs were enriched at transcriptional regulatory sites for immune cells. Our results link mCAs with impaired immunity and predisposition to infections. Furthermore, these findings may also have important implications for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in prioritizing individual preventive strategies and evaluating immunization responses.","Zekavat, Seyedeh M.; Lin, Shu-Hong; Bick, Alexander G.; Liu, Aoxing; Paruchuri, Kaavya; Uddin, Md Mesbah; Ye, Yixuan; Yu, Zhaolong; Liu, Xiaoxi; Kamatani, Yoichiro; Pirruccello, James P.; Pampana, Akhil; Loh, Po-Ru; Kohli, Puja; McCarroll, Steven A.; Neale, Benjamin; Engels, Eric A.; Brown, Derek W.; Smoller, Jordan W.; Green, Robert; Karlson, Elizabeth W.; Lebo, Matthew; Ellinor, Patrick T.; Weiss, Scott T.; Daly, Mark J.; Terao, Chikashi; Zhao, Hongyu; Ebert, Benjamin L.; Ganna, Andrea; Machiela, Mitchell J.; Genovese, Giulio; Natarajan, Pradeep",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236019/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.12.20230821; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.12.20230821v1?rss=1,203
596439,COVID-19 in patients with familial Mediterranean fever treated with colchicine: case based review,2021-02-21,"Abstract The American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) was established in 1946. Since then, significant advances have been made in diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting the upper extremity. However, there has been little documentation regarding how the largest and oldest society dedicated to hand surgery has evolved over time. Further, an understanding of the history of the ASSH and the specialty of hand surgery should be emphasized in resident and fellow education. The authors aim to provide a historical overview of the ASSH through the speeches of ASSH past presidents which sheds light on future directions and long-term goals. Presidential addresses from 1961 to 2018 (courtesy of ASSH Chase Library historical archives) were reviewed. The overall percentage of ASSH presidents by specialty was 67% orthopaedic, 25% plastic surgery, and 8% general surgery. The most common speech theme overall was “how to be a good hand surgeon” (31%). The most common speech themes were as follows by decade: 1960’s, “history and the current state of ASSH”; 1970’s and 80’s “assessments of how to be a good surgeon” and “goals for ASSH”; 1990’s, “healthcare and governmental regulation”; 2000’s, “how to be a better hand surgeon”; 2010’s “goals for ASSH”. In earlier years, there was more of a focus on education and technical skill development in the ASSH. Work-life balance, introduced in the 1990s, has become more of a focus in the past 20 years. Revisiting the history of the ASSH and its goals allows us to reflect on the progress made while recognizing what is important as we look into the future. Further, as we strive to make progress in the field of hand surgery during the current pandemic, valuable tools surface that will allow the specialty to strengthen its education, research, and patient care delivery in the future.","Azoury, Saïd C.; John, Tamara; Cheema, Adnan N.; Behar, Brittany J.; Zapolsky, Ivan; Levin, L.

The aim of this study was to assess fetal growth, fetal well-being, and any observed gross anomalies that may follow SARS-CoV-2 infection in Egyptian pregnant women. During fetal anomaly scan at 22 weeks, we compared 30 pregnant women with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at 6‑12 weeks of gestation (group A) with 60 pregnant women (group B) who had no history of SARS-CoV-2. Then, we followed them on 28 and 34 weeks of gestation with fetal biometry and Doppler study. RESULTS: Our results revealed no significant difference between both groups regarding fetal biometry, estimated fetal weight, amniotic fluid index, Doppler scan, and gross anomaly scan throughout all visits. CONCLUSION: According to the results of our pilot study, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was not found to increase the risk of fetal growth restriction or possible fetal gross anomalies. Nevertheless, larger-scale studies are needed to confirm those findings. Perhaps, post-SARS-CoV-2 infection pregnancies may run an uncomplicated course regarding fetal parameters.","Eltemamy, Emad; Salama, Sameh; Salem, Sondos M.; Abdel-Rasheed, Mazen; Salama, Ehab; Elsirgany, Sherif; Elnahas, Tamer",Middle East Fertil Soc J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483650/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s43043-021-00075-2,203

There has been increasing evidence to suggest that the pathophysiological basis is a severe inflammatory response that resembles the cytokine release syndrome. Current strategies to counteract this involve modifiers of the immune response such as interleukin (IL)-6 receptor blockers and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. An example of a JAK inhibitor is baricitinib. In this case, we present a 17-year-old female admitted with severe COVID-19 symptoms, who was placed on high-flow nasal cannula and started on azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine, which were standard of care at the time. Due to the worsening of symptoms, she was given baricitinib for compassionate use. There was a rapid improvement in clinical and imaging findings, and the patient was discharged from the hospital within 8 days of admission. This study is fascinating because there are very limited studies published on the benefits of baricitinib in managing patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 especially in the pediatric population, and the rapidity in recovery time was remarkable.","Atemnkeng, Francis; Alataby, Harith; Demirjian, Jack; Kenne, Foma Munoh; Nfonoyim, Jay",J Med Cases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33984091/; https://doi.org/10.14740/jmc3629,203

Nanoparticle based vaccines have proven prodigious prophylaxis of various infectious and non-infectious diseases of human and animal concern. Nano-vaccines outnumber the conventional vaccines by virtue of plasticity in physio-chemical properties and ease of administration. The efficacy of nano-based vaccines may be attributed to the improved antigen stability, minimum immuno-toxicity, sustained release, enhanced immunogenicity and the flexibility of physical features of nanoparticles. Based on these, the nano-based vaccines have potential to evoke both cellular and humoral immune responses. Targeted and highly specific immunological pathways required for solid and long lasting immunity may be achieved with specially engineered nano-vaccines. This review presents an insight into the prevention of infectious diseases (of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin) and non-infectious diseases (cancer, auto-immune diseases) using nano-vaccinology.

Despite significant efforts, many limitations and biases exist in previously developed AI diagnostic models for COVID-19. Utilizing a large set of local and international CXR images, we developed an AI model with high performance on temporal and external validation. OBJECTIVE: Investigate real-time performance of an AI-enabled COVID-19 diagnostic support system across a 12-hospital system. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Labeled frontal CXR images (samples of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19) from the M Health Fairview (Minnesota, USA), Valencian Region Medical ImageBank (Spain), MIMIC-CXR, Open-I 2013 Chest X-ray Collection, GitHub COVID-19 Image Data Collection (International), Indiana University (Indiana, USA), and Emory University (Georgia, USA) PARTICIPANTS: Internal (training, temporal, and real-time validation): 51,592 CXRs; Public: 27,424 CXRs; External (Indiana University): 10,002 CXRs; External (Emory University): 2002 CXRs MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Model performance assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Precision-Recall curves, and F1 score. RESULTS: Patients that were COVID-19 positive had significantly higher COVID-19 Diagnostic Scores (median .1 [IQR: 0.0–0.8] vs median 0.0 [IQR: 0.0–0.1], p < 0.001) than patients that were COVID-19 negative. Pre-implementation the AI-model performed well on temporal validation (AUROC 0.8) and external validation (AUROC 0.76 at Indiana U, AUROC 0.72 at Emory U). The model was noted to have unrealistic performance (AUROC > 0.95) using publicly available databases. Real-time model performance was unchanged over 19 weeks of implementation (AUROC 0.70). On subgroup analysis, the model had improved discrimination for patients with “severe” as compared to “mild or moderate” disease, p < 0.001. Model performance was highest in Asians and lowest in whites and similar between males and females. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: AI-based diagnostic tools may serve as an adjunct, but not replacement, for clinical decision support of COVID-19 diagnosis, which largely hinges on exposure history, signs, and symptoms. While AI-based tools have not yet reached full diagnostic potential in COVID-19, they may still offer valuable information to clinicians taken into consideration along with clinical signs and symptoms.","Sun, Ju; Peng, Le; Li, Taihui; Adila, Dyah; Zaiman, Zach; Melton, Genevieve B.; Ingraham, Nicholas; Murray, Eric; Boley, Daniel; Switzer, Sean; Burns, John L.; Huang, Kun; Allen, Tadashi; Steenburg, Scott D.; Gichoya, Judy Wawira; Kummerfeld, Erich; Tignanelli, Christopher",ArXiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099980/,203

Even today, we are still mostly ignorant about why most poxvirus infections of vertebrate hosts show strict species specificity, or how zoonotic poxvirus infections occur when poxviruses occasionally leap into novel host species. Poxvirus tropism at the cellular level seems to be regulated by intracellular events downstream of virus binding and entry, rather than at the level of specific host receptors as is the case for many other viruses. This review summarizes our current understanding of poxvirus tropism and host range, and discusses the prospects of exploiting host-restricted poxvirus vectors for vaccines, gene therapy or tissue-targeted oncolytic viral therapies for the treatment of human cancers.","McFadden, Grant",Nature Reviews Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15738948/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4382915?pdf=render,203
597938,Su323 THE PATTERNS OF LIVER INJURY IN COVID-19 POSITIVE PREGNANT FEMALES: A CASE SERIES,2021-05-31,"OBJECTIVE: To separately compare the long-term risk of mortality among bariatric surgical patients undergoing either RYGB or SG to large, matched, population-based cohorts of patients with severe obesity who did not undergo surgery. BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has been associated with reduced long-term mortality compared to usual care for severe obesity which is particularly relevant in the COVID-19 era. Most prior studies involved the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation and there is less long-term data on the sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: In this retrospective, matched cohort study, patients with a body mass index ≥35âkg/m2 who underwent bariatric surgery from January 2005 to September 2015 in three integrated health systems in the United States were matched to nonsurgical patients on site, age, sex, body mass index, diabetes status, insulin use, race/ethnicity, combined Charlson/Elixhauser comorbidity score, and prior health care utilization, with follow-up through September 2015. Each procedure (RYGB, SG) was compared to its own control group and the two surgical procedures were not directly compared to each other. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis investigated time to all-cause mortality (primary outcome) comparing each of the bariatric procedures to usual care. Secondary outcomes separately examined the incidence of cardiovascular-related death, cancer related-death, and diabetes related-death. RESULTS: Among 13,900 SG, 17,258 RYGB, and 87,965 nonsurgical patients, the 5-year follow-up rate was 70.9%, 72.0%, and 64.5%, respectively. RYGB and SG were each associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to nonsurgical patients at 5-years of follow-up (RYGB: HR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.35,0.54; SG: HR = 0.28; 95% CI: 0.13,0.57) Similarly, RYGB was associated with a significantly lower 5-year risk of cardiovascular- (HR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.37), cancer- (HR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.76), and diabetes-related mortality (HR = 0.23; 95% CI:0.15, 0.36). There was not enough follow-up time to assess 5-year cause-specific mortality in SG patients, but at 3-years follow up, there was significantly lower risk of cardiovascular- (HR = 0.33; 95% CI:0.19, 0.58), cancer- (HR = 0.26; 95% CI:0.11, 0.59), and diabetes-related (HR = 0.15; 95% CI:0.04, 0.53) mortality for SG patients. CONCLUSION: This study confirms and extends prior findings of an association with better survival following bariatric surgery in RYGB patients compared to controls and separately demonstrates that the SG operation also appears to be associated with lower mortality compared to matched control patients with severe obesity that received usual care. These results help to inform the trade-offs between long-term benefits and risks of bariatric surgery.","Courcoulas, Anita P; Johnson, Eric; Arterburn, David E; Haneuse, Sebastien; Herrinton, Lisa J; Fisher, David P; Li, Robert A; Theis, Mary Kay; Liu, Liyan; Taylor, Brianna; Cooper, Julie; Chin, Philip L; Grinberg, Gary G; Gupta, Anirban; Saurabh, Shireesh; Um, Scott S; Yenumula, Panduranga R; Zelada, Jorge L; Coleman, Karen J",Ann. surg,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000005155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34387200/,203

597980,Political will and international collaborative frameworks in infectious diseases,2015-01-13,"Two-dimensional transition metal carbides/carbonitrides known as MXenes are rapidly growing as multimodal nanoplatforms in biomedicine. Here, taking SARS-CoV-2 as a model, we explored the antiviral properties and immune-profile of a large panel of four highly stable and well-characterized MXenes - Ti(3)C(2)T(x), Ta(4)C(3)T(x), Mo(2)Ti(2)C(3)T(x) and Nb(4)C(3)T(x). To start with antiviral assessment, we first selected and deeply analyzed four different SARS-CoV-2 genotypes, common in most countries and carrying the wild type or mutated spike protein. When inhibition of the viral infection was tested in vitro with four viral clades, Ti(3)C(2)T(x) in particular, was able to significantly reduce infection only in SARS-CoV-2/clade GR infected Vero E6 cells. This difference in the antiviral activity, among the four viral particles tested, highlights the importance of considering the viral genotypes and mutations while testing antiviral activity of potential drugs and nanomaterials. Among the other MXenes tested, Mo(2)Ti(2)C(3)T(x) also showed antiviral properties. Proteomic, functional annotation analysis and comparison to the already published SARS-CoV-2 protein interaction map revealed that MXene-treatment exerts specific inhibitory mechanisms. Envisaging future antiviral MXene-based drug nano-formulations and considering the central importance of the immune response to viral infections, the immune impact of MXenes was evaluated on human primary immune cells by flow cytometry and single-cell mass cytometry on 17 distinct immune subpopulations. Moreover, 40 secreted cytokines were analyzed by Luminex technology.

597993,Seizures Related to Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Case Series and Literature Review,2020-07-24,"The interaction between the enhancing and neutralizing activities of three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (5‐6‐2, 6‐4‐2 and 7‐4‐1) to the spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79‐1146 was determined using feline macrophages. At a high MAb concentration, all of the three MAbs completely inhibited the FIPV infection at 37 C. However, two of them (6‐4‐2 and 7‐4‐1) enhanced FIPV infection when either the MAb concentration or reaction temperature was lowered. These MAbs also exerted an immediate infectivity‐enhancing activity for up to 10 min of reaction and by 20 min, neutralizing activities were observed. Only MAb 5‐6‐2 consistently showed neutralizing activity regardless of the reaction conditions. Competition with sera from cats experimentally infected with FIPV strain 79‐1146 or feline enteric coronavirus strain 79‐1683 showed that the two epitopes recognized by MAb 5‐6‐2 and MAb 6‐4‐2, respectively, are also recognized by the natural host.","Hohdatsu, Tsutomu; Yamada, Hitomi; Ishizuka, Yuzuru; Koyama, Hiroyuki",Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7694052/,203

Novel datasets detailing levels of social activity were made widely available during the COVID-19 pandemic. These allow the relationship between activity and STI incidence to be examined. METHODS: The correlation between social activities and the reported number of gonorrhoea cases between March and December 2020 in Germany was studied. Regression through Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series modelling identified those activities associated with case numbers. RESULTS: ARIMA regression identified a significant association with ‘transit’ activity within the Apple data and ‘parks’ within Google. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the potential newly available measures of social activity provided for STI research. Reductions in STI incidence are likely to have occurred due to COVID-19 social restrictions. Although other studies report reductions in infectious diseases during this period, few examine the potential social factors mediating this. The results illustrate the continual need for sexual health services throughout the pandemic.","Sulyok, Mihály; Walker, Mark",Sex Transm Infect,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2021-055159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510006/,203

Design Epidemiological observational study. Setting Two large hospitals and 40 territorial healthcare units, with a total of 5700 workers. Participants 143 HCWs with a SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal (NF) swab in a population made of 5,700 HCWs. Main outcome measures Clinical data on the history of exposure, contacts inside and outside of the hospital, NF swab dates and results. A daily online self-reported case report form consisting of the morning and evening body temperature and 11 other symptoms (cough, dyspnoea, discomfort, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhoea, anosmia, dysgeusia, conjunctival hyperaemia). Results Most workers were tested and found positive due to a close contact with a positive colleague (49%), followed by worker-initiated testing due to symptoms (and unknown contact, 28%), and a SARS-CoV-2 positive member of the family (9.8%). 10% of NF swabs performed in the framework of contact tracing resulted positive, compared to only 2.6% through random testing. The first (index) case caused a cluster of 7 positive HCWs discovered through contact tracing and testing of 250 asymptomatic HCWs. HCWs rarely reported symptoms of a respiratory infection, and up to 90% were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms in the days surrounding the positive NF swab. During the 15-day follow-up period, up to 40% of HCWs reported anosmia and dysgeusia/ageusia as moderate or heavy, more frequently than any other symptom. The time necessary for 95% of HCWs to be considered cured (between the positive and two negative NF swabs) was 30 days. Conclusion HCWs represent the main source of infection in healthcare institutions, 90% are asymptomatic or with symptoms not common in a respiratory infection. The time needed to overcome the infection in 95% of workers was 30 days. Contact tracing allows identifying asymptomatic workers which would spread SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and is a more successful strategy than random testing.","Mandic-Rajcevic, S.; Masci, F.; Crespi, E.; Franchetti, S.; Longo, A.; Bollina, I.; Veloci, S.; Amorosi, A.; Baldelli, R.; Boselli, L.; Negroni, L.; Za, A.; Orfeo, N.

METHODS: In according to the recommendations of the European Association of Urology, we have developed practical additional document on the treatment of prostate cancer. RESULTS: Low-Risk Group Watchful Waiting should be offered to patients >75 years old, with a limited life expectancy and unfit for local treatment. In Active Surveillance (AS) patients re-biopsy, PSA evaluation and visits should be deferred for up to 6 months, preferring non-invasive multiparametric-MRI. The active treatment should be delayed for 6–12 months. Intermediate-Risk Group AS should be offered in favorable-risk patients. Short-course neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with ultra-hypo-fractionation radiotherapy should be used in unfavorable-risk patients. High-Risk Group Neoadjuvant ADT combined with moderate hypofractionation should be preferred. Whole-pelvis irradiation should be offered to patients with positive lymph nodes in locally advanced setting. ADT should be initiated if PSA doubling time is < 12 months in radio-recurrent patients, as well as in low priority/low volume of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. If radiotherapy cannot be delayed, hypo-fractionated regimens should be preferred. In high priority class metastatic disease, treatment with androgen receptor-targeted agents should be offered. When palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastasis is required, single fraction of 8 Gy should be offered.

The role of DNA has increased dramatically with the advent of various DNA derivatives such as DNA–RNA, DNA–metal hybrids, and PNA, which can be organized into 2D or 3D structures by exploiting their complementary recognition. Due to its intrinsic biocompatibility, self‐assembly, tunable immunogenicity, structural programmability, long stability, and electron‐rich nature, DNA has generated major interest in electronic and catalytic applications. Based on its advantages, DNA and its derivatives are utilized in several fields where the traditional methodologies are ineffective. Here, the present challenges and opportunities of DNA transformations are demonstrated, especially in biomedical applications that include diagnosis and therapy. Natural DNAs previously utilized and transformed into patterns are not found in nature due to lack of multiplexing, resulting in low sensitivity and high error frequency in multi‐targeted therapeutics. More recently, new platforms have advanced the diagnostic ability and therapeutic efficacy of DNA in biomedicine.

The rapidity of its spread and the lack of detailed research on the course and methods of transmission significantly impede both its eradication and prevention. SCOPE AND APPROACH: Due to the high transmission rate and fatality resulting from COVID-19 disease, the paper focus on analyzing the current state of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 as well as its potential connection with food as a source of pathogen and infection. KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is currently no evidence (scientific publications, WHO, EFSA etc.) that COVID-19 disease can spread directly through food and the human digestive system. However, according to the hypothesis regarding the primary transmission of the virus, the source of which was food of animal origin (meat of wild animals), as well as the fact that food is a basic necessity for humans, it is worth emphasizing that food can, if not directly can be a carrier of the virus. Particular attention should be paid to this indirect pathway when considering the potential for the spread of an epidemic and the development of prevention principles.","Duda-Chodak, Aleksandra; Lukasiewicz, Marcin; Zięć, Gabriela; Florkiewicz, Adam; Filipiak-Florkiewicz, Agnieszka",Trends Food Sci Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32921922/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2020.08.020; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0924224420305847; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224420305847?v=s5,203
601701,"Covid-19 transmission, outcome and associated risk factors in cancer patients at the first month of the pandemic in a Spanish hospital in Madrid",2020-05-25,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Although there are some doubts about the reporting of cases and deaths in China, it seems that this country was able to control the epidemic more effectively than many other countries. In this paper, we would like to analyze the measures taken in China and compare them with other countries in order to find out what they can learn from China. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model of the COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan. Based on a number of simulations we analyze the impact of changing parameters, such as contact rates, on the development of a second wave. RESULTS: Although China’s health care system seems to be poorly financed and inefficient, the epidemic was brought under control in a comparably short period of time and no second wave was experienced in Wuhan until today. The measures to contain the epidemic do not differ from what was implemented in other countries, but China applied them very early and rigorously. For instance, the consequent implementation of health codes and contact-tracking technology contributed to contain the disease and effectively prevented the second and third waves. CONCLUSIONS: China’s success in fighting COVID-19 is based on a very strict implementation of a set of measures, including digital management. While other countries discuss relaxing the lock-down at a rate of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants, China started local lock-downs at a rate of 3 per 100,000. We call for a public debate whether this policy would be feasible for more liberal countries as well.","Wang, Mei Mei; Fleßa, Steffen",Health Econ Rev,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13561-021-00319-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228254/,203

This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. RESULTS: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. CONCLUSION: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future.

The mental health impact of COVID-19 in this crucial population has not been studied thus far. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the psychosocial well-being of these providers. STUDY DESIGN: National cross-sectional online survey (no control group). SETTING: Academic otolaryngology programs in the United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We distributed a survey to nonphysician health care workers in otolaryngology departments across the United States. The survey incorporated a variety of validated mental health assessment tools to measure participant burnout (Mini-Z assessment), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7), distress (Impact of Event Scale), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire–2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictive factors associated with these mental health outcomes. RESULTS: We received 347 survey responses: 248 (71.5%) nurses, 63 (18.2%) administrative staff, and 36 (10.4%) advanced practice providers. A total of 104 (30.0%) respondents reported symptoms of burnout; 241 (69.5%), symptoms of anxiety; 292 (84.1%), symptoms of at least mild distress; and 79 (22.8%), symptoms of depression. Upon further analysis, development of these symptoms was associated with factors such as occupation, practice setting, and case load.

On March 5, the government of Palestine declared a state of emergency in order to curb the spread of the virus, a declaration that it extended for a fifth time on July 5(th). The degree to which a population complies with corresponding safety measures is surely affected by the people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards the disease. To explore this hypothesis, we gathered data from 1,731 Palestinians between April 19(th)and May 1(st), 2020 through a KAP questionnaire. The participant pool represented a stratified sample of Palestinians living across a number of governorates in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, with 36.5% from Gaza and (63.5%) from the West Bank. Gender was almost equally distributed within the sample with (51%) men respondents and (49%) women respondent. The questionnaire included 17 questions about participants’ knowledge and awareness of COVID–19, 17 questions regarding the safety measures they had taken in the wake of the outbreak and 3 questions asking them to assess the efficacy of the government’s response to the pandemic. Our data shows that 79% of the respondents have good awareness about transmission of the virus, 55.6% were knowledgeable of the symptoms exhibited by an infected individual, 81% were aware of the preventative measures and 82% demonstrated awareness of the risk groups. Most participants complied with preventative measures (77%) and 62% the study participants agreed that stricter measures have to be enforced by the government to limit the spread of the virus. Our study revealed that younger participants and people with higher educational level demonstrated more awareness of the virus. Also, Women were reported to be more aware of preventative measures and to have complied more with good practices. We report that residents of the West Bank have complied more with the right practices when compared to residents of Gaza. Based on the results of this study, we conclude that health education programs aimed at improving the public’s understanding of COVID-19 are important in helping the population maintain appropriate practices and should be target people with lower educational level, and that findings such as those discussed in this report may provide valuable feedback to lawmakers working to stop the spread of the virus.","Qutob, Nouar; Awartani, Faisal",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400722/,203

The pathophysiology of ATM is poorly understood, with no apparent differences in age, ethnicities, or race, along with variable radiographic and clinical presentation. Therefore, in this review, we will characterize what is known about ATM’s etiology and diagnostic criteria, and relate it to properties of neuroimmunology. Moreover, we will further discuss current treatment options, along with potential novel methods, to provide a comprehensive overview of the status of ATM’s research development. Among these novel treatments, potassium blockers reveal exciting early outcomes in restoring neurologic motor function. In addition, human glial progenitor cell transportations have been described as a potential treatment through integrating and remyelinating lesion sites. Nevertheless, despite these novel methods, there is a paucity of clinical trials establishing ATM’s immunopathology and the therapeutic role of potential treatment methods.

Remote management of HF patients has been recommended in order to maintain routine standards of care, but satisfaction with this platform of care is unknown. We set out to address the physician and patient opinion of remote management of HF during COVID-19. Methods and Results An observational report of the use of a Structured Telephonic assessment (STA) in stable outpatient HF patients. Physician grading of the STA was complemented by 100 randomly chosen patients to ascertain patient's satisfaction and comment. 278 patients underwent a STA. Patient preference for STA was noted in 66%. Convenience was the single most cited reason for this preference (83.3%). The STA was deemed satisfactory by clinicians in 67.6%. The two-leading reasons for clinician dissatisfaction were data gaps providing a barrier to titration (55.6%) and need for clinical exam (18.9%). The annual review appointment visit subtype possessed the highest levels of satisfaction congruence amongst both clinicians and patients. Conclusion In summary, this report demonstrates reasonable patient / physician satisfaction with STA, and providing some direction on how this care platform might be sustained beyond the COVID crisis.","Kerr, Brian; Pharithi, Rebabonye B; Barrett, Matthew; Halley, Carmel; Gallagher, Joe; Ledwidge, Mark; McDonald, Kenneth",International journal of cardiology.

Characterizing the global patent landscape of coronaviruses is essential not only for informing research and policy, given the current pandemic crisis, but also for anticipating important future developments. While patents are a promising indicator of technological knowledge production widely used in innovation research, they are often an underused resource in biological sciences. In this study, we present a patent landscape for the seven coronaviruses known to infect humans. The information included in this paper provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines along with a deeper discussion of intellectual property rights under epidemic conditions. The results show that there has been a rapid increase in human coronavirus patents, especially COVID-19 patents. China and the United States play an outstanding role in global cooperation and patent application. The leading role of academic institutions and government is increasingly apparent. Notable technological issues related to human coronaviruses include pharmacochemical treatment, diagnosis of viral infection, viral-vector vaccines, and traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, a critical challenge lies in balancing commercial competition, enterprise profit, knowledge sharing, and public interest.","Liu, Kunmeng; Gu, Zixuan; Islam, Md Sahidul; Scherngell, Thomas; Kong, Xiangjun; Zhao, Jing; Chen, Xin; Hu, Yuanjia",Int J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33907523/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.58807,203

Observations: Despite the challenges experienced during the pandemic, the global oncology community has responded with an unprecedented level of investigation, collaboration, and technological innovation through the rapid development of COVID-19 registries that have allowed an increased understanding of the natural history, risk factors, and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19. This review describes 14 major registries comprising more than 28 500 patients with cancer and COVID-19; these ongoing registry efforts have provided an improved understanding of the impact and outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: An initiative is needed to promote active collaboration between different registries to improve the quality and consistency of information. Well-designed prospective and randomized clinical trials are needed to collect high-level evidence to guide long-term epidemiologic, behavioral, and clinical decision-making for this and future pandemics.","Desai, Aakash; Mohammed, Turab J; Duma, Narjust; Garassino, Marina C; Hicks, Lisa K; Kuderer, Nicole M; Lyman, Gary H; Mishra, Sanjay; Pinato, David J; Rini, Brian I; Peters, Solange; Warner, Jeremy L; Whisenant, Jennifer G; Wood, William A; Thompson, Michael A",JAMA oncol.

603672,More on COVID‐19 coagulopathy in Caucasian patients,2020-05-25,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive, behavioral and motor symptoms and has a more challenging clinical management and poorer prognosis compared to other forms of dementia. The experience of lockdown leads to negative psychological outcomes for fragile people such as elderly with dementia, particularly for DLB, causing a worsening of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Since an individual’s feeling of time passage is strongly related to their cognitive and emotional state, it is conceivable to expect alterations of this construct in people with DLB during such a difficult period. We therefore assessed the subjective experience of the passage of time for present and past time intervals (Subjective Time Questionnaire, STQ) during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID−19) in 22 patients with DLB (17 of which were re-tested in a post-lockdown period) and compared their experience with that of 14 caregivers with similar age. Patients showed a significantly slower perception of present and past time spent under lockdown restrictions. We argue that these alterations might be related to the distinctive features of DLB and their exacerbation recorded by the patients’ caregivers during the period of lockdown, though our results show that the patients’ experience of time passage in a post-lockdown period remained similarly slow. Overall, we show an impairment of the subjective perception of time passage in DLB tested during the COVID-19 lockdown.

One of the features of WGM sensors is their capability to respond to environmental perturbations that influence the optical mode distribution. The exceptional sensitivity of WGM devices, coupled with the diversity in their structures and the ease of integration with existing infrastructures, such as conventional chip-based technologies, has catalyzed the development of WGM sensors for a broad range of analytes. WGM sensors have been developed for multiplexed detection of clinically relevant biomolecules while also being adapted for the analysis of single-protein interactions. They have been used for the detection of materials in different phases and forms, including gases, liquids, and chemicals. Furthermore, WGM sensors have been used for a wide variety of field-based sensing applications, including electric field, magnetic field, force, pressure, and temperature. WGM sensors hold great potential for applications in life and environmental sciences. They are expected to meet the ever-increasing demand in sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and real-time health monitoring. Here we review the mechanisms, structures, parameters, and recent advances of WGM microsensors and discuss the future of this exciting research field.","Jiang, Xuefeng; Qavi, Abraham J.; Huang, Steven H.; Yang, Lan",Matter,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590238520303660; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2020.07.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590238520303660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835223/,203

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for Covid-19. Methods In an open-label adaptive multiplatform randomized controlled trial, non-critically ill patients hospitalized for Covid-19, defined by the absence of critical care-level organ support at enrollment, were randomized to a pragmatic strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The primary outcome combined survival to hospital discharge and days free of organ support through 21 days, which was evaluated with Bayesian statistical models according to baseline D-dimer. Results The trial was stopped when prespecified criteria for superiority were met for therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in groups defined by high ([≥]2-fold elevated) and low (<2-fold elevated) D-dimer. Among 2219 participants in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic anticoagulation increased organ support-free days compared to thromboprophylaxis was 99.0% (adjusted odds ratio 1.29, 95% credible interval 1.04 to 1.61). The adjusted absolute increase in survival to hospital discharge without organ support with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.6% (95% credible interval 0.7 to 8.1). In the primary adaptive stopping groups, the final probabilities of superiority for therapeutic anticoagulation were 97.3% in the high D-dimer group and 92.9% in the low D-dimer group. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% and 0.9% of participants randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and thromboprophylaxis, respectively. Conclusions In non-critically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increases the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of organ support.","Lawler, P.

605995,Thrombosis and COVID-19 pneumonia: the clot thickens!,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies described the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in outdoor air particulate matter (PM) in urban areas of northern Italy and USA. The city of Madrid was heavily affected by COVID-19 during March-June 2020. Also, this city usually displays high concentrations of PM under several atmospheric situations. This is mandatory to assess the presence of viral RNA in PM, as an indicator of epidemic recurrence. Our study was aimed at investigating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in outdoor air samples (on PM10, PM2.5 and PM1). METHODS: six samples of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were collected between the May 4(th) and 22(nd) 2020 in Madrid, on quartz fiber filters by using MCV high volume samplers (30 m(3) h(−1) flow) with three inlets (Digitel DHA-80) for sampling PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. RNA extraction and amplification was performed according to the protocol recently set by Setti et al., 2020c in Italy. Up to three highly specific molecular marker genes (N1, N2, and RP) were used to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: After RNA extraction and expression measurements of N1, N2 and RP genes from all the collected filters, no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was observed. Control test to exclude false positive results were successfully accomplished. CONCLUSIONS: No presence of SARS-CoV-2 in quartz fiber filters samplers for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 fractions was observed in our study carried out in Madrid during the month of May 2020. Nevertheless, the absence of viral genomes could be due to different factors including: limited social interactions and economic activities resulting in reduced circulation of the coronavirus, lower daily PM concentration in outdoor air, as well as to meteorological stability and higher temperature that characterize spring season. Further researches should be carried out during the winter, in presence of higher viral circulation and daily PM exceedances.","Pradillo, Beatriz Linillos; Rancan, Lisa; Ramiro, Elías Díaz; Vara, Elena; Artíñano, Begoña; Arias, Javier",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33609549/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121001572; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.110863; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121001572?v=s5,203

We analyzed a citywide electronic TB register in Blantyre, Malawi and interviewed TB officers. Malawi did not have an official COVID-19 lockdown but closed schools and borders on March 23, 2020. In an interrupted time series analysis, we noted an immediate 35.9% reduction in TB notifications in April 2020; notifications recovered to near prepandemic numbers by December 2020. However, 333 fewer cumulative TB notifications were received than anticipated. Women and girls were affected more (30.7% fewer cases) than men and boys (20.9% fewer cases). Fear of COVID-19 infection, temporary facility closures, inadequate personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 stigma because of similar symptoms to TB were mentioned as reasons for fewer people being diagnosed with TB.

606402,Chest CT Imaging Features of Typical Covert COVID-19 Cases,2021-03-15,"The theoretical framework of interactive work provides a multi-dimensional perspective on the interpersonal demands of nurses in nurse–patient interactions. It is defined by four dimensions: emotional labor directed to the self and others, cooperative work, and subjective acting. While the framework stems from qualitative research, the aim of the current study is to translate it into a quantitative scale to enable measurement of the high interpersonal demands that so often remain implicit. For this reason, we conducted an online survey study (N = 157; 130 women, 25 men, 2 divers) among professional nurses in Germany (spring 2021) to test the derived items and subscales concerning interactive work, which resulted in a 4-factor model that was verified with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The survey further captured additional information on established constructs concerning job-related well-being (e.g., burn out, meaningfulness), job characteristics (e.g., work interruptions, time pressure) and individual resources (coping strategies) that are supposed to correlate with interactive work demand scales for nurses (IWDS-N), to determine the quantitative nature of their relations. The results show that the subscales of the IWDS-N have adverse effects on indicators of work-related well-being. Moreover, negative job characteristics, such as time pressure, are positively correlated with subscales of the IWDS-N and are therefore problem-focused coping strategies as an individual resource. The results emphasize that a multidimensional consideration of self-regulatory processes is useful to capture the subtle and complex nature of the interactive work demands of nurses. The current study is the first that developed a quantitative, multi-dimensional measure for interactive work demands, which can help make implicit demands in service work explicit.","Digutsch, Jan; Velana, Maria; Rinkenauer, Gerhard; Sobieraj, Sabrina",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360076/,203

Human coronaviruses (CoVs) are a major cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections with associated morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to characterize the epidemiology of CoVs in our tertiary care centre, and identify clinical correlates of disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was performed of 226 patients admitted with confirmed CoV respiratory tract infection between 2010 and 2016. Variables consistent with a severe disease burden were evaluated including symptoms, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. RESULTS: CoVs represented 11.3% of all positive respiratory virus samples and OC43 was the most commonly identified CoV. The majority of infections were community-associated while 21.6% were considered nosocomial. The average length of stay was 11.8 days with 17.3% of patients requiring ICU admission and an all-cause mortality of 7%. In a multivariate model, female gender and smoking were associated with increased likelihood of admission to ICU or death.

These coronaviruses are associated with novel respiratory syndromes that spread from person-to-person via close contact, resulting in high morbidity and mortality caused by the progression to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Areas covered: The risks of re-emergence of SARS-CoV from bat reservoir hosts, the persistence of MERS-CoV circulation, and the potential for future emergence of novel coronaviruses indicate antiviral drug discovery will require activity against multiple coronaviruses. In this review, approaches that antagonize viral nonstructural proteins, neutralize structural proteins, or modulate essential host elements of viral infection with varying levels of efficacy in models of highly pathogenic coronavirus disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Treatment of SARS and MERS in outbreak settings has focused on therapeutics with general antiviral activity and good safety profiles rather than efficacy data provided by cellular, rodent, or nonhuman primate models of highly pathogenic coronavirus infection. Based on lessons learned from SARS and MERS outbreaks, lack of drugs capable of pan-coronavirus antiviral activity increases the vulnerability of public health systems to a highly pathogenic coronavirus pandemic.","Totura, Allison L.; Bavari, Sina",Expert Opin Drug Discov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30849247/; https://doi.org/10.1080/17460441.2019.1581171,203

Encephalitis is an inflammatory condition of the brain that has been described as a severe neurological complication of COVID‐19. Despite a growing number of reported cases, encephalitis related to COVID‐19 infection has not been adequately characterised. To address this gap, this systematic review and meta‐analysis aims to describe the incidence, clinical course, and outcomes of patients who suffer from encephalitis as a complication of COVID‐19. METHODS: All studies published between 1 November 2019 and 24 October 2020 that reported on patients who developed encephalitis as a complication of COVID‐19 were included. Only cases with radiological and/or biochemical evidence of encephalitis were included. RESULTS: In this study, 610 studies were screened and 23 studies reporting findings from 129,008 patients, including 138 with encephalitis, were included. The average time from diagnosis of COVID‐19 to onset of encephalitis was 14.5 days (range = 10.8–18.2 days). The average incidence of encephalitis as a complication of COVID‐19 was 0.215% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.056%–0.441%). The average mortality rate of encephalitis in COVID‐19 patients was 13.4% (95% CI = 3.8%–25.9%). These patients also had deranged clinical parameters, including raised serum inflammatory markers and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although encephalitis is an uncommon complication of COVID‐19, when present, it results in significant morbidity and mortality. Severely ill COVID‐19 patients are at higher risk of suffering from encephalitis as a complication of the infection.","Siow, Isabel; Lee, Keng Siang; Zhang, John J.

In 2020, in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, Cameroon recorded a high cholera case fatality rate of 4.3% following epidemics noted in the South, Littoral and South-West regions. The Cameroon Ministry of Public Health, has thus organized a reactive vaccination campaign against cholera to address the high mortality rate in the affected health districts of those regions. The objective of this study was to describe the challenges, best practices and lessons learned drawing from daily experiences from this reactive vaccination campaign against cholera. METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional study drawn from the results of the campaign. We had a target population of 631,109 participants aged 1 year and above resident of the targeted health areas. RESULTS: the overall vaccination coverage was 64.4% with a refusal rate ranging from 0-10% according to health districts. Vaccination coverage was the lowest among people aged 20 years and above. The main challenge was difficulty maintaining physical distanciation, the main best practice was the screening of all actors taking part at the vaccination against COVID-19 and we found that emphasizing on thorough population sensitization through quarter heads and social mobilizers and adequately programming the campaign during a good climate season is crucial to achieving good vaccination coverage. CONCLUSION: lessons learned from this study could serve to inform various agencies in the event of planning rapid mass vaccination programs during pandemics.","Amani, Adidja; Fouda, André Arsène Bita; Nangmo, Armanda Jeanne; Bama, Solange Ngo; Tatang, Collins Asaah; Mbang, Marie Angèle; Douba, Emmanuel Christian Epee; Noula, Aimé Gilbert Mbonda; Dia, Mariette; Bouhenia, Malika",Pan Afr Med J,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2021.38.392.27754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381536/,203

The main objective of this study was to explore the health system preparedness for COVID-19 and its impacts on frontline health-care workers in Nepal. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 32 health-care workers who were involved in clinical care of COVID-19 patients and four policy-makers who were responsible for COVID-19 control and management at central and provincial level. Interviews were conducted through telephone or Internet-based tools such as Zoom and Skype. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into English, and coded using inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: Both health-care workers and policy-makers reported failure to initiate pre-emptive control measures at the early stages of the outbreak as the pivot in pandemic control. Although several measures were rolled out when cases started to appear, the overall health system preparedness was low. The poor governance, and coordination between three tiers of government was compounded by the inadequate personal protective equipment for health-care workers, insufficient isolation beds for patients, and poor engagement of the private sector. Frontline health-care workers experienced various degrees of stigma because of their profession and yet were able to maintain their motivation to continue serving patients. CONCLUSION: Preparedness for COVID-19 was affected by the poor coordination between three tiers of governance. Specifically, the lack of human resources, inadequate logistic chain management and laboratory facilities for testing COVID-19 appeared to have jeopardized the health system preparedness and escalated the pandemic in Nepal.

The mortality of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unacceptably high and new strategies are urgently needed to rapidly identify and treat patients at risk for organ failure. Clinical epidemiologic studies demonstrate that vulnerability to organ failure is greatest after viral clearance from the upper airway, which suggests that dysregulation of the host immune response is a critical mediator of clinical deterioration and death. Autopsy and pre-clinical evidence implicate aberrant complement activation in endothelial injury and organ failure. A potential therapeutic strategy warranting investigation is to inhibit complement, with case reports of successful treatment of COVID-19 with inhibitors of complement. However, this approach requires careful balance between the host protective and potential injurious effects of complement activation, and biomarkers to identify the optimal timing and candidates for therapy are lacking. Here we report the presence of complement activation products on circulating erythrocytes from hospitalized COVID-19 patients using flow cytometry. These findings suggest that novel erythrocyte-based diagnostics provide a method to identify patients with dysregulated complement activation.","Lam, L. M.; Murphy, S.

However, it remains a challenge and methods for identifying initial COVID-19 cases are urgently needed. Here, we used the results from a seroprevalence study in 50 US states to apply our Retrospective Methodology to Estimate Daily Infections from Deaths (REMEDID) with the aim of analyzing the initial stages and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections across the United States (US). Our retrospective data analysis revealed that the virus likely entered the country through California on December 28, 2019, which corresponds to 16 days before the officially recognized entry date established by the CDC. Thus, REMEDID provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 entered the U.S. earlier than previously reflected in official data. Collectively, our mathematical modeling more accurately estimates the initial COVID-19 cases in the US, may be extrapolated to other countries, and may be used to retrospectively track the progress of the pandemic.

It has been considered as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Positive pressure ventilation is a non-physiological and invasive intervention that can be lifesaving in COVID-19 patients. Similar to any other interventions, it can cause its own danger and complications as it can prompt ventilator-induced lung injury and barotrauma. The aim of the work was to identify the incidence of invasive mechanical ventilation complication in COVID-19 pneumonias, and to describe patient characteristics and patterns of barotrauma in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 103 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 76 males and 27 females are on invasive mechanical ventilation. Their mean age was 56.6, ranged from 21 to 85 years old. Barotraumas event type in the studied patients, (NB: one or multiple barotrauma events occurring on the same day were considered as single event (95/103 patients-92.23%), while separate multiple events (8/103 patients-7.77%) were recorded when occurring separated by at least 24 h). Single barotrauma events were subdivided into: one event (67/95 patients—70.53%), & multiple events (28/95 patients—29.47%). The mean interval between invasive mechanical ventilation and developing barotraumas was 3–7 days included 41 patients (39.98%). We revealed a strong prevalence of COVID-19 IMV complication with worsening prognosis and subsequent higher death rates in elderly smoker or obese males, as well as those suffering from ARDS. Past medical history (hypertension, DM, chronic renal or cardiac disease) or surgical history of CABG was more liable for these types of complications. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were more liable to the higher incidence of barotraumas with presence of predisposition and high risk factors. In general, an outstanding bad prognostic outcome and a significantly high mortality rate prevailed in COVID-19 patients associated with mechanically ventilated patients.","Ibrahim, Ghada Sobhy; Alkandari, Buthaina M.; Shady, Islam Ahmed Abo; Gupta, Vikash K.; Abdelmohsen, Mohsen Ahmed",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://doi.org/10.1186/s43055-021-00609-8,203

Critical care technologies used to support patients with ARDS, including strategies for mechanical ventilation, have resulted in improved outcomes in the last decade. However, there is still a need for effective pharmacotherapies to treat ARDS, as mortality rates remain high. To date, no single pharmacotherapy has proven effective in decreasing mortality in adult patients with ARDS, although exogenous surfactant replacement has been shown to reduce mortality in the paediatric population with ARDS from direct causes. Several promising therapies are currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of ARDS in its acute and subacute, exudative phases. These include exogenous surfactant therapy, β(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, antioxidants, immunomodulating agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Recent research has also focused on prevention of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress in patients at risk. Drugs such as captopril, rosiglitazone and incyclinide (COL-3), a tetracycline derivative, have shown promising results in animal models, but have not yet been tested clinically. Further research is needed to discover therapies to treat ARDS in its late, fibroproliferative phase. Given the vast number of negative clinical trials to date, it is unlikely that a single pharmacotherapy will effectively treat all patients with ARDS from differing causes. Future randomized controlled trials should target specific, more homogeneous subgroups of patients for single or combination therapy.","Bosma, Karen J.; Taneja, Ravi; Lewis, James F.",Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20568833/; https://doi.org/10.2165/10898570-000000000-00000,203
610362,GOOD NUTRITION CRITICAL TO PREVENT COVID 19 MORTALITY,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND: Identifying pregnancy episodes and accurately estimating their beginning and end dates are imperative for observational maternal vaccine safety studies using electronic health record (EHR) data. METHODS: We modified the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Pregnancy Episode Algorithm (PEA) to include both the International Classification of Disease, ninth revision (ICD-9 system) and ICD-10 diagnosis codes, incorporated additional gestational age data, and validated this enhanced algorithm with manual medical record review. We also developed the new Dynamic Pregnancy Algorithm (DPA) to identify pregnancy episodes in real time. RESULTS: Around 75% of the pregnancy episodes identified by the enhanced VSD PEA were live births, 12% were spontaneous abortions (SABs), 10% were induced abortions (IABs), and 0.4% were stillbirths (SBs). Gestational age was identified for 99% of live births, 89% of SBs, 69% of SABs, and 42% of IABs. Agreement between the PEA-assigned and abstractor-identified pregnancy outcome and outcome date was 100% for live births, but was lower for pregnancy losses. When gestational age was available in the medical record, the agreement was higher for live births (97%), but lower for pregnancy losses (75%). The DPA demonstrated strong concordance with the PEA and identified pregnancy episodes ⩾6 months prior to the outcome date for 89% of live births. CONCLUSION: The enhanced VSD PEA is a useful tool for identifying pregnancy episodes in EHR databases. The DPA improves the timeliness of pregnancy identification and can be used for near real-time maternal vaccine safety studies. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Improving identification of pregnancies in the Vaccine Safety Datalink electronic medical record databases to allow for better and faster monitoring of vaccination safety during pregnancy Introduction: It is important to monitor of the safety of vaccines after they have been approved and licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, especially among women vaccinated during pregnancy. The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) monitors vaccine safety through observational studies within large databases of electronic medical records. Since 2012, VSD researchers have used an algorithm called the Pregnancy Episode Algorithm (PEA) to identify the medical records of women who have been pregnant. Researchers then use these medical records to study whether receiving a particular vaccine is linked to any negative outcomes for the woman or her child. Methods: The goal of this study was to update and enhance the PEA to include the full set of medical record diagnostic codes [both from the older International Classification of Disease, ninth revision (ICD-9 system) and the newer ICD-10 system] and to incorporate additional sources of data about gestational age. To ensure the validity of the PEA following these enhancements, we manually reviewed medical records and compared the results with the algorithm. We also developed a new algorithm, the Dynamic Pregnancy Algorithm (DPA), to identify women earlier in pregnancy, allowing us to conduct more timely vaccine safety assessments. Results: The new version of the PEA identified 2,485,410 pregnancies in the VSD database. The enhanced algorithm more precisely estimated the beginning of pregnancies, especially those that did not result in live births, due to the new sources of gestational age data. Conclusion: Our new algorithm, the DPA, was successful at identifying pregnancies earlier in gestation than the PEA. The enhanced PEA and the new DPA will allow us to better evaluate the safety of current and future vaccinations administered during or around the time of pregnancy.","Naleway, Allison L.; Crane, Bradley; Irving, Stephanie A.; Bachman, Don; Vesco, Kimberly K.; Daley, Matthew F.; Getahun, Darios; Glenn, Sungching C.; Hambidge, Simon J.; Jackson, Lisa A.; Klein, Nicola P.; McCarthy, Natalie L.; McClure, David L.; Panagiotakopoulos, Lakshmi; Panozzo, Catherine A.; Vazquez-Benitez, Gabriela; Weintraub, Eric S.; Zerbo, Ousseny; Kharbanda, Elyse O.",Ther Adv Drug Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34178302/; https://doi.org/10.1177/20420986211021233,203
610406,Tracing open data in emergencies: the case of the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-06-19,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious infectious disease which first emerged in late 2002, caused by a then novel human coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The virus is believed to have originated from bats and transmitted to human through intermediate animals such as civet cats. The re-emergence of SARS-CoV remains a valid concern due to the continual persistence of zoonotic SARS-CoVs and SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) in bat reservoirs. In this study, the screening for the presence of SARS-specific T cells in a cohort of three SARS-recovered individuals at 9 and 11 years post-infection was carried out, and all memory T cell responses detected target the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Two CD8(+) T cell responses targeting the SARS-CoV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins were characterized by determining their HLA restriction and minimal T cell epitope regions. Furthermore, these responses were found to persist up to 11 years post-infection. An absence of cross-reactivity of these CD8(+) T cell responses against the newly-emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was also demonstrated. The knowledge of the persistence of SARS-specific celullar immunity targeting the viral structural proteins in SARS-recovered individuals is important in the design and development of SARS vaccines, which are currently unavailable.","Ng, Oi-Wing; Chia, Adeline; Tan, Anthony T.; Jadi, Ramesh S.; Leong, Hoe Nam; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tan, Yee-Joo",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.02.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26954467/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16002589; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X16002589,203

Online survey questions considered “before” and “during” confinement. Confinement reduced all PA intensities (η(p)(2) = 0.27–0.67, p < 0.001) and increased daily sitting time from 3.57 ± 1.47 to 6.32 ± 1.33 h per weekday (η(p)(2) = 0.67, p < 0.001). The largest reduction was detected for the sum parameter all physical activity (minutes per week, η(p)(2) = 0.67, p < 0.001; MET (metabolic equivalent of task)-minutes/week, η(p)(2) = 0.69, p < 0.001). Life satisfaction decreased, with the score for “I am satisfied with my life” (η(p)(2) = 0.76, p < 0.001) decreasing from 28.1 ± 4.81 to 14.2 ± 6.41 arbitrary units (AU). Concerning life satisfaction, the largest change was detected for the statement “the conditions of my life are excellent” (d(male) = 7.93). For all parameters, time effects were indicative of large negative effects in both genders. In terms of magnitude, the difference between gender was greatest for the parameter “the conditions of my life are excellent” (difference between groups, d = 4.84). In conclusion, COVID-19 confinement decreased PA, increased sitting time, and decreased life satisfaction in Qatar.

During development innate immunity is the first to become functional and is mediated primarily by phagocytic cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. In the olfactory sensory system, the same sensory neurons in contact with the external environment have their first synapse within the central nervous system. This unique architecture presents a potential gateway for the entry of damaging or infectious agents to the nervous system. Here we used zebrafish as a model system to examine the development of the olfactory organ and to determine whether it shares immune characteristics of a host defense niche described in other tissues. During early development, both neutrophils and macrophages appear coincident with the generation of the primitive immune cells. The appearance of neutrophils and macrophages in the olfactory organs occurs as the blood and lymphatic vascular system is forming in the same region. Making use of the neurogenic properties of the olfactory organ we show that damage to the olfactory sensory neurons in larval zebrafish triggers a rapid immune response by local and non-local neutrophils. In contrast, macrophages, although present in greater numbers, mount a slower response to damage. We anticipate our findings will open new avenues of research into the role of the olfactory-immune response during normal neurogenesis and damage-induced regeneration and contribute to our understanding of the formation of a potential host defense immune niche in the peripheral nervous system.","Palominos, M.

Previously, it was demonstrated that passive immunization by providing hyperimmune egg yolk through the feed reduces Campylobacter jejuni colonization in broilers. Campylobacteriosis is the most commonly reported bacterial foodborne zoonosis worldwide, and poultry products are the number one origin of these bacteria for human infection. To date, no effective control measures exist to limit Campylobacter colonization in the chicken's intestinal tract. Here, the effect of lyophilization of hyperimmune egg yolk on protection of broilers against C. jejuni was investigated. During an in vivo trial, broiler chickens were prophylactically given feed with lyophilized hyperimmune or non-immunized egg yolk powder starting from day 1 after hatch. At day 11, broilers were inoculated with C. jejuni according to a seeder model. Five days later, all broilers were euthanized and cecal content was examined for C. jejuni colonization. No decrease in C. jejuni colonization was found. The freeze-drying resulted in a 16-fold decrease of the antibody titer in the yolk powder compared to the fresh yolks, presumably caused by structural changes in the antibodies. In conclusion, applying freeze-dried hyperimmune egg yolk failed to protect broilers against C. jejuni colonization, possibly because lyophilization affected the antibodies' functionality.","Vandeputte, Jasmien; Martel, An; Antonissen, Gunther; Verlinden, Marc; De Zutter, Lieven; Heyndrickx, Marc; Haesebrouck, Freddy; Pasmans, Frank; Garmyn, An",Poult Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0032579119580555; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119580555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241501/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2019.11.054,203

The present study aimed to analyze the diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases using public health data, and to compare this pattern with seasonal viral infection trends. METHOD: Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data. RESULTS: In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin’s lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus.

Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort are among the most common GI symptoms reported. Diffuse Colitis Following COVID-19 Infection is a rare presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 52-year-old female presented with intensified abdominal pain following COVID-19 infection to the emergency department. She was diagnosed with peritonitis due to diffuse colitis and perforation of sigmoid colon. The patient was treated with total colectomy with an end ileostomy. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this study was to increase awareness among clinicians about the existence of this rare cause of abdominal pain after COVID-19 infection, diffuse colitis. Although uncommon, these presentations can potentially lead to delay in diagnosis among unfamiliar clinicians with GI presentation of COVID-19.

Seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor-binding domain antigens up to 149–270 days was 92.49% (90.17% IgG, 76.3% IgA, 60.69% IgM). In a subset of 64 health care workers who had not yet been vaccinated by April 2021, seropositivity was 96.88% (95.31% IgG, 82.81% IgA) up to 322–379 days post symptoms onset. Four suspected reinfections were detected by passive case detection, two among seronegative individuals (5 and 7 months after the first episode), and one low antibody responder. Antibody levels significantly correlated with fever, hospitalization, anosmia/hypogeusia, allergies, smoking, and occupation.

Adequate sedation, most commonly being achieved with remifentanil and dexmedetomidine, is integral to this procedure. This meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of these 2 sedatives. METHODS: We conducted electronic searches in Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, Springer, and Web of Science with no language restrictions. Studies comparing safety and efficacy between the sole use of remifentanil and dexmedetomidine among patients who underwent AFOI were included. Eight randomized controlled trials, comprising 412 patients, met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were first attempt intubation success rate and incidence of hypoxia. The secondary outcomes were the Ramsay Sedation Scale score at intubation, memory recall of endoscopy, and unstable hemodynamic parameters during intubation. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of hypoxemia during AFOI (risk ratio: 2.47; 95% confidence [CI]: 1.32–4.64]) compared with remifentanil; however, the first intubation success rates were equivalent (risk ratio: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.87–1.46]. No significant differences between the 2 sedatives were found for the Ramsay Sedation Scale score at intubation (mean difference: −0.14; 95% CI: −0.66–0.38) or unstable hemodynamic parameters during intubation (risk ratio: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59–1.17). Dexmedetomidine reduced memory recall of endoscopy (risk ratio: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.13–1.72). CONCLUSIONS: While both remifentanil and dexmedetomidine are effective for AFOI and well-tolerated, dexmedetomidine may be more effective in reducing the incidence of hypoxemia and memory recall of endoscopy.

IFN-λ proteins belong to the new type III IFN group. Type III IFN is structurally similar to type II IFN (IFN-γ) but functionally identical to type I IFN (IFN-α/β). However, in contrast to type I or type II IFNs, the response to type III IFN is highly cell-type specific. Only epithelial-like cells and to a lesser extent some immune cells respond to IFN-λ. This particular pattern of response is controlled by the differential expression of the IFN-λ receptor, which, in contrast to IFN-α, should result in limited side effects in patients. Recently, we and other groups have shown in several animal models a potent antitumor role of IFN-λ that will open a new challenging era for the current IFN therapy.","Lasfar, Ahmed; Abushahba, Walid; Balan, Murugabaskar; Cohen-Solal, Karine A.",Clin Dev Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22190970/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/349575,203

618107,Hematologic parameters in patients with COVID‐19 infection: a reply,2020-05-29,"In the article a virus transmission model is constructed on a simplified social network. The social network consists of more than 2 million nodes, each representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly distributed and undirected. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that at the end of the first epidemic wave, the infection was twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) and data assimilation approach to estimate the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty and to inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic, the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus biology, i.e. its reproduction number. In the controlled epidemic with low ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range forecasts. Virus transmission models with accurate social network models are thus essential for improving epidemics forecasting.","Zaplotnik, Žiga; Gavrić, Aleksandar; Medic, Luka",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853292/,203

The well-established quarantine measures for nonhuman primates and those that have re-emerged for rodents are very important. The increased use and exchange of genetically engineered mutant mice especially demands rodent quarantine capabilities for the majority of research institutions. Apart from species-specific housing requirements, it is important to consider pathogens to be contained in terms of the route of transmission, and degree of hazard to human and animal health. Animals obtained from commercial vendors, as opposed to other research institutions, may be less likely to harbor undesirable microorganisms, often allowing them to be exempt from a quarantine program. The ideal quarantine facility should be flexible enough to allow the use of multiple species, and take into account the number and frequency of shipments expected. The more shipments and different species involved, the more subdivided the facility should be, through the use of multiple rooms, cubicles, isolators, etc. At a minimum, ABSL2 design criteria should be used to enable the containment of pathogens at the room or cage level, while also preventing agent transmission via contaminated animal waste, fomites, and personnel.","Huerkamp, Michael J.; Pullium, Jennifer K.",Planning and Designing Research Animal Facilities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123695178000268; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123695178000268,203

Mental illness is expected to become the leading cause of disability worldwide by 2030. Yet, the last two decades have seen the pharmaceutical industry withdraw from psychiatric drug discovery after costly late-stage trial failures in which clinical efficacy predicted pre-clinically has not materialised, leading to a crisis in confidence in preclinical psychopharmacology. METHODS: Based on a review of the relevant literature, we formulated some principles for improving investment in translational neuroscience aimed at psychiatric drug discovery. RESULTS: We propose the following 8 principles that could be used, in various combinations, to enhance CNS drug discovery: (1) consider incorporating the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach; (2) engage the power of translational and systems neuroscience approaches; (3) use disease-relevant experimental perturbations; (4) identify molecular targets via genomic analysis and patient-derived pluripotent stem cells; (5) embrace holistic neuroscience: a partnership with psychoneuroimmunology; (6) use translational measures of neuronal activation; (7) validate the reproducibility of findings by independent collaboration; and (8) learn and reflect. We provide recent examples of promising animal-to-human translation of drug discovery projects and highlight some that present re-purposing opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that this review will re-awaken the pharma industry and mental health advocates to the opportunities for improving psychiatric pharmacotherapy and so restore confidence and justify re-investment in the field.","Tricklebank, Mark David; Robbins, Trevor W.; Simmons, Camilla; Wong, Erik H.

We systematically evaluated the risk of incident stroke among vegetarians (diets excluding meat, poultry, fish, and seafood) compared among nonvegetarians. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was performed until 20 May 2021. Prospective cohort studies comparing the risk estimates for incident stroke between vegetarians and nonvegetarians were included. Of 398 articles identified in the database search, data from seven cohort studies (408 total stroke cases in 29,705 vegetarians and 13,026 total stroke cases in 627,728 nonvegetarians) were included. The meta-analysis revealed no significant association between adhering to the vegetarian dietary patterns and the risk of incident stroke (HR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.67–1.11; I(2) = 68%, n = 7). Subgroup analyses suggested that studies conducted in Asia and those with a mean baseline age of participants 50–65 years showed a lower risk of stroke in vegetarians. Moreover, no significant association between vegetarian diets and the risk of ischemic stroke (HR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.22–1.42; I(2) = 82%, n = 3) or hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.19–3.09; I(2) = 85%, n = 2) was found.

The DöBra cards, a Swedish adaptation of the GoWish cards, were first used for advance care planning conversations in a participatory action research project and later, due to popular demand, made available for purchase by the general public. We explore how the DöBra cards were disseminated and used publicly, to understand their impact in the community. METHODS: We used Ripple Effects Mapping to follow three dissemination ripples, based on interviews with 20 participants, analyzed with directed content analysis. FINDINGS: Key factors influencing dissemination of the DöBra cards included ‘champions’ with a mandate within their context or organization, policy documents including use of the cards, media coverage, and presentations of the cards in various settings. The DöBra cards were adapted for use individually and in groups in different private, professional, and organizational settings. Perceived benefits of the cards included acting as an icebreaker in initiating end-of-life conversations and having preformulated statements to reflect upon. Other positive experiences included discussions on different interpretations of card statements, thus opening new perspectives regarding end-of-life. The DöBra cards functioned both as means to raise end-of-life issues in different contexts, and as an end in themselves, for example, by facilitating advance care planning conversations for those with serious disease. Impact also included personal development and strengthening of private and professional relationships, with potential to affect end-of-life care. CONCLUSION: The broad dissemination of the DöBra cards influenced capacity-building in dealing with end-of-life issues in communities, as the topic of dying and death was brought to agendas in new contexts.","Eneslätt, Malin; Helgesson, Gert; Tishelman, Carol",Palliat Care Soc Pract,https://doi.org/10.1177/26323524211032983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409297/,203

In obesity, skeletal muscle, the main tissue responsible for insulin‐mediated glucose uptake, exhibits dysregulation of insulin signaling, glucose uptake, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function, thus, promoting type 2 diabetes. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme family mediates lipid signaling and membrane remodeling and may play an important role in metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease. The PLA2 family consists of 16 members clustered in four groups. PLA2s hydrolyze the sn‐2 ester bond of phospholipids generating free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. Differential tissue and subcellular PLA2 expression patterns and the abundance of distinct fatty acyl groups in the target phospholipid determine the impact of individual family members on metabolic functions and, potentially, diseases. Here, we update the current knowledge of the role of the PLA2 family in skeletal muscle, with a view to their potential for therapeutic targeting in metabolic diseases.","Prunonosa Cervera, Iris; Gabriel, Brendan M.; Aldiss, Peter; Morton, Nicholas M.",Physiol Rep,https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33433056/,203

This disease is characterized by an excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix deposition that modify normal lung physiology. Up to date, there are not efficient therapeutic tools to fight IPF. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation plays an essential role in lung functions in normal and in pathological conditions. The aim of the present study was to study the possible beneficial effects of the administration of the GLP-1R agonist, liraglutide, in the pathogenesis of the fibrotic process in an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. We observed that liraglutide decreased mRNA expression of collagen, hydroxyproline and key enzymes for the synthesis of collagen. In addition, GLP-1R activation restored the ACE2 mRNA levels modulating the activities of the RAS components, increased the production of surfactant proteins (SFTPa1, SFTPb, SFTPc) and promoted an improvement in pulmonary and cardiac functionality, including a partial restoration of lung alveolar structure. Liraglutide effects are shown at both the pro-inflammatory and fibrosis phases of the experimental disease.

However, over the past 4 decades, results from well-done RCTs have repeatedly contradicted practices supported by common sense and clinical observation. Common sense and clinical observation fail for several reasons: incomplete understanding of pathophysiology, biases and unmeasured confounding in observational research, and failure to understand risks and benefits of treatments within complex systems. Concerns about traditional RCT models are legitimate, but randomization remains a critical tool to understand the causal relationship between treatments and outcomes. Instead, development and promulgation of tools to apply randomization to real-world data are needed to build the best evidence base in cardiovascular medicine.","Fanaroff, Alexander C.; Califf, Robert M.; Harrington, Robert A.; Granger, Christopher B.; McMurray, John J.V.; Patel, Manesh R.; Bhatt, Deepak L.; Windecker, Stephan; Hernandez, Adrian F.; Gibson, C.

Resulting disasters have the potential to wreak havoc on the economy, infrastructure, family unit, and human health. Global estimates project that children will be disproportionately impacted by the changing climate – shouldering 88% of the related burdens. Exposure to EWEs in childhood is traumatic, with ramifications for mental health specifically. Symptoms of posttraumatic stress, depression, and anxiety have all been associated with childhood EWE exposure and have the potential to persist under certain circumstances. Conversely, many childhood survivors of EWE also demonstrate resilience and experience only transient symptoms. While the majority of studies are focused on the effects resulting from one specific type of disaster (hurricanes), we have synthesized the literature across the various types of EWEs. We describe psychological symptoms and behavior, the potential for long‐term effects, and potential protective factors and risk factors. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Climate change‐related phenomena such as extreme weather events (EWEs) have the potential to impact mood and behavior in children. Posttraumatic stress (PTS) is the most common mental health consequence in child survivors of EWEs. PTS is often comorbid with depression and/or anxiety in this group.","Barkin, Jennifer L; Buoli, Massimiliano; Curry, Carolann Lee; von Esenwein, Silke A; Upadhyay, Saswati; Kearney, Maggie Bridges; Mach, Katharine",Dev Med Child Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720406/; https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14856,203

The present study considers its impact upon gambling behavior. Particularly, changes in self-reported gambling by Swiss, land-based casino players are examined. The main characteristics of respondents who played or did not play during lockdown are also investigated. This study is embedded in an ongoing longitudinal study that examines the gambling behavior of casino players at three points in time. All respondents who had participated in the first wave of the longitudinal study by the cut-off date (15th March 2020) were asked about their gambling behavior during lockdown in a supplementary online survey three weeks after the end of lockdown. A total of 55% of the 110 respondents reported having played during lockdown. Gambling intensity significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in our sample. Considering only those respondents (n = 66) who reported having gambled during lockdown, gambling intensity also decreased (p < 0.001), but online gambling significantly increased (p < 0.002). Those players who have increased their gambling activity require particular attention. It is important that casinos respond with appropriate player protection measures to those who have increased their gambling activity during the pandemic.","Lischer, Suzanne; Steffen, Angela; Schwarz, Jürg; Mathys, Jacqueline",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670652/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041973,203

We present here a young infant with an inborn error of immunity (IEI) who developed fatal adverse events to this live-attenuated vaccine. This male infant received BCG (Serum Institute of India Pvt., Ltd., India) on Day 11 of life. On Day 25, he developed fever, followed by cervical lymphadenitis and bilateral otitis media with fluid drainage. On Day 118, he was admitted with severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and passed away on Day 145. The diagnostic exome sequencing test identified a hemizygous nonsense variant, NM_000397.3(CYBB):c.676C>T, p.Arg226(*) (rs137854592). Pathogenic variants of CYBB [cytochrome b(-245), beta subunit; Mendelian Inheritance in Man [MIM] accession code, 300481] are known to cause “immunodeficiency 34, mycobacteriosis, X-linked” (IMD34, MIM#300645) and “chronic granulomatous disease, X-linked” (CGDX, MIM#306400). The natural history of his illness is consistent with “X-linked recessive Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD).” This entity is responsible for his BCG disease and is a likely trigger of his HLH. This disastrous event underlines the importance of developing worldwide policies that target BCG disease prevention, especially in communities with high prevalence of IEI. Moreover, screening for genetic causes of MSMD in the community could pave the way, at least partially, for scale-up of tuberculosis (TB) prevention.","Al-Hammadi, Suleiman; Yahya, Amal M.; Al-Amri, Abdulla; Shibli, Amar; Balhaj, Ghazala B.; Tawil, Mohamed I.; Vijayan, Ranjit; Souid, Abdul-Kader",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268280/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.687538,203

In general, students seemed to hold more with Heilbroner’s stance, which left room for compassion, while condemning Hardin’s harshness. Students were then asked to provide written responses stating whether they would personally sacrifice their eventual retirement in order to stop COVID-19 and the reasons for their views. Responses were analyzed and categorized to detect inconsistencies between students’ described views and their willingness to personally sacrifice for the sake of others. Almost 72% of respondents asserted that they would be willing to intervene to stop the novel coronavirus by sacrificing their retirement. A fair number of respondents that stated they would sacrifice (28.6%) said that they would do so because they would benefit personally from the avoidance of guilt and/or from the opportunity to feel good about themselves, suggesting that even seemingly selfless behaviors are sometimes driven by egoistic motivations. Forty percent of all respondents held inconsistent views.

624854,Home Monitoring of Cardiac Devices in the Era of COVID-19,2020-11-20,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an endemic disease of chickens and a major contributor to economic losses for the poultry industry despite vaccination. Recent observations indicated that chicks may have an immature immune system immediately after hatching when vaccinated for IBV. Therefore we hypothesized that early IBV vaccination will generate an immature, poorly protective IBV-specific immune response contributing to immune escape and persistence of IBV. To test this hypothesis the IBV-specific immune response and immune protection were measured in chicks vaccinated at different ages. This demonstrated a delayed production of IgG and IgA plasma antibodies in the 1, 7 and 14-day-old vaccination groups and also lower IgA antibody levels were observed in plasma of the 1-day-old group. Similar observations were made for antibodies in tears. In addition, IgG antibodies from the 1-day-old group had lower avidity indices than day 28 vaccinated birds. The delayed and/or lower antibody response combined with lower IgG avidity indices coincided with increased tracheal inflammation and depletion of tracheal epithelia cells and goblet cells upon IBV field strain challenge. The lack of vaccine-mediated protection was most pronounced in the 1-day-old vaccination group and to a lesser extent the 7-day-old group, while the 14-day-old and older chickens were protected. These data strongly support IBV vaccination after day 7 post hatch.","van Ginkel, Frederik W.; Padgett, Justin; Martinez-Romero, Gisela; Miller, Matthew S.; Joiner, Kellye S.; Gulley, Stephen L.",Vaccine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910920/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X1500479X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.04.026; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X1500479X,203

The emergence of drug-resistant M. tb has made control of TB more difficult. The selective optimization of side activities (SOSA) approach uses old drugs for new pharmacological targets. In the present study by using SOSA approach, we have successfully identified pyrvinium pamoate (PP) which is capable of inhibiting the growth of mycobacteria, including M. tb H37Rv, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), M. tb H37Ra, and drug-resistant M. tb clinical isolates in vitro from 1280 known drugs library. The MIC(99) of PP, the minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits more than 99% of M. tb H37Rv and the drug-resistant M. tb clinical isolates, ranges from 1.55 to 4.8 µg/mL. Importantly, PP could reduce the bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) in lung, spleen and liver tissues, and effectively inhibit inflammatory response in M. tb H37Rv, multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tb and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) M.tb-infected mice.

During this time of social distancing, limited in-person visits, and uncertainty, patients and donors are relying more than ever on telemedicine and web-based information. Several factors can influence patients’ understanding of web-based information, such as delivery modes (instruction, interaction, and assessment) and social-epistemological dimensions (choices in interactive knowledge building). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systemically evaluate the content, delivery modes, and social-epistemological dimensions of web-based information on COVID-19 and renal transplantation at time of the pandemic. METHODS: Multiple keyword combinations were used to retrieve websites on COVID-19 and renal transplantation using the search engines Google.com and Google.nl. From 14 different websites, 30 webpages were examined to determine their organizational sources, topics, delivery modes, and social-epistemological dimensions. RESULTS: The variety of topics and delivery modes was limited. A total of 13 different delivery modes were encountered, of which 8 (62%) were instructional and 5 (38%) were interactional; no assessment delivery modes were observed. No website offered all available delivery modes. The majority of delivery modes (8/13, 62%) focused on individual and passive learning, whereas group learning and active construction of knowledge were rarely encountered. CONCLUSIONS: By taking interactive knowledge transfer into account, the educational quality of eHealth for transplant care could increase, especially in times of crisis when rapid knowledge transfer is needed.","van Klaveren, Charlotte W; de Jong, Peter G M; Hendriks, Renée A; Luk, Franka; de Vries, Aiko P J; van der Boog, Paul J M; Reinders, Marlies E J",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946412/; https://doi.org/10.2196/22068,203

The effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system are now increasingly well understood. This article aims to review the current data on the effects of COVID-19 on the digestive system with particular emphasis on preexisting digestive diseases and its implications on nutrition practices. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence has shown that Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus affects the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas and hepatobiliary system resulting in different GI manifestations. Several preexisting digestive diseases have been investigated. These studies have revealed that these special patient population groups are generally not at an increased risk to contract COVID-19, but are susceptible to develop increasing severity of disease. Aside from medical therapy, optimizing nutritional care has a beneficial role in this group of patients. SUMMARY: GI manifestations of COVID-19 in addition to preexisting digestive diseases have an impact on patient's nutrition. Digestion, absorption and transport of nutrients may be impaired. To date, there are no existing guidelines on the nutritional management of patients for this particular at-risk group. Most nutrition practices are based only on observations and clinical experience.

Because of its relatively high transmissibility and mortality upon infection, probable SARS patients were quarantined and treated with special and intensive care. Therefore, instant and accurate laboratory confirmation of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection has become a worldwide interest. For this need, we purified recombinant proteins including the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and truncated forms of the spike protein (S1–S7) of SARS-CoV inEscherichia coli. The six proteins N, E, M, S2, S5, and S6 were used for Western blotting (WB) to detect various immunoglobulin classes in 90 serum samples from 54 probable SARS patients. The results indicated that N was recognized in most of the sera. In some cases, S6 could be recognized as early as 2 or 3 days after illness onset, while S5 was recognized at a later stage. Furthermore, the result of recombinant-protein-based WB showed a 90% agreement with that of the whole-virus-based immunofluorescence assay. Combining WB with existing RT-PCR, the laboratory confirmation for SARS-CoV infection was greatly enhanced by 24.1%, from 48.1% (RT-PCR alone) to 72.2%.

A paradigm presenting a spectrum related to airway bacteria, with associated degradation and inflammation products causing airway damage if untreated, entails protracted bacterial bronchitis (at the mild end) to irreversible airway dilatation with cystic formation as determined by HRCT (at the severe end of the spectrum). Increasing evidence suggests that progression of airway damage can be limited by intensive treatment, even in those predestined to have bronchiectasis (eg immune deficiency).

The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of HBoV, and other respiratory viral pathogens, in a 2‐year retrospective study of children admitted to hospital, and to investigate whether viral loads of HBoV DNA were associated with severity of infection. Between April 2007 and March 2009, 891 respiratory samples from 760 children admitted to hospital with acute respiratory tract infection were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses by real‐time PCR or direct immunofluorescence testing. HBoV DNA was detected by using internally controlled real‐time quantitative PCR assay and 25 samples selected at random were sequenced. The virus detected most frequently was rhinovirus, followed by respiratory syncytial virus, HBoV, and human metapneumovirus. HBoV DNA was detected in 18.4% of children admitted to hospital. HBoV was the only viral pathogen detected in 66/164 (40.2%) of HBoV DNA‐positive children and in 7.4% of all 891 samples. Ninety‐seven percent (64/66) of children with an HBoV single infection were diagnosed as having lower respiratory tract infection. Median HBoV DNA viral load was significantly higher in children when HBoV was detected as a single pathogen. Higher HBoV DNA viral loads were associated with prematurity and age. HBoV seems to be an important and frequent pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children, and it is likely that the severity of illness is comparable to the severity of RSV illness. J. Med.

The proposed model assumes that a single supplier faces full disruptions with a probability, and therefore, fails to procure all the items ordered. Accordingly, the buyer experiences unmet demand, which is assumed to be partially backordered. To make proper replenishment decisions, two base stock (S,T) periodic review optimization models are developed. The objective functions minimize the expected long-run total costs (i.e., ordering, holding, and shortage). After proving their convexity and obtaining the optimal decisions, computational experiments were carried out to investigate the impacts of the change in parameters. The results highlight the importance of selecting a suitable ratio for backorders during supply disruptions, as it leads to lower costs and reduces the inventory obsolescence and overstocking risks. Moreover, the managerial insights derived from this study aid retailers to make better replenishment decisions (in terms of level and frequency) and to be more resilient in times of disruptions. Retailers can benefit from the provided solution algorithm as a computational application.","Taleizadeh, Ata Allah; Tafakkori, Keivan; Thaichon, Park",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698920312996; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0969698920312996,203
628553,Impact of comorbidity burden on mortality in patients with COVID-19 using the Korean health insurance database,2021-03-18,"Introduction: With 5.3 million people living with dementia in India and the pandemic wreaking havoc, dementia care has faced unique challenges during the outbreak, with reduced healthcare access, travel restriction, long-term lockdown and fear of hospitalization. We explored the experiences and barriers faced by the physicians involved in dementia care during the lockdown period. Methods: A qualitative approach was used with purposive sampling. After an initial pilot, 148 physicians were included in the study. They were virtually interviewed in-depth based on a pre-designed semi-structured questionnaire, in areas related to tele-consultations, attributes related to dementia care, challenges faced and way forward. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analyzed using Nvivo-10 software. Triangulation, peer debriefing and respondent validation were used to ensure rigor. Results: The overarching categories that emerged were “Tele-medicine as the future of dementia care in India,” “people living with dementia being uniquely susceptible to the pandemic with a triple burden of: age, ageism and lack of autonomy” and “markedly reduced healthcare access in this population with significant mental health burden of caregivers.” The experiences of the physicians were categorized into their challenges during the lockdown period and perceptions related to specific facets of dementia care during the crisis. The general physicians expressed special “unmet needs” of dementia-specific training and specialist collaboration. Most of the participants perceived ambiguity related to the newly released telepsychiatry guidelines. Conclusion: Resource constraints and pandemic burden are currently high. This study looks at the “voices” of those actively providing dementia care during the ongoing crisis and to the best of our knowledge, is the first one from India to do so. Concurring with their experiences, PwD and their families are exposed to multiple vulnerabilities during COVID-19, need tailored care, especially at the primary healthcare level which includes general physicians. These relevant “voices” are discussed in light of the new tele-psychiatry guidelines and further optimization of dementia care in an aging India.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Vajawat, Bhavika; Varshney, Prateek; Rao, TS Sathyanarayana",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.615758; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33551877/,203

Moreover, due to the fact that the average age profile of agricultural workers in many parts of the world are on the higher side, fishery production will face the dilemma of shortage of labor, and aquaculture methods are in urgent need of change. Modern information technology has gradually penetrated into various fields of agriculture, and the concept of intelligent fish farm has also begun to take shape. The intelligent fish farm tries to deal with the precise work of increasing oxygen, optimizing feeding, reducing disease incidences, and accurately harvesting through the idea of “replacing human with machine,” so as to liberate the manpower completely and realize the green and sustainable aquaculture. This paper reviews the application of fishery intelligent equipment, IoT, edge computing, 5G, and artificial intelligence algorithms in modern aquaculture, and analyzes the existing problems and future development prospects. Meanwhile, based on different business requirements, the design frameworks for key functional modules in the construction of intelligent fish farm are proposed.","Wang, Cong; Li, Zhen; Wang, Tan; Xu, Xianbao; Zhang, Xiaoshuan; Li, Daoliang",Aquac Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10499-021-00773-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539102/,203

Human serum albumin (HSA) a common factor in COVID‐19 vulnerabilities. What advances does it highlight? Understanding of HSA capacity, and systemic vulnerabilities to COVID‐19. Raising HSA in COVID‐19 patients may alleviate systemic injury caused by diminished native HSA binding. A change in fluid therapy administration into the portal system of the liver is proposed to safely raise HSA levels. ABSTRACT: The specific nature of the vulnerabilities to COVID‐19 are an intrinsic part of COVID‐19 infection in many patients. This paper proposes that vulnerabilities to COVID‐19 may be intensified by a decrease in human serum albumin (HSA) as a ligand carrier for nutrients. A mechanism for COVID‐19 vulnerabilities is evident from consideration of ligand carriers such as HSA as intermediaries. We hypothesise that low levels of pool HSA binding, caused for whatever reason, affect the performance of albumin as a carrier protein reducing the availability of nutrients. Hypoalbuminaemia (low HSA) has been implicated as an indicator of COVID‐19 and long‐COVID‐19. The levels of HSA directly affect the immune system and vulnerabilities to age, diabetes and obesity in COVID‐19. Any slight reduction in available HSA has profound effects on ligand concentrations in the small capillaries where damage occurs in COVID‐19. The clinical implication is that attempts should be made to return HSA to clinical levels to compensate for the additional ligands caused by infection (SARS‐CoV‐2 virions, antibodies and cellular breakdown products). Therapeutic albumin is usually given peripherally, and usual preparations are unbound to ligands, but we suggest that a clinical trial of HSA therapy via the hepatic portal vein should be considered.","Johnson, Andrew S.; Winlow, William",Exp Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep089703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34275164/,203
630879,"Clinical, cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging findings in COVID-19 encephalopathy: a case series",2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: During the year 2020, the COVID - 19 pandemic spread from China to the rest of the world, leading the world to a widespread mandated quarantine or suggested social isolation. The impending uncertainty due to the pandemic must have led to a variety of widespread mental health maladies. There has been documentation in the literature about a lot of these in small populations of the world but limited studies and generated evidence from it has been conducted in India. The main objective of our study was to investigate the mental health effects of COVID-19 on the general population in India - both quantitatively and qualitatively. These results would help contribute to the knowledge gap recognized in the literature, given the unprecedented and novel nature of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Aim 1.1: We aim to qualitatively analyze the psychosocial and behavioral effects among the target population via online survey forms and present them in an easily readable way. Aim 1.1 will be accomplished by collecting the data via the use of the 'google forms' survey and using the same software to present data in the form of different kinds of charts such as bar, pie, etc. These will be included in the 'tables and charts' section of the research article. Aim 1.2: We aim to quantitatively analyze and determine the extent of these associations and their statistical significance. Aim 1.2 will be accomplished by using STATA software to analyze the demographic variables across with the data on the psychosocial and behavioral effects by using methods such as logistic regression, chi-square analysis, etc. depending on the kind of variables being analyzed. The results of this analysis will also be included in the 'analysis' section of the research article. METHODS: We designed and validated our own questionnaire and utilized the method of circulating it via WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a social media app very popularly used in India, and hence turned out to be an effective medium to gather pilot data. We analyzed the pilot data and used it to validate the questionnaire with the expertise of our mentor, Dr. Nilima Shah MD psychiatry. RESULTS: The study protocol was approved in September 2020 by the IRB at Vadilal Sarabhai General Hospital, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. We gathered pilot data of 545 subjects and used the results to determine the changes needed to the questionnaire, while simultaneously validating it. CONCLUSIONS: The following preliminary assumptions can be made about the study from the pilot data: the majority of the survey respondents were male (53%: 289/545), most of them were educated and employed as healthcare workers (36.5%: 199/545). The majority of the responders were self-employed (33.9%: 185), single (54.5%: 297/545), and stayed with their family for the lockdown, which helped psychologically. Findings specific to mental health have been elaborated in the manuscript below. It is evident from the data collected in the literature previously, that the pandemic had significantly detrimental effects on the mental health of a vast proportion of the Indian population.

Then I rank the coefficients measured by the inner product via the featured frequencies. The distances between these ranked vectors are evaluated by Manhattan metric. Afterwards, I associate each country with its nearest neighbor which shares the evolutive pattern via the distance matrix. Our research shows such patterns is are not random at all, i.e., the underlying pattern could be contributed to by some factors. In the end, I perform the typical cosine similarity on the time-series data. The comparison shows our mechanism differs from the typical one, but is also related to each it in some way.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic by systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: The PRISMA guideline was used for conducting this study. Related keywords were searched in credited resources including ISC, Magiran, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, ProQuest, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Embase to find the articles published on the prevalence of GAD among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic from the first of January to the end of June 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted by the random effects model. Results: In this study, 553 articles were initially identified, from which 19 studies were finally included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of GAD in health care workers based on the GAD-7 and GAD-2 instruments were 32.04% (95% CI: 26.89–37.19, I(2) = 98.2%, p < 0.001) and 22.62% (95% CI: 9.01–36.24, I(2) = 97.7%, p < 0.001). The overall prevalence of GAD was obtained 30.5% (95% CI: 25.58–35.42, I(2) = 98.4%, p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study showed a relatively high GAD prevalence, as one of the fundamental psychological problems, among health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Significant numbers of patients are being admitted to the hospital with severe illness, often in the setting of advanced age and underlying comorbidities. Therefore, palliative care is an important part of the response to this pandemic. The Seattle area and UW Medicine have been on the forefront of the pandemic in the U.S. Methods UW Medicine developed a strategy to implement a palliative care response for a multihospital health care system that incorporates conventional capacity, contingency capacity, and crisis capacity. The strategy was developed by our palliative care programs with input from the health care system leadership. Results In this publication, we share our multifaceted strategy to implement high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic that incorporates conventional, contingency, and crisis capacity and focuses on the areas of the hospital caring for the most patients: the emergency department, intensive care units, and acute care services. The strategy focuses on key content areas, including identifying and addressing goals of care, addressing moderate and severe symptoms, and supporting family members. Conclusion Strategy planning for delivery of high-quality palliative care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic represents an important area of need for our health care systems. We share our experiences of developing such a strategy to help other institutions conduct and adapt such strategies more quickly.","Fausto, James; Hirano, Lianne; Lam, Daniel; Mehta, Amisha; Mills, Blair; Owens, Darrell; Perry, Elizabeth; Curtis, J.

633080,Comments on: Retinal vein occlusion in COVID-19: A novel entity,2021-01-11,"This study examined whether an infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) potentiates respiratory signs upon exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Five-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated intratracheally with the Lelystad strain of PRRSV and received 5 days later one or two intratracheal LPS administrations. The necessary controls were included. After LPS administration, pigs were intensively monitored for clinical signs. Additionally, some pigs were euthanatized after a second LPS administration for broncho-alveolar cell analysis and virological examinations of the lungs. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were counted and differentiated. Lung suspensions and BAL fluids were titrated for PRRSV. Exposure of pigs to PRRSV only resulted in a fever for time periods ranging from 1 to 5 days and slight respiratory signs. Exposure of pigs to LPS only resulted in general signs, characterized by fever and depression, but respiratory signs were slight or absent. PRRSV–LPS exposed pigs, on the other hand, developed severe respiratory signs upon LPS exposure, characterized by tachypnoea, abdominal breathing and dyspnoea. Besides respiratory signs, these pigs also showed enhanced general signs, such as fever and depression. Lung neutrophil infiltration was similar in non-infected and PRRSV-infected pigs upon LPS exposure. PRRSV quantities were similar in lungs and BAL fluids of pigs infected with PRRSV only and PRRSV–LPS exposed pigs. These data show a clear synergism between PRRSV and LPS in the induction of respiratory signs in conventional pigs. The synergism was observed in 87% of the pigs. So, it can be considered as reproducible and may be used to test the efficacy of preventive and therapeutic measures.","Labarque, G; Van Reeth, K; Van Gucht, S; Nauwynck, H; Pensaert, M",Vet Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12119134/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113502001049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113502001049,203

We find that positive framing on the health side induces students to give greater relevance to the health dimension. The effect is sizeable and highly effective among many different audiences, especially females. Importantly, this triggers a higher level of intention to adhere to social distancing and precautionary behaviors.

The virus was passaged multiple times in embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs, and at different passage levels samples were tested for safety for the respiratory tract and kidneys in 1-day-old SPF chickens. There was a clear decrease in pathogenicity for the respiratory tract and kidneys when the virus had undergone a large number of passages. Passage level 80 was investigated for safety for the reproductive tract in 1-day-old and 7-day-old SPF chickens. In 1-day-old chickens, 12.5% of the vaccinated birds had macroscopic lesions. No lesions were observed if the chickens had been vaccinated at 7 days of age. Passage level 80 was investigated for its ability to spread from vaccinated to non-vaccinated chickens and for dissemination in the body. The virus was able to spread from vaccinated chickens to groups of non-vaccinated chickens, and in the vaccinated birds the virus was found frequently in oro-pharyngeal and cloacal swabs. A fragment of the hypervariable region of the S1 protein of passage level 80 was sequenced and revealed nucleotide changes resulting in two amino acid substitutions.

However, this has not been accompanied by a comprehensive evaluation of the target plasma and lung concentrations of these drugs following approved dosing in humans. Accordingly, EC(90) values recalculated from in vitro anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity data was expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) at an approved dose in humans (Cmax/EC(90) ratio). Only 14 of the 56 analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC(90) ratio above 1. A more in‐depth assessment demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (ritonavir‐boosted) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 activity across their entire approved dosing interval. An unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (K(p)U(lung)) was also simulated to derive a lung Cmax/EC(50) as a better indicator of potential human efficacy. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (ritonavir‐boosted), tipranavir (ritonavir‐boosted), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (ritonavir‐boosted) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10‐fold higher than their reported EC(50). Nitazoxanide and sulfadoxine also exceeded their reported EC(50) by 7.8‐ and 1.5‐fold in lung, respectively. This analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical testing, while deprioritising compounds unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral activity.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis were aimed to assess the pooled CFR of COVID-19. METHODS: Electronic databases: PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched to retrieve the eligible primary studies that reported CFR of COVID-19. Keywords: (“COVID-19”OR “COVID-2019” OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2”OR “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019nCoV” OR ((“Wuhan” AND (“coronavirus” OR “coronavirus”)) AND (2019/12[PDAT] OR 2020[PDAT]))) AND (“mortality “OR “mortality” OR (“case” AND “fatality” AND “rate”) OR “case fatality rate”) were used as free text and MeSH term in searching process. A random-effects model was used to estimate the CFR in this study. I(2) statistics, Cochran’s Q test, and T(2) were used to assess the functional heterogeneity between included studies. RESULTS: The overall pooled CFR of COVID 19 was 10.0%(95% CI: 8.0-11.0); P < 0.001; I(2) = 99.7). The pooled CFR of COVID-19 in general population was 1.0% (95% CI: 1.0-3.0); P < 0.001; I(2) = 94.3), while in hospitalized patients was 13.0% (95% CI: 9.0-17.0); P < 0.001, I(2) = 95.6). The pooled CFR in patients admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) was 37.0% (95% CI: 24.0-51.0); P < 0.001, I(2) = 97.8) and in patients older than 50 years was 19.0% (95% CI: 13.0-24.0); P < 0.001; I(2) = 99.8). CONCLUSION: The present review results highlighted the need for transparency in testing and reporting policies and denominators used in CFR estimation. It is also necessary to report the case’s age, sex, and the comorbidity distribution of all patients, which essential in comparing the CFR among different segments of the population.","ALIMOHAMADI, YOUSEF; TOLA, HABTEYES HAILU; ABBASI-GHAHRAMANLOO, ABBAS; JANANI, MAJID; SEPANDI, MOJTABA",J Prev Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2021.62.2.1627; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34604571/,203
636753,Antibody development after COVID-19 vaccination in patients with autoimmune diseases in the Netherlands: a substudy of data from two prospective cohort studies,2021-08-06,"Dengue has a negative impact in low- and lower middle-income countries, but also affects upper middle- and high-income countries. Despite the efforts at controlling this disease, it is unclear why dengue remains an issue in affluent countries. A better understanding of dengue epidemiology and its burden, and those of chikungunya virus and Zika virus which share vectors with dengue, is required to prevent the emergence of these diseases in high-income countries in the future. The purpose of this review was to assess the relative burden of dengue in four high-income countries and to appraise the similarities and differences in dengue transmission. We searched PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar using specific keywords for articles published up to 05 May 2016. We found that outbreaks rarely occur where only Aedes albopictus is present. The main similarities between countries uncovered by our review are the proximity to dengue-endemic countries, the presence of a competent mosquito vector, a largely nonimmune population, and a lack of citizens’ engagement in control of mosquito breeding. We identified important epidemiological and environmental issues including the increase of local transmission despite control efforts, population growth, difficulty locating larval sites, and increased human mobility from neighboring endemic countries. Budget cuts in health and lack of practical vaccines contribute to an increased risk. To be successful, dengue-control programs for high-income countries must consider the epidemiology of dengue in other countries and use this information to minimize virus importation, improve the control of the cryptic larval habitat, and engage the community in reducing vector breeding. Finally, the presence of a communicable disease center is critical for managing and reducing future disease risks.","Viennet, Elvina; Ritchie, Scott A.; Williams, Craig R.; Faddy, Helen M.; Harley, David",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0004943; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643596/,203

A longitudinal online survey was conducted in the State of Mexico, from 8 April to 27 May, 2020, in a sample of men and women between 18 and 60 years old, using: Impact of Event Scale-6, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disoder-7, and a questionnaire of concerns and behaviors related to COVID-19. Six hundred seventy participants were analyzed. Only a mild difference in distress was observed between the two waves and mild correlations of this variable with contagion in oneself and in a relative. Having a high-risk medical condition proved a considerable effect on distress within both waves. Perception of usefulness of preventive measures, concerns of contagion in a relative, and financial and security situations scored high within our questionnaire but did not change in the follow-up. We hypothesize that habituation to distressful events in the Mexican population (emergent resilience) might explain the absence of meaningful differences. Our research adds to the monitoring of mental health in Mexicans during the COVID-19 pandemic; its findings can serve to perform comparisons in other studies and for further meta-analyses.","Toledo-Fernández, Aldebarán; Betancourt-Ocampo, Diana; González-González, Alejandro",Behav Sci (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068274/; https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11050076,203

Clinical studies suggested that certain live vaccines, particularly the BCG vaccine, could reduce the mortality due to other diseases caused by non-targeted pathogens, most probably through the nonspecific effects (heterologous effects). By the end of May 2020, the available information on the COVID-19 pandemic indicated the great effect of the BCG vaccine in reducing the number of COVID-19 death cases. The occurrence of death due to COVID-19 was found to be 21-fold lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination policy than in countries without such a policy, based on the medians of COVID-19 death case per 1 million of the population in these two groups of countries (p<0.001, MannWhitney test). Therefore, it can be concluded that the early establishment of a BCG vaccination policy in any country is a key element in reducing the number of COVID-19 and tuberculosis death cases.","Jirjees, Feras J.; Dallal Bashi, Yahya H.; Al-Obaidi, Hala J.",Tuberc Respir Dis (Seoul),https://doi.org/10.4046/trd.2020.0063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883062/,203

Considering the unprecedented increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency internationally on 11(th) March 2020. However, existing drugs are insufficient in dealing with this contagious virus infection; therefore, a vaccine is exigent to curb this pandemic disease. In the present study, B- and T-cell immune epitopes were identified for RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) protein using immunoinformatic techniques, which is proved to be a rapid and efficient method to explore the candidate peptide vaccine. Subsequently, antigenicity and interactions with HLA (human leukocyte antigen) alleles were estimated. Further, physicochemical properties, allergenicity, toxicity, and stability of RdRp protein were evaluated to demonstrate the specificity of the epitope candidates. Interestingly, we identified a total of 36 B-cell and 16 T-cell epitopes using epitopes predictive tools. Among the predicted epitopes, 26 B-cell and 9 T-cell epitopes showed non-allergenic, non-toxic, and highly antigenic properties. Altogether, our study revealed that RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 (an epitope-based peptide fragment) can be a potentially good candidate for the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Yashvardhini, Niti; Kumar, Amit; Jha, Deepak Kumar",Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33936347/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6627141,203
639080,Informing patients that they are at high risk for serious complications of viral infection increases vaccination rates,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND: Considering its pandemicity and absence of effective treatment, authorities across the globe have designed various mitigation strategies to combat the spread of COVID-19. Although adherence towards preventive measures is the only means to tackle the virus, reluctance to do so has been reported to be a major problem everywhere. Thus, this study aimed to assess the community’s adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation strategies and its associated factors among Gondar City residents, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was employed among 635 respondents from April 20–27, 2020. Cluster sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Epi-Data version 4.6 and STATA version 14 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. Binary logistic regressions (Bivariable and multivariable) were performed to identify statistically significant variables. Adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI was used to declare statistically significant variables on the basis of p < 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of good adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation measures was 51.04% (95%CI: 47.11, 54.96). Female respondents [AOR: 2.39; 95%CI (1.66, 3.45)], receiving adequate information about COVID-19 [AOR: 1.58; 95%CI (1.03, 2.43)], and favorable attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures were significantly associated with good adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation measures. Whereas, those respondents who had high risk perception of COVID-19 were less likely to adhere towards COVID-19 mitigation measures [AOR: 0.61; 95% CI (0.41, 0.92)]. CONCLUSIONS: The findings have indicated that nearly half of the study participants had poor adherence towards COVID-19 mitigation measures. Sex, level of information exposure, attitude towards COVID-19 preventive measures, and risk perception of COVID-19 were factors which significantly influenced the adherence of the community towards COVID-19 mitigation measures. Therefore, it is crucial to track adherence responses towards the COVID-19 preventive measures, scale up the community’s awareness of COVID-19 prevention and mitigation strategies through appropriate information outlets, mainstream media, and rely on updating information from TV, radio, and health care workers about COVID-19.","Azene, Zelalem Nigussie; Merid, Mehari Woldemariam; Muluneh, Atalay Goshu; Geberu, Demiss Mulatu; Kassa, Getahun Molla; Yenit, Melaku Kindie; Tilahun, Sewbesew Yitayih; Gelaye, Kassahun Alemu; Mekonnen, Habtamu Sewunet; Azagew, Abere Woretaw; Wubneh, Chalachew Adugna; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Asmamaw, Nega Tezera; Agegnehu, Chilot Desta; Azale, Telake; Tamiru, Animut Tagele; Rade, Bayew Kelkay; Taye, Eden Bishaw; Taddese, Asefa Adimasu; Andualem, Zewudu; Dagne, Henok; Gashaye, Kiros Terefe; Kabito, Gebisa Guyasa; Mekonnen, Tesfaye Hambisa; Daba, Sintayehu; Azanaw, Jember; Adane, Tsegaye; Alemayeyu, Mekuriaw",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33378332/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244265,203

The aim is to check whether the relationships the model poses among the various observables are actually found in the data. The study case of the second through the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy is taken. Given its scale invariance, initially the model is tested with reference to the curve of swab-confirmed infectious individuals only. It is found to match the data, if the curve of the removed (that is healed or deceased) individuals is assumed underestimated by a factor of about 3 together with other related curves. Contextually, the generation time and the removal period, as well as the effective reproduction number, are obtained fitting the SIR equations to the data; the outcomes prove to be in good agreement with those of other works. Then, using knowledge of the proportion of Covid-19 transmissions likely occurring from individuals who didn’t develop symptoms, thus mainly undetected, an estimate of the real numbers of the epidemic is obtained, looking also in good agreement with results from other, completely different works. The line of this work is new, and the procedures, computationally really inexpensive, can be applied to any other national or regional case besides Italy’s study case here.","Lazzizzera, Ignazio",Eur Phys J Plus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377623/; https://doi.org/10.1140/epjp/s13360-021-01797-y,203

Detecting of inflammasome assembly in post-mortem COVID-19 lungs, we asked whether and how metformin inhibits inflammasome activation while exerting its anti-inflammatory effect. We show that metformin inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin (IL)-1β production in cultured and alveolar macrophages along with inflammasome-independent IL-6 secretion, thus attenuating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. By targeting electron transport chain complex 1 and independently of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or NF-κB, metformin blocked LPS-induced and ATP-dependent mitochondrial (mt) DNA synthesis and generation of oxidized mtDNA, an NLRP3 ligand. Myeloid-specific ablation of LPS-induced cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2), which is rate limiting for mtDNA synthesis, reduced ARDS severity without a direct effect on IL-6. Thus, inhibition of ATP and mtDNA synthesis is sufficient for ARDS amelioration.","Xian, Hongxu; Liu, Yuan; Rundberg Nilsson, Alexandra; Gatchalian, Raphaella; Crother, Timothy R.; Tourtellotte, Warren G.; Zhang, Yi; Aleman-Muench, German R.; Lewis, Gavin; Chen, Weixuan; Kang, Sarah; Luevanos, Melissa; Trudler, Dorit; Lipton, Stuart A.; Soroosh, Pejman; Teijaro, John; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Arditi, Moshe; Karin, Michael; Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa",Immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115964/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321002107; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321002107; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.05.004,203

Increasing evidence suggests a role for autophagy in inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. These studies suggest that modulating autophagy could be a novel therapeutic option for inflammatory diseases. Eosinophils are a major type of inflammatory cell that aggravates airway inflammatory diseases, particularly corticosteroid-resistant inflammation. The eosinophil count is a useful tool for assessing which patients may benefit from inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Recent studies demonstrate that autophagy plays a role in eosinophilic airway inflammatory diseases by promoting airway remodeling and loss of function. Genetic variant in the autophagy gene ATG5 is associated with asthma pathogenesis, and autophagy regulates apoptotic pathways in epithelial cells in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, autophagy dysfunction leads to severe inflammation, especially eosinophilic inflammation, in chronic rhinosinusitis. However, the mechanism underlying autophagy-mediated regulation of eosinophilic airway inflammation remains unclear. The aim of this review is to provide a general overview of the role of autophagy in eosinophilic airway inflammation. We also suggest that autophagy may be a new therapeutic target for airway inflammation, including that mediated by eosinophils.","Lee, Jinju; Kim, Hun Sik",Immune Netw,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30838160/; https://doi.org/10.4110/in.2019.19.e5,203

In contrast with prior efforts focusing on connections at a distance or online communities where the digital technology is the interface, we explore the design opportunities and role of technology for connectedness within a geographically local community context. We present findings from interviews with 22 older adults and a linked ideation workshop. Our analysis identified shared concerns and negative perceptions around local relationships, connections and characteristics of the geographical area. However, local connectedness through technology was largely absent from day-to-day life and even perceived as contributing to disconnection. By uncovering how older adults use and perceive technology in their social lives and combining these findings with their ideas for improving local connections, we highlight the need for thoughtful consideration of the role of technology in optimising social connections within communities. Our research highlights a need for design work to understand the specifics of the local context and reduce emphasis on technology as the interface between people. We introduce an amended definition—‘underpinned by a commitment to respect and social inclusion, an age-friendly community is engaged in a strategic and ongoing process to facilitate active ageing by optimising the community’s physical, social and digital environments and its supporting infrastructure’—to conceptualise our approach.

640913,Severe Thrombocytopenia in a Patient with COVID-19,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Migrant women are at increased risk for complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, possibly due to inadequate access and utilisation of healthcare. Recently migrated women are considered a vulnerable group who may experience challenges in adapting to a new country. We aimed to identify challenges and barriers recently migrated women face in accessing and utilising maternity healthcare services. METHODS: In the mixed-method MiPreg-study, we included recently migrated (≤ five years) pregnant women born in low- or middle-income countries and healthcare personnel. First, we conducted 20 in-depth interviews with migrant women at Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHC) and seven in-depth interviews with midwives working at either the hospital or the MCHCs in Oslo. Afterwards, we triangulated our findings with 401 face-to-face questionnaires post-partum at hospitals among migrant women. The data were thematically analysed by grouping codes after careful consideration and consensus between the researchers. RESULTS: Four main themes of challenges and barriers faced by the migrant women were identified: (1) Navigating the healthcare system, (2) Language, (3) Psychosocial and structural factors, and (4) Expectations of care. Within the four themes we identified a range of individual and structural challenges, such as limited knowledge about available healthcare services, unmet needs for interpreter use, limited social support and conflicting recommendations for pregnancy-related care. The majority of migrant women (83.6%) initiated antenatal care in the first trimester. Several of the challenges were associated with vulnerabilities not directly related to maternal health. CONCLUSION: A combination of individual, structural and institutional barriers hinder recently migrated women in achieving optimal maternal healthcare. Suggested strategies to address the challenges include improved provision of information about healthcare structure to migrant women, increased use of interpreter services, appropriate psychosocial support and strengthening diversity- and intercultural competence training among healthcare personnel.

641433,Testing the Sensitivity of Conjunctival Swabs from Confirmed COVID-19 Patients,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: The concept of “intersectionality” is increasingly employed within public health arenas, particularly in North America, and is often heralded as offering great potential to advance health inequalities research and action. Given persistently poor progress towards tackling health inequalities, and recent calls to reframe this agenda in the United Kingdom and Europe, the possible contribution of intersectionality deserves attention. Yet, no existing research has examined professional stakeholder understandings and perspectives on applying intersectionality to this field. METHODS: In this paper we seek to address that gap, drawing upon a consultation survey and face-to-face workshop (n = 23) undertaken in the United Kingdom. The survey included both researchers (n = 53) and policy and practice professionals (n = 20) with varied roles and levels of engagement in research and evaluation. Topics included familiarity with the term and concept “intersectionality”, relevance to health inequalities work, and issues shaping its uptake. Respondents were also asked to comment on two specific policy suggestions: intersectionally targeting and tailoring interventions, and evaluating the intersectional effects of policies. The workshop aims were to share examples of applying intersectionality within health inequalities research and practice; understand the views of research and practice colleagues on potential contributions and challenges; and identify potential ways to promote intersectional approaches. RESULTS: Findings indicated a generally positive response to the concept and a cautiously optimistic assessment that intersectional approaches could be valuable. However, opinions were mixed and various challenges were raised, especially around whether intersectionality research is necessarily critical and transformative and, accordingly, how it should be operationalized methodologically. Nonetheless, there was general agreement that intersectionality is concerned with diverse inequalities and the systems of power that shape them. CONCLUSIONS: We position intersectionality within the wider context of health inequalities policy and practice, suggesting potential ways forward for the approach in the context of the United Kingdom. The views of policy and practice professionals suggest that intersectionality has far to travel to help counter individualistic narratives and to encourage an approach that is sensitive to subgroup inequalities and the processes that generate them. Examples of promising practice, albeit mostly in North America, suggest that it is possible for intersectionality to gain traction.

In order to better understand the overall situation, the molecular epidemiology, and factors that might influence the most variable disease impact; 40 samples from swine feces were collected from different PED outbreaks in Germany and other European countries and sequenced by shot-gun next-generation sequencing. A total of 38 new PEDV complete coding sequences were generated. When compared on a global scale, all investigated sequences from Central and South-Eastern Europe formed a rather homogeneous PEDV S INDEL cluster, suggesting a recent re-introduction. However, in-detail analyses revealed two new clusters and putative ancestor strains. Based on the available background data, correlations between clusters and location, farm type or clinical presentation could not be established. Additionally, the impact of secondary infections was explored using the metagenomic data sets. While several coinfections were observed, no correlation was found with disease courses. However, in addition to the PEDV genomes, ten complete viral coding sequences from nine different data sets were reconstructed each representing new virus strains.

Computational docking experiments supported the biological data observed and this preliminary study provides useful data for further development of tricyclic acyclic nucleoside derivatives with improved lipophilicity and retention of activity in HSV-1 TK deficient strains. Also, the new tricyclic derivatives were evaluated against a broad range of other DNA and RNA viruses, but were found to be inactive at subtoxic concentrations. In addition, weak to moderate cytostatic effect was observed for the new compounds.","Mohammed, Anber F.; Andrei, Graciela; Hayallah, Alaa M.; Abdel-Moty, Samia G.; Snoeck, Robert; Simons, Claire",Bioorg Med Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738653/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096808961832087X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.02.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S096808961832087X,203
642393,Clinical features of COVID-19 and influenza: A comparative study on Nord Franche-Comte cluster,2020-06-16,"The first step in influenza virus infection is the binding of hemagglutinin to sialic acid-containing glycans present on the cell surface. Over 50 different sialic acid modifications are known, of which N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) are the two main species. Animal models with α2,6 linked Neu5Ac in the upper respiratory tract, similar to humans, are preferred to enable and mimic infection with unadapted human influenza A viruses. Animal models that are currently most often used to study human influenza are mice and ferrets. Additionally, guinea pigs, cotton rats, Syrian hamsters, tree shrews, domestic swine, and non-human primates (macaques and marmosets) are discussed. The presence of NeuGc and the distribution of sialic acid linkages in the most commonly used models is summarized and experimentally determined. We also evaluated the role of Neu5Gc in infection using Neu5Gc binding viruses and cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH)(−/−) knockout mice, which lack Neu5Gc and concluded that Neu5Gc is unlikely to be a decoy receptor. This article provides a base for choosing an appropriate animal model. Although mice are one of the most favored models, they are hardly naturally susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses, possibly because they express mainly α2,3 linked sialic acids with both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc modifications. We suggest using ferrets, which resemble humans closely in the sialic acid content, both in the linkages and the lack of Neu5Gc, lung organization, susceptibility, and disease pathogenesis.","Spruit, Cindy M.; Nemanichvili, Nikoloz; Okamatsu, Masatoshi; Takematsu, Hiromu; Boons, Geert-Jan; de Vries, Robert P.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34062844/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050815,203

While policymakers have attempted to balance the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, decentralized decision-making, deep uncertainty, and the lack of widespread use of comprehensive decision support methods can lead to the choice of fragile or inefficient strategies. This paper uses simulation models and the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach to stress-test California's reopening strategy and other alternatives over a wide range of futures. We find that plans which respond aggressively to initial outbreaks are required to robustly control the pandemic. Further, the best plans adapt to changing circumstances, lowering their stringent requirements to reopen over time or as more constituents are vaccinated. While we use California as an example, our results are particularly relevant for jurisdictions where vaccination roll-out has been slower.","Nascimento de Lima, P.; Lempert, R.; Vardavas, R.; Baker, L.; Ringel, J.; Rutter, C.

Due to the high transmission of this disease, rate precautions have been implemented, such as the use of masks by the population, personal protective equipment (PPE), and safety protocols, mainly to health workers. Thus, we performed a patent review to evaluate the current patents related to the protective mask. The review was carried out in the patent database in the period of May 2019 to May 2020. After the process of screening and eligibility, 563 patents were selected for our analysis according to the aim of the study which used masks such as a PPE against dust particles and pathogens, mostly when it is about airborne transmission, such as viruses and bacteria. Here, an overview of the main materials used in the mask manufacturing and their efficiency was described. The results of the review showed that most of the masks used cotton, nylon, silver fiber fabrics, among others as fabrics to develop the masks. It also makes an analysis of masks composed of nanotechnology which provide high filtration efficiency. Moreover, the review also brought possibilities of masking the population, which already have been done in countries such as China and Korea and ways of sterilization for reuse of PPE during COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, this review can further researchers in the developing of masks to decrease the spread of a pandemic disease.

No safe and efficacious vaccines against ASFV are available, which threats the swine industry worldwide. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex dsDNA virus that displays multiple mechanisms to counteract the host innate immune response, whose efficacy might determine the different degrees of virulence displayed by attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here we report that infection with both virulent Arm/07/CBM/c2 and attenuated NH/P68 strains prevents interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in interferon (IFN)-treated cells by counteracting the JAK/STAT pathway. This inhibition results in an impaired nuclear translocation of the interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, as well as in the proteasome-dependent STAT2 degradation and caspase 3-dependent STAT1 cleavage. The existence of two independent mechanisms of control of the JAK/STAT pathway, suggests the importance of preventing this pathway for successful viral replication. As ASFV virulence is likely associated with the efficacy of the IFN signaling inhibitory mechanisms, a better understanding of these IFN antagonistic properties may lead to new strategies to control this devastating pig disease.","Riera, Elena; Pérez-Núñez, Daniel; García-Belmonte, Raquel; Miorin, Lisa; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Revilla, Yolanda",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512601/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.722952,203

The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an in-clinic rapid test in the detection of CPV infection in dogs. To this end, we compared the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking(®)) to PCR, which is considered as the most reliable diagnostic method. A total of 78 duplicated faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic dogs. Vaccination history within a month prior to the onset of diarrhoea was reported for 12 of the sampled dogs. The rapid diagnostic test was performed in 23 of the faecal samples directly, while the rest were placed into a sterile cotton tipped swab suitable for collection and transportation of viruses (Sigma Σ-VCM(®)) and stored at −20 °C. The sensitivity of the Quicking rapid diagnostic test compared to PCR in the total number of samples, in samples from non-vaccinated dogs and in samples tested directly after collection were 22.22% (95% CI: 13.27–33.57%), 26.67% (95% CI: 16.08–39.66%) and 76.47% (95% CI: 50.10–93.04%) respectively, while the specificity of the test was 100% in any case. In conclusion, negative results do not exclude parvoenteritis from the differential diagnosis, especially in dogs with early vaccination history, but a positive result almost certainly indicates CPV infection. An improved sensitivity may be expected when the test is performed immediately.","Kantere, Maria C.; Athanasiou, Labrini V.; Spyrou, Vassiliki; Kyriakis, Constantinos S.; Kontos, Vassilios; Chatzopoulos, Dimitrios C.; Tsokana, Constantina N.; Billinis, Charalambos",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.02.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093415000348; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093415000348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25707551/,203

The nucleic acid used in the experiments was targeted against GAG-1 gene from the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1. By binding to the outer leaflet of the membrane, carbosilane dendrimers decreased the fluidity of the hydrophilic part of the membrane but increased the fluidity of the hydrophobic interior. They induced hemolysis, but did not change the morphology of the cells. Increasing concentrations of dendrimers induced erythrocyte aggregation.

Interaction of this molecule with its ligand transmits a two‐way signal that activates both T lymphocyte and antigen presenting cells. The soluble form of CD137 (sCD137) reduces the activity of its membrane isoform and is associated with T lymphocyte activation‐induced cell death. Recombinant CD137‐Fc may be used to treat cancers, autoimmune disorders and viral infections. It may also be useful for management of coronavirus infection. The 1276 bp DNA sequence encoded CD137‐Fc recombinant protein was prepared and subcloned into lentiviral vector and expressed in transduced CHO‐K1 eukaryotic cells. The sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot analysis, and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay analysis results demonstrated that the expression of the 70‐kDa CD137‐Fc molecule was detectable without any degradation. This study helps to confirm previous research suggesting the use of this recombinant protein as a promising solution for the treatment of virus infections. CD137‐Fc fusion protein could also make immunotherapy more effective for some diseases.

To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently, we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel process. Results: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the ‘TKF91’ model). The algorithm converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing to the algorithm's close similarity to the Baum–Welch algorithm for training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an ‘unsupervised’ fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates.

A severe, symptomatic COVID-19 infection in close-to-term pregnancies can have a poor prognosis. Early identification of COVID-19 in pregnant women can prevent the progression of the disease. Currently, there is very little guidance on treating pregnant close-to-term women with COVID-19; this case report suggests changes to current management to maximize positive maternal and fetal outcomes. CASE REPORT: A pregnant woman (37 weeks of gestation) presented to the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of fever with an associated cough for 2 days. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Emergency Department, and discharged in a stable condition. She returned 5 days later in preterm labor with severe respiratory distress. After an emergency cesarean section, she remained intubated in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit; she was persistently hypotensive and hypoxic despite maximal ventilator and medical treatment. She died after a cardiac arrest and unsuccessful resuscitation, 15 days after the delivery. We discuss the possible benefit of a planned C-section for close-to-term pregnancies prior to the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The patient’s next of kin gave informed consent for this case report. Approval from the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Review Board was not required as this is a case report. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, asymptomatic pregnant women are not tested for COVID-19 infection until hospitalization for delivery. It could be beneficial to have a protocol in place to screen asymptomatic pregnant women so they can be identified early and monitored, as COVID-19 symptoms can escalate quickly.","Patel, Priya; Kulkarni, Sayali; Guerrero, Manrique; Persaud, Clive; Zuberi, Jamshed; Rebein, Benjamin",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33339814/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926591,203

Liver dysfunction and elevated liver enzymes were observed in about 53% of COVID-19 patients. AIM: To gain insight into transcriptional abnormalities in liver tissue of severe COVID-19 patients that may result in liver dysfunction. METHODS: The transcriptome of liver autopsy samples from severe COVID-19 patients against those of non-COVID donors was analyzed. Differentially expressed genes were identified from normalized RNA-seq data and analyzed for the enrichment of functional clusters and pathways. The differentially expressed genes were then compared against the genetic signatures of liver diseases including cirrhosis, fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and hepatitis A/B/C. Gene expression of some differentially expressed genes was assessed in the blood samples of severe COVID-19 patients with liver dysfunction using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Analysis of the differential transcriptome of the liver tissue of severe COVID-19 patients revealed a significant upregulation of transcripts implicated in tissue remodeling including G-coupled protein receptors family genes, DNAJB1, IGF2, EGFR, and HDGF. Concordantly, the differential transcriptome of severe COVID-19 liver tissues substantially overlapped with the disease signature of liver diseases characterized with pathological tissue remodeling (liver cirrhosis, Fibrosis, NAFLD, and hepatitis A/B/C). Moreover, we observed a significant suppression of transcripts implicated in metabolic pathways as well as mitochondrial function, including cytochrome P450 family members, ACAD11, CIDEB, GNMT, and GPAM. Consequently, drug and xenobiotics metabolism pathways are significantly suppressed suggesting a decrease in liver detoxification capacity. In correspondence with the RNA-seq data analysis, we observed a significant upregulation of DNAJB1 and HSP90AB1 as well as significant downregulation of CYP39A1 in the blood plasma of severe COVID-19 patients with liver dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Severe COVID-19 patients appear to experience significant transcriptional shift that may ensue tissue remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction and lower hepatic detoxification resulting in the clinically observed liver dysfunction.","Hammoudeh, Sarah Musa; Hammoudeh, Arabella Musa; Bhamidimarri, Poorna Manasa; Mahboub, Bassam; Halwani, Rabih; Hamid, Qutayba; Rahmani, Mohamed; Hamoudi, Rifat",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135558/; https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v27.i21.2850,203

The primary causal agent is Clostridium perfringens type C. The β-toxin plays a decisive role in the pathogenesis of this disease. A toxoid vaccine for use in sows has been developed and studied in field trials. The European Pharmacopoeia Monograph on vaccines for use in animals lays down a method of the efficacy testing based on the immunization of rabbits, the collection of pooled sera and the subsequent assay of anti-toxin antibodies in mice using an appropriate test toxin. The vaccine is regarded as effective if it induces a minimum of 10 IU of β-anti-toxin per ml of rabbit serum. We have established a range of 17.14–98.23 IU β-anti-toxin per ml rabbit serum induced by a sample of C. perfringens toxoid vaccine. The vaccine has been used under field conditions in different rearing units at the same time, mostly in the form of emergency vaccinations following the outbreak of disease. The outcome of vaccination was evaluated by recording the total numbers of piglets born alive and the piglet losses. Use of the vaccine, coupled with other measures, resulted in an approximately 30% reduction in the number of losses.","Springer, S; Selbitz, H.-J",FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928824499000504; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928824499000504,203

Asymptomatic COVID-19 infections have been described, and the aim of this systematic review was to summarise their presentation forms. METHODS: We searched PubMed® and Google® (1 December 2019 to 29 March 2020) and extracted age, laboratory findings, and computed tomography (CT) scans. Pooled incidence rates of clinical characteristics were analyzed using random-effect models. RESULTS: In total, 506 patients from 34 studies (68 single cases and 438 from case-series) with an asymptomatic course were identified. Patients with normal radiology were younger (19.59 ± 17.17 years) than patients with abnormal radiology (39.14 ± 26.70 years) (p-value = 0.013). Despite being asymptomatic, CT investigations revealed abnormalities in 62.2% of the cases; ground-glass opacities were most frequently observed (43.09% by meta-analysis). Most studies reported normal laboratory findings (61.74% by meta-analysis). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients without any symptoms present with CT abnormalities.

651540,Don’t close the book on tocilizumab for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia–the jury is still out: The Kuwait experience,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases. METHODS: and findings: We analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Our data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r(2) = 0.92, p = 0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r(2) = 0.98, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.","Lau, Hien; Khosrawipour, Veria; Kocbach, Piotr; Mikolajczyk, Agata; Ichii, Hirohito; Zacharski, Maciej; Bania, Jacek; Khosrawipour, Tanja",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300864?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32299783/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118220300864,203
651784,COVID-19 Diagnosis in Case of Two Negative Nasopharyngeal Swabs: Association between Chest CT and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Results,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease is a life-threatening illness that can cause sequelae such as neurological impairment, hearing loss, seizures, limb amputations, and scarring. Adolescents and young adults are at highest risk for contracting this disease which comes with a case-fatality ratio of 10–15%. Common serogroups in the United States are B, C, W, and Y, which are covered by two separate vaccines administered in a two-dose series. While MenACWY is routinely administered, the booster dose is often missed. Only 21.8% of teens reported receiving the MenB vaccine. While it is not currently part of routine care, recent outbreaks have been caused by serogroup B, prompting the need for increased vaccination rates. METHODS: MenACWY and MenB vaccination rates and demographic information were collected for 16–19-year-old patients in a pediatric clinic. Interventions including staff education, call logs, EMR communications to parents/guardians, and careful chart review were employed. RESULTS: At the time of baseline MenACWY data collection, there were N = 333 subjects between 16 and 19 years of age and N = 335 subjects between 16 and 19 years of age provided for MenB data. Upon completion, there were N = 319 subjects. Comparison of pre- and post-intervention data demonstrated a statistically significant increase in MenACWY series completion from 67.3 to 76.2% (p = 0.035) and a non-statistically significant increase in MenB completion from 6.9 to 10.3% (p = 0.197). CONCLUSIONS: There was a statistically significant improvement in MenACWY but not MenB vaccination rates, indicating a need for more effective measures in addressing low MenB coverage.","Podraza, Lindsay; Vasudevan, Jayan; Hudson, Cathy; Jayan, Anjali; Varman, Meera",J Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-021-01023-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34389892/,203

An Updated Review",2021-04-28,"Tracking the dynamics and spread of COVID-19 is critical to mounting an effective response to the pandemic. In the absence of randomized representative serological surveys, many SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance studies have relied on convenience sampling to estimate cumulative incidence. One common approach is to recruit at frequently visited community locations (“venue-based” sampling), but the sources of bias and uncertainty associated with this strategy are still poorly understood. Here, we used data from a venue-based community serosurveillance study, GPS-estimated foot traffic data, and data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to report an estimate of cumulative incidence in Somerville, Massachusetts, and a methodological strategy to quantify and reduce uncertainty in serology-based cumulative incidence estimates obtained via convenience sampling. The mismatch between the geographic distribution of participants’ home locations (the “participant catchment distribution”) and the geographic distribution of infections is an important determinant of uncertainty in venue-based and other convenience sampling strategies. We found that uncertainty in cumulative incidence estimates can vary by a factor of two depending how well the participant catchment distribution matches the known or expected geographic distribution of prior infections. GPS-estimated business foot traffic data provides an important proxy measure for the participant catchment area and can be used to select venue locations that minimize uncertainty in cumulative incidence.","Brown, Tyler S.; de Salazar Munoz, Pablo Martinez; Bhatia, Abhishek; Bunda, Bridget; Williams, Ellen K.; Bor, David; Miller, James S.; Mohareb, Amir; Naranbai, Vivek; Beltran, Wilfredo Garcia; Miller, Tyler E.; Thierauf, Julia; Yang, Wenxin; Kress, Doug; Stelljes, Kristen; Johnson, Keith; Larremore, Daniel B.; Lennerz, Jochen; Iafrate, A.

652677,"COVID‐19: Thrombosis, thromboinflammation, and anticoagulation considerations",2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a major healthcare threat. Apparently, the novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) is armed by special abilities to spread and dysregulate the immune mechanisms. The likelihood of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) development in COVID‐19 patients with a list of attributable risk factors for oral infections has not yet been investigated. OBJECTIVES: We here aim to investigate the prevalence, causative agents, and antifungal susceptibility pattern of OPC in Iranian COVID‐19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients with OPC were studied. Relevant clinical data were mined. Strain identification was performed by 21‐plex PCR and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1‐5.8S‐ITS2). Antifungal susceptibility testing to fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin was performed according to the CLSI broth dilution method. RESULTS: In 53 COVID‐19 patients with OPC, cardiovascular diseases (52.83 %), and diabetes (37.7 %) were the principal underlying conditions. The most common risk factor was lymphopenia (71%). In total, 65 Candida isolates causing OPC were recovered. C. albicans (70.7%) was the most common, followed by C. glabrata (10.7%), C. dubliniensis (9.2%), C. parapsilosis sensu stricto (4.6%), C. tropicalis (3%), and Pichia kudriavzevii (=C. krusei, 1.5%). Majority of the Candida isolates were susceptible to all three classes of antifungal drugs. CONCLUSION: Our data clarified some concerns regarding the occurrence of OPC in Iranian COVID‐19 patients.

653011,CT radiomic models to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other interstitial pneumonias,2021-05-27,"Automatic diagnosis of coronavirus (COVID-19) is studied in this research. Deep learning methods especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great success in COVID-19 diagnosis in recent works. But they are efficient when the depth of network is high enough. However, the use of a deep network requires a sufficiently large training set, which is not available in practice. From the other hand, the use of a shallow CNN may not provide superior results because it is not able to rich feature extraction due to lacking enough convolutional layers. To deal with this difficulty, the contextual features reduced by convolutional filters (CFRCF) is proposed in this work. CFRCF extracts shape and textural features as contextual feature maps from the chest X-ray radiographs and abdominal computed tomography (CT) images. Morphological operators, Gabor filter banks and attribute filters are used for contextual feature extraction. Then, two convolutional filters are applied to the contextual feature cube to extract the nonlinear sub-features and hidden relationships among the contextual features. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to produce a reduced feature vector which is fed to a classifier. Support vector machine and random forest are used as classifier. The experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method from the recognition accuracy and running time point of view using limited training samples. More than 76% and 94% overall classification accuracy is obtained by the proposed method in CT scan and X-ray images datasets, respectively.","Imani, Maryam",Biomed Signal Process Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824681/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1746809421001993; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102602; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809421001993?v=s5,203
653098,Letter to the Editors: COVID‐19‐Related Liver Injury: The Interpretation for Aspartate Aminotransferase Needs to Be Cautious,2020-08-07,"Background People with severe mental ill health (SMI) experience a mortality gap of 15-20 years. COVID-19 has amplified population health inequalities, and there is concern that people with SMI will be disproportionately affected. Understanding how health risk behaviours have changed during the pandemic is important when developing strategies to mitigate future increases in health inequalities. Methods We sampled from an existing cohort of people with SMI. Researchers contacted participants by phone or post to invite them to take part in a survey about how the pandemic had affected them. We asked people about their health risk behaviours and how these had changed during the pandemic. We created an index of changed behaviours, comprising dietary factors, smoking, lack of exercise, and drinking patterns. By creating data linkages, we compared their responses during pandemic restrictions to responses they gave prior to the pandemic. Outcomes 367 people provided health risk data. 47.5% of participants reported taking less physical activity during the pandemic and of those who smoke 54.5% reported smoking more heavily. Self-reported deterioration in physical health and younger age were significantly associated with an increase in health risk behaviours (adjusted OR for physical health 1.59, 95%CI 1.22-2.07; adjusted OR for Age 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-1.00). Interpretation COVID-19 is likely to amplify health inequalities for people with SMI. Health services should target health risk behaviours for people with SMI to mitigate the immediate and long lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Peckham, E.; Allgar, V.; Crosland, S.; Heron, P.; Johnston, G.; Newbronner, E.; Spanakis, P.; Wadman, R.; Walker, L.; Gilbody, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.29.21254527v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.21254527,203

We investigated the impact of COVID‐19 on the physical and mental health of people with intellectual impairment, controlling for demographic risk, socio‐economic circumstances and pre‐pandemic health levels. METHOD: Data were drawn from two UK birth cohorts that surveyed their participants on the impact of COVID‐19 in May 2020: the Millennium Cohort Study (20‐year‐old participants) and the British Cohort Survey (50‐year‐old participants). Health outcomes (COVID‐19 infection, COVID‐19 symptoms, self‐reported physical health, mental health, health service use and impact on health behaviours) were compared between people with and without intellectual impairment, adjusting for gender and ethnicity. Differences were further adjusted for self‐reported health pre‐pandemic and the impact of COVID‐19 on socio‐economic circumstances. RESULTS: Controlling for gender and ethnicity, poor health was reported less often by younger adults [relative risks (RR): 0.44 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23, 0.86] and more often by older adults (RR: 1.99 95% CI 1.45, 2.73) with intellectual impairment compared with peers. Older adults were also more likely to experience fever and loss of taste/smell. Adjusting for pre‐pandemic health and socio‐economic circumstances eliminated some differences in the older cohort, but not in the younger one. CONCLUSION: In young adulthood, the impact of COVID‐19 on health outcomes was not negative. The pattern was reversed in later adulthood, although differences were mostly eliminated after adjustment suggesting a socio‐economic and age gradient of COVID‐19 impacts on intellectual impairment.","Totsika, V.; Emerson, E.; Hastings, R.

In this study, we leveraged large-scale longitudinal curation of electronic health records (EHRs) from the multi-state Mayo Clinic health system (MN, AZ, FL, WN, IA). We compared the infection rate of 2,195 individuals who received a single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to the infection rate of 21,950 unvaccinated, propensity-matched individuals between February 27th and April 14th 2021. Of the 1,779 vaccinated individuals with at least two weeks of follow-up, only 3 (0.17%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 15 days or more after vaccination compared to 128 of 17,744 (0.72%) unvaccinated individuals (4.34 fold reduction rate). This corresponds to a vaccine effectiveness of 76.7% (95% CI: 30.3-95.3%) in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection with onset at least two weeks after vaccination. This data is consistent with the clinical trial-reported efficacy of Ad26.COV2.S in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 with onset at least 14 days after vaccine administration (66.9%; 95% CI: 59.0-73.4%). Due to the recent authorization of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, there are not yet enough hospitalizations, ICU admissions, or deaths within this cohort to robustly assess the effect of vaccination on COVID-19 severity, but these outcomes will be continually assessed in near-real-time with our platform. Collectively, this study provides further evidence that a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is highly effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and reaffirms the urgent need to continue mass vaccination efforts globally.","Corchado-Garcia, J.; Puyraimond-Zemmour, D.; Hughes, T.; Cristea-Platon, T.; Lenehan, P.; Pawlowski, C.; Bade, S.; OHoro, J.

656275,COVID-19 infection in pregnancy: a single center experience with 75 cases,2021,"Background: The lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been called a crisis in mental health, and adolescents may have been among the most affected. Comparing the first period of societal lockdown in spring 2020 to periods going back to 2014 using a rich cross-sectional dataset based on repeated surveys, we explore the potential changes in self-reported mental well-being across sociodemographic groups among Norway's adolescents. Methods: Norway closed schools and implemented strict restrictions in March 2020; an electronic questionnaire survey was distributed to lower secondary school students in Trøndelag county (N = 2,443) in May 2020. Results were compared with similar surveys conducted annually in the same county dating back to 2014. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate potential changes in depressive symptoms, loneliness, and quality of life and life satisfaction, and to detect possible differences in the impact of lockdown between the genders and socioeconomic groups. Results: The prevalence of boys and girls reporting high quality of life (43–34%; 23–16%) and life satisfaction (91–80%; 82–69%) decreased significantly compared to the pre-pandemic. For girls only, lockdown was associated with higher odds for reporting high depressive symptoms. As expected, the least privileged socioeconomic groups showed the greatest psychological distress. However, our trend analyses provided no evidence that the socioeconomic inequalities in psychological distress (according to prevalence of high depressive symptoms or loneliness) changed substantial in any direction during the first wave of the pandemic [between the pre-pandemic and inter-pandemic periods]. Conclusion: Adolescents are vulnerable, and interventions should provide them with mental health support during crises such as societal lockdown. In particular, the social and health policy, public health, and further research should target these least privileged groups.","Myhr, Arnhild; Naper, Linn Renée; Samarawickrema, Indira; Vesterbekkmo, Renate K.",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.717747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595148/,203
656510,Universal testing for COVID-19 in patients undergoing cancer treatment during the second outbreak in Brescia,2021,"A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r(2) = 0.88; P = 8 × 10(−7)), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.","Escobar, Luis E.; Molina-Cruz, Alvaro; Barillas-Mury, Carolina",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008410117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647056/,203
656552,Letter regarding “Non-aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19”,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients affected by COVID-19 may develop disease related malnutrition (DRM) due to the catabolic situation, symptoms that interfere with intake and prolonged hospital stay. This study aims to know the percentage of patients admitted for COVID-19 who required artificial nutrition (AN), their clinical characteristics, as well as the prevalence of DRM and the risk of sarcopenia at hospital discharge and after 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective study, with successive inclusion of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 in whom institutional nutritional support (NS) care protocol was applied. Those who received AN underwent a nutritional screening by Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and an assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) at hospital discharge, as well as a screening for sarcopenia (SARC-F test) and SNAQ re-test 15 days and 6 months after by a phone call. Symptoms related to food intake, anthropometric and analytical data were also collected. RESULTS: We evaluated 936 patients with a mean age of 63.7 ± 15.3 years; predominantly male (59.7%), overweight 41%, obesity 40.4%; hypertension 52.9%; diabetes mellitus 26.6% and cancer 10.4%. The stay hospital length was 17.3 ± 13.8 days and 13.6% patients died during hospitalization. The modality of nutritional support was: 86.1% dietary adaptation + oral nutritional supplements (ONS); 12.4% enteral nutrition (EN) by nasogastric (NG) tube; 0.9% parenteral nutrition (PN) and 0.6% EN plus PN. Focusing on patients who received AN, follow-up post discharge was possible in 62 out of 87 who survived. Of these, at the time of hospital discharge, 96.7% presented nutritional risk by SNAQ and 100% malnutrition by SGA (20% B; 80% C). During admission, 82.3% presented intense anorexia and the mean weight loss was 10.9 ± 6 Kg (p < 0.001). Fifteen days after being discharged, 12.9% still had anorexia, while hyperphagia appeared in 85.5% of the patients and risk of sarcopenia by SARC-F was present in 87.1% of them. Six months after discharge, 6.8% still had anorexia and 3.4% hyperphagia, with a global weight gain of 4.03 ± 6.2 Kg (p=<0.0001). Risk of malnutrition was present in only 1.7% of the patients, although risk of sarcopenia persisted in 49.2%. CONCLUSION: All patients admitted by COVID-19 for whom EN or PN were indicated following an institutional protocol still presented malnutrition at hospital discharge, and almost all showed risk of sarcopenia, that persisted in almost half of them at 6 months. These findings suggest that nutritional and functional problems persist in these patients after discharge, indicating that they require prolonged nutritional support and monitoring.","Ramos, Analía; Joaquin, Clara; Ros, Mireia; Martin, Mariona; Cachero, Montserrat; Sospedra, María; Martínez, Eva; Sánchez Migallón, José Manuel; Sendrós, María-José; Soldevila, Berta; Puig-Domingo, Manel",Clin Nutr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261561421002387; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.05.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561421002387?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049748/,203

Digital divide is any uneven distribution in Information and Communications Technologies between people. AIMS: The purpose of this work was to describe the digital divide of a population of patients with dementia contacted by telemedicine during Italian lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: One hundred eight patients with cognitive impairment were contacted by video call to perform a telemedicine neurological evaluation. Information on patients and caregivers attending the televisit were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients connected with neurologist (successful televisit, 68.5%) and 34 patients were not able to perform televisit and were contacted by phone (failed televisit, 31.5%). No significant differences were observed among the two groups concerning age, gender, and education, but the prevalence of successful televisit was higher in the presence of younger caregivers: televisits performed in the presence of subjects of younger generation (sons and grandsons) had a successful rate higher (86% successful, 14% failed) than the group without younger generation caregiver (49% successful, 51% failed). This difference is mainly due to the ability of technological use among younger people. DISCUSSION: The most impacting factors on digital divide in our population are the social support networks and the experience with the technology: the presence of a digital native caregiver. The COVID-19 pandemic is unmasking an emerging form of technology-related social inequalities: political and community interventions are needed to support the most socially vulnerable population and prevent social health inequalities.","Arighi, Andrea; Fumagalli, Giorgio Giulio; Carandini, Tiziana; Pietroboni, Anna Margherita; De Riz, Milena Alessandra; Galimberti, Daniela; Scarpini, Elio",Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459891/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-05009-w,203

Currently, there is no effective vaccine for tackling this COVID19 pandemic where disease countermeasures rely upon preventing or slowing person-to-person transmission. Specifically, there is increasing efforts to prevent or reduce transmission to front-line healthcare workers (HCW). However, there is growing international concern regarding the shortage in supply chain of critical one-time-use personal and protective equipment (PPE). PPE are heat sensitive and are not, by their manufacturer's design, intended for reprocessing. Most conventional sterilization technologies used in hospitals, or in terminal medical device sterilization providers, cannot effectively reprocess PPE due to the nature and severity of sterilization modalities. Contingency planning for PPE stock shortage is important. Solutions in the Republic of Ireland include use of smart communication channels to improve supply chain, bespoke production of PPE to meets gaps, along with least preferred option, use of sterilization or high-level disinfection for PPE reprocessing. Reprocessing PPE must consider material composition, functionality post treatment, along with appropriate disinfection. Following original manufacturer of PPE and regulatory guidance is important. Technologies deployed in the US, and for deployment in the Republic of Ireland, are eco-friendly, namely vaporised hydrogen peroxide (VH2O2), such as for filtering facepiece respirators and UV irradiation and High-level liquid disinfection (Actichlor+) is also been pursed in Ireland.

In this respect, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is comparable with other severe community-acquired forms of pneumonia caused by conventional pathogens, even if the pathogenesis is different. The fatality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is approximately 20% (and therefore higher than for other pneumonia pathogens), in intensive care patients 30–40% and in invasively ventilated patients ca. 50%. Risk factors that are decisive for the fatality are old age, overweight, male gender and typical age-related cardiopulmonary underlying diseases.

Cellular senescence defines as an irreversible cell cycle arrest due to DNA damage leading to accumulation of senescent cells in the elderly population and may result in worsening of COVID-19 mediated increased mortality. However, whether this variation in senescence levels, in different aged populations, translation to COVID-19 infection is unknown. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been recently identified to be responsible for inducing pathogenic signals, although a clear understanding of how the host receptor interacts with SARS-CoV-2 protein and mediates the immune responses is not clear. In this review, we address the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and the cellular senescence responding immune response to pathogenic SARS-CoV-2. We provide a prospective summary of what to expect and how to brace the possible immunological strategy to protect against COVID-19 infection.

High-quality genomes are crucial for understanding the molecular basis and evolution of these traits. Here we incorporated long-read sequencing and state-of-the-art scaffolding protocols(1) to generate, to our knowledge, the first reference-quality genomes of six bat species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rousettus aegyptiacus, Phyllostomus discolor, Myotis myotis, Pipistrellus kuhlii and Molossus molossus). We integrated gene projections from our ‘Tool to infer Orthologs from Genome Alignments’ (TOGA) software with de novo and homology gene predictions as well as short- and long-read transcriptomics to generate highly complete gene annotations. To resolve the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria, we applied several phylogenetic methods to comprehensive sets of orthologous protein-coding and noncoding regions of the genome, and identified a basal origin for bats within Scrotifera. Our genome-wide screens revealed positive selection on hearing-related genes in the ancestral branch of bats, which is indicative of laryngeal echolocation being an ancestral trait in this clade. We found selection and loss of immunity-related genes (including pro-inflammatory NF-κB regulators) and expansions of anti-viral APOBEC3 genes, which highlights molecular mechanisms that may contribute to the exceptional immunity of bats. Genomic integrations of diverse viruses provide a genomic record of historical tolerance to viral infection in bats. Finally, we found and experimentally validated bat-specific variation in microRNAs, which may regulate bat-specific gene-expression programs. Our reference-quality bat genomes provide the resources required to uncover and validate the genomic basis of adaptations of bats, and stimulate new avenues of research that are directly relevant to human health and disease(1).","Jebb, David; Huang, Zixia; Pippel, Martin; Hughes, Graham M.; Lavrichenko, Ksenia; Devanna, Paolo; Winkler, Sylke; Jermiin, Lars S.; Skirmuntt, Emilia C.; Katzourakis, Aris; Burkitt-Gray, Lucy; Ray, David A.; Sullivan, Kevin A.

Prevalence matters,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND: When this study began in 2018, I sought to determine the extent to which the top 50 schools of nursing were using hashtags that could attract attention from journalists on Twitter. In December 2020, the timeframe was expanded to encompass 2 more years of data, and an analysis was conducted of the types of hashtags used. OBJECTIVE: The study attempted to answer the following question: to what extent are top-ranked schools of nursing using hashtags that could attract attention from journalists, policy makers, and the public on Twitter? METHODS: In February 2018, 47 of the top 50 schools of nursing had public Twitter accounts. The most recent 3200 tweets were extracted from each account and analyzed. There were 31,762 tweets in the time period covered (September 29, 2016, through February 22, 2018). After 13,429 retweets were excluded, 18,333 tweets remained. In December 2020, 44 of the original 47 schools of nursing still had public Twitter accounts under the same name used in the first phase of the study. Three accounts that were no longer active were removed from the 2016-2018 data set, resulting in 16,939 tweets from 44 schools of nursing. The Twitter data for the 44 schools of nursing were obtained for the time period covered in the second phase of the study (February 23, 2018, through December 13, 2020), and the most recent 3200 tweets were extracted from each of the accounts. On excluding retweets, there were 40,368 tweets in the 2018-2020 data set. The 2016-2018 data set containing 16,939 tweets was merged with the 2018-2020 data set containing 40,368 tweets, resulting in 57,307 tweets in the 2016-2020 data set. RESULTS: Each hashtag used 100 times or more in the 2016-2020 data set was categorized as one of the following seven types: nursing, school, conference or tweet chat, health, illness/disease/condition, population, and something else. These types were then broken down into the following two categories: intercom hashtags and megaphone hashtags. Approximately 83% of the time, schools of nursing used intercom hashtags (inward-facing hashtags focused on in-group discussion within and about the profession). Schools of nursing rarely used outward-facing megaphone hashtags. There was no discernible shift in the way that schools of nursing used hashtags after the publication of The Woodhull Study Revisited. CONCLUSIONS: Top schools of nursing use hashtags more like intercoms to communicate with other nurses rather than megaphones to invite attention from journalists, policy makers, and the public. If schools of nursing want the media to showcase their faculty members as experts, they need to increase their use of megaphone hashtags to connect the work of their faculty with topics of interest to the public.","Acquaviva, Kimberly",JMIR Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345795/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25114,203
664530,COVID-19 mortality- The culprit may not be proton pump inhibitors,2021-08-12,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive frailty (CF) is identified as one of the main precursors of dementia. Multidomain intervention has been found to delay or prevent the onset of CF. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our present study is to determine the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multidomain intervention on CF; to evaluate its cost effectiveness and the factors influencing adherence toward this intensive intervention. METHODS: A total of 1,000 community dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above will be screened for CF. This randomized controlled trial involves recruitment of 330 older adults with CF from urban, semi-urban, and rural areas in Malaysia. Multidomain intervention comprised of physical, nutritional, cognitive, and psychosocial aspects will be provided to participants in the experimental group (n = 165). The control group (n = 165) will continue their usual care with their physician. Primary outcomes include CF status, physical function, psychosocial and nutritional status as well as cognitive performance. Vascular health and gut microbiome will be assessed using blood and stool samples. A 24-month intensive intervention will be prescribed to the participants and its sustainability will be assessed for the following 12 months. The effective intervention strategies will be integrated as a personalized telerehabilitation package for the reversal of CF for future use. RESULTS: The multidomain intervention developed from this trial is expected to be cost effective compared to usual care as well as able is to reverse CF. CONCLUSION: This project will be part of the World-Wide FINGERS (Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) Network, of which common identifiable data will be shared and harmonized among the consortia.","Ponvel, Pavapriya; Shahar, Suzana; Singh, Devinder Kaur Ajit; Ludin, Arimi Fitri Mat; Rajikan, Roslee; Rajab, Nor Fadilah; Ai-Vyrn, Chin; Din, Normah Che; Ibrahim, Norhayati; Subramaniam, Ponnusamy; Haron, Hasnah; Ismail, Aniza; Sharif, Razinah; Ramasamy, Kalavathy; Majeed, Abu Bakar Abdul; Ali, Nazlena Mohamad; Mohamad, Mazlyfarina; Noah, Shahrul Azman Mohd; Ibrahim, Azianah Mohd; Safien, Aisyah Mohd; Khalid, Norhayati Mustafa; Fadzil, Nurul Hidayah Md; Mangialasche, Francesca; Kivipelto, Miia",Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092633/; https://doi.org/10.3233/jad-201607,203

In this paper, we aimed at reviewing the current knowledge about COVID-19 infectious risk status in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients requiring immunosuppressive medication. We also focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear not to have higher risks of infection and worse outcomes in COVID-19 than the general population in an attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. METHODS: PubMed electronic database was interrogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Besides, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). Discussions. Few molecular and therapeutic interactions between IBD and pathogenic coronaviruses were explored. First, we showed how the activity of soluble angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, CD209L other receptors, and phosphorylated α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 might exert protective impact in IBD in case of coronavirus infection. Second, IBD medication was discussed in the context of possible beneficial effects on COVID-19 pathogeny, including “cytokine storm” prevention and treatment, immunomodulation, interferon signaling blocking, and viral endocytosis inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Using the current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other pathogenic coronaviruses immunopathology, we showed why IBD patients should not be considered at an increased risk of infection or more severe outcomes. Whether our findings are entirely applicable to the pathogenesis, disease susceptibility, and treatment management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD must be further explored.","Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Diculescu, Mircea; Mihai, Cătălina; Cijevschi-Prelipcean, Cristina; Burlacu, Alexandru",Gastroenterol Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1918035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32714386/,203

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of these restrictions on behaviours and well-being and whether individual differences predict changes in well-being. METHODS: Australian adults participated in a cross-sectional, online survey during May 2020. The survey captured demographic information; health behaviours; personality traits; life satisfaction and COVID-19-related attitudes, financial concerns, perceived risks and impacts. RESULTS: In total, 3745 (86.8% of 4313) participants completed all items. Participants were mostly female (85.7%) and 56.4 years (standard deviation [SD] = 12.6) on average. Over 95.0% of the sample indicated they had been social distancing or isolating. Health behaviours and well-being had generally worsened, with social connections being the most negatively affected. Life satisfaction was significantly lower since restrictions. For changes in life satisfaction, extroversion was a risk factor and openness to experience was a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, well-being was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing particularly in this sample containing mainly older women. In future, it will be crucial to understand why and who may be differentially affected, to encourage behaviours that are protective of well-being.","Brindal, Emily; Ryan, Jillian C; Kakoschke, Naomi; Golley, Sinead; Zajac, Ian T; Wiggins, Bonnie",J Public Health (Oxf),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683320/; https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab040,203

The pandemic has not only social and economic effects, but even more impressive effects on the health system. If the virus spreads uncontrollably and rapidly, there is a risk of an unpredictable increase of patients with COVID-19 disease requiring hospital treatment. The capacities of a hospital can quickly reach the limit and consequently patients can no longer be adequately treated. Therefore, in the acute phase of the pandemic, it is necessary to release all hospital resources for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Strict hygiene regulations must also be observed in order to prevent the virus from spreading unexpectedly in the hospital in order to protect patients and hospital staff. Elective operations and outpatient clinics must be cancelled in the acute phase. Special hygiene measures must be observed for urgent and unpostponable operations. These relate to the admission of the patients, the accommodation in the ward and the operative care in the operating room. In the post-acute phase, a normal surgical program can be resumed step by step. In this phase, however, clear hygiene regulations must also be observed. Regular medical meetings taking into account the current pandemic situation and the occurrence of new infections must be carried out in the hospital and the occupancy of the ward and operating room adjusted accordingly. To what extent the situation for the treatment of patients in orthopedics and trauma surgery will normalize cannot be predicted at the present time.","Müller, Michael; Stöckle, Ulrich; Trampuz, Andrej; Felix, Stephan; Kramer, Axel; Wassilew, Georgi",Z Orthop Unfall,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33152771/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1208-0182,203

Using HLA class I and II predicted peptide ‘megapools’, circulating SARS-CoV-2−specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were identified in ∼70% and 100% of COVID-19 convalescent patients, respectively. CD4+ T cell responses to spike, the main target of most vaccine efforts, were robust and correlated with the magnitude of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA titers. The M, spike and N proteins each accounted for 11-27% of the total CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a and ORF8, among others. For CD8+ T cells, spike and M were recognized, with at least eight SARS-CoV-2 ORFs targeted. Importantly, we detected SARS-CoV-2−reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40-60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating ‘common cold’ coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2.","Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Ramirez, Sydney I.; Mateus, Jose; Dan, Jennifer M.; Moderbacher, Carolyn Rydyznski; Rawlings, Stephen A.; Sutherland, Aaron; Premkumar, Lakshmanane; Jadi, Ramesh S.; Marrama, Daniel; de Silva, Aravinda M.; Frazier, April; Carlin, Aaron; Greenbaum, Jason A.; Peters, Bjoern; Krammer, Florian; Smith, Davey M.; Crotty, Shane; Sette, Alessandro",Cell,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0092867420306103; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420306103?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32473127/,203

I show that these variations correlate strongly with the level of the viral receptor protein ACE2 in rat lungs, which is consistent with the still limited data on human ACE2. Surprisingly, lower receptor levels correlate with higher fatality. I propose two possible explanations of this negative correlation: First, a previous mathematical model predicts that the velocity of viral progression in the organism as a function of the receptor level has a maximum and declines for abundant receptor. Secondly, degradation of ACE2 by the virus may cause the runaway inflammatory response that characterizes severe CoViD-19. I present here a mathematical model that predicts the lethality as a function of ACE2 protein level based on the two above hypothesis. The model fits Covid-19 fatality rate across age and sex in three countries with high accuracy ([Formula: see text]) under the hypothesis that the speed of viral progression in the infected organism is a decreasing function of the ACE2 level. Moreover, rescaling the fitted parameters by the ratio of the binding rates of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 allows predicting the fatality rate of SARS-CoV across age and sex, thus linking the molecular and epidemiological levels.","Bastolla, Ugo",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322518/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2021.706122,203

According to the 2020 Global Risk Register, extreme weather and climate action failure are the two most likely and impactful risks to the global economy, which now more than ever needs to be avoided. Addressing the major challenges that we face from climate change can often appear to conflict with economic priorities. Add to this the fact that environmental mitigation steps can inadvertently exclude sections of the population and the enormity and complexity of climate change responses can result in paralysis. In contrast, the Stirling Protocol provides the framework for rapid, effective action and comprises three pillars: Environment, Economy & Inclusion. By addressing and balancing these three pillars, the simple protocol can be adopted throughout organisations putting the environment at the heart of sustainable prosperity and inclusion and provide a benchmark for positive action.","Cusack, M.; Tyler, A.; Valenti, M.; Rogers, J.; Macleod, M.",Sci Total Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720335993; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140079; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720335993?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32783830/,203
666996,Overview of acute kidney manifestations and management of patients with COVID-19,2021-10-01,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied to identify genetic factors that affect complex diseases or traits. Presently, the GWAS Catalog includes > 2800 human studies. Of these, only a minority have investigated the susceptibility to infectious diseases or the response to therapies for the treatment or prevention of infections. Despite their limited application in the field, GWASs have provided valuable insights by pinpointing associations to both innate and adaptive immune response loci, as well as novel unexpected risk factors for infection susceptibility. Herein, we discuss some issues and caveats of GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs for infections in non-human mammals. We conclude that, although the general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing, important knowledge on infectious disease-related traits can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach. We suggest that future studies will benefit from the leveraging of information from the host's and pathogen's genomes, as well as from the exploration of models that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes. Interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex may also play an important role in shaping the susceptibility and response to invading pathogens.","Mozzi, Alessandra; Pontremoli, Chiara; Sironi, Manuela",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134817303349; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2017.09.028; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134817303349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28951201/,203

Season 1 premiered on March 31, 2017 and featured the sensitive issue of teen suicide along with bullying, substance use, depression, and sexual assault. Unlike the typical teen dramas on popular streaming platforms, this show was created not only for entertainment, but also to stimulate conversations about taboo topics that people often shy away from. However, it also caused significant controversy, especially criticism around the main character Hannah’s suicide scene. More than three years into the initial controversy and at least two dozen scholarly publications later, this study is the first to examine the entertainment narrative content of 13 Reasons Why Season 1 to better understand how these health and social issues were portrayed in the show, what specific examples we could identify as potential behavioral modeling, and to what degree it complied with the 2017 WHO guidelines for media professionals. We used the framing theory and social cognitive theory in communication research and media studies as our guiding conceptual frameworks and a narrative analysis approach to investigate a total of 660 cut scenes in all 13 episodes. Our findings provided empirical evidence, along with contextual information and detailed examples, to demonstrate that a popular entertainment program like the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why serves as a double-edged sword.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. health departments worked to improve infection prevention and control (IPC) practices in nursing homes to prevent outbreaks and limit the spread of COVID-19 in affected facilities; however, limited resources have hampered health departments' ability to rapidly provide IPC support to all nursing homes within their jurisdictions. Since 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has published health inspection results and quality ratings based on their Five-Star Quality Rating System for all CMS-certified nursing homes (3); these ratings might be associated with facility-level risk factors for COVID-19 outbreaks. On April 17, 2020, West Virginia became the first state to mandate and conduct COVID-19 testing for all nursing home residents and staff members to identify and reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these settings (4). West Virginia's census of nursing home outbreaks was used to examine associations between CMS star ratings and COVID-19 outbreaks. Outbreaks, defined as two or more cases within 14 days (with at least one resident case), were identified in 14 (11%) of 123 nursing homes. Compared with 1-star-rated (lowest rated) nursing homes, the odds of a COVID-19 outbreak were 87% lower among 2- to 3-star-rated facilities (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03-0.54) and 94% lower among 4- to 5-star-rated facilities (aOR = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.006-0.39). Health departments could use star ratings to help identify priority nursing homes in their jurisdictions to inform the allocation of IPC resources. Efforts to mitigate outbreaks in high-risk nursing homes are necessary to reduce overall COVID-19 mortality and associated disparities. Moreover, such efforts should incorporate activities to improve the overall quality of life and care of nursing home residents and staff members and address the social and health inequities that have been recognized as a prominent feature of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (5).","Bui, David P.; See, Isaac; Hesse, Elisabeth M.; Varela, Kate; Harvey, R.

All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, uploaded to NVivo(®) software and analysed following thematic analysis approach. Four major themes emerged: views on BSAs, factors influencing BSA prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship: practices and barriers and recommendations to improve appropriate BSA prescribing. Recommendations for the future include improving clinical knowledge, feedback on prescribing, multidisciplinary team decision-making and local guideline implementation. Identification of views and determinants of BSA prescribing can guide the design of a multifaceted intervention to support physicians and policymakers to improve antimicrobial prescribing practices.","Alsaleh, Nada A.; Al-Omar, Hussain A.; Mayet, Ahmed Y.; Mullen, Alexander B.",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10040366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33807345/,203

670858,Serum and CSF alpha-synuclein levels do not change in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms,2021-02-19,"Outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases continue to challenge human health. Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered a global coronavirus pandemic, known as COVID-19. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus are circulating, thus raising questions with respect to the effectiveness of different lines of treatment, such as vaccines and antiviral drugs. To find the appropriate prevention/treatment, 21 plant-based ingredients (Glycyrrhizin, Withanone, Aloe-emodin, Rhein, Emodin, Chrysophanol, Physcion, Kaempferol, Progallin A, Gallic acid, Naringin, Quercetin, Luteolin, and Apigenin) having antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties were identified. We pseudo-typed SARS-CoV-2 on a lentiviral vector plasmid and tested the impact of five different herbal formulations in mammalian HEK293T cells. Viral inactivation assay showed that the natural extracts in a herb-derived phytoconstituent-based formulation, BITS-003, comprising Bacopa monnieri, Glycyerrhiza glabra, Asparagus racemosus-wild, and Nigella sativa had strong virucidal properties, inactivating enveloped viruses from 2log10 (or 99%) to >4log10 (or 99.99%). Moreover, bacterial and yeast cells treated with BITS-003 displayed reduced growth. Topical use of the formulation as a mouthwash/gargle could be effective in reducing symptoms of respiratory viral infections, with the potential to decrease the viral load in the buccal/oral cavity. This may inhibit the coronavirus spreading to the lungs of infected persons and at the same time may reduce the risk of viral transmission to other susceptible persons through micro-droplets originating from the oral cavity of the infected person.","Sharad, Shashwat; Kapur, Suman",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10091130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578161/,203
670860,Atypical Palmar Involvement with Erythema Elevatum Diutinum as a Sole Manifestation: A Report of Two Cases,2020-08-07,"BACKGROUND: China implemented containment measures to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. After the first epidemic wave, we conducted population-based serological surveys to determine extent of infection, risk factors for infection, and neutralization antibody levels to assess the real infections in the random sampled population. METHODS: We used a multistage, stratified cluster random sampling strategy to conduct serological surveys in three areas - Wuhan, Hubei Province outside Wuhan, and six provinces selected on COVID-19 incidence and containment strategy. Participants were consenting individuals >1 year old who resided in the survey area >14 days during the epidemic. Provinces screened sera for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG, and total antibody by two lateral flow immunoassays and one magnetic chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay; positive samples were verified by micro-neutralization assay. FINDINGS: We enrolled 34,857 participants (overall response rate, 92%); 427 were positive by micro-neutralization assay. Wuhan had the highest weighted seroprevalence (4•43%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]=3•48%-5•62%), followed by Hubei-ex-Wuhan (0•44%, 95%CI=0•26%-0•76%), and the other provinces (<0•1%). Living in Wuhan (adjusted odds ratio aOR=13•70, 95%CI= 7•91–23•75), contact with COVID-19 patients (aOR=7•35, 95%CI=5•05–10•69), and age over 40 (aOR=1•36, 95%CI=1•07–1•72) were significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among seropositives, 101 (24%) reported symptoms and had higher geometric mean neutralizing antibody titers than among the 326 (76%) without symptoms (30±2•4 vs 15±2•1, p<0•001). INTERPRETATION: The low overall extent of infection and steep gradient of seropositivity from Wuhan to the outer provinces provide evidence supporting the success of containment of the first wave of COVID-19 in China. SARS-CoV-2 infection was largely asymptomatic, emphasizing the importance of active case finding and physical distancing. Virtually the entire population of China remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; vaccination will be needed for long-term protection.

METHODS Individual semi-structured interviews were carried out via telephone in May 2020 with 10 individuals with Parkinson's (six men and four women) recruited from Parkinson's UK. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was adopted to analyse the resulting data. RESULTS Four overarching themes emerged from the interview data: (1) COVID-19 amplifying existing fears and difficulties around the uncertainty of Parkinson's; (2) practical and psychological efforts to manage uncertainty; (3) benefit-finding as a way of acknowledging the positives of lockdown; (4) risk and future management in the context of uncertainty. DISCUSSION Participants reported a range of implicit and explicit strategies to cope with the 'double whammy' of uncertainty caused by having Parkinson's during a global pandemic. While these were generally successful in maintaining well-being, it is important that such successful accounts are used to help inform novel strategies and interventions targeting individuals who might need additional support.","Simpson, Jane; Zarotti, Nicolò; Varey, Sandra; Anestis, Eleftherios; Holland, Carol; Murray, Craig; Eccles, Fiona Jr",Chronic illness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524910/; https://doi.org/10.1177/17423953211043101,203

This study’s objective was to estimate the association between ≤10 μm diameter particulate matter (PM(10)) exposure and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia due to Covid-19 using individual-level data in Italy. METHODS: Information on Covid-19 patients was retrieved from the Italian IQVIA® Longitudinal Patient Database (LPD), a computerized network of general practitioners (GPs) including anonymous data on patients’ consultations and treatments. All patients with a Covid-19 diagnosis during March 18th, 2020 – June 30th, 2020 were included in the study. The date of first Covid-19 registration was the starting point of the 3-month follow-up (Index Date). Patients were classified based on Covid-19-related pneumonia registrations on the Index date and/or during follow-up presence/absence. Each patient was assigned individual exposure by calculating average PM(10) during the 30-day period preceding the Index Date, and according to GP’s office province. A multiple generalized linear mixed model, mixed-effects logistic regression, was used to assess the association between PM(10) exposure tertiles and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia. RESULTS: Among 6483 Covid-19 patients included, 1079 (16.6%) had a diagnosis of pneumonia. Pneumonia patients were older, more frequently men, more health-impaired, and had a higher individual-level exposure to PM(10) during the month preceding Covid-19 diagnosis. The mixed-effects model showed that patients whose PM(10) exposure level fell in the second tertile had a 30% higher likelihood of having pneumonia than that of first tertile patients, and the risk for those who were in the third tertile was almost doubled. CONCLUSION: The consistent findings toward a positive association between PM(10) levels and the likelihood of experiencing pneumonia due to Covid-19 make the implementation of new strategies to reduce air pollution more and more urgent.

State-of-the-art databases with experimental data of human, chimp, and rat effects by chemicals have been used to build machine-learning classifiers and regressors and to evaluate these on independent sets. Different featurizations, algorithms, and protein structures lead to different results, with deep neural networks (DNNs) on user-defined physicochemically relevant features developed for this work outperforming graph convolutional, random forest, and large featurizations. The results show that these user-provided structure-, ligand-, and statistically based features and specific DNNs provided the best results as determined by AUC (0.87), MCC (0.47), and other metrics and by their interpretability and chemical meaning of the descriptors/features. In addition, the same features in the DNN method performed better than in a multivariate logistic model: validation MCC = 0.468 and training MCC = 0.868 for the present work compared to evaluation set MCC = 0.2036 and training set MCC = 0.5364 for the multivariate logistic regression on the full, unbalanced set.

BALB/c mice were selected and mouse models of asthma were constructed. Mice were divided into 7 groups. A double-chamber plethysmograph, MTT, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and ELISA were used. The expression levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in lung tissue cells were detected. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA sustained-release vaccines significantly alleviated airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) in asthmatic mice. The numbers of total lymphocytes and eosinophils in BALF were remarkably reduced. The expression levels of IL-4 and IL-5 in lung tissue cells of the treatment groups were dramatically decreased. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA was found in vitro to be able to inhibit OVA-induced T-cell proliferation and upregulate the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. CS-BCG-PSN-OVA sustained-release vaccine could significantly attenuate AHR and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice.

Humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with symptoms and consequences including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiovascular disorders, and death. SARS-CoV-2 appears to infect cells by first binding viral spike proteins with host protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors; the virus is endocytosed following priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The process of virus entry into endosomes and its release from endolysosomes are key features of enveloped viruses. Thus, it is important to focus attention on the role of endolysosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, coronaviruses are now known to hijack endocytic machinery to enter cells such that they can deliver their genome at replication sites without initiating host detection and immunological responses. Hence, endolysosomes might be good targets for developing therapeutic strategies against coronaviruses. Here, we focus attention on the involvement of endolysosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Further, we explore endolysosome-based therapeutic strategies to restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Khan, Nabab; Chen, Xuesong; Geiger, Jonathan D.",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324224/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.595888,203

Here, we propose a novel model in which visual texture perception is essentially determined by the 1st-order (2D-luminance) and 2nd-order (4D-energy) spectra. This model is an extension of the dimensionality of the Filter-Rectify-Filter (FRF) model, and it also corresponds to the frequency representation of the Portilla-Simoncelli (PS) statistics. We show that preserving two spectra and randomizing phases of a natural texture image result in a perceptually similar texture, strongly supporting the model. Based on only two single spectral spaces, this model provides a simpler framework to describe and predict texture representations in the primate visual system. The idea of multi-order spectral analysis is consistent with the hierarchical processing principle of the visual cortex, which is approximated by a multi-layer convolutional network.","Okada, Kosuke; Motoyoshi, Isamu",Front Comput Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34381346/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2021.692334,203

Although palliative care will become more important in the care sector in future, there is a large knowledge gab, especially with regard to GPC. The aim of this study was to identify and compare the burdens, resources, health and wellbeing of nurses working in GPC and SPC. Such information will be helpful for developing prevention programs in order to reduce burdens and to strengthen resources of nurses. METHODS: In 2017, a nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted. In total, 437 nurses in GPC and 1316 nurses in SPC completed a questionnaire containing parts of standardised instruments, which included parts of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the Resilience Scale (RS-13) Questionnaire, a single question about back pain from the health survey conducted by the Robert Koch Institute as well as self-developed questions. The differences in the variables between GPC and SPC nurses were compared. RESULTS: SPC nurses reported higher emotional demands as well as higher burdens due to nursing care and the care of relatives while GPC nurses stated higher quantitative demands, i.e. higher workload. SPC nurses more often reported organisational and social resources that were helpful in dealing with the demands of their work. Regarding health, GPC nurses stated a poorer health status and reported chronic back pain as well as a major depressive disorder more frequently than SPC nurses. Furthermore, GPC nurses reported a higher intention to leave the profession compared to SPC nurses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicate that SPC could be reviewed as the best practice example for nursing care in Germany. The results may be used for developing target group specific prevention programs for improving health and wellbeing of nurses taking the differences between GPC and SPC into account. Finally, interventional and longitudinal studies should be conducted in future to determine causality in the relationship of burdens, resources, health and wellbeing.

Being primarily a respiratory disease, it is highly transmissible through both direct and indirect contacts. It displays a range of symptoms in different individuals and thus has been grouped into mild, moderate, and severe diseases. The virus utilizes spike proteins present on its surface to recognize ACE-2 receptors present on the host cells to enter the cell cytoplasm and replicate. The viral invasion of cells induces damage response, pyroptosis, infiltration of immune cells, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm), and activation of the adaptive immune system. Depending on viral load and host factors like age and underlying medical conditions, the immune responses mounted against SARS-CoV-2 may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and death. In this review, we specify and justify both viral and host therapeutic targets that can be modulated to relieve the symptoms and treat the disease.

We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase (>21 days) sera were available, 26% had immunoglobulin G to SARS-associated coronavirus. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing’s strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures.

The aim of this study was to describe the behavior of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant women treated with nitazoxanide. Methodology This cross-sectional study included the files of COVID-19 positive pregnant women treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg every 6 hours, levofloxacin every 12 hours, and clarithromycin 500 mg every 12 hours. Results The data of 51 women (mean age: 27.4 ± 7.2 years) were analyzed. Eleven (21.56%) patients had to receive medical attention in the intensive care unit. There were 22 (43.13%) preterm deliveries, 21 by cesarean and one by vaginal delivery. The medical attention of this population was as follows: 31 cesareans, five vaginal deliveries, nine still pregnant, two requiring manual vacuum aspiration, two ectopic pregnancies, one requiring curettage, and one requiring hysterotomy. There were seven (13.72%) cases of preeclampsia, and there were two (3.92%) deaths.

Wearables facilitate measurements of gait in novel and unsupervised environments; however, differences between unsupervised and in-laboratory measures have been reported in PD. We aimed to investigate whether unsupervised gait speed discriminates medication states and which supervised tests most accurately represent home performance. In-lab gait speeds from different gait tasks were compared to home speeds of 27 PD patients at ON and OFF states using inertial sensors. Daily gait speed distribution was expressed in percentiles and walking bout (WB) length. Gait speeds differentiated ON and OFF states in the lab and the home. When comparing lab with home performance, ON assessments in the lab showed moderate-to-high correlations with faster gait speeds in unsupervised environment (r = 0.69; p < 0.001), associated with long WB. OFF gait assessments in the lab showed moderate correlation values with slow gait speeds during OFF state at home (r = 0.56; p = 0.004), associated with short WB. In-lab and daily assessments of gait speed with wearables capture additional integrative aspects of PD, reflecting different aspects of mobility. Unsupervised assessment using wearables adds complementary information to the clinical assessment of motor fluctuations in PD.","Corrà, Marta Francisca; Atrsaei, Arash; Sardoreira, Ana; Hansen, Clint; Aminian, Kamiar; Correia, Manuel; Vila-Chã, Nuno; Maetzler, Walter; Maia, Luís",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21123974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207565/,203

A cohort of 45 patients underwent elective endovascular coil embolization (with or without stent) for intracranial aneurysm at our department. Arterial pressure transducer was used for all measurements. It was attached to proximal end of the microcatheter. Measurements were taken in the parent artery before and after embolization, at the aneurysm dome before embolization, after stent implantation, and after embolization. Stent-assisted coiling was performed with 4 different stents: LVIS and LVIS Jr (Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA), Leo (Balt, Montmorency, France), Barrel VRD (Medtronic/ Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA). Presence of the stent showed significant reverse correlation with intra-aneurysmal pressure-both systolic and diastolic-after its implantation (r = -0.70 and r = -0.75, respectively), which was further supported by correlations with stent cell size-r = 0.72 and r = 0.71, respectively (P<0.05). Stent implantation resulted in significant decrease in diastolic intra-aneurysmal pressure (p = 0.046). Systolic or mean intra-aneurysmal pressure did not differ significantly. Embolization did not significantly change the intra-aneurysmal pressure in matched pairs, regardless of the use of stent (p>0.05). In conclusion, low-profile braided stents show a potential to divert blood flow, there was significant decrease in diastolic pressure after stent placement. Flow-diverting properties were related to stent porosity. Coiling does not significantly change the intra-aneurysmal pressure, regardless of packing density.","Piasecki, Piotr; Ziecina, Piotr; Brzozowski, Krzysztof; Wierzbicki, Marek; Narloch, Jerzy",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233981; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497124/,203

The need to rapidly screen vast numbers of a country’s population in order to control the spread of the infection is paramount. However, the logistical requirement for reagent supply (and associated cost) of RT-PCR based testing (the current front-line test) have been hugely problematic. Mass spectrometry-based methods using swab and gargle samples have been reported with promise, but have not approached the task from a systematic analysis of the entire diagnostic process. Here, the pipeline from sample processing, the biological characteristics of the pathogen in human biofluid, the downstream bio- and physical-chemistry and the all-important data processing with clinical interpretation and reporting, are carefully compiled into a single high-throughput and reproducible rapid process. Utilizing MALDI-ToF mass spectrometric detection to viral envelope glycoproteins in a systems biology-multidisciplinary team approach, we have achieved a multifaceted clinical MALDI ToF MS screening test, primarily (but not limited to) SARS-CoV-2, with direct application to other future epidemics/pandemics that may arise. The clinical information generated not only includes SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus detection–(Spike protein fragments S1, S2b, S2a peaks), but other respiratory viral infections detected as well as an assessment of generalised oral upper respiratory immune response (elevated total Ig light chain peak) and a measure of the viral immune response (elevated intensity of IgA heavy chain peak). The advantages of the method include; (1) ease of sampling, (2) speed of analysis, and much reduced cost of testing.

This study aims to evaluate the attitudes of dental students of one medical university toward online courses and compare them with those of non-dental students amid the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with a self-report online questionnaire was conducted at the medical university in May 2020 in Taipei. Students from the School of Dentistry, School of Dental Technology, and School of Oral Hygiene Study were enrolled in our survey. RESULTS: In total, 473 students responded to the survey, 318 (67.2%) of whom were dental students. Overall, 366 (77%) students agreed with the change to online learning. Only 10.4% of students thought that dental professional courses with a laboratory format could be changed to online courses. Dental students were significantly more worried than non-dental students about being infected with COVID-19 and about the COVID-19 pandemic continuing. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, changing to online learning seems to be perceived as feasible by students. However, more discussion about changing dental professional courses with a laboratory format to online courses considering the attitudes from students is needed.

Cancer wards have been subjected to several modifications to protect patients and healthcare professionals from COVID-19 infection, while attempting to maintain cancer diagnosis, therapy, and research. In this setting, the management of COVID-19 infected patients with cancer is particularly challenging. We also discuss the direct and potential remote impacts of the global pandemic on the mortality of patients with cancer. As such, the indirect impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the potential consequences in terms of cancer mortality are discussed.

678727,Characteristics and prognostic factors of disease severity in patients with COVID-19: The Beijing experience,2020-04-24,"T-cell reduction is an important characteristic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and its immunopathology is a subject of debate. It may be due to the direct effect of the virus on T-cell exhaustion or indirectly due to T cells redistributing to the lungs. HIV/AIDS naturally served as a T-cell exhaustion disease model for recognizing how the immune system works in the course of COVID-19. In this study, we collected the clinical charts, T-lymphocyte analysis, and chest CT of HIV patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China). The median age of the 21 patients was 47 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 40–50 years] and the median CD4 T-cell count was 183 cells/μl (IQR = 96–289 cells/μl). Eleven HIV patients were in the non-AIDS stage and 10 were in the AIDS stage. Nine patients received antiretroviral treatment (ART) and 12 patients did not receive any treatment. Compared to the reported mortality rate (nearly 4%–10%) and severity rate (up to 20%–40%) among COVID-19 patients in hospital, a benign duration with 0% severity and mortality rates was shown by 21 HIV/AIDS patients. The severity rates of COVID-19 were comparable between non-AIDS (median CD4 = 287 cells/μl) and AIDS (median CD4 = 97 cells/μl) patients, despite some of the AIDS patients having baseline lung injury stimulated by HIV: 7 patients (33%) were mild (five in the non-AIDS group and two in the AIDS group) and 14 patients (67%) were moderate (six in the non-AIDS group and eight in the AIDS group). More importantly, we found that a reduction in T-cell number positively correlates with the serum levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which is contrary to the reported findings on the immune response of COVID-19 patients (lower CD4 T-cell counts with higher levels of IL-6 and CRP). In HIV/AIDS, a compromised immune system with lower CD4 T-cell counts might waive the clinical symptoms and inflammatory responses, which suggests lymphocyte redistribution as an immunopathology leading to lymphopenia in COVID-19.","Lin, Hua-Song; Lin, Xiao-Hong; Wang, Jian-Wen; Wen, Dan-Ning; Xiang, Jie; Fan, Yan-Qing; Li, Hua-Dong; Wu, Jing; Lin, Yi; Lin, Ya-Lan; Sun, Xu-Ri; Chen, Yun-Feng; Chen, Chuan-Juan; Lian, Ning-Fang; Xie, Han-Sheng; Lin, Shou-Hong; Xie, Qun-Fang; Li, Chao-Wei; Peng, Fang-Zhan; Wang, Ning; Lin, Jian-Qing; Chen, Wan-Jin; Huang, Chao-Lin; Fu, Ying",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.564938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34646783/,203

Accordingly, this scoping review aims to identify research evidence supporting the use of wearable devices to monitor the tidal volume during both daily activities and clinical settings. A screening of the literature (Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was carried out in December 2020 to collect studies: i. comparing one or more methodological approaches for the assessment of tidal volume with the outcome of a state-of-the-art measurement device (i.e., spirometry or optoelectronic plethysmography); ii. dealing with technological solutions designed to be exploited in wearable devices. From the initial 1031 documents, only 36 citations met the eligibility criteria. These studies highlighted that the tidal volume can be estimated by using different technologies ranging from IMUs to strain sensors (e.g., resistive, capacitive, inductive, electromagnetic, and optical) or acoustic sensors. Noticeably, the relative volumetric error of these solutions during quasi-static tasks (e.g., resting and sitting) is typically ≥10% but it deteriorates during dynamic motor tasks (e.g., walking). As such, additional efforts are required to improve the performance of these devices and to identify possible applications based on their accuracy and reliability.","Monaco, Vito; Stefanini, Cesare",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21124124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208468/,203

Willow bark (Salix cortex) has been used for centuries to relieve pain, inflammation, and fever. Its main active ingredient, salicin, is metabolized in the human body into salicylic acid, the precursor of the commonly used pain drug acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Here, we report on the in vitro anti-inflammatory efficacy of two methanolic Salix extracts, standardized to phenolic compounds, in comparison to ASA in the context of a SARS-CoV-2 peptide challenge. Using SARS-CoV-2 peptide/IL-1β- or LPS-activated human PBMCs and an inflammatory intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX co-culture, Salix extracts, and ASA concentration-dependently suppressed prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)), a principal mediator of inflammation. The inhibition of COX-2 enzyme activity, but not protein expression was observed for ASA and one Salix extract. In activated PBMCs, the suppression of relevant cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10) was seen for both Salix extracts. The anti-inflammatory capacity of Salix extracts was still retained after transepithelial passage and liver cell metabolism in an advanced co-culture model system consisting of intestinal Caco-2/HT29-MTX cells and differentiated hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells.

680418,Do breast cancer patients with COVID-19 have a poor prognosis? Experience in a hospital in Madrid,2020-09-30,"Viral infections frequently induce acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, yet the contribution of the innate immune response to a detrimental host response remains poorly understood. In virus-infected cells, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is generated as an intermediate during viral replication. Cell necrosis (and the release of endogenous dsRNA) is a common event during both sterile and infectious inflammatory processes. The discovery of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) as an interferon-inducing dsRNA sensor led to the assumption that TLR3 was the master sentinel against viral infections. This simplistic view has been challenged by the discovery of at least three members of the DExd/H-box helicase cytosolic sensors of dsRNA that share with TLR3 the Toll–interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) -adapter molecule TIR domain-containing adaptor protein interferon-β (TRIF) for downstream type I interferon signalling. Data are conflicting on the role of TLR3 in protective immunity against viruses in the mouse model. Varying susceptibility to infection and disease outcomes have been reported in TLR3-immunodeficient mice. Surprisingly, the susceptibility to develop herpes simplex virus-1 encephalitis in humans with inborn defects of the TLR3 pathway varies, and TLR3-deficient humans do not show increased susceptibility to other viral infections. Therefore, a current challenge is to understand the protective versus pathogenic contribution of TLR3 in viral infections. We review recent advances in the identification of TLR3-signalling pathways, endogenous and virus-induced negative regulators of the TLR3 cascade, and discuss the protective versus pathogenic role of TLR3 in viral pathogenesis.","Perales-Linares, Renzo; Navas-Martin, Sonia",Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23909285/,203

It impacts on disease onset and development, yet only recently underlying mechanisms have been studied in clonal cell cultures by single-virion immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. In this review, we showcase how single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-molecule RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) with alkynyl-tagged viral genomes dissect infection variability in human and mouse cells. We show how the combined use of scRNA-FISH and click-chemistry reveals highly variable onsets of adenoviral gene expression, and how single live cell plaques reveal lytic and nonlytic adenovirus transmissions. The review highlights how scRNA-seq profiling and scRNA-FISH of coxsackie, influenza, dengue, zika, and herpes simplex virus infections uncover transcriptional variability, and how the host interferon response tunes influenza and sendai virus infections. We introduce the concept of “cell state” in infection variability, and conclude with advances by single-cell simultaneous measurements of chromatin accessibility and mRNA counts at high-throughput. Such technology will further dissect the sequence of events in virus infection and pathology, and better characterize the genetic and genomic stability of viruses, cell autonomous innate immune responses, and mechanisms of tissue injury.","Suomalainen, Maarit; Greber, Urs F.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081568; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452433/,203
681125,Left ventricular thrombus with normal systolic function secondary to the novel prothrombotic association of acute on chronic calcific pancreatitis and COVID-19,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 poses a considerable threat to those living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). RACF COVID-19 outbreaks have been characterised by the rapid spread of infection and high rates of severe disease and associated mortality. Despite a growing body of evidence supporting airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2, current infection control measures in RACF including hand hygiene, social distancing, and sterilisation of surfaces, focus on contact and droplet transmission. Germicidal ultraviolet (GUV) light has been used widely to prevent airborne pathogen transmission. Our aim is to investigate the efficacy of GUV technology in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RACF. METHODS: A multicentre, two-arm double-crossover, randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the efficacy of GUV devices to reduce respiratory viral transmission in RACF, as an adjunct to existing infection control measures. The study will be conducted in partnership with three aged care providers in metropolitan and regional South Australia. RACF will be separated into paired within-site zones, then randomised to intervention order (GUV or control). The initial 6-week period will be followed by a 2-week washout before crossover to the second 6-week period. After accounting for estimated within-zone and within-facility correlations of infection, and baseline infection rates (10 per 100 person-days), a sample size of n = 8 zones (n = 40 residents/zone) will provide 89% power to detect a 50% reduction in symptomatic infection rate. The primary outcome will be the incidence rate ratio of combined symptomatic respiratory infections for intervention versus control. Secondary outcomes include incidence rates of hospitalisation for complications associated with respiratory infection; respiratory virus detection in facility air and fomite samples; rates of laboratory confirmed respiratory illnesses and genomic characteristics. DISCUSSION: Measures that can be deployed rapidly into RACF, that avoid the requirement for changes in resident and staff behaviour, and that are effective in reducing the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, would provide considerable benefit in safeguarding a highly vulnerable population. In addition, such measures might substantially reduce rates of other respiratory viruses, which contribute considerably to resident morbidity and mortality.

Social sequence analysis was used to explore occupation-by-agrichemical events relative to migration.

The odds of any perceived effects of agrichemicals on the body increased with time prior to migration in the moderate and high exposure sequence clusters and continued to increase 20% with each year following migration in the moderate exposure cluster. Workers with high lifetime agrichemical exposures prior to migrating internationally showed lower likelihoods of a perceived effect on the body following migration despite continued exposure.

681269,Accuracy of CT in a cohort of symptomatic patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia during the outbreak peak in Italy,2020-07-14,"Introduction: The severity of COVID-19 may be correlated with the risk of liver injury development. An increasing number of studies indicate that degrees of hepatotoxicity has been associated with using some medications in the management of COVID-19 patients. However, limited studies had systematically investigated the evidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in COVID-19 patients. Thus, this study aimed to examine DILI in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 30, 2020. Search items included “SARS-CoV-2”, “Coronavirus,” COVID-19, and liver injury. Results: We included 22 related articles. Among included studies, there was five case report, five case series, four randomizes control trial (RCT), seven cohort studies, and one cross-sectional study. The drugs included in this systematic review were remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Among included studies, some studies revealed a direct role of drugs, while others couldn't certainly confirm that the liver injury was due to SARS-CoV-2 itself or administration of medications. However, a significant number of studies reported that liver injury could be attributable to drug administration. Discussion: Liver injury in COVID-19 patients could be caused by the virus itself or the administration of some types of drug. Intensive liver function monitoring should be considered for patients, especially patients who are treated with drugs such as remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab.","Sodeifian, Fatemeh; Seyedalhosseini, Zahra Sadat; Kian, Naghmeh; Eftekhari, Mahya; Najari, Shaghayegh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Farsi, Yeganeh; Nasiri, Mohammad Javad",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34616757/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.731436,203

681380,Mechanisms and consequences of COVID-19 associated liver injury: What can we affirm?,2020-08-27,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, which was later formally named the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused a worldwide public health crisis. Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and infects humans through the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Here, we have systematically studied the molecular mechanisms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by protein-protein docking and MD simulations. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable and may survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This provides insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-like coronaviruses have originated in bats. Our computation also suggested that the RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than that for SARS-CoV. Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. These findings would be beneficial for the disease prevention and drug/vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2.","He, Jiahua; Tao, Huanyu; Yan, Yumeng; Huang, Sheng-You; Xiao, Yi",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12040428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32290077/,203
681403,Prolonged Self-Resolving Neutropenia Following Asymptomatic COVID-19 Infection,2021-07-18,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) utilizes RNA polymerase II to transcribe viral genes and produce viral mRNAs. It can specifically target the nucleolus to facilitate viral transcription and translation. As RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription is active in the nucleolus, we investigated the role of Pol I, along with relative contributions of the human Pol II and Pol III, to early phases of viral transcription in HCMV infected cells, compared with Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1) and Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Inhibition of Pol I with siRNA or the Pol I inhibitors CX-5461 or Actinomycin D (5nM) resulted in significantly decreased IE and pp65 mRNA and protein levels in human fibroblasts at early times post infection. This initially delayed replication was compensated for later during the replication process, at which stage it didn’t significantly affect virus production. Pol I inhibition also reduced HSV-1 ICP0 and gB transcripts, suggesting that some herpesviruses engage Pol I for their early transcription. In contrast, inhibition of Pol I failed to affect MCMV transcription. Collectively, our results contribute to better understanding of the functional interplay between RNA Pol I-mediated nucleolar events and the Herpes viruses, particularly HCMV whose pathogenic impact ranges from congenital malformations and potentially deadly infections among immunosuppressed patients, up to HCMV’s emerging oncomodulatory role in human tumors.","Kostopoulou, Ourania N.; Wilhelmi, Vanessa; Raiss, Sina; Ananthaseshan, Sharan; Lindström, Mikael S.; Bartek, Jiri; Söderberg-Naucler, Cecilia",Oncotarget,https://doi.org/10.18632/oncotarget.22106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29228551/,203

682016,Dynamic CT assessment of disease change and prognosis of patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-09-19,"Abstract The mammarenavirus Lassa (LASV) is highly prevalent in West Africa where it infects several hundred thousand individuals annually resulting in a high number of Lassa fever (LF) cases, a febrile disease associated with high morbidity and significant mortality. Mounting evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic mammarenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. There are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed vaccines and current anti-mammarenavirus therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin that is only partially effective and can cause significant side effects. Therefore, there is an unmet need for novel antiviral drugs to combat LASV. This task would be facilitated by the implementation of high throughput screens (HTS) to identify inhibitors of the activity of the virus ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) responsible for directing virus RNA genome replication and gene transcription. The use of live LASV for this purpose is jeopardized by the requirement of biosafety level 4 (BSL4) containment. We have developed a virus-free cell platform, where expression levels of reporter genes serve as accurate surrogates of vRNP activity, to develop cell-based assays compatible with HTS to identify inhibitors of LASV and LCMV mammarenavirus vRNP activities.","Cubitt, Beatrice; Ortiz-Riano, Emilio; Cheng, Benson YH.; Kim, Yu-Jin; Yeh, Charles D.; Chen, Catherine Z.; Southall, N.O.E.; Zheng, Wei; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; de la Torre, Juan C.",Antiviral Research,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219305170; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31786250/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104667; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219305170,203
682094,Reply to: “Reporting of all cardiac medications and their outcome in COVID‐19”,2020-04-13,"Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected millions of people, overwhelming critical care resources in some regions. Many plans for rationing critical care resources during crises are based on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The COVID-19 pandemic created an emergent need to develop and validate a novel electronic health record (EHR)-computable tool to predict mortality. Research Questions: To rapidly develop, validate, and implement a novel real-time mortality score for the COVID-19 pandemic that improves upon SOFA. Study Design and Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of a regional health system with 12 hospitals in Colorado between March 2020 and July 2020. All patients >14 years old hospitalized during the study period without a do not resuscitate order were included. Patients were stratified by the diagnosis of COVID-19. From this cohort, we developed and validated a model using stacked generalization to predict mortality using data widely available in the EHR by combining five previously validated scores and additional novel variables reported to be associated with COVID-19-specific mortality. We compared the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) for the new model to the SOFA score and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results: We prospectively analyzed 27,296 encounters, of which 1,358 (5.0%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 4,494 (16.5%) included intensive care unit (ICU)-level care, 1,480 (5.4%) included invasive mechanical ventilation, and 717 (2.6%) ended in death. The Charlson Comorbidity Index and SOFA scores predicted overall mortality with an AUROC of 0.72 and 0.90, respectively. Our novel score predicted overall mortality with AUROC 0.94. In the subset of patients with COVID-19, we predicted mortality with AUROC 0.90, whereas SOFA had AUROC of 0.85. Interpretation: We developed and validated an accurate, in-hospital mortality prediction score in a live EHR for automatic and continuous calculation using a novel model, that improved upon SOFA.","Sottile, P.

682728,Exploring Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 (SGLT2) Inhibitors for Organ Protection in COVID-19,2020-06-28,"COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with important political, socio-economic, and public health consequences. Inhibiting replication represents an important antiviral approach, and in this context two viral proteases, the SARS-CoV-2 main and papain-like proteases (PL(pro)), which cleave pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides, are critical. Along with protease activity, the PL(pro) possesses deubiquitinating activity, which is important in immune regulation. Naphthalene-based inhibitors, such as the well-investigated GRL-0617 compound, have been shown to possess dual effects, inhibiting both protease and deubiquitinating activity of the PL(pro). Rather than binding to the canonical catalytic triad, these type of non-covalent inhibitors target an adjacent pocket, the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site. Using a high-throughput screen, we have previously identified the dietary hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside compounds as potential protease inhibitors targeting the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site. Here, our aim was to investigate the binding characteristics of these compounds to the PL(pro), and to evaluate deubiquitinating activity, by analyzing seven different PL(pro) crystal structures. Molecular docking highlighted the relatively high affinity of GRL-0617 and dietary compounds. In contrast binding of the small molecules was abolished in the presence of ubiquitin in the palm subdomain of the PL(pro). Further, docking the small molecules in the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site, followed by protein-protein docking revealed displacement of ubiquitin in a conformation inconsistent with functional activity. Finally, the deubiquitinating activity was validated in vitro using an enzymatic activity assay. The findings indicated that the dietary compounds inhibited deubiquitinase activity in the micromolar range with an order of activity of GRL-0167, hypericin >> rutin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside > epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and cefotaxime. Our findings are in accordance with mechanisms and potential antiviral effects of the naphthalene-based, GRL-0617 inhibitor, which is currently progressing in preclinical trials. Further, our findings indicate that in particular hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, represent suitable candidates for subsequent evaluation as PL(pro) inhibitors.","Pitsillou, Eleni; Liang, Julia; Ververis, Katherine; Lim, Kah Wai; Hung, Andrew; Karagiannis, Tom C.",Front Chem,https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.623971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33364229/,203

Furthermore, 21 patients (47%) experienced underlying chronic diseases, with onother four patients (9%) having three or more chronic diseases simultaneously. The first symptoms appeared at the onset of illness onset include fever in 36 patients (80%), cough in 23 patients (51%), and expectoration in 15 patients (33%), respectively. Patients may experience hepatic and renal injury as well as abnormal myocardial enzymes in varying degrees. Advanced age (≥58) and accompanying chronic diseases were considered as independent predictors for developing a severe and critically ill population with increased mortality. Laboratory results regarding the NEU percentage, NLR, ALC, and C-reactive protein levels were considered significant in predicting clinically critical disease or for prognosis assessment and thus require further studies.

The scope of this study is to analyze the evolution of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic throughout Italy and factors associated to the different way it spread in the Italian Regions, starting from the day that the first indigenous cases were detected through day 81 (6 days after the end of the strict lockdown). Data were obtained from daily reports and are represented as number (and percentage) of cases/100,000 persons. A lockdown with movement restrictions, especially across Regions, was declared at day 20. At day 81, 219,070 cases (363/100,000 persons) were diagnosed. A regression analysis based on the Gompertz model predicts a total number 233,606 cases (386/100,000 persons) at the end of the epidemic. The 21 areas, divided into Italian Regions and autonomous Provinces, showed a wide range in the frequency of cases at day 81 (58–921, median 258/100,000 persons) and total predicted cases (58–946, median 267/100,000 persons). Similarly, the predicted time for the end of the wave of the epidemic (considering as surrogate marker the time at which 99% of the total cases are predicted to occur) was highly variable, ranging from 64 to 136 (median 99) days. We analyzed the impact of local and interventional variables on the epidemic curve in each Region. The number of cases correlated inversely with the distance from the area in which first cases were detected and directly also with the gross domestic product pro capite (as a marker of industrial activity) of the Region. Moreover, an earlier start of the lockdown (i.e. in the presence of a lower number of cases) and wider testing were associated with a lower final number of total cases. In conclusion, this analysis shows that population-wide testing and early lockdown enforcement appear effective in limiting the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.","Lilleri, Daniele; Zavaglio, Federica; Gabanti, Elisa; Gerna, Giuseppe; Arbustini, Eloisa",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0242305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180880/,203

Historical data reflect disproportionate morbidity and mortality rates in the Hispanic population for influenza and COVID-19. Influenza vaccination rates remain low in the Hispanic community. We aim to improve vaccination through a community-led event, partnering with the Cristo Rey School Dallas, located in a zip code with a higher age-adjusted influenza/pneumonia mortality rate. A survey was administered to adults attending the Influenza vaccine event to understand attitudes and perceptions about influenza, vaccination, and effective messaging strategies for the campaign. Methods: Messaging was cocreated with student health ambassadors to promote immunization and delivered through trusted sources. The health department administered vaccines to individuals >age 3 at no cost. Adults were asked to complete a 19-question survey postvaccination offered in both English and Spanish. Results: Two hundred and forty-one of 394 (61.2%) participants completed the survey. Ninety-eight percent identified as Hispanic/Latino, and the majority of surveys were administered in Spanish. Among Spanish language participants, the church bulletins (57.3%) and Spanish language radio (30.5%) were reported to be most effective modes of messaging versus word of mouth (32.9%) and social media (26.3%) for English-speaking participants. Sixteen percent of participants surveyed had never received an influenza vaccine before this event.

U-Net segmentation models have demonstrated superior performance compared to conventional hand-crafted feature-based methods. Medical image modality-specific DL models are better at transferring domain knowledge to a relevant target task than those pretrained on stock photography images. This character helps improve model adaptation, generalization, and class-specific region of interest (ROI) localization. In this study, we train chest X-ray (CXR) modality-specific U-Nets and other state-of-the-art U-Net models for semantic segmentation of tuberculosis (TB)-consistent findings. Automated segmentation of such manifestations could help radiologists reduce errors and supplement decision-making while improving patient care and productivity. Our approach uses the publicly available TBX11K CXR dataset with weak TB annotations, typically provided as bounding boxes, to train a set of U-Net models. Next, we improve the results by augmenting the training data with weak localization, postprocessed into an ROI mask, from a DL classifier trained to classify CXRs as showing normal lungs or suspected TB manifestations. Test data are individually derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and other cross-institutional collections, including the Shenzhen TB and Montgomery TB CXR datasets. We observe that our augmented training strategy helped the CXR modality-specific U-Net models achieve superior performance with test data derived from the TBX11K CXR training distribution and cross-institutional collections (p < 0.05). We believe that this is the first study to i) use CXR modality-specific U-Nets for semantic segmentation of TB-consistent ROIs and ii) evaluate the segmentation performance while augmenting the training data with weak TB-consistent localizations.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Folio, Les R.; Dimperio, Jane; Alderson, Philip O.; Antani, Sameer K.",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11040616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808240/,203
685689,Delirium: A Frequent Manifestation in COVID-19 Older Patients,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND: The INSPIRE framework was developed by 10 global agencies as the first global package for preventing and responding to violence against children. The framework includes seven complementary strategies. Delivering all seven strategies is a challenge in resource-limited contexts. Consequently, governments are requesting additional evidence to inform which ‘accelerator’ provisions can simultaneously reduce multiple types of violence against children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We pooled data from two prospective South African adolescent cohorts including Young Carers (2010–2012) and Mzantsi Wakho (2014–2017). The combined sample size was 5,034 adolescents. Each cohort measured six self-reported violence outcomes (sexual abuse, transactional sexual exploitation, physical abuse, emotional abuse, community violence victimisation, and youth lawbreaking) and seven self-reported INSPIRE-aligned protective factors (positive parenting, parental monitoring and supervision, food security at home, basic economic security at home, free schooling, free school meals, and abuse response services). Associations between hypothesised protective factors and violence outcomes were estimated jointly in a sex-stratified multivariate path model, controlling for baseline outcomes and socio-demographics and correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We calculated adjusted probability estimates conditional on the presence of no, one, or all protective factors significantly associated with reduced odds of at least three forms of violence in the path model. Adjusted risk differences (ARDs) and adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated. The sample mean age was 13.54 years, and 56.62% were female. There was 4% loss to follow-up. Positive parenting, parental monitoring and supervision, and food security at home were each associated with lower odds of three or more violence outcomes (p < 0.05). For girls, the adjusted probability of violence outcomes was estimated to be lower if all three of these factors were present, as compared to none of them: sexual abuse, 5.38% and 1.64% (ARD: −3.74% points, 95% CI −5.31 to −2.16, p < 0.001); transactional sexual exploitation, 10.07% and 4.84% (ARD: −5.23% points, 95% CI −7.26 to −3.20, p < 0.001); physical abuse, 38.58% and 23.85% (ARD: −14.72% points, 95% CI −19.11 to −10.33, p < 0.001); emotional abuse, 25.39% and 12.98% (ARD: −12.41% points, 95% CI −16.00 to −8.83, p < 0.001); community violence victimisation, 36.25% and 28.37% (ARD: −7.87% points, 95% CI −11.98 to −3.76, p < 0.001); and youth lawbreaking, 18.90% and 11.61% (ARD: −7.30% points, 95% CI −10.50 to −4.09, p < 0.001). For boys, the adjusted probability of violence outcomes was also estimated to be lower if all three factors were present, as compared to none of them: sexual abuse, 2.39% to 1.80% (ARD: −0.59% points, 95% CI −2.24 to 1.05, p = 0.482); transactional sexual exploitation, 6.97% to 4.55% (ARD: −2.42% points, 95% CI −4.77 to −0.08, p = 0.043); physical abuse from 37.19% to 25.44% (ARD: −11.74% points, 95% CI −16.91 to −6.58, p < 0.001); emotional abuse from 23.72% to 10.72% (ARD: −13.00% points, 95% CI −17.04 to −8.95, p < 0.001); community violence victimisation from 41.28% to 35.41% (ARD: −5.87% points, 95% CI −10.98 to −0.75, p = 0.025); and youth lawbreaking from 22.44% to 14.98% (ARD −7.46% points, 95% CI −11.57 to −3.35, p < 0.001). Key limitations were risk of residual confounding and not having information on protective factors related to all seven INSPIRE strategies. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, we found that positive and supervisory caregiving and food security at home are associated with reduced risk of multiple forms of violence against children. The presence of all three of these factors may be linked to greater risk reduction as compared to the presence of one or none of these factors. Policies promoting action on positive and supervisory caregiving and food security at home are likely to support further efficiencies in the delivery of INSPIRE.","Cluver, Lucie D.; Rudgard, William E.; Toska, Elona; Zhou, Siyanai; Campeau, Laurence; Shenderovich, Yulia; Orkin, Mark; Desmond, Chris; Butchart, Alexander; Taylor, Howard; Meinck, Franziska; Sherr, Lorraine",PLoS Med,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33166288/,203

Human health, animal health (both wildlife and domestic animals), and environmental health are forever bound together. The convergence of people, animals, and the environment defines the parameters of One Health and directs attention to the impact this overlap has on public health, disease detection, and control. One Health (sometimes referred to as One Medicine) is a concept that promotes, improves, and defends the health and well-being of all species through the integration of the sciences of human medicine, veterinary medicine, and environmental studies. As microbiologists, we need to be aware of this One Health concept and how it can positively impact our profession by allowing us to be more productive members of the health care team. There are several things we can do to get started. We can review organism pathogenicity and evaluate and question test results that may signal an unusual event or process that led to a disease. We can be alert to the epidemiologic potential of organism isolates from patients as they may apply to infection control or community epidemiology. We can become familiar with the zoonotic diseases and recognize the etiologic agents associated with wild and domestic animals and apply that knowledge to our diagnostic skills. As we further understand the “big picture” of One Health, we can ask strategic questions that can lead us to provide further technical assistance to facilitate earlier interventions that lead to positive patient outcomes and ultimately healthier populations. In human medicine, we generally work with one species of animal. Veterinarians work with all the rest. It is time to communicate with and learn from our veterinary clinical microbiology colleagues and begin to understand the critical nature of the human, animal, and environment interface. This is our opportunity to be at the front of this line and not stand on the sidelines watching.","Miller, J.

686124,Suggestions for global coagulation assays for the assessment of COVID-19 associated hypercoagulability,2021-02-24,"Novel coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS, often originate from recombination events. The mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses is template switching. Coronavirus transcription also involves template switching at specific regions, called transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). It is hypothesized but not yet verified that TRS sites are prone to recombination events. Here, we developed a tool called SuPER to systematically identify TRS in coronavirus genomes and then investigated whether recombination is more common at TRS. We ran SuPER on 506 coronavirus genomes and identified 465 TRS-L and 3509 TRS-B. We found that the TRS-L core sequence (CS) and the secondary structure of the leader sequence are generally conserved within coronavirus genera but different between genera. By examining the location of recombination breakpoints with respect to TRS-B CS, we observed that recombination hotspots are more frequently co-located with TRS-B sites than expected.","Yang, Yiyan; Yan, Wei; Hall, A.

686342,Should qualitative RT-PCR be used to determine release from isolation of COVID-19 patients?,2020-06-18,"Background: There is increased interest in early intervention and prevention of mental health difficulties during adolescence; thus, we are seeing increased efforts to optimize well-being during this epoch. Positive emotional experiences are a central component of overall well-being. However, research exploring what adolescents perceive to be the cause(s) of their emotional difficulties is lacking. Improving understanding of this issue within non-clinical adolescent groups may provide useful insight into how to develop strategies to support young people as they navigate emotional difficulties. Objectives: The aim of this research was to explore if meaningful categories of perceived cause(s) for emotional distress exist for non-clinical adolescent groups. Methods: The data for this study were drawn from interviews across 6 sites in England conducted as part of the 5-year national evaluation of the HeadStart Learning Programme. The sample comprised of 32 young people aged 11–12 years from the first annual wave of qualitative data collection in 2017. Ideal type analysis—a qualitative form of person-centered analysis—was used to construct a typology of adolescents perceived cause(s) for emotional distress. Findings: We identified five distinct categories of perceived cause: (1) perceived lack of control; (2) unfair treatment; (3) others, their actions and judgements as the catalyst; (4) concerns for self and others; and, (5) self as cause. Conclusions: Our findings illustrate that distinct categories for perceived cause of emotional distress exist among adolescents considered to be “at risk” of developing mental health difficulties, which provides a foundation for future necessary work seeking to investigate the possible link between perceived cause for emotional distress and help-seeking behavior among sub-clinical groups.","O'Neill, Alisha; Stapley, Emily; Stock, Sarah; Merrick, Hannah; Humphrey, Neil",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.673321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109149/,203

This includes new innovative technologies and strategies being developed by educators to foster the rapid learning-recovery and reinstatement of the stakeholders (e.g., teachers and students). Indeed, the main challenge for educators has been on what appropriate steps should be taken to prevent learning loss for the students; ranging from how to provide efficient learning tools/curriculum that ensures continuity of learning, to provision of methods that incorporate coping mechanisms and acceleration of education in general. For several higher educational institutions (HEIs), technology-mediated education has become an integral part of the modern teaching/learning instruction amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, when digital technologies have consequently become an inevitable and indispensable part of learning. To this effect, this study defines a hybrid educational model (HyFlex + Tec) used to enable virtual and in-person education in the HEIs. Practically, the study utilized data usage report from Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Emotions and Experience Survey questionnaire in a higher education setting for its experiments. To this end, we applied an Exponential Linear trend model and Forecasting method to determine overall progress and statistics for the learners during the Covid-19 pandemic, and subsequently performed a Text Mining and Univariate Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to determine effects and significant differences that the teaching–learning experiences for the teachers and students have on their energy (learning motivation) levels. From the results, we note that the hybrid learning model supports continuity of education/learning for teachers and students during the Covid-19 pandemic. The study also discusses its innovative importance for future monitoring (tracking) of learning experiences and emotional well-being for the stakeholders in leu (aftermath) of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Okoye, Kingsley; Rodriguez-Tort, Jorge Alfonso; Escamilla, Jose; Hosseini, Samira",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),https://doi.org/10.1007/s10639-021-10527-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025205/,203

The combination of DPSIR with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a useful method to study low-carbon evaluation because the AHP model has a special advantage in multi-indexes evaluation. This paper constructs the low-carbon economy evaluation system and comprehensively evaluates the numerical value of low-carbon economic development of China’s 30 regions from 2000 to 2015 by using the AHP method. It shows that the numerical value of low-carbon economy of China’s 30 regions varies in terms of growth rate. The numerical value of east regional low-carbon economy shows a pattern that is gradually higher than that of the west region. The numerical value of low carbon economic development in the south region is higher than that of the north region by degrees. In addition, based on the model of coordination degree in 2015, the result indicated that the four subsystems have primary coordination in the east area and bare coordination in the central and west areas. It is indicated that the four sub-indexes should be developed at the same pace and promoting the development of a low-carbon economy in the mid-west areas is the key in China. Finally, we proposed that environmental regulations and policies should be formulated to improve coordination in various aspects and various departments. Calculating the degree of low-carbon economic coupling coordination may be helpful for policy makers to formulate effective policies and take actions in the future.","Pan, Wenyan; Gulzar, Muhammad Awais; Hassan, Waseem",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751191/,203

Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government’s progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam’s response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies. METHODS: The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam’s country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database ‘Vietnam Laws Repository’ (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries’ respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020. RESULTS: Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 – related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government’s prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic’s progression. CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings. As the pandemic is still ongoing in an unpredictable trajectory, disease control measures should continue to be put in place in the foreseeable short term.","Tran, Thi Phuong Thao; Le, Thanh Ha; Nguyen, Thi Ngoc Phuong; Hoang, Van Minh",Journal of global health,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.020502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110585/,203

The advent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted not only in the closing of most outpatient clinics for face-to-face consultations but also in the inability to perform most laboratory and imaging investigations. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the delivery of care for those with diabetic foot ulcers. The approaches to this challenge in two centers with an interest in diabetic foot disease, including virtual consultations using physician-to-patient and physician–to–home nurse telemedicine as well as home podiatry visits, are described in this review and are illustrated by several case vignettes.

A case study design was employed to examine how sites conceptualize youth engagement as well as youth engagement strategies employed across 6 sites. Data sources included observations, team member debriefs, and document review. RESULTS: There was variation in how youth engagement and youth voice are conceptualized in educational settings, and readiness for youth engagement. Sites actively solicited and implemented youth engagement resources and strategies. CONCLUSIONS: By failing to engage young people, well‐intentioned adults miss important opportunities.

688666,Infection and thrombosis associated with COVID-19: Possible role of the ABO blood group(),2020-09-26,"In this paper, the dynamics of a non-autonomous tabu learning two-neuron model is investigated. The model is obtained by building a tabu learning two-neuron (TLTN) model with a composite hyperbolic tangent function consisting of three hyperbolic tangent functions with different offsets. The possibility to adjust the compound activation function is exploited to report the sensitivity of non-trivial equilibrium points with respect to the parameters. Analysis tools like bifurcation diagram, Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits, and basin of attraction are used to explore various windows in which the neuron model under the consideration displays the uncovered phenomenon of the coexistence of up to six disconnected stable states for the same set of system parameters in a TLTN. In addition to the multistability, nonlinear phenomena such as period-doubling bifurcation, hysteretic dynamics, and parallel bifurcation branches are found when the control parameter is tuned. The analog circuit is built in PSPICE environment, and simulations are performed to validate the obtained results as well as the correctness of the numerical methods. Finally, an encryption/decryption algorithm is designed based on a modified Julia set and confusion–diffusion operations with the sequences of the proposed TLTN model. The security performances of the built cryptosystem are analyzed in terms of computational time (CT = 1.82), encryption throughput (ET = 151.82 MBps), number of cycles (NC = 15.80), NPCR = 99.6256, UACI = 33.6512, χ(2)-values = 243.7786, global entropy = 7.9992, and local entropy = 7.9083. Note that the presented values are the optimal results.

PURPOSE: To assess international variations in CT utilization, protocols, and radiation doses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective data collection study, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) coordinated a survey between May and July 2020 regarding CT utilization, protocols, and radiation doses from 62 healthcare sites in 34 countries across five continents for CT exams performed in COVID-19 pneumonia. The questionnaire obtained information on local prevalence, method of diagnosis, most frequent imaging, indications for CT, and specific policies on use of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Collected data included general information (patient age, weight, clinical indication), CT equipment (CT make and model, year of installation, number of detector rows), scan protocols (body region, scan phases, tube current and potential), and radiation dose descriptors (CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) and dose length product (DLP)). Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equations were performed. RESULTS: Data from 782 patients (median age (interquartile range) of 59(15) years) from 54 healthcare sites in 28 countries were evaluated. Less than one-half of the healthcare sites used CT for initial diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and three-fourth used CT for assessing disease severity. CTDI(vol) varied based on CT vendors (7-11mGy, p<0.001), number of detector-rows (8-9mGy, p<0.001), year of CT installation (7-10mGy, p=0.006), and reconstruction techniques (7-10mGy, p=0.03). Multiphase chest CT exams performed in 20% of sites (11 of 54) were associated with higher DLP compared with single-phase chest CT exams performed in 80% (43 of 54 sites) (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: CT use, scan protocols, and radiation doses in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showed wide variation across healthcare sites within the same and different countries. Many patients were scanned multiple times and/or with multiphase CT scan protocols.

Resistance is mainly caused by the presence of a subpopulation of tumor cells, the glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. In 2015, Zikavirus (ZIKV)-induced microcephaly emerged in newborns, indicating that ZIKV has a specific neurotropism. Accordingly, an oncolytic tropism for infecting GSCs was demonstrated in a murine tumor model. Like other flaviviruses, ZIKV is enveloped by two proteins, prM and E. The pME expression plasmid along with the HIV-1 vector pNL Luc AM generated prME pseudotyped viral particles. Four different prME envelopes, Z1 to Z4, were cloned, and the corresponding pseudotypes, Z1- to Z4-HIVluc, produced by this two-plasmid system, were tested for entry efficiency using Vero-B4 cells. The most efficient pseudotype, Z1-HIVluc, also infected glioma-derived cell lines U87 and 86HG39. The pseudotype system was then extended by using a three-plasmid system including pME-Z1, the HIV-1 packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the lentiviral vector pLenti-luciferase-P2A-Neo. The corresponding pseudotype, designated Z1-LENTIluc, also infected U87 and 86HG39 cells. Altogether, a pseudotyped virus especially targeting glioma-derived cells might be a promising candidate for a prospective glioblastoma-directed virotherapy.","Kretschmer, Maibritt; Kadlubowska, Patrycja; Hoffmann, Daniel; Schwalbe, Birco; Auerswald, Heidi; Schreiber, Michael",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32325703/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12041000,203

The distances between each person’s home residence and the nearest movement disorders center of excellence (MDC) as well as the distance to the UF-NFIND were calculated using ArcGIS 10.3. RESULTS: A total of 5.2% (355/6867) of the sample population were identified as a Medicaid/self-pay population and classified as underserved. The most common diagnoses were tic disorder (19.2%), dystonia (18.3%), and Parkinson’s disease (14.3%). In underserved persons, the median distances from their homes to the UF-NFIND (82.19 [45.79–176.93] km) vs. their nearest MDC (63.34 [26.91–121.43] km) were significantly different (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Underserved persons in our study travelled further to receive subspecialty care at UF-NFIND than closer MDCs. Potential reasons for underutilization of closer care could possibly include research opportunities, availability of specific treatments or procedures, insurance restrictions, and limited specialist availability. Despite this observation, underserved persons were underrepresented at our institution compared to the proportion of Medicaid/uninsured patients in Florida. Our results highlight the need for increased awareness of care options for underserved movement disorders populations.","Giacobbe, Alaina; Au, Ka Loong Kelvin; Nguyen, Oliver T.; Moore, Kathryn; Dinh, Emily; Ramirez-Zamora, Adolfo; Okun, Michael S.; Almeida, Leonardo",Tremor and other hyperkinetic movements,https://doi.org/10.5334/tohm.635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513276/,203
