However, in 2014, a sharp rise was observed in the number of cases of JE in north-eastern Assam state, and 51% of the total cases of JE in India were reported from the Assam in the same year. In this regard, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers in Darrang, a district of Assam highly affected by JE. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted for 2 months among HCWs in the major district hospital of Darrang, Assam. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Convenience sampling approach was used to collect data from different departments of the hospitals. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results. RESULTS: The knowledge of HCWs regarding JE was poor with a mean knowledge score of 11.02±2.39 (out of 17), while their attitudes were positive with a mean attitudes score of 43.16± 2.47 (ranging from 13 to 52). Overall, 40.4% and 74.3% of participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitudes respectively. Cut-off score for good knowledge and positive attitudes toward JE was set as ≥12 and >40 respectively. Older participants (40–49 years) and experienced workers (>10 years) were significantly associated with good knowledge as compared to their referent group (p<0.05), while knowledge of nurses and other orderlies were significantly lower than physicians (p<0.01). Similar factors were associated with the positive attitudes of the participants with the exception of experience. Television was the major source of information regarding JE reported by HCWs (79%). CONCLUSION: Although the knowledge was not optimized, HCWs exhibited positive attitudes towards JE. Future research is required to design, implement and evaluate interventions to improve the knowledge of JE among HCWs.","Ahmad, Akram; Khan, Muhammad Umair; Gogoi, Lakhya Jyoti; Kalita, Manabendra; Sikdar, Atul Prasad; Pandey, Sureshwar; Dhingra, Sameer",PLoS One,327,5

We searched concepts on partnerships of CBHOs with health systems in guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and literature. Then, we validated the researcher-made tool by face validity, content validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and criterion validity. Data were collected by sending the tool to 620 CBHOs serving under supervision of Iran’s ministry of health. Opinions of health professionals and stakeholders in CBHOs were used to assess face and content validity. Factor loads in EFA were based on three-factor structure that verified by CFA. We used SPSS V.18 and Mplus7 software for statistical analysis. About 105 health-based CBHOs participated. After conducting face validity and calculating content validity ratio and content validity index, we reached 54 items in the field of planning, training and infrastructure. We conducted construct validity using 105 CBHOs. Three items exchanged between the fields according to factor loads in EFA, and CFA verified the model fit as Comparative Fit Index, Tucker-Lewis index and root mean square error of approximation were 0.921, 0918 and 0.052, respectively. The Cronbach’s of the whole tool was 0.944. Spearman correlation coefficient confirmed criterion validity as coefficient was 0.736. Planning, training and infrastructure fields are the most important aspects of preparedness in health-based CBHOs. Applying the new assessment tool in future studies will show the weaknesses and capabilities of health-based CBHOs in biohazard and clear necessary intervention actions for health authorities.","Rezaei, Fatemeh; Maracy, Mohammad R; Yarmohammadian, Mohammad H; Ardalan, Ali; Keyvanara, Mahmood",Fam Med Community Health,327,5

These changes in patient population are apparent in neurosurgery; however, relatively little is reported about specific outcomes and prognostication in this group. This review summarises the challenges and management changes occurring in the treatment of three common neurosurgical pathologies; aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, head injury, and haemorrhagic stroke. A move towards less invasive neurosurgical techniques has implications on the risk–benefit profile of interventions. This creates the opportunity to intervene in older patients with greater co-morbidity, as long as improved outcomes can be evidenced. A critical part of assessing appropriateness for surgical intervention in older patients may be to change from a mindset of age to one of frailty and growing interest in scales assessing this may aid treatment decisions in the future.","Edlmann, Ellie; Whitfield, Peter C.",J Neurol,327,12

We further consider the psychological consequences of being tolerated at the personal, interpersonal, and intergroup levels and consider factors that may moderate the impact of being tolerated for minority outcomes. Taken together, this work provides the first theoretical argument and overview of what it means to be tolerated by considering the negative implications of toleration in diverse nations.","Verkuyten, Maykel; Yogeeswaran, Kumar; Adelman, Levi",Perspect Psychol Sci,327,5
14980,14980,14980,Emergency physician attitudes towards illness verification (sick notes),20.4538,4.2156954,2021-01-19,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the population is aging rapidly; therefore, there is a growing interest in strategies to support and maintain health and well-being in later life. Although familiarity with technology and digital literacy are increasing among this group, some older adults still lack confidence in their ability to use web-based technologies. In addition, age-related changes in cognition, vision, hearing, and perception may be barriers to adoption and highlight the need for digital tools developed specifically to meet the unique needs of older adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to understand the use of technology by older adults in general and identify the potential barriers to and facilitators of the adoption of health information technologies (HITs) to support the health and well-being of older adults to facilitate implementation and promote user uptake. In addition, this study aims to co-design and configure the InnoWell Platform, a digital tool designed to facilitate better outcomes for people seeking mental health services, to meet the needs of adults 50 years and older and their supportive others (eg, family members, caregivers) to ensure the accessibility, engagement, and appropriateness of the technology. METHODS: Participants were adults 50 years and older and those who self-identified as a supportive other (eg, family member, caregiver). Participants were invited to participate in a 3-hour participatory design workshop using a variety of methods, including prompted discussion, creation of descriptive artifacts, and group-based development of user journeys. RESULTS: Four participatory design workshops were conducted, including a total of 21 participants, each attending a single workshop. Technology use was prevalent, with a preference indicated for smartphones and computers. Factors facilitating the adoption of HITs included personalization of content and functionality to meet and be responsive to a consumer’s needs, access to up-to-date information from reputable sources, and integration with standard care practices to support the relationship with health professionals. Concerns regarding data privacy and security were the primary barriers to the use of technology to support mental health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Although HITs have the potential to improve access to cost-effective and low-intensity interventions at scale for improving and maintaining mental health and well-being, several strategies may improve the uptake and efficacy of technologies by the older adult community, including the use of co-design methodologies to ensure usability, acceptability, and appropriateness of the technology; support in using and understanding the clinical applications of the technology by a digital navigator; and ready availability of education and training materials.","LaMonica, Haley M; Davenport, Tracey A; Roberts, Anna E; Hickie, Ian B",JMIR Aging,327,5

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hand arthritis: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and other forms of arthritis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: This study used a survey among people with hand arthritis. Descriptive statistics and percentages were reported for all the data about the barriers, facilitators and preferences around JP. RESULTS: A total of 192 patients consented to participate. Most of the patients (82%) were unaware of JP. Factors that may act as barriers to participation and were regarded as ‘a very big concern’ were: cost of the programme (44%), time of offering the programme (39%), work commitments (36%) and having a centre/clinic close to the house (28%). Factors that may act as facilitators and rated as ‘extremely helpful’ were: research that shows that JP works (26%) and having the centre/clinic close to the house (25%). An online format for JP was the most preferred option (54%). Half (46%) preferred a timeframe of 1 hour, three times per week and 44% preferred a 2-hour programme, for three times per week. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the potential benefits of JP, and prior experience with JP programme were very low. Common potentially modifiable patient-reported barriers to participate in future JP interventions, included: cost, work commitments, distance from home to clinic and times that the intervention were provided. These barriers might be addressed with free and accessible forms of delivery of JP, which may lead to better uptake and participation in JP programmes.","Bobos, Pavlos; MacDermid, Joy; Ziebart, Christina; Boutsikari, Eleni; Lalone, Emily; Ferreira, Louis; Grewal, Ruby",BMJ Open,327,1

Extracellular vesicles (EV) are phospholipid bilayer-surrounded structures carrying several types of lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids with the ability to cross biological barriers. EV-associated AAVs might serve as new and efficient gene therapy vectors considering that they carry the benefits of both AAVs and EVs. (2) We tested vesicle-associated AAVs and vesicles mixed with AAVs on two major cell types of the central nervous system: a neural cell line (N2A) and primary astrocyte cells. (3) In contrast to previously published in vivo observations, the extracellular vesicle packaging did not improve but, in the case of primary astrocyte cells, even inhibited the infection capacity of the AAV particles. The observed effect was not due to the inhibitory effects of the vesicles themselves, since mixing the AAVs with extracellular vesicles did not change the effectiveness. (4) Our results suggest that improvement of the in vivo efficacy of the EV-associated AAV particles is not due to the enhanced interaction between the AAV and the target cells, but most likely to the improved delivery of the AAVs through tissue barriers and to the shielding of AAVs from neutralizing antibodies.","Kovács, Orsolya Tünde; Soltész-Katona, Eszter; Marton, Nikolett; Baricza, Eszter; Hunyady, László; Turu, Gábor; Nagy, György",Int J Mol Sci,327,5

SSc results in significant challenges for the practicing anesthesiologist due to its rarity, multi-system involvement, and limited evidence-based guidance for optimal perioperative care. In this update, we briefly discuss the recent evidence on the pathophysiology and current management of SSc, review the anesthesia-related literature, and extrapolate these observations into an optimal perioperative strategy for the care of SSc patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Evidence shows that patients with SSc demonstrate an increased risk for perioperative myocardial infarction, high rates of interstitial lung disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension, neurological disease, gastric dysmotility disorders, and challenging airway management, all findings that may result in suboptimal perioperative outcomes. SUMMARY: Advances in SSc medical management have resulted in improved survival, likely increasing the number of patients who will be exposed to perioperative care. Optimal perioperative management and risk stratification should expand beyond the well-described airway challenges and consider numerous systemic manifestations of systemic sclerosis such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, interstitial lung disease, and cardiac sequelae.","Carr, Zyad J.; Klick, John; McDowell, Brittany J.; Charchaflieh, Jean G.; Karamchandani, Kunal",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,327,5

This in turn may result in respiratory failure and in death. Experimentally, acetylcholine (ACh) modulates the acute inflammatory response, a neuro-immune mechanism known as the inflammatory reflex. Recent clinical evidence suggest that electrical and chemical stimulation of the inflammatory reflex may reduce the burden of inflammation in chronic inflammatory diseases. Pyridostigmine (PDG), an ACh-esterase inhibitor (i-ACh-e), increases the half-life of endogenous ACh, therefore mimicking the inflammatory reflex. This clinical trial is aimed at evaluating if add-on of PDG leads to a decrease of invasive mechanical ventilation and death among patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: A parallel-group, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial to test the efficacy of pyridostigmine bromide 60 mg/day P.O. to reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and mortality in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. DISCUSSION: This study will provide preliminary evidence of whether or not -by decreasing systemic inflammation- add-on PDG can improve clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19.

We then demonstrate how analysis of information uses is incomplete if viewed from the perspectives of likely vectors of disease who may be subjects of fear and stigma and likely victims who may be coerced into isolation or quarantine. Next, we consider aspects of fairness in the use of information in non-ideal circumstances: inclusive participation in decisions about information use, resource plans for those needing services, and assurances of reciprocal support.

SUMMARY ANSWER: The desire to conceive outweighed fears regarding infection. Patients felt fertility treatments should be classified as essential and were agreeable to most risk mitigation strategies. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The effects of the COVID–19 global pandemic on fertility services became evident in early 2020. Because of possible impacts of the virus on gametes, embryos and patients and concerns over virus transmission and the ability of medical services to cope, fertility treatments were temporarily suspended, as advised by ESHRE, ASRM and others. Across Europe, services were paused for approximately 7 weeks. Patients have reported that they found this extremely stressful and in some cases, unfair. After the initial closures, many clinics re-opened but with new risk mitigation strategies regarding PPE, hygiene and reducing staff and patient footfall. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Men and women with a scheduled appointment at a fertility clinic over a 7-week period during the first wave of the COVID–19 pandemic were asked to complete a questionnaire outlining their experience and how it affected them. Participants were recruited via email using a secure online patient portal. A standardised anonymous 25-item questionnaire was sent to 828 patients and a reminder was circulated seven days later. The questionnaire remained open for 28 days. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants were invited to complete a questionnaire and assured that all data would remain anonymous. Three areas were assessed. Firstly, how the pandemic itself affected their attempts to conceive. Secondly, participant perceptions regarding the overall disruption to fertility services. Thirdly, how participants feel fertility services should be treated in the event of a future large scale global pandemic. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 135 responses were received, giving a response rate of 16.3%. 80% of respondents were female and 20% male with no significant difference in responses between the sexes. Most participants (96%) had completed third level education and 90% were fully employed. Interestingly, 69% of participants continued trying to conceive during this time. This was despite 28% having concerns about contracting COVID–19 should they attend a clinic, 21% having concerns regarding the effect of the virus on pregnancy and 21% having concerns regarding an impact on the fetus. The majority surveyed (93%) stated that fertility treatment should be considered essential. 90% had their treatment disrupted or altered and, of these, 44% felt that this was justified, 23% disagreed and 33% were unsure. Regarding changes implemented within the clinic, 68% were satisfied with online video consultations and a further 16% would be content in certain circumstances. 92% felt privacy was maintained and 95% were happy to sign consent forms via video link. Many disagreed with the no partner policy at early pregnancy scans(57%) and embryo transfer(44%); however, they agreed with it for phlebotomy and treatment scans. In the event of a future pandemic, 79% felt fertility services should or probably should be continued. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study focuses on the first wave of COVID–19. The long term, ongoing nature of the pandemic may influence participants’ perspectives on the areas investigated over time. Wider implications of the findings: It is estimated that the world will face a global pandemic approximately once every generation. Fertility stakeholders must learn from these events and studies such as ours are important to ascertain the views of service users. Some policies, such as video consultations, may be of benefit even in non-pandemic times. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Not applicable","Schaler, L; Glover, L; Wingfield, M",Hum Reprod,327,13

METHODS Adolescents undergoing WLS (n = 139) and nonsurgical comparisons with severe obesity (NSComp; n = 83) completed validated questionnaires assessing psychopathology and potential predictors and correlates at presurgery/baseline and 24 months postoperatively/follow-up. RESULTS At 24 months, 34.7% of WLS and 37.7% of nonsurgical comparisons were categorized as ""symptomatic"" (Youth Self-Report ≥ borderline on at least one DSM scale). The majority maintained their symptomatic or nonsymptomatic status from baseline to 24 months postbaseline. Remission of symptoms was more common than the development of new symptomatology at 24 months. Beyond demographics, separate models of baseline predictors and concurrent correlates of 24-month psychopathology identified baseline psychopathology and loss of control (LOC) eating as significant. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and LOC eating emerged as correlates in the concurrent model. For the WLS group, preoperative, postoperative, and change in symptomatology were not related to 24-month percent weight loss. CONCLUSIONS At 2 years, approximately one in three adolescents were symptomatic with psychopathology. Maintenance of symptomatic/nonsymptomatic status over time or remission was more common than new incidence. Although symptomatology was not predictive of surgical weight loss outcomes at 2 years, preoperative psychopathology and several other predictors (LOC eating) and correlates (LOC eating, AUD) emerged as signals for persistent mental health risks, underscoring the importance of pre- and postoperative psychosocial monitoring and the availability of adjunctive intervention resources.","Hunsaker, Sanita L; Garland, Beth H; Rofey, Dana; Reiter-Purtill, Jennifer; Mitchell, James; Courcoulas, Anita; Jenkins, Todd M; Zeller, Meg H",The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine,327,11

OBJECTIVE The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of RFA in debulking benign TNs. DESIGN AND PATIENTS Eighty-four consecutive patients with symptomatic and cytologically benign solid nodules were randomly assigned to either a single RFA session (group A; n = 42) or follow-up (group B; n = 42) at our center. Entry criteria were a solid thyroid nodule or predominantly solid (with a fluid component ≤ 30% of the volume), normal thyroid function, no autoimmunity, and no previous thyroid gland treatment. Three subgroups were formed according to the baseline volume of nodules: small (≤ 12 mL), medium (from 12 to 30 mL), or large (>30 mL). METHODS In group A RFA was performed in a single session with the moving-shot technique. Volume and local symptom changes were evaluated 1 and 6 months after RFA. RESULTS In group A, the volume decreased from 24.5.5 ± 19.6 to 8.6 ± 9.5 6 months after RFA (P = .001). The greatest volume reduction was in small nodules. The pressure symptom score improved only in medium and large nodules (P < .001), whereas the cosmetic score improved in all treated patients (P < .001). The rate of thyroid volumetric reduction was not statistically different between solid and predominantly solid nodules. Only one patient experienced permanent right paramedian vocal cord palsy with inspiratory stridor without dysphonia. In group B, nodule volume remained unchanged, whereas the symptom score was worse at the 6-month evaluation (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS RFA is effective in reducing thyroid nodule volume. The best reduction rate was observed in small TNs. The thyroid volumetric reduction does not change according to the sonographic features. The mean treatment duration was longer in larger TNs.","Cesareo, Roberto; Pasqualini, Valerio; Simeoni, Carla; Sacchi, Marco; Saralli, Erminio; Campagna, Giuseppe; Cianni, Roberto",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,327,20

Molecular characterization was carried out by NMR spectroscopy and GPC analysis, confirming the chemical structure and high polymerization degree. Thermal analyses evidenced a reduction of both glass-to-rubber transition and melting temperatures, as well as a detriment of crystallization capability, for 2,4-PBF with respect to 2,5-PBF. Nevertheless, it was possible to induce crystal phase formation by annealing treatment. Wide-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the crystal lattices developed in the two isomers are distinct from each other. The different isomerism affects also the thermal stability, being 2,4-PBF more thermally inert than 2,5-PBF. Functional properties, such as wettability, mechanical response, and gas barrier capability, were tested on both amorphous and semicrystalline 2,4-PBF films and compared with those of 2,5-PBF. Reduced hydrophilicity was determined for 2,4-isomer, in line with its lower average dipole moment, suggesting better chemical resistance to hydrolysis. Stress-strain tests have evidenced the higher flexibility and toughness of 2,4-PBF with respect to those of 2,5-PBF and the possibility of improving its mechanical resistance by annealing. Finally, the different isomerism deeply affects the gas barrier performance, being the O2- and CO2-transmission rates of 2,4-PBF 50 and 110 times lower, respectively, than those of 2,5-PBF. The gas barrier properties turned out to be outstanding under a dry atmosphere as well as in humid conditions, suggesting the presence of interchain hydrogen bonds. The gas blocking capability decreases after annealing because of the presence of disclination associated with the formation of crystals.","Bianchi, Enrico; Soccio, Michelina; Siracusa, Valentina; Gazzano, Massimo; Thiyagarajan, Shanmugam; Lotti, Nadia",ACS sustainable chemistry & engineering,327,2

It increases collateral vessel growth and blood flow in models of hind-limb ischemia. This study tested whether intramuscular administration of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16, an engineered recombinant type 2 adenovirus vector encoding constitutively active HIF-1α, improves walking time in patients with peripheral artery disease and intermittent claudication. METHODS AND RESULTS Two hundred eighty-nine patients with claudication were randomized in a double-blind manner to 1 of 3 doses of Ad2/HIF-1α/VP16 (2×10(9), 2×10(10), or 2×10(11) viral particles) or placebo, administered by 20 intramuscular injections to each leg. Graded treadmill tests were performed at baseline and then 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. The primary end point was the change in peak walking time from baseline to 6 months. The secondary end point was change in claudication onset time, and tertiary end points included changes in ankle-brachial index and quality-of-life assessments. Median peak walking time increased by 0.82 minutes (interquartile range, -0.05-1.93 minutes) in the placebo group and by 0.82 minutes (interquartile range, -0.07-2.12 minutes), 0.28 minutes (interquartile range, -0.37-1.70 minutes), and 0.78 minutes (interquartile range, -0.02-2.10 minutes) in the HIF-1α 2×10(9), 2×10(10), and 2×10(11) viral particle groups, respectively (P=NS between placebo and each HIF-1α treatment group).

We triangulated interview and observational findings and analysed data thematically. RESULTS We developed four themes: 1) 'Navigating the homecare identity and role': describing challenges of moving between different role identities and managing associated expectations, 2) 'Developing and utilising relational and emotional skills': boundaries between caring and getting emotionally involved felt blurred and difficult to manage, 3) 'Managing clients who resist care': homecare workers experienced clients' reactions as challenging and felt ""thrown to the wolves"" without sufficient training, and 4) 'Drawing on agency and team support': homecare work could be isolating, with no shared workplace, busy schedules and limited opportunity for peer support. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS It is important that training and support for homecare workers addresses the relational, emotional and rights-based aspects of the role.

There are currently many approaches for its management, using both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The National Institute of Health - Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) score is a validated measure commonly used to measure CP/CPPS symptoms. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of non-pharmacological therapies for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS). SEARCH METHODS We performed a comprehensive search using multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with a diagnosis of CP/CPPS. We included all available non-pharmacological interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies, performed statistical analyses and rated quality of evidence (QoE) according to the GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS We included 38 unique studies with 3290 men with CP/CPPS across 23 comparisons.1. Acupuncture: (three studies, 204 participants) based on short-term follow-up, acupuncture probably leads to clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with sham procedure (mean difference (MD) in total NIH-CPSI score -5.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.32 to -4.26, high QoE). Acupuncture may result in little to no difference in adverse events (low QoE). Acupuncture may not reduce sexual dysfunction when compared with sham procedure (MD in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Scale -0.50, 95% CI -3.46 to 2.46, low QoE). Acupuncture may also lead to a clinically meaningful reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with standard medical therapy (MD -6.05, 95% CI -7.87 to -4.24, two studies, 78 participants, low QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.2. Lifestyle modifications: (one study, 100 participants) based on short-term follow-up, lifestyle modifications may be associated with a reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (risk ratio (RR) for improvement in NIH-CPSI scores 3.90, 95% CI 2.20 to 6.92, very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.3. Physical activity: (one study, 85 participants) based on short-term follow-up, a physical activity programme may cause a small reduction in prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.69 to -0.31, low QoE). This programme may not reduce anxiety or depression (low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction or quality of life.4. Prostatic massage: (two studies, 115 participants) based on short-term follow-up, we are uncertain whether the prostatic massage reduces or increases prostatitis symptoms compared with control (very low QoE). We found no information regarding adverse events, sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.5. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy: (three studies, 157 participants) based on short-term follow-up, extracorporeal shockwave therapy reduces prostatitis symptoms compared with control (NIH-CPSI score MD -6.18, 95% CI -7.46 to -4.89, high QoE). These results may not be sustained at medium-term follow-up (low QoE). This treatment may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse events (low QoE). This treatment probably improves sexual dysfunction (MD in the IIEF Scale MD 3.34, 95% CI 2.68 to 4.00, one study, 60 participants, moderate QoE). We found no information regarding quality of life, depression or anxiety.6. Transrectal thermotherapy compared to medical therapy: (two studies, 237 participants) based on short-term follow-up, transrectal thermotherapy alone or in combination with medical therapy may decrease prostatitis symptoms slightly when compared with medical therapy alone (NIH-CPSI score MD -2.50, 95% CI -3.82 to -1.18, low QoE). One included study reported that participants may experience transient adverse events. We found no information regarding sexual dysfunction, quality of life, depression or anxiety.7. Other interventions: there is uncertainty about the effects of most of the other interventions included in this review. We found no information regarding psychological support or prostatic surgery. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of moderate quality evidence, this review found that some non-pharmacological interventions such as acupuncture and extracorporeal shockwave therapy are likely to result in a decrease in prostatitis symptoms and may not be associated with a greater incidence of adverse event. The QoE for most other comparisons was predominantly low. Future clinical trials should include a full report of their methods including adequate masking, consistent assessment of all patient-important outcomes including potential treatment-related adverse events and appropriate sample sizes.","Franco, Juan Va; Turk, Tarek; Jung, Jae Hung; Xiao, Yu-Tian; Iakhno, Stanislav; Garrote, Virginia; Vietto, Valeria",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,327,15

However, the effect of anesthetics on arterial oxygenation during one-lung ventilation has not been well established in human study. In this clinical trial, we investigated whether a difference between desflurane-remifentanil and propofol-remifentanil anesthesia can be observed with regard to oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS Adult patients with lung cancer, scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy without preoperative oxygen support, were screened and randomized to receive desflurane or propofol, with remifentanil continuous infusion in both groups. Mechanical ventilation was performed with tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and FIO2 0.5 during two-lung ventilation, and 6 ml/kg and 1.0 during one-lung ventilation, both with positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed preoperatively, during two-lung ventilation, and after 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of one-lung ventilation. The primary endpoint was PaO2 at 30 min after initiating one-lung ventilation. Statistical analyses included the independent t-test for the primary endpoint and a mixed model with a post-hoc analysis to evaluate the serial changes in values. RESULTS Patients were recruited between July 9 and December 2, 2014. In total, 103 patients were analyzed (n = 52 in desflurane group and n = 51 in propofol group). The primary endpoint, PaO2 at 30 min of one-lung ventilation was lower in the desflurane group than the propofol group (170 ± 72 vs. 202 ± 82 mmHg; p = 0.039). Serial changes in PaO2 during one-lung ventilation showed lower levels during desflurane anesthesia compared with propofol anesthesia (mean difference, 45 mmHg; 95% confidence interval, 16-75 mmHg; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, desflurane-remifentanil anesthesia resulted in decreased arterial oxygenation compared with that of propofol-remifentanil anesthesia during one-lung ventilation for thoracoscopic surgery in patients with lung cancer.

Unlike other medical and surgical specialties driven primarily by objective medical diagnosis and outcome, aesthetic surgery is patient driven; it represents a special exercise in professional competence by adapting objective medical standards to a mostly subjective field. Given the subjectivity of facial beauty and of the projected aesthetic intervention outcome, in addition to be able to determine beauty of the final result as precisely and objectively as possible, it is also essential to be able to assess patient's satisfaction. However, lack of standardized facial measurements and clear definition of aesthetic outcome and beauty are still major obstacles preventing real change in the consultation dynamics to help better serve patients' expectations. Because of the tremendous increase in demand for all types of facial aesthetic procedures, an objective understanding of aesthetics and beauty is becoming of utmost importance. Recognition of the importance of science and evidence-based medicine is long overdue in our specialty. This study aims at identifying the most recently available evidence-based measures to quantitatively assess beauty and measure outcome of rhytidoplasty that can be useful in everyday aesthetic practice.","Atiyeh, Bishara S; Chahine, Fadl",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,327,12

Other STAT family members mediate signalling by diverse cytokines important to infection, but their relationship with viruses is more complex. Importantly, virus-STAT interaction can be antagonistic or stimulatory depending on diverse viral and cellular factors. While STAT antagonism can suppress immune pathways, many viruses promote activation of specific STATs to support viral gene expression and/or produce cellular conditions conducive to infection. It is also becoming increasingly clear that viruses can hijack non-canonical STAT functions to benefit infection. For a number of viruses, STAT function is dynamically modulated through infection as requirements for replication change. Given the critical role for STATs in infection by diverse viruses, the virus:STAT interface is an attractive target for the development of antivirals and live-attenuated viral vaccines. Here, we review current understanding of the complex and dynamic virus:STAT interface, and discuss how this relationship might be harnessed for medical applications.","Harrison, Angela R; Moseley, Gregory W",Journal of virology,327,8

Here, we evaluated the prevalence and related risk factors of UTI associated with LRTI in children under 36 months of age. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 1574 patients under 36 months of age who were hospitalised with LRTI from January 2017 to December 2019 in a single centre, Seoul, South Korea. Among them, we analysed 278 patients who showed fever and performed urine evaluation. Urine was collected by catheterisation in children under 24 months of age and by voided urine between 24 and 36 months of age. RESULTS The prevalence of concomitant UTI and LRTI was 13.6% in children under 24 months of age. Mean age was significantly younger in the UTI versus non-UTI group (6.93 ± 7.26 months vs. 12.61 ± 11.70 months; P < 0.001). When the participants were stratified by age, the prevalence of UTI was significantly higher in children younger than 24 months of age compared to older ones (P = 0.006). UTIs were more prevalent in boys than in girls (14.6% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.018). Peak body temperature, fever duration, premature birth and detected respiratory virus type did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS It is not uncommon for children with LRTI with fever to be accompanied by UTI. When evaluating for UTI in children with febrile LRTI, age and sex must be considered.","Kim, Jeong Min; Koo, Ja Wook; Kim, Hyo-Bin",Journal of paediatrics and child health,327,12

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, randomized controlled, clinical trial. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 30) weighing >16 kg. METHODS Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 laparoscopic gastropexy groups: group 1 (controls), intracorporeal 2-0 polydioxanone sutures (PDSII, Ethicon); group 2, barbed suture (0 Quill™ PDO; Angiotech); and group 3, barbed suture (2-0 V-Loc™ 180; Covidien). Gastropexy suturing time (GST) and total surgery time (TST) were recorded for each dog. Complications were recorded. Each dog was examined by ultrasound (1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively) to ensure persistence of the gastropexy. One dog each in group 2 and group 3 had 2nd look laparoscopy to evaluate the gastropexy. RESULTS All gastropexies were intact at 6 months. Mean GST was significantly longer for group 1 (36 minutes; range, 25-46 minutes) than for groups 2 (20 minutes; range, 16-37 minutes) and 3 (19 minutes; range, 15-30 minutes; P < .05), which were not significantly different from each other. Likewise TSTs for groups 2 and 3 were significantly shorter than for group 1 (P < .05).

This study describes cases of vaginal reconstruction performed using a modified rectosigmoid colon held in an ischemic state in order to reduce secretion and denervated in order to prevent defecation problems. Vaginal reconstructions with rectosigmoid colon were performed on 43 patients. In this retrospective study, 34 patients had Müllerian agenesis, while nine had undergone male to female sex reassignment surgery in which adequate vaginal depth had not been achieved. A rectosigmoid colon with its vascular pedicle was used and left in an ischemic state. All nerve structures within the pedicle were excised intraoperatively. Follow-up period was between 12 and 60 months. Partial necrosis occurred in one patient which was reconstructed with local flap. Hematoma developed beneath the skin incision in two cases, but resolved with conservative treatment. A good esthetic outcome was achieved in all cases. Sexual function was assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) in 15 patients. Fourteen out of 15 patients scored above 26.5 on this scale and were determined as having no sexual dysfunction (FSFI score ≥26.5). In conclusion, vaginal reconstruction with denervated rectosigmoid held in an ischemic state appears to be a reasonable option among several available reconstruction techniques.","Özkan, Ömer; Özkan, Özlenen; Çinpolat, Anı; Doğan, Nasuh Utku; Bektaş, Gamze; Dolay, Kemal; Gürkan, Alihan; Arıcı, Cumhur; Doğan, Selen",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,327,1

The clinical course of both asthma and COPD are punctuated by the occurrence of exacerbations, acute events characterized by increased symptoms and airflow obstruction. Exacerbations contribute most of the morbidity, mortality and excess healthcare costs associated with both asthma and COPD. COPD and asthma exacerbations are frequently associated with respiratory virus infections and this has led to an intense research focus into the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbations over the past decade. Current therapies are effective in reducing chronic symptoms but are less effective in preventing exacerbations, particularly in COPD. Understanding the mechanisms of virus-induced exacerbation will lead to the development of new targeted therapies that can reduce the burden of virus-induced exacerbations.

The efficacy and safety of DAPT may vary with different regiments, initiating treatment time and race. Our study assessed the efficacy and safety of DAPT in patients with stroke and to determine the factors influencing the efficacy and safety of DAPT. Relevant studies published up to May 2019 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DAPT with mono antiplatelet therapy (MAPT) for stroke secondary prevention were included. The primary endpoints were stroke recurrence, ischemic stroke recurrence and all-cause death. Subgroup analysis was made according to regiment, initiating treatment time and race. Eighteen studies (n=33353) were included. Comparing with MAPT, short-term DAPT reduced stroke recurrence (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.60-0.77) and ischemic stroke recurrence (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but increased major bleeding (RR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.11-2.98). Long-term DAPT had no superiority compared with MAPT. Aspirin plus clopidogrel comparing with aspirin and early initiating treatment time comparing with MAPT decreased stroke recurrence (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.83; RR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.61-0.78) and ischemic stroke recurrence ( RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.64-0.79; RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but also increased major bleeding (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.38-2.09; RR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.07-2.85). DAPT reduced stroke and ischemic stroke recurrence in non-Asian group but only reduced ischemic stroke recurrence in Asian group. As stroke secondary prevention, short-term DAPT rather than long-term DAPT could be a better choice. Patients could benefit more from aspirin plus clopidogrel or given DAPT within 72 h after symptoms onset. Race may be a factor influencing the efficacy of DAPT.","Fu-Sang, Wang; Xiao-Han, Zheng; Yang, Zou; Ting-Ting, Chen; Chao, Sun; Jing-Yi, Ling; Jian-Jun, Zou",Die Pharmazie,327,1

There is little data on the variation in adherence to guideline-recommended therapies among patients with different clinical manifestations of vascular disease. PURPOSE To analyze the variation in adherence to guideline-recommended therapies among patients with diverse manifestations of vascular disease. METHODS We analyzed a comprehensive database of all patients with critical limb ischemia, claudication, acute limb ischemia, carotid artery stenosis, subclavian artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis, or mesenteric ischemia who underwent angiography between 2006 and 2013 at a multidisciplinary vascular center. RESULTS Among 1,114 patients with vascular disease, adherence to guideline-recommended therapy at time of angiography included use of aspirin in 936 (84%), statins in 753 (68%), ACEIs in 673 (60%), and smoking abstinence in 788 (71%). A total of 335 (30%) patients utilized all four guideline-recommended therapies. Adherence to four guideline-recommended therapies was lowest among patients with acute limb ischemia (14%) and highest among patients with renal artery stenosis (37%). Among all patients with vascular disease, the range of adherence to individual guidelines was 64%-91% for aspirin, 43%-83% for statins, 49%-66% for ACEIs, and 47%-78% for smoking abstention. CONCLUSION The majority of patients with diverse manifestations of vascular disease take aspirin and abstain from smoking while fewer patients are prescribed ACEIs and statins.

However, defucosylated antibodies can readily kill latently infected cells after their activation to express envelope glycoprotein (Env) through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We herein aimed to test a defucosylated bispecific multivalent molecule consisting of domain-antibody and single-domain CD4, LSEVh-LS-F, for its HIV-1 neutralizing activity and ADCC against the reactivated latently infected cells, compared with the nondefucosylated molecule LSEVh-LS. METHODS LSEVh-LS-F's neutralizing activity against a panel of newly characterized Chinese HIV-1 clinical isolates was assessed by using TZM-bl-based and PBMC-based assays. LSEVh-LS-F-mediated ADCC in the presence of natural killer cells against cell lines that stably express Env proteins, HIV-1-infected cells and LRA-reactivated HIV-1 latent cells, was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay or flow cytometry. RESULTS LSEVh-LS-F and LSEVh-LS were equally effective in neutralized infection of all HIV-1 isolates tested with IC50 and IC90 values 3∼4-fold lower than those of VRC01. LSEVh-LS-F was more effective in natural killer-mediated killing of HIV-1 Env-expressing cell lines, HIV-1-infected cells, latency reactivation agents-reactivated ACH2 cells and reactivated latently infected resting CD4 T cell line as well as resting CD4 T lymphocytes isolated from patients receiving HAART. CONCLUSION LSEVh-LS-F exhibits broad HIV-1 neutralizing activity and enhanced ADCC against HIV-1-infected cells, reactivated latently infected cell lines and primary CD4 T cells, thus being a promising candidate therapeutic for eradicating the HIV-1 reservoir.","Kong, Desheng; Wang, Yan; Ji, Ping; Li, Wei; Ying, Tianlei; Huang, Jinghe; Wang, Chen; Wu, Yanling; Wang, Yanping; Chen, Weizao; Hao, Yanling; Hong, Kunxue; Shao, Yiming; Dimitrov, Dimiter S; Jiang, Shibo; Ma, Liying",AIDS,327,1

HYPOTHESIS We hypothesized that a novel system including a device containing polymer resin sorbent beads and a custom-made suctioning catheter could efficiently remove contrast from an in vitro novel model of circulatory system (MOCS) mimicking the cerebral circulation. METHODS A custom-made catheter was built and optimized for cerebral venous approach. The efficiency of a system made of a polymer resin sorbent beads column (CST 401, Cytosorbents) and this particular catheter was tested in the MOCS running a solution composed of 0.9% saline and radio-contrast. During two series of 18 cycles of first-pass experiments we assessed the catheter's suctioning efficiency and the system's ability to clear radio-contrast injected into the MOCS's cerebral arterial segment. We also assessed the functioning and reliability of the MOCS. RESULTS Mean suctioning efficiency of the catheter was 84% ± 24%. The polymer sorbent column contrast removal rate was initially 96% and gradually decreased with subsequent cycles in a linear fashion during an experiment lasting approximately 90 minutes. The MOCS had a reliability of 0.9946×min(-1) where 1 × min(-1) was the optimum value. CONCLUSION A system including a polymer resin sorbent beads column and a custom-made suctioning catheter had an excellent initial efficiency in quickly removing contrast from an artificial MOCS mimicking the cerebral circulation. MOCS is an inexpensive and relatively reliable custom-made system that can be used for training or testing purposes.","Angheloiu, George O; Hänscheid, Heribert; Reiners, Christoph; Anderson, William D; Kellum, John A",Cardiovascular revascularization medicine : including molecular interventions,327,19

Little is known about the frequency of guideline concordance in routine practice. METHODS A cohort study (2007 to 2013) of 15,951 lung cancer patients undergoing lobectomy or pneumonectomy was conducted with MarketScan, a claims database of individuals with employer-provided health insurance. Guideline concordance was defined by claims for PFT within 180 days of resection and for CT and PET within 90 days of resection. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate temporal trends, patient characteristics, and costs associated with guideline-concordant care. RESULTS Overall, 61% of patients received guideline-concordant care, increasing from 57% in 2007 to 66% in 2013 (p < 0.001). Compared with patients who received guideline-discordant care, patients with guideline-concordant care more frequently underwent repeat testing (PFT: 21% versus 12%, p < 0.001; CT: 46% versus 22%, p < 0.001; PET: 2.3% versus 1.1%, p < 0.001). Health plan-adjusted mean total test-related costs were higher among guideline-concordant patients who underwent repeat testing than patients who did not ($4,304 versus $3,454, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Forty percent of lung cancer patients treated with surgical procedures did not receive recommended noninvasive cancer staging and physiologic assessment before resection. Guideline concordance was associated with repeat testing, and repeat testing was associated with higher costs. These findings support the need for quality improvement interventions that can increase guideline concordance while curbing potential excess use of diagnostic tests.","Flanagan, Meghan R; Varghese, Thomas K; Backhus, Leah M; Wood, Douglas E; Mulligan, Michael S; Cheng, Aaron M; Flum, David R; Farjah, Farhood",The Annals of thoracic surgery,327,1

Used effectively, the device appears to reduce operating times and blood loss, although this requires confirmation in a larger series.","Takiguchi, Nobuhiro; Nagata, Matsuo; Soda, Hiroaki; Nomura, Yukihiro; Takayama, Wataru; Yasutomi, Jun; Tohyama, Youichi; Ryu, Munemasa",Surgery today,327,14

Some infants may clinically deteriorate, requiring admission to an intensive care unit. We aimed to describe diagnostic and therapeutic measures of bronchiolitis in Israeli pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and evaluate intercenter variability of care. METHODS Medical records of all RSV-infected infants admitted to 5 Israeli PICUs over 4 RSV seasons were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Data on 276 infants with RSV-positive bronchiolitis, admitted to the participating PICUs were analyzed. Most of the infants were males with a mean admission age of 4.7 months. Approximately half of the infants had pre-existing conditions such as prematurity, cardiac disease or chronic lung disease. Respiratory distress was the most common symptom at presentation followed by hypoxemia and fever. There was significant variation in the methods used for RSV diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support of the infants. Furthermore, utilization of inhalational therapy and transfusion of blood products differed significantly between the centers. Although a bacterial pathogen was isolated in only 13.4% of the infants, 82.6% of the cohort was treated with antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS Significant variation was found between the different PICUs regarding RSV bronchiolitis diagnosis, medical management and respiratory support, which may not be accounted for by the differences in baseline and clinical characteristics of the infants. Some of these differences may be explained by uneven resource allocations. This diversity and the documented routine use of medications with weak evidence of efficacy calls for national guidelines for bronchiolitis management.","Kadmon, Gili; Feinstein, Yael; Lazar, Isaac; Nahum, Elhanan; Sadot, Efraim; Adam, Dganit; Zamir, Gur; Chodick, Gabriel; Schiller, Ofer",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,327,1

This chromatography resin yielded very large distribution coefficients for Pu4+ (>105) in 0.5 - 6 M HNO3 feed solutions. Various physicochemical properties such as sorption kinetics, Pu4+ sorption mechanism, and its sorption capacity were investigated. The sorption kinetics, following a pseudo-second-order model, showed that about 10 minutes of equilibration was sufficient for >99.9% sorption of Pu4+. The sorption of Pu4+ on the resin followed the Langmuir monolayer model, which was confirmed by a theoretical calculation based on the kinetic model. The Pu4+ sorption on the resin was driven by a large exothermic enthalpy change (ΔH = -31.4±2.2 kJ/mol) and a positive entropy change (ΔS = 224±15 J/mol/L). The resin could sorb a maximum of 12.1±0.8 mg of Pu per gram of resin, which is equivalent to 1:2 metal/ligand complex on the resin. The Pu4+ from the resin phase was completely stripped with 0.5 M oxalic acid. A possible application of this resin for the separation / pre-concentration of Pu4+ was successfully demonstrated in the column mode.","Banerjee, Piyali; Ansari, Seraj A; Mohapatra, Prasanta K; Egberink, Richard J M; Valsala, Thichur P; Sathe, Darshan B; Bhatt, Raj B; Huskens, Jurriaan; Verboom, Willem",Journal of chromatography.

Procalcitonin is a serum marker that rises in response to bacterial infections, but remains low in nonbacterial infections and other proinflammatory conditions. To date, there are four randomized clinical trials which compare procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy to standard therapy in patients with COPD exacerbations. In all four trials the use of procalcitonin was associated with a reduction in antibiotic use (prescription and/or duration) without an increase in the rates of adverse patient outcomes including death, admission to the intensive care unit, re-exacerbation and readmission to the hospital. This data is clinically significant and suggests that the use of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy has the potential to decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in nonbacterial COPD exacerbations, thereby curtailing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, reducing antibiotic-related adverse reactions, including Clostridium difficile infection, and potentially reducing healthcare costs.","Tokman, Sofya; Schuetz, Philipp; Bent, Stephen",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,327,1

OBJECTIVE To investigate the associations between the frequencies of asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections and air pollutants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which were direct consequences of countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic. METHODS Asthma exacerbations and respiratory infections among hospitalized children in the permanent population of Guangzhou City, China, from February to June 2016-2019 (before the pandemic) to February to June 2020 (during the pandemic) were collected in this cross-sectional study in Guangzhou. RESULTS The number of asthma exacerbation cases per month documented in the Guangzhou Women and Children's Hospital before (median: 13.5; range: 0-48) and during (median: 20; range: 0-34) the mitigative response to the COVID-19 pandemic was similar. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbation cases per month decreased, whereas that of mild asthma exacerbation cases per year increased (p = .004). The number of patients hospitalized with infectious respiratory diseases decreased from 146 (range: 90-172) per month before the pandemic to 42 (range: 33-57) per month during the pandemic (p = .004). Most pathogens and air pollutants decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The frequency of severe asthma exacerbations positively correlated to that of respiratory infections in children, but did not correlate to air pollutants. CONCLUSION Strict countermeasures undertaken for the pandemic were associated with a decreased the frequency of infectious respiratory diseases and severe asthma exacerbations among urban children.","Fan, Hui-Feng; He, Chun-Hui; Yin, Gen-Quan; Qin, Yi; Jiang, Nan; Lu, Gen; Li, Xing",Pediatric pulmonology,327,19

Lightweight portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) are a valid alternative to traditional systems such as portable compressed oxygen cylinders. However, patient preference and the possible psychological implications related to the use of both devices have been poorly assessed. We sought to evaluate patient preference between the ambulatory oxygen systems (ie, a POC or a small cylinder) for patients with COPD and interstitial lung disease experiencing exertional desaturation in a rehabilitation setting. Furthermore, the use of one device in comparison with the other was related to specific mechanical characteristics and related to perceived quality of life, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. METHODS 30 subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease, who demonstrated exertional desaturation on room air during 6-min walk test (6MWT), were recruited. Each subject performed 2 6MWTs, in random order: one breathing oxygen via a POC and one with a portable compressed oxygen cylinder. Both devices were set up to ensure oxyhemoglobin saturation between 92% and 95% during the 6MWTs. All subjects completed a questionnaire assessing anxiety, depression, and quality of life. Each device was randomly assigned to each subject for 1 week, and then replaced with the other in the following week. At the end of the trial period, all subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating several aspects of the oxygen therapy devices. RESULTS There were no significant differences in oxygen saturation or the mean distances achieved during the 6MWTs between the 2 portable oxygen devices. The subjects expressed greater preference for the POC (73.3%), basing their choice mainly on ease of transport and lower weight. Subjects' age also correlated with preferences: younger subjects were more negatively focused on the weight of the portable compressed oxygen cylinder, whereas older subjects considered the POC easier to manage. No significant differences in preferences were present between COPD and interstitial lung disease. CONCLUSIONS The POC and the portable compressed oxygen cylinder performed in a comparable manner during 6MWT for subjects with COPD and interstitial lung disease and exertional desaturation. Subjects preferred the POC because it was associated with better mobility.","Moretta, Pasquale; Molino, Antonio; Martucci, Michele; Fuschillo, Salvatore; De Felice, Alberto; Guida, Pietro; Motta, Andrea; Vitacca, Michele; Maniscalco, Mauro",Respiratory care,327,1

This study aims at evaluating antibiotic prescribing during COVID-19 pandemic from November 2019 to December 2020. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted primarily through the NCBI database, using PRISMA guidelines to identify relevant literature for the period between November 1, 2019 and December 19, 2020, using the keywords: COVID-19 OR SARS-Cov-2 AND antibiotics restricted to the English language excluding nonclinical articles. Five hundred twenty-seven titles were identified; all articles fulfilling the study criteria were included, 133 through the NCBI, and 8 through Google Scholar with a combined total of 141 studies. The patient's spectrum included all ages from neonates to elderly with all associated comorbidities, including immune suppression. Results: Of 28,093 patients included in the combined studies, 58.7% received antibiotics (16,490/28,093), ranging from 1.3% to 100% coverage. Antibiotics coverage was less in children (57%) than in adults with comorbidities (75%). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed presumptively without pathogen identifications, which might contribute to adverse outcomes. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant and wide range of antibiotic prescribing in patients affected by the disease, particularly in adults with underlying comorbidities, despite the paucity of evidence of associated bacterial infections. The current practice might increase patients' immediate and long-term risks of adverse events, susceptibility to secondary infections as well as aggravating AMR.","Al-Hadidi, Sara H; Alhussain, Hashim; Abdel Hadi, Hamad; Johar, Alreem; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Eltai, Nahla O",Microbial drug resistance,327,1

We investigated admission rates, treatment and mortality of BAME with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during COVID-19. METHODS Using multisource national healthcare records, patients hospitalised with AMI in England during 1 February-27 May 2020 were included in the COVID-19 group, whereas patients admitted during the same period in the previous three consecutive years were included in a pre-COVID-19 group. Multilevel hierarchical regression analyses were used to quantify the changes in-hospital and 7-day mortality in BAME compared with whites. RESULTS Of 73 746 patients, higher proportions of BAME patients (16.7% vs 10.1%) were hospitalised with AMI during the COVID-19 period compared with pre-COVID-19. BAME patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were younger, male and likely to present with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. COVID-19 BAME group admitted with non-ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction less frequently received coronary angiography (86.1% vs 90.0%, p<0.001) and had a longer median delay to reperfusion (4.1 hours vs 3.7 hours, p<0.001) compared with whites.

The goal of this study was to investigate the replication and transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. Following direct intranasal inoculation of animals, the virus was detected in nasal washes of infected animals during the first 7 days postinfection. High viral titers were obtained from nasal turbinates and lung tissues of directly inoculated animals. Further, bovine FLUDV was able to transmit from the infected guinea pigs to sentinel animals by means of contact and not by aerosol dissemination under the experimental conditions tested in this study. Despite exhibiting no clinical signs, infected guinea pigs developed seroconversion and the viral antigen was detected in lungs of animals by immunohistochemistry. The observation that bovine FLUDV replicated in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs was similar to observations described previously in studies of gnotobiotic calves and pigs experimentally infected with bovine FLUDV but different from those described previously in experimental infections in ferrets and swine with a swine FLUDV, which supported virus replication only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract, including lung. Our study established that guinea pigs could be used as an animal model for studying this newly emerging influenza virus. IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel emerging pathogen with bovine as its primary host. The epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus are not yet known. FLUDV also spreads to swine, and the presence of FLUDV-specific antibodies in humans could indicate that there is a potential for zoonosis. Our results showed that bovine FLUDV replicated in the nasal turbinate and lungs of guinea pigs at high titers and was also able to transmit from an infected animal to sentinel animals by contact. The fact that bovine FLUDV replicated productively in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of guinea pigs, similarly to virus infection in its native host, demonstrates that guinea pigs would be a suitable model host to study the replication and transmission potential of bovine FLUDV.","Sreenivasan, Chithra; Thomas, Milton; Sheng, Zizhang; Hause, Ben M; Collin, Emily A; Knudsen, David E B; Pillatzki, Angela; Nelson, Eric; Wang, Dan; Kaushik, Radhey S; Li, Feng",Journal of virology,327,28

OBJECTIVES Our primary objective was to evaluate the association of a battery of fulfillment, job satisfaction change, COVID-19 concerns, and coping measures. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the fulfillment and coping measures differed by gender and by experience levels among a battery of physician specialties. METHODS The study was a purposive sample of convenience. Study participants included all trainees and attending orthopedic surgeons from our academic institution; all participants were invited to complete a survey built around a validated measure of professional fulfillment aimed at assessing response to acute change and stressors. We performed univariate statistics and a matrix correlational analysis to correlate different survey domains with variables of interest. RESULTS The survey was sent electronically to 138 individuals; 63 surveys were completed (response rate = 45.7%). Twenty-seven (42.8%) individuals met the threshold criteria for fulfillment whereas 10 (15.9%) met the threshold for burnout. We found that surgeon perspectives on COVID-19 were not associated with burnout or professional fulfillment. Burnout was inversely associated with professional fulfillment (R = -0.35). Support seeking was noted to be correlated with professional fulfillment (R = 0.37). CONCLUSIONS Stressors related to COVID-19 pandemic were not correlated with physician burnout and fulfillment. This held true even when stratifying by gender and by attending vs. trainee. Continued efforts should be implemented to protect against physician burnout and ensure professional fulfillment for Orthopedic surgeons.","Lazarides, Alexander L; Belay, Elshaday S; Anastasio, Albert T; Cook, Chad E; Anakwenze, Oke A",Work,327,1

Based on this premise, we sought to design a ventilator with the following criteria: 1) standard components that are accessible to the public, 2) ""open-source"" compatibility to allow anyone to easily recreate the system, 3) ability to ventilate in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 4) lowest possible cost to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Design We pursued development of a pneumatic-type ventilator. The basic design involves three electrically controlled solenoid valves, a pressure chamber, the patient breathing circuit, a positive end-expiratory pressure valve, and an electronics control system. Multiple safety elements were built into the design. The user-friendly interface allows simple control of ventilator settings. The ventilator delivers a hybrid form of pneumatic, assist-control ventilation, with predicted tidal volumes of 300-800 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure 0-20 cm H2O, and Fio2 21-100%. Main Results The ventilator was extensively tested with two separate high-fidelity lung simulators and a porcine in vivo model. Both lung simulators were able to simulate a variety of pathologic states, including obstructive lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome. The ventilator performed well across all simulated scenarios. Similarly, a porcine in vivo model was used to assess performance in live tissue, with a specific emphasis on gas exchange. The ventilator performed well in vivo and demonstrated noninferior ventilation and oxygenation when compared with the standard ventilator. Conclusions The Portsmouth Ventilator was able to perform well across all simulated pathologies and in vivo. All components may be acquired by the public for a cost of approximately $250 U.S.D. Although this ventilator has limited functionality compared with modern ventilators, the simple design appears to be safe and would allow for rapid mass production if ventilator surge demand exceeded supply.","Cole, Jacob H; Hughey, Scott B; Rector, Christopher H; Booth, Gregory J",Critical care explorations,327,1

This evolutionary ancient post-translational modification (PTM) is involved in fundamental processes including DNA repair, inflammation, cell death, differentiation and proliferation, among others. ADP-ribosylation is catalysed by two major families of enzymes: the cholera toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTCs) and the diphtheria toxin-like ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTDs, also known as PARPs). ARTCs sensor and use extracellular NAD, which may represent a danger signal, whereas ARTDs are present in the cell nucleus and/or cytoplasm. ARTCs mono-ADP-ribosylate their substrates whereas ARTDs, according to the specific family member, are able to mono- or poly-ADP-ribosylate target proteins or are devoid of enzymatic activity. Both mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylation are dynamic processes, as specific hydrolases are able to remove single or polymeric ADP-moieties. This dynamic equilibrium between addition and degradation provides plasticity for fast adaptation, a feature being particularly relevant to immune cell functions. ADP-ribosylation regulates differentiation and functions of myeloid, T and B cells. It also regulates the expression of cytokines and chemokines, production of antibodies, isotype switch and the expression of several immune mediators. Alterations in these processes involve ADP-ribosylation in virtually any acute and chronic inflammatory/immune-mediated disease. Besides, pathogens developed mechanisms to contrast the action of ADP-ribosylating enzymes by using their own hydrolases and/or to exploit this PTM to sustain their virulence. In the present review, we summarize and discuss recent findings on the role of ADP-ribosylation in immunobiology, immune evasion/subversion by pathogens and immune-mediated diseases.","Rosado, Maria Manuela; Pioli, Claudio",Immunology,327,1

This cap moiety ((7m)GpppN) is an essential RNA structural modification allowing its efficient translation, limiting its degradation by cellular 5' exonucleases and avoiding its recognition as ""nonself"" by the innate immunity machinery. In vitro synthesis of capped RNA is an important bottleneck for many biological studies. Moreover, the lack of methods allowing the synthesis of large amounts of RNA starting with a specific 5'-end sequence have hampered biological and structural studies of proteins recognizing the cap structure or involved in the capping pathway. Due to the chemical nature of N(7)-methylguanosine, the synthesis of RNAs possessing a cap structure at the 5' end is still a significant challenge. In the present work, we combined a chemical synthesis method and an enzymatic methylation assay in order to produce large amounts of RNA oligonucleotides carrying a cap-0 or cap-1. Short RNAs were synthesized on solid support by the phosphoramidite 2'-O-pivaloyloxymethyl chemistry. The cap structure was then coupled by the addition of GDP after phosphorylation of the terminal 5'-OH and activation by imidazole. After deprotection and release from the support, GpppN-RNAs or GpppN(2'-Om)-RNAs were purified before the N(7)-methyl group was added by enzymatic means using the human (guanine-N(7))-methyl transferase to yield (7m)GpppN-RNAs (cap-0) or (7m)GpppN(2'-Om)-RNAs (cap-1). The RNAs carrying different cap structures (cap, cap-0 or, cap-1) act as bona fide substrates mimicking cellular capped RNAs and can be used for biochemical and structural studies.","Thillier, Yann; Decroly, Etienne; Morvan, François; Canard, Bruno; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Debart, Françoise",RNA,327,1

We determine the prognostic value of the follow-up neurological examination using the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and identify 24- to 48-hour NIHSS risk categories in basilar artery occlusion patients. METHODS Participants of an observational registry of radiologically confirmed acute basilar artery occlusion (BASICS [Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study]) with prospectively collected 24- to 48-hour NIHSS and 1-month modified Rankin scale scores were included. Uni- and multivariable modeling were performed to identify independent predictors of poor outcome. Predictive powers of baseline and 24- to 48-hour NIHSS for poor outcome (modified Rankin scale, 4-6) and 1-month mortality were determined by receiver operating characteristic analyses. Classification and regression tree analysis was performed to identify risk groups. RESULTS Three hundred seventy-six of 619 BASICS participants were included, of whom 65.4% had poor outcome. In multivariable analyses, 24- to 48-hour NIHSS (odds ratio=1.28 [1.21-1.35]), history of minor stroke (odds ratio=2.64 [1.04-6.74], time to treatment >6 hours (odds ratio=3.07 [1.35-6.99]), and age (odds ratio=1.02 [0.99-1.04]) were retained in the final model as predictors of poor outcome. Prognostic power of 24- to 48-hour NIHSS was higher than baseline NIHSS for 1-month poor outcome (area under the curve, 0.92 versus 0.75) and mortality (area under the curve, 0.85 versus 0.72). Classification and regression tree analysis identified five 24- to 48-hour NIHSS risk categories with poor outcome rates of 9.4% (NIHSS 0-4), 36% (NIHSS 5-11), 84.3% (NIHSS 12-22), 96.1% (NIHSS 23-27), and 100% (NIHSS≥28).

A key question in understanding this pathway is how it is regulated in different cell contexts. Here we have examined how endocytic processing contributes to signalling by the single cytokine receptor, Domeless, in Drosophila melanogaster cells. We identify an evolutionarily conserved di-Leu motif that is required for Domeless internalisation and show that endocytosis is required for activation of a subset of Domeless targets. Our data indicate that endocytosis both qualitatively and quantitatively regulates Domeless signalling. STAT92E, the single STAT transcription factor in Drosophila, appears to be the target of endocytic regulation and our studies show that phosphorylation of STAT92E on Tyr704, while necessary, is not always sufficient for target transcription. Finally, we identify a conserved residue, Thr702, which is essential for Tyr704 phosphorylation. Taken together, our findings identify previously unknown aspects of JAK/STAT pathway regulation likely to play key roles in the spatial and temporal regulation of signalling in vivo.","Moore, Rachel; Vogt, Katja; Acosta Martin, Adelina E; Shire, Patrick; Zeidler, Martin; Smythe, Elizabeth",Journal of cell science,327,1

However, technological solutions have not yet been seamlessly incorporated into clinical care. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine how to bridge the gaps between the recovery process, technology, and clinical practice to impact stroke rehabilitation meaningfully. DESIGN Semi-structured interviews using a grounded theory approach with purposive sampling of 17 diverse expert providers in acute care, inpatient, and outpatient stroke rehabilitation settings. Common themes were identified from qualitative analyses of the transcribed conversations to develop a guiding framework from the emerging concepts. RESULTS Four core themes emerged that addressed major barriers in stroke rehabilitation and technology-assisted solutions to overcome these barriers: 1) accessibility to quality rehabilitation, 2) adaptability to patient differences, 3) accountability or compliance with rehabilitation, and 4) engagement with rehabilitation. CONCLUSION The results suggest a four-pronged framework, the A3E framework which stands for Accessibility, Adaptability, Accountability and Engagement, to comprehensively address existing barriers in providing rehabilitation services. This framework can guide technology developers and clinicians in designing and deploying technology-assisted rehabilitation solutions for post-stroke rehabilitation, particularly using tele-rehabilitation.","Jayasree-Krishnan, Veena; Ghosh, Shramana; Palumbo, Anna; Kapila, Vikram; Raghavan, Preeti",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,327,12

The aim of this study was to explore the prevalence of respiratory pathogens in the upper airways of asymptomatic adults, compared with a reference population of symptomatic patients sampled in the same centers during the same period. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were prospectively collected from adults with and without ongoing symptoms of respiratory tract infection (RTI) during 12 consecutive months, in primary care centers and hospital emergency departments, and analyzed for respiratory pathogens by a PCR panel detecting 16 viruses and four bacteria. Altogether, 444 asymptomatic and 75 symptomatic subjects completed sampling and follow-up (FU) at day 7. In the asymptomatic subjects, the detection rate of viruses was low (4.3%), and the most common virus detected was rhinovirus (3.2%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was found in 5.6% of the asymptomatic subjects and Haemophilus influenzae in 1.4%. The only factor independently associated with low viral detection rate in asymptomatic subjects was age ≥65 years (P = 0.04). An increased detection rate of bacteria was seen in asymptomatic subjects who were currently smoking (P < 0.01) and who had any chronic condition (P < 0.01). We conclude that detection of respiratory viruses in asymptomatic adults is uncommon, suggesting that a positive PCR result from a symptomatic patient likely is relevant for ongoing respiratory symptoms. Age influences the likelihood of virus detection among asymptomatic adults, and smoking and comorbidities may increase the prevalence of bacterial pathogens in the upper airways.","Sundell, Nicklas; Andersson, Lars-Magnus; Brittain-Long, Robin; Sundvall, Pär-Daniel; Alsiö, Åsa; Lindh, Magnus; Gustavsson, Lars; Westin, Johan",Journal of clinical microbiology,327,16

Our study draws upon SK&A data covering primary care physicians and psychiatrists in eight states (California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and West Virginia), which were linked to a list of waivered buprenorphine prescribers from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. We calculated waivered rates stratified by patient limits, physician type, health system affiliation, and area-level characteristics. We mapped the spatial relationship between hospitals and waivered physicians in four metro areas. We found that primary care physicians affiliated with hospital health systems were less likely to have waivers than unaffiliated physicians (3.6% versus 8.2%), but the reverse was true for psychiatrists (33.2% versus 26.2%). Waivered physicians affiliated with health systems were less likely to practice in high-poverty areas than unaffiliated counterparts, and affiliated physicians were also more likely to cluster near hospitals. Health systems may be able to improve access to buprenorphine treatment in their communities by creating either incentives or mandates for more affiliated physicians to obtain a waiver.","Saloner, Brendan; Lin, LeeKai; Simon, Kosali",Journal of substance abuse treatment,327,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included all patients with LM treated with combined TACE and ablation from August 1998 to September 2015. Forty-two patients (12 women, 30 men; age 62.9 ± 11.9 years) were treated for 44 LMs. Tumor characteristics, imaging response to treatment, recurrence, and OS data were reviewed. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox regression and Fisher's exact, Wilcoxon rank sum, or log rank tests. RESULTS Median follow-up was 10.3 months. Eighteen patients had 1 hepatic lesion, 16 had 2-5, and 8 had > 5. Median index lesion size was 4.7 cm (range 1.5-8 .0 cm). Tumor response (mRECIST) was available for 41/44 treated lesions, with CR in 32 (78.0%), PR in 8 (19.5%), and PD in 1 (2.4%). Long-term imaging follow-up was available for 38 patients. Freedom from local recurrence was 61% at 1 year and 50% at 2 years. OS was 55% at 1 year and 30% at 2 years (median OS, 14.5 months). Tumor size and histology were not predictors of time to progression or OS. Complications occurred in 19 patients (45%). Major complications occurred in 19% of patients and included hospitalization for fever (n = 2), hepatic abscess (n = 3) and fall requiring transfusion, portal vein thrombus causing lobar infarct, biliary fistula, and retroperitoneal hematoma (n = 1 each). CONCLUSIONS Combined TACE and ablation is effective for local tumor control of liver metastases up to 8 cm when part of a multidisciplinary treatment strategy. Major complications occurred in 19% of patients.","Alexander, Erica S; Mick, Rosemarie; Nadolski, Gregory J; Mondschein, Jeffrey I; Stavropoulos, S William; Soulen, Michael C",Abdominal radiology,327,12

Our previously reported first-in-class bacterial transcription inhibitors ""nusbiarylins"" presented a promising prospect towards the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents with a novel mechanism. Here we investigated and characterised the lead nusbiarylin compound, MC4, and several of its chemical derivatives in both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and the S. aureus type strains, demonstrating their capacity for the arrest of growth and cellular respiration, impairment of RNA and intracellular protein levels at subinhibitory concentrations. In some instances, derivatives of MC4 were also shown to attenuate the production of staphylococcal virulence factors in vitro, such as the exoproteins α-toxin and Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL). Trends observed from quantitative PCR assays suggested that nusbiarylins elicited these effects possibly by acting via but not limited to the modulation of global regulatory pathways, such as the agr regulon, which coordinates the expression of S. aureus genes associated with virulence. Our findings encourage the continued development of more potent compounds within this novel family of bacterial transcription inhibitors.","Chu, Adrian Jun; Qiu, Yangyi; Harper, Rachel; Lin, Lin; Ma, Cong; Yang, Xiao",International journal of molecular sciences,327,19

However, which specific aspects of quality of life are most affected by VHR have not been formally investigated. METHODS Through retrospective analysis of the Abdominal Core Health Quality Collaborative national database, we measured the change in each individual component of the HerQLes questionnaire from a pre-operative baseline assessment to one-year postoperatively in VHR patients. RESULTS In total, 1,875 VHR patients had completed both pre- and post-operative questionnaires from 2014-2018. They were predominately Caucasian (92.3%), 57.9 ± 12.4 Y old, and evenly gender split (50.5% male, 49.5% female, P = 0.31). Most operations were performed open (80.5%) with fewer laparoscopic (7.5%) or robotic cases (12.1%). For each of the 12 individual categories, improvement in QOL from baseline to 1-Y was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.0001). This held true with subgroup analysis of small (<2 cm), medium (2-6 cm), and large (>6 cm) hernias (P < 0.0001), though a larger improvement was seen in 8 of 12 components in hernias >6 cm (P < 0.001). Operative approach did not carry a significant effect except in medium hernias (2-6 cm), where an open approach saw a greater improvement in the ""accomplish less at work"" item (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS VHR is associated with improvement in each of the 12 components of QOL measured in the HerQLes questionnaire, regardless of the size of their hernia. The amount of improvement, however, may be dependent on hernia size and approach.","Haisley, Kelly R; Vadlamudi, Chaitanya; Gupta, Anand; Collins, Courtney E; Renshaw, Savanah M; Poulose, Benjamin K",The Journal of surgical research,327,16

Airway point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has demonstrated utility in children, but the examinations vary by age and may require non-traditional techniques or utilize less common probes. This study evaluated the performance of measuring the tracheal location of the cuffed TT using a novel, linear probe-based POCUS examination over a wide age range of children. After adjusting for the subjects' height and TT size, ultrasound measurements of the TT cuff location were compared with fluoroscopy measurements of the TT tip location. METHODS Perioperative pediatric patients (<10 years) requiring a cuffed TT were enrolled. After routine TT placement, ultrasound and fluoroscopy images were obtained. Measurements from the TT cuff to the cricoid cartilage were obtained from the POCUS examination. Chest fluoroscopy was reviewed to measure the TT's distance from the carina. Both measurements were then compared after scaling for patient height. The duration of the ultrasound examination and image quality scores were also recorded. RESULTS Forty-one patients were enrolled, with a median age of 3 (25th/75th percentile: 1.50/7.00) years. The POCUS examination identified the TT cuff in all cases with the highest image quality score. The median POCUS exam time was 112 (25th/75th percentile: 80.00/156.00) seconds. There was a strong correlation between the POCUS measurements and the fluoroscopy measurements, r = -0.7575, 95% CI [-0.8638, -0.5866 ], p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between POCUS TT localization measurements and traditional measurements via fluoroscopy. This study further supports the utility of POCUS for pediatric care.","Ramsingh, Davinder; Ghazal, Elizabeth; Gordon, Brent; Ross, Philip; Goltiao, Darren; Alschuler, Matt; Pugh, Justin; Holsclaw, Matthew; Mason, Linda",Journal of clinical medicine,327,19

The main objectives of this study were to map the literature of SM strategies and SMS needs of patients with advanced cancer and to describe SMS interventions tested in this patient population. A scoping review of all literature published between 2002 and 2016 was conducted. A total of 11 094 articles were generated for screening from MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library databases. A final 55 articles were extracted for inclusion in the review. Included studies identified a wide variety of SM behaviours used by patients with advanced cancer including controlling and coping with the physical components of the disease and facilitating emotional and psychosocial adjustments to a life-limiting illness. Studies also described a wide range of SMS needs, SMS interventions and their effectiveness in this patient population. Findings suggest that SMS interventions addressing SMS needs should be based on a sound understanding of the core skills required for effective SM and theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Future research should examine how a patient-oriented SMS approach can be incorporated into existing models of care delivery and the effects of SMS on quality of life and health system utilisation in this population.","Budhwani, Suman; Wodchis, Walter P; Zimmermann, Camilla; Moineddin, Rahim; Howell, Doris",BMJ supportive & palliative care,327,17

Single B cell sorting and cloning of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy- and light-chain variable regions (V(H) and V(L)) is a powerful technology for defining anti-viral B cell repertoires. However, the Ig-cloning step is time-consuming and prevents high-throughput analysis of the B cell repertoire. Novel linear Ig heavy- and light-chain gene expression cassettes were designed to express Ig V(H) and V(L) genes isolated from sorted single B cells as IgG1 antibody without a cloning step. The cassettes contain all essential elements for transcriptional and translational regulation, including CMV promoter, Ig leader sequences, constant region of IgG1 heavy- or Ig light-chain, poly(A) tail and substitutable V(H) or V(L) genes. The utility of these Ig gene expression cassettes was established using synthetic V(H) or V(L) genes from an anti-HIV-1 gp41 mAb 2F5 as a model system, and validated further using V(H) and V(L) genes isolated from cloned EBV-transformed antibody-producing cell lines. Finally, this strategy was successfully used for rapid production of recombinant influenza mAbs from sorted single human plasmablasts after influenza vaccination. These Ig gene expression cassettes constitute a highly efficient strategy for rapid expression of Ig genes for high-throughput screening and analysis without cloning.","Liao, Hua-Xin; Levesque, Marc C; Nagel, Ashleigh; Dixon, Ashlyn; Zhang, Ruijun; Walter, Emmanuel; Parks, Robert; Whitesides, John; Marshall, Dawn J; Hwang, Kwan-Ki; Yang, Yi; Chen, Xi; Gao, Feng; Munshaw, Supriya; Kepler, Thomas B; Denny, Thomas; Moody, M Anthony; Haynes, Barton F",Journal of virological methods,327,1

This study investigated the mental health status of community healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. This cross-sectional study, which was conducted from February 8 to 18, 2020, involved 450 healthcare workers in 18 community hospitals who had worked for more than 1 year. A self-designed demographic data questionnaire and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were provided to the participants through links and quick response codes. The respondents completed and submitted the questionnaires online. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze multiple factors related to the SCL-90 scores of these community healthcare workers in China. For the 450 community healthcare workers who completed the study, the median scores in each SCL-90 factor were lower than the Chinese norms, and 119 (26.4%) participants were SCL-90 positive. Among them, 178 participants were doctors and had the highest scores on most SCL-90 factors except for obsessive compulsiveness, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (P < 0.05). The top 3 positive items for doctors working in the community were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and somatization, and those among nurses were obsessive compulsiveness, others, and hostility. Sex, type of workers, and occupational exposure risk to COVID-19 were independent risk factors for the mental health status of the community healthcare workers. Overall, the community healthcare workers experienced psychological problems during the COVID-19 outbreak in Sichuan Province, China. More attention should be paid to the mental health of these workers, and their mental status should be regularly assessed. Psychological interventions should be provided to those with serious mental problems through networks or telephone visits.","Zhang, Jianshu; Deng, Xuexue; Liu, Hong; Xu, Xiaoru; Fang, Ronghua",Medicine,327,27

In the present study, the roles of the nucleocapsid (N) protein in induction of IL-10 and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) lymphocytes (T(reg)) were investigated. Transfection of porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) with a plasmid encoding N protein resulted in significant upregulation of IL-10 gene expression in the gene-transfected cells. Structural conformation, but not nuclear localization, of the expressed N protein was indicated to be essential for the ability to induce IL-10. Furthermore, the presence of recombinant N proteins in cultured PBMCs increased the number of IL-10-producing lymphocytes. Strong induction of IL-10-producing cells and T(reg) was observed when using N protein-pulsed MoDCs, suggesting an important role of MoDCs in induction of IL-10 and T(reg) by the N protein. Neutralization of IL-10 by addition of an anti-IL-10 antibody in the culture system resulted in marked reduction of PRRSV-induced T(reg) in the cultured PBMCs. Together, the data demonstrate the immunomodulatory properties of the PRRSV N protein and the linkage between IL-10 production and development of PRRSV-induced T(reg).

However, the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has received unprecedented attention internationally. Monitoring pathogenic CoVs in environmental compartments has been proposed as a promising strategy in preventing the environmental spread and tracing of infectious diseases, but a lack of reliable and efficient detection techniques is still a significant challenge. Moreover, the lack of information regarding the monitoring methodology may pose a barrier to primary researchers. Here, we provide a systematic introduction focused on the detection of CoVs in various environmental matrices, comprehensively involving methods and techniques of sampling, pretreatment, and analysis. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges and potential improvements in virus detection techniques for environmental surveillance.","Yao, Linlin; Zhu, Wenting; Shi, Jianbo; Xu, Tailin; Qu, Guangbo; Zhou, Wenhua; Yu, Xue-Feng; Zhang, Xueji; Jiang, Guibin",Chemical Society reviews,327,31

We sought to determine the safety and feasibility of mechanical thrombectomy using the new ERIC retrieval device. MATERIALS AND METHODS We identified 36 consecutive patients from our Stroke Center registry with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with the new ERIC retriever from September 2013 to December 2014. Patients with ischemic stroke meeting the following criteria were eligible: onset-to-treatment time of ≤4.5 hours or wake-up stroke (n = 10) with relevant CT perfusion mismatch, NIHSS score of ≥4, and proof of large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation on CT angiography. We assessed the baseline characteristics including age, sex, comorbidities, stroke severity, site of vessel occlusion, presence of tissue at risk, and treatment-related parameters such as onset-to-treatment time, recanalization grade, and outcome. RESULTS The mean age was 70 ± 13 years, and the median NIHSS score on admission was 18 (interquartile range, 10-20). Seventeen of 36 patients were on platelet inhibitors or anticoagulants before endovascular treatment (47.2%); 20 patients received intravenous thrombolysis (55.5%). The ERIC was used as the sole retriever in 28 patients (77.8%) and as a rescue device in 8. Excellent recanalization was achieved in 30/36 patients (83.3%) with TICI 3 in 19/36 and 2b in 11/36, respectively. Median procedural time in these patients was 90 minutes (interquartile range, 58-133 minutes). No intraprocedural complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, the new ERIC retrieval device was technically feasible, safe, and effective in acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion.","Kahles, T; Garcia-Esperon, C; Zeller, S; Hlavica, M; Añon, J; Diepers, M; Nedeltchev, K; Remonda, L",AJNR.

Cognitive impairment in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12). METHODS We conducted a cross sectional study and enrolled 30 (20 male and 10 female) genetically confirmed SCA12 patients and 30 healthy, age, gender and education matched individuals as controls. Cognitive domains were tested using a battery of validated neurocognitive tests. RESULT Mean age of patients was 51.6 ± 8.0 years and mean disease duration was 5.3 ± 3.0 years. Mean International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was 29.8 ± 12.5. SCA 12 patients scored significantly lower than controls in executive function and new learning ability. Other tested cognitive domains were also affected but did not reach statistical significance. Age, age at onset, severity of ataxia, disease duration and CAG repeat length did not correlate with cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION Cognitive impairment is a part of the spectrum of SCA12 and is characterized by dysfunction in executive function and new learning ability even early in the course of disease.","Agarwal, Amit; Kaur, Harsimarpreet; Agarwal, Ayush; Nehra, Ashima; Pandey, Shivam; Garg, Ajay; Faruq, Mohammed; Rajan, Roopa; Shukla, Garima; Goyal, Vinay; Srivastava, Achal Kumar",Parkinsonism & related disorders,327,31

Four potential risk factors have been identified based on how applicants might perceive the comparable value of respective programs. Schools with lower risk are public, established before 2000, located within an academic health center, and traditional (ie, four-year) programs. The Academy cannot sustain more than 140 schools much longer. Market forces are establishing a new equilibrium between the number of graduates and the availability of pharmacist jobs.

We aimed at identifying germline variants associated with survival in mCRC patients treated with these regimens in CALGB/SWOG 80405. METHODS Patients with mCRC receiving either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI were randomized to either cetuximab or bevacizumab. DNA from peripheral blood was genotyped for ~700,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The association between SNPs and overall survival (OS) was tested in 613 patients of genetically-estimated European ancestry using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS The four most significant SNPs associated with OS were three haplotypic SNPs between MGST1 and LMO3 (representative hazard ratios (HR) 1.56, p-value 1.30x10-6), and rs11644916 in AXIN1 (HR 1.39, p-value 4.26x10-6). AXIN1 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene in CRC, and rs11644916 (G>A) conferred shorter OS. Median OS for patients with the AA, AG or GG genotypes was 18.4, 25.6, or 36.4 months, respectively. In 90 stage IV CRC patients from TCGA, rs11649255 in AXIN1 (in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs11644916), was associated with shorter OS (HR 2.24, p-value 0.0096). Using rs11648673 in AXIN1 (in very high LD with rs11644916 and with functional evidence), luciferase activity in three CRC cell lines was reduced. CONCLUSIONS This is the first large GWAS ever conducted in mCRC patients treated with first-line standard treatment in a randomized phase III trial. A common SNP in AXIN1 confers worse OS and the effect is replicated in TCGA. Further studies in CRC experimental models are required.","Innocenti, Federico; Sibley, Alexander B; Patil, Sushant A; Etheridge, Amy S; Jiang, Chen; Ou, Fang-Shu; Howell, Stefanie; Plummer, Sarah J; Casey, Graham; Bertagnolli, Monica M; McLeod, Howard L; Auman, James T; Blanke, Charles D; Furukawa, Yoichi; Venook, Alan P; Kubo, Michiaki; Lenz, Heinz-Josef; Parker, Joel S; Ratain, Mark J; Owzar, Kouros",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,327,27

METHODS This study recruited 62 post-SARS osteonecrosis patients and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Fasting blood samples were collected from all the subjects through cubital veins. Immunoglobulins A, G and M (IgA, G and M) types of anticardiolipin antibodies were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The routine examinations of prothrombin time, thrombin time, prothrombin activity, and international normalized ratio were also performed. RESULTS There were 21 of 62 post-SARS osteonecrosis patients (33.9%) who showed at least one type of anticardiolipin antibodies. The titers of specific IgA, IgG, and IgM were 11.33 +/- 11.209 APL, 5.127 +/- 5.927 GPL, and 17.821 +/- 10.606 MPL, respectively. There were only 4 of 52 subjects in the control group (7.7%) who showed positive anticardiolipin antibody with titers of IgA at 10.702 +/- 3.126 APL, IgG at 5.184 +/- 4.780 GPL, and IgM at 14.684 +/- 5.516 MPL. There were significant differences between the 2 groups confirmed by t-Test and chi(2) test (P < 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in prothrombin time, thrombin time, prothrombin activity, and international normalized ratio results between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS The incidences of anticardiolipin antibodies were increased in the post-SARS osteonecrosis patients and anticardiolipin antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of post-SARS osteonecrosis.","Sun, Wei; Wang, Bai-Liang; Liu, Bing-Li; Zhao, Feng-Chao; Shi, Zhen-Cai; Guo, Wan-Shou; Liu, Zhao-Hui; Li, Zi-Rong",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,327,1

STUDY DESIGN Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi from April to July 2020. Methodology: All 58 patients (n=58) presenting with acute appendicitis (AA) were included. Assessment was done with Alvarado score (AS) and ultrasound. Treatment was initiated according to the algorithm corresponding with AS. Those with AS score of 4 or less were started on outpatient oral antibiotics. Patients with AS score of 5 or more were admitted for IV antibiotics. If the symptoms and signs resolved, they were sent home on oral antibiotics to complete a course of 5 days. If their condition did not improve in 72 hours or deteriorated at any time, appendectomy was done. Outcomes were recorded and analysed on SPSS. RESULTS Out of 58 patients, 16 were treated with oral, while 42 with IV antibiotics. This yielded a statistically significant difference on the course of disease (p=0.028). Resolution of symptoms was seen in 27.6% (n=16) with conservative management; whereas, 72.4% (n=42) patients needed a subsequent appendectomy. The difference in operative findings between patients, who had been given oral or IV antibiotics was statistically insignificant (p=0.536). Diagnostic value of leukocyte count (TLC), ultrasound and AS was not found to be significant. CONCLUSION Non-operative management is successful in about a quarter of the patients of AA. There is very limited value of sonography, laboratory parameters, or AS in confirming the diagnosis of AA.

Generally, vaccines are considered as public health tools rather than from the individual patient perspective. However, adult vaccination programs in particular should consider many different factors, at the individual level and also from societal, cultural and country-specific perspectives. Currently, most immunization programs, including those for pneumococcal vaccines, have only been adopted on the basis of age or medical risk. Areas covered: Based on a broad literature search, this review addresses possible environmental factors which can affect the burden of pneumococcal disease and the immune response to pneumococcal vaccines. Expert opinion: Factors which influence the incidence of pneumococcal disease and the reaction against pneumococcal vaccination, including personal conditions, geographic/ethnic factors and social risks, are diverse. To maximize the effects of pneumococcal vaccination, not only for public health but also to induce optimal effects at the individual level, vaccines need to be verified under diverse situations and with collaboration among relevant medical societies, governments, and the pharmaceutical industry. Whereas vaccines are generally considered only from the public health perspective, flexible, comprehensive and tailored pneumococcal immunization programs, with appropriate policy support, can generate a greater positive impact on public health.","Park, Seong-Beom; Kim, Hyun-Jin; Cheong, Hee-Jin",Expert review of vaccines,327,27

This systematic review explores the associations between preoperative frailty and perioperative complications in benign gynecologic surgery. METHODS A comprehensive, systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed interface for Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases through August 12, 2020. Articles were included if they described the utilization of frailty assessment tools in benign gynecologic patients in the pre- or perioperative setting. Study quality and evidence were evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in Non-Randomized Studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluations criteria. RESULTS One thousand one hundred twenty unique citations were identified, and five studies assessing frailty and perioperative outcomes were included. Three retrospective cohort studies utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to assess the impact of frailty on perioperative outcomes in hysterectomies and pelvic organ prolapse repair procedures. One retrospective cohort study utilized a California database to assess frailty in prolapse repair surgeries. One cross-sectional study assessed frailty in new urogynecology patient visits. Four of these studies found that preoperative frailty is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. Overall, the evidence from the included studies is of low quality and at moderate to critical risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS There are few studies assessing the impact of frailty on perioperative complications in benign gynecologic surgery. This review demonstrates that preoperative frailty is significantly associated with adverse perioperative outcomes, but additional studies are needed to further explore this association.","Kikuchi, Jacqueline Y; Hoyt, Katerina; Nomura, Andrea I; Vallabhaneni, Sindhura; Blanck, Jaime; Patterson, Danielle; Chen, Chi Chiung Grace",International urogynecology journal,327,7

Prevention efforts have traditionally focused on individual injury mechanisms and their specific risk factors, which has resulted in slow progress in reducing the burden. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a global agenda for promoting human prosperity while respecting planetary boundaries. While injury prevention is currently only recognised in the SDG agenda via two road safety targets, the relevance of the SDGs for injury prevention is much broader. In this State of the Art Review, we illustrate how unintentional injury prevention efforts can be advanced substantially within a broad range of SDG goals and advocate for the integration of safety considerations across all sectors and stakeholders. This review uncovers injury prevention opportunities within broader global priorities such as urbanisation, population shifts, water safeguarding and corporate social responsibility. We demonstrate the relevance of injury prevention efforts to the SDG agenda beyond the health goal (SDG 3) and the two specific road safety targets (SDG 3.6 and SDG 11.2), highlighting 13 additional SDGs of relevance. We argue that all involved in injury prevention are at a critical juncture where we can continue with the status quo and expect to see more of the same, or mobilise the global community in an 'Injury Prevention in All Policies' approach.","Ma, Tracey; Peden, Amy E; Peden, Margaret; Hyder, Adnan A; Jagnoor, Jagnoor; Duan, Leilei; Brown, Julie; Passmore, Jonathon; Clapham, Kathleen; Tian, Maoyi; Rahman, A K M Fazlur; Ivers, Rebecca Q",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,327,5

However, visual analysis is labor-intensive and EMGdi is heavily corrupted by electrocardiographic (ECG) activity. Therefore, we developed an automatic method to detect inspiratory onset from EMGdi envelope using fixed sample entropy (fSE) and a dynamic threshold based on kernel density estimation (KDE). Moreover, we combined fSE with adaptive filtering techniques to reduce ECG interference and improve onset detection. The performance of EMGdi envelopes extracted by applying fSE and fSE with adaptive filtering was compared to the root mean square (RMS)-based envelope provided by the EMG acquisition device. Automatic onset detection accuracy, using these three envelopes, was evaluated through the root mean square error (RMSE) between the automatic and mean visual onsets (made by two observers). The fSE-based method provided lower RMSE, which was reduced from 298 ms to 264 ms when combined with adaptive filtering, compared to 301 ms provided by the RMS-based method. The RMSE was negatively correlated with the proposed EMGdi quality indices. Following further validation, fSE with KDE, combined with adaptive filtering when dealing with low quality EMGdi, indicates promise for detecting the neural onset of respiratory drive.","Sarlabous, Leonardo; Estrada, Luis; Cerezo-Hernández, Ana; V D Leest, Sietske; Torres, Abel; Jané, Raimon; Duiverman, Marieke; Garde, Ainara",Entropy,327,27

Clinical aims include reducing individuals' crisis states, psychological distress, and risk of suicide. Efforts may also include enhancing access and facilitating connections to behavioral health care. This review examines models of crisis line services for demonstrated effectiveness. Methods: Literature searches of Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were conducted from January 1, 1990, to May 7, 2018. Experts were contacted, and references were mined for additional studies. Eligible studies provided health- or utilization-related effectiveness outcome(s). Results were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and evaluated for risk of bias using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. Results: Thirty-three studies yielded effectiveness outcomes. In most cases findings regarding crisis calls vs. other modalities were presented. Evaluation approaches included user- and helper-reported data, silent monitoring, and analyses of administrative records. About half of studies reported immediate proximal outcomes (during the crisis service), and the remaining reported distal outcomes (up to four years post-contact). Most studies were rated at Oxford level four evidence and 80% were assessed at high risk of bias. Conclusions: High quality evidence demonstrating crisis line effectiveness is lacking. Moreover, most approaches to demonstrating impact only measured proximal outcomes. Research should focus on innovative strategies to assess proximal and distal outcomes, with a specific focus on behavioral health treatment engagement and future self-directed violence.","Hoffberg, Adam S; Stearns-Yoder, Kelly A; Brenner, Lisa A",Frontiers in public health,327,1

However, to date, the CES-D has not been validated in Farsi. Therefore, this study aimed toassess the psychometric properties of the CES-D in Iranian cancer patients. METHODS During a three-month period(October to December, 2015), a total of 380 cancer patients completed a Farsi version of the CES-D. The constructvalidity of the scale was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alphaand McDonald Omega. All of the statistical procedure were run by SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS The construct validity of the CES-D determined three factors (somatic affect, negative affect, and positive affect),which explained 65.60% of the total variance. The internal consistency was greater than 0.70. CONCLUSION Findingsrevealed that the Farsi version of the CES-D has acceptable validity and reliability, which can be used to measuredepression in Iranian cancer patients.","Sharif Nia, Hamid; Rezapour, Maryam; Allen, Kelly A; Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed; Jafari, Azar; Torkmandi, Hojjat; Goudarzian, Amir Hossein",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,327,16

However, a comprehensive characterization of the complex chemical mixtures present in plastics is missing. In this study, we benchmark plastic consumer products, covering eight major polymer types, according to their toxicological and chemical signatures using in vitro bioassays and non-target high resolution mass spectrometry. Most (74 %) of the 34 plastic extracts contained chemicals triggering at least one endpoint, including baseline toxicity (62 %), oxidative stress (41 %), cytotoxicity (32 %), estrogenicity (12 %) and antiandrogenicity (27 %). In total, we detected 1,411 features, tentatively identified 213, including monomers, additives and non-intentionally added substances, and prioritized 25 chemicals. Extracts of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyurethane (PUR) induced the highest toxicity whereas polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) caused no or low toxicity. High baseline toxicity was detected in all ""bioplastics"" made of polylactic acid (PLA). The toxicities of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) varied. Our study demonstrates that consumer plastics contain compounds that are toxic in vitro but remain largely unidentified. Since the risk of unknown compounds cannot be assessed, this poses a challenge to manufacturers, public health authorities and researchers alike. However, we also demonstrate that products not inducing toxicity are already on the market.","Zimmermann, Lisa; Dierkes, Georg; Ternes, Thomas A; Völker, Carolin; Wagner, Martin",Environmental science & technology,327,1

Recent studies have shown that locomotion can be adapted when an external force is applied to the lower limb. To better understand the neural control of this adaptation, the present study investigated gait modifications resulting from exposure to a position-dependent force field. Ten subjects walked on a treadmill before, during, and after exposure to a force field generated by elastic tubing that pulled the foot forward and up during swing. Lower limb kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity were recorded during each walking period. During force field exposure, peak foot velocity was initially increased by 38%. As subjects adapted, peak foot velocity gradually returned to baseline in <or=125 strides. In the adapted state, hamstring EMG activity started earlier (16% before toe off) and remained elevated throughout swing. After force field exposure, foot velocity was initially reduced by 22% and returned to baseline in 9-51 strides. Aftereffects in hamstring EMGs consisted of increased activity around toe off. Contrary to the adapted state, this increase was not maintained during the rest of swing. Together, these results suggest that while the neural control of human locomotion can adapt to force field exposure, the mechanisms underlying this adaptation may vary according to the timing in the gait cycle. Adapted hamstring EMG activity may rely more on feedforward mechanisms around toe off and more on feedback mechanisms during the rest of swing.","Blanchette, Andreanne; Bouyer, Laurent J",Journal of neurophysiology,327,1

METHODS A total of 138 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (SCS) who underwent CEA after acute ischemic stroke from March 2008 to March 2015 were included in this study. Transient ischemic attacks were excluded. These patients were divided into 2 groups according to the topographic pattern of the stroke on magnetic resonance imaging: group 1, territorial strokes (TS) caused by emboli of carotid origin, and group 2, WS caused by a hemodynamic mechanism related to an SCS. Primary end points were 30-day mortality and postoperative neurological morbidity. The insertion of a Pruitt carotid shunt was performed systematically. RESULTS Ninety (65.2%) patients presented a TS of carotid origin and were included in group 1, and 48 (34.8%) of the 138 patients had a WS related to an SCS and were included in group 2. The median time between clinical onset of the cerebral ischemic event and surgery was 9 days (range: 0-89 days). Postoperative mortality was 0%. Seven (5.1%) patients had an aggravation of the neurological status during the postoperative period, of whom 2 presented a complete regression of the symptoms in less than 1 hour (definitive postoperative neurologic morbidity: 3.6%). Postoperative neurologic morbidity rate was significantly higher in the TS group (7 of 90; 7.8%) compared to the WS group (0 of 48; P = .04). No other independent predictive factor of neurologic morbidity after CEA for an SCS was found. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that routine shunting should be considered in case of acute WS since it may play a protective role. Further studies are eagerly awaited to better define the timing and the best treatment option for both acute WS and TS related to an SCS in order to reduce postoperative neurologic morbidity.","Perini, Paolo; Bonifati, Domenico Marco; Tasselli, Sebastiano; Sogaro, Filippo",Vascular and endovascular surgery,327,1

While the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via human respiratory droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is poorly understood1-3. This study investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring viral RNA in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in February and March 2020. The concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, but it was elevated in the patients' toilet areas. Levels of airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the majority of public areas was undetectable except in two areas prone to crowding, possibly due to infected carriers in the crowd. We found that some medical staff areas initially had high concentrations of viral RNA with aerosol size distributions showing peaks in submicrometre and/or supermicrometre regions, but these levels were reduced to undetectable levels after implementation of rigorous sanitization procedures. Although we have not established the infectivity of the virus detected in these hospital areas, we propose that SARS-CoV-2 may have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols. Our results indicate that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.

It also presents a challenge among patients undergoing spinal surgery. Use of Teriparatide and bisphosphonates in such patients has been shown to improve outcomes after fusion surgery, including successful fusion, decreased risk of instrumentation failure, and patient-reported outcomes. Herein, we performed a systematic review and indirect meta-analysis of available literature on outcomes of fusion surgery after use of bisphosphonates or Teriparatide. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search of all databases (Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus) to identify studies assessing outcomes of spinal fusion among osteoporotic patients after use of Teriparatide or bisphosphonate. Four authors independently screened electronic search results, and all four authors independently performed study selection. Two authors performed independent data extraction and assessed the studies' risk of bias assessment using standardized forms of Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). RESULTS Nineteen studies were included in the final analysis. A total of 13 studies evaluated the difference in fusion rate between bisphosphonates and Teriparatide or control group. Fusion rate was higher for bisphosphonates (effect size (ES) 83%, 95% CI 77-89%) compared with Teriparatide (ES 71%, 95% CI 57-85%), with the p value for heterogeneity between groups without statistical significance (p = 0.123). Five studies assessed the impact of using bisphosphonate or Teriparatide on screw loosening. The rate of screw loosening was higher for bisphosphonates (ES 19%, 95% CI 13-25%) compared with Teriparatide (ES 13%, 95% CI 9-16%) without statistical significance (p = 0.52). CONCLUSION Our results indicate that while both agents may be associated with positive outcomes, bisphosphonates may be associated with a higher fusion rate, while Teriparatide may be associated with lower screw loosening. The decision to treat with either agent should be tailored individually for each patient keeping in consideration the adverse effect and pharmacokinetic profiles.","Tsai, Sung Huang Laurent; Chien, Ruei-Shyuan; Lichter, Katie; Alharthy, Raghad; Alvi, Mohammed Ali; Goyal, Anshit; Bydon, Mohamad; Fu, Tsai-Sheng; Lin, Tung-Yi",Archives of osteoporosis,327,1

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in PD which has shed light on our understanding of structural abnormalities underlying PD symptoms or its associations with pathological mechanisms. One of the white matter tracts shown to be disrupted in PD with a possible contribution to some PD symptoms is the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). On the whole, lower ILF integrity contributes to thought disorders, impaired visual emotions, cognitive impairments such as semantic fluency deficits, and mood disorders. This review outlines the microstructural changes in ILF associated with systemic inflammation and various PD symptoms like cognitive decline, facial emotion recognition deficit, depression, color discrimination deficit, olfactory dysfunction, and tremor genesis. However, few studies have investigated DTI correlates of each symptom and larger studies with standardized imaging protocols are required to extend these preliminary findings and lead to more promising results.","Haghshomar, Maryam; Dolatshahi, Mahsa; Ghazi Sherbaf, Farzaneh; Sanjari Moghaddam, Hossein; Shirin Shandiz, Mehdi; Aarabi, Mohammad Hadi",Frontiers in neurology,327,33

We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers and in vitro VN titer. The probability of a VN titer ≥160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment, was ≥80% when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers were ≥1:1350. Of all donors, 37% lacked VN titers ≥160. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2,814 asymptomatic adults found 73 individuals with anti-ECD IgG titers of ≥1:50 and strong positive correlation with anti-RBD and VN titers. Fourteen of these individuals had VN titers ≥1:160, all of which had anti-RBD titer ≥1:1350. We conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors.

We present our initial experience with the SITUS technique in radical cystectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between September 2010 and September 2011, eight patients underwent SITUS radical cystectomy (SITUS Cx), pelvic lymph node dissection and extracorporeal urinary diversion. A cutaneous ureterostomy was performed in three, an ileum conduit in one and an ileal neobladder in four patients. Data were collected prospectively, including patients' characteristics, intraoperative parameters, pathological stage and postoperative outcome. RESULTS Mean age of the patients was 67 years and the mean body mass index 24 kg/m(2). SITUS Cx was successfully completed in all patients without conversion to conventional laparoscopic or open surgery. Mean surgical time was 434 min and mean estimated blood loss 643 ml. No major intra- or postoperative surgical complications occurred. All patients recovered quickly reporting low postoperative pain levels. Mean hospital stay was 16 (7-24 days). Histopathological evaluation revealed a mean of 16 (6-33) retrieved lymph nodes and no positive margins. CONCLUSION In the present experience, SITUS Cx proved to be feasible with surgical outcome comparable to conventional techniques. Because SITUS Cx combines the advantages of traditional laparoscopy (straight instruments and triangulation) with those of single-port surgery (superior cosmesis and minimal invasiveness), it presents an attractive alternative to other minimally invasive techniques.","Horstmann, M; Kugler, M; Anastasiadis, A G; Walcher, U; Herrmann, T; Nagele, U",World journal of urology,327,5

While intent is not necessarily outcome, such intentions match similar survey results in Ireland and elsewhere. The rationale for migration is described as a function of difficult workplace circumstances (notably long hours and mismanagement). Lifestyle factors may however also be important for both migration and significant levels of return migration. These are related to family formation, and to an established culture of migration, that has contributed to a considerable circularity of mobility and migration, primarily between Anglophone countries.

However, there has not been a systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of CBPHC on HIV outcomes derived from rigorous assessments of primary studies. Using peer-reviewed studies of randomized interventions or those containing a specified control group and directly measuring clinical HIV outcomes, we provide evidence for the effectiveness of CBPHC on HIV outcomes for mothers and children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods Eligibility criteria included studies assessing the effectiveness of community-based HIV interventions with or without a facility-based component, or multiple integrated projects, with outcome measures defining an aspect of HIV health status such as the utilization of prevention or health care services, nutritional status, serious morbidity (including clinical measures of HIV progression) or mortality of children aged five or younger and pregnant women. Articles published through June 3, 2020 were identified by searching four databases. The type of community-based projects implemented, the implementors, and the implementation strategies of each program were identified and the impact on HIV-related outcomes assessed. Results The search yielded 10 537 articles; 4881 underwent title and abstract screening after removing duplicates. Of these, 117 studies qualified for full-text screening; only 22 were included in the final analysis. Most studies showed that community-based interventions improved HIV prevention and treatment outcomes compared to facility-based approaches alone. Each study had at least one statistically significant HIV-related outcome; the non-significant outcomes found in six of the 22 studies were mostly not related to HIV programming. Most interventions were implemented by community health workers; other implementers were government workers, community members, or research staff. Strategies used included peer-to-peer education, psychosocial support, training of community champions, community-based follow-up care, home-based care, and integrated care. Conclusions CBPHC strategies are effective in improving population-based, HIV-related health outcomes for mothers and children, especially in combination with facility-based approaches. However, there is a need to assess the scalability of such interventions and integrate them into existing health systems to assess their impact on the HIV pandemic in more routine settings.","Mushamiri, Ivy; Belai, Wintana; Sacks, Emma; Genberg, Becky; Gupta, Sundeep; Perry, Henry B",Journal of global health,327,12

Strategies to improve immunity to influenza in these patients are clearly needed. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing tandem Fluzone High-Dose influenza vaccination with standard-of-care influenza vaccination. Standard-of-care vaccination was single-dose age-based vaccination (standard dose, <65 years; high dose, ≥65 years), and patients in this arm received a saline placebo injection at 30 days. A total of 122 PCD patients were enrolled; 47 received single-dose standard-of-care vaccination, and 75 received 2 doses of Fluzone High-Dose vaccine. Rates of hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titer seroprotection against all 3 strains (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) were significantly higher for patients after tandem high-dose vaccination vs control (87.3% vs 63.2%; P = .003) and led to higher seroprotection at the end of flu season (60.0% vs 31.6%; P = .04). These data demonstrate that tandem high-dose influenza vaccination separated by 30 days leads to higher serologic HAI titer responses and more durable influenza-specific immunity in PCD patients. Similar vaccine strategies may also be essential to achieve protective immunity against other emerging pathogens such as novel coronavirus in these patients.

METHODS Between January 2016 and October 2018, 20 consecutive patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma underwent supine extraperitoneal laparoscopic nephroureterectomy. The patients were placed in the complete supine position. A 4-cm pararectal skin incision was made and the extraperitoneal space was developed. We used a unique port placement that permits complete access for nephroureterectomy, bladder cuff excision and concomitant lymphadenectomy. Operative parameters and pathological data were analyzed. RESULTS The median age was 70 years (range 49-88 years), the mean operative time was 234 min (range 175-293 min) and the mean estimated blood loss was 67 mL (range 50-200 mL). There were no intraoperative complications, and no patients required transfusion or open conversion. The median number of removed lymph nodes was 10; only one patient had node metastasis. The total operative time and time for nephroureterectomy were significantly longer in the first 10 patients (first group) than in the second 10 patients (second group). Times required for bladder cuff excision and lymphadenectomy did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Our novel technique, which enables completion of the entire procedure of nephrouretectomy with bladder cuff excision and lymphadenectomy in the supine position without patient repositioning, is safe and minimizes operative time while maintaining oncological efficacy. We believe this approach might become a standard option for patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.","Miki, Jun; Yanagisawa, Takafumi; Iwatani, Kosuke; Obayashi, Koki; Fukuokaya, Wataru; Mori, Keiichiro; Urabe, Fumihiko; Tsuzuki, Shunsuke; Kimura, Shoji; Kimura, Takahiro; Egawa, Shin",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,327,1

Immunologic mechanisms are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SMPP. Therefore, the use of systemic glucocorticoids may have beneficial effects. However, to date, the use of glucocorticoid therapy in SMPP is limited to small case series, and the glucocorticoid dosage for children with SMPP has not been established. METHODS Here, we used a meta-analysis method to collect data from randomized control trials of different doses of methylprednisolone in SMPP to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with low- versus high-dose methylprednisolone in children with SMPP. RESULTS We included 13 Chinese randomized control trials that included 1049 children. The high- and low-dose groups were comprised of 524 and 525 children, respectively. The high-dose group was significantly more effective than the low-dose group in clinical efficacy [risk ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.23, 1.38), P < 0.05]. In addition, compared with low-dose methylprednisolone, high-dose methylprednisolone significantly shortened hospital stays and antipyretic therapy, pulmonary rales disappearance, cough disappearance and pulmonary shadow absorption times. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the high- and low-dose groups: risk ratio= 0.85, 95% CI (0.53, 1.36), P > 0.05. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective in the treatment of SMPP without increasing the incidence of adverse reactions.","Sun, Lin-Li; Ye, Chao; Zhou, Yu-Lu; Zuo, Shan-Ru; Deng, Zhen-Zhen; Wang, Chun-Jiang",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,327,1

Several mechanisms involving both direct effects on target cells and indirect effects via the immune system might exist. SARS-CoV has been shown in vitro to induce changes of cytokines and chemokines in various human and animal cells. We previously reported that interferon (IFN) alfacon-1 was more active against SARS-CoV infection in human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells than in African green monkey kidney epithelial cells on day 3 post-infection. METHODS In the current study, we first evaluated the efficacy of IFN-alfacon 1 in Calu-3 cells during the first 7 days of virus infection. We then used the two-antibody sandwich ELISA method to detect IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). We further evaluated the efficacy of antivirals directed against SARS-CoV infection in BALB/c mice. RESULTS A potent, prolonged inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in Calu-3 cells with IFN-alfacon 1 was observed. Furthermore, IP-10, an IFN-inducible leukocyte chemoattractant, was detected in Calu-3 cells after SARS-CoV infection. Interestingly, IP-10 expression was shown to be significantly increased when SARS-CoV-infected Calu-3 cells were treated with IFN alfacon-1. IP-10 expression was detected in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mice. Significantly high levels of mouse IP-10 in BALB/c mice was also detected when SARS-CoV-infected mice were treated with the interferon inducer, polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethyl cellulose (poly IC:LC). Treatment with poly IC:LC by intranasal route were effective in protecting mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and reduced the viral lung titres. CONCLUSIONS Our data might provide an important insight into the mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and these properties might be therapeutically advantageous.","Kumaki, Yohichi; Day, Craig W; Bailey, Kevin W; Wandersee, Miles K; Wong, Min-Hui; Madsen, Jason R; Madsen, Justin S; Nelson, Nathan M; Hoopes, Justin D; Woolcott, John D; McLean, Tyler Z; Blatt, Lawrence M; Salazar, Andres M; Smee, Donald F; Barnard, Dale L",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,327,28

The objective was to compare the serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) titers to BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V, cytokine mRNA expression and mucosal BHV1- and BRSV-specific IgA in nasal secretions following administration of IN or subcutaneous (SC) modified-live virus (MLV) booster vaccines 60 days after primary IN vaccination in young beef calves. Twenty-one beef calves were administered 2 mL of an IN MLV vaccine containing BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V (Inforce3®) between one and five weeks of age. Sixty days after primary vaccination, calves were randomly assigned to one of two groups: IN-MLV (n = 11): Calves received 2 mL of the same IN MLV vaccine used for primary vaccination and 2 mL of a SC MLV vaccine containing BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi- Shield GOLD® BVD). SC-MLV (n = 10): Calves were administered 2 mL of a MLV vaccine containing, BHV1, BRSV, BPI3V, and BVDV1 & 2 (Bovi-Shield GOLD® 5). Blood and nasal secretion samples were collected on days -61 (primary vaccination), -28, -14, 0 (booster vaccination), 14, 21, 28, 42 and 60 for determination of SNA titers, cytokine gene expression analysis and nasal virus-specific IgA concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using a repeated measures analysis through PROC GLIMMIX of SAS®. Booster vaccination by neither IN nor SC routes induced a significant increase in SNA titers against BHV1, BRSV, and BPI3V. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA titers (on day 42) and IgA concentration in nasal secretions (on days 21 and 42) compared to calves receiving IN booster vaccination. Both IN and SC booster vaccination were able to stimulate the production of BHV1-specific IgA in nasal secretions. In summary, booster vaccination of young beef calves using either SC or IN route two months after IN MLV primary vaccination resulted in comparable SNA titers, cytokine gene expression profile and virus-specific IgA concentration in nasal secretions. Only a few differences in the systemic and mucosal immune response against BHV1 and BRSV were observed. Subcutaneous booster vaccination induced significantly greater BRSV-specific SNA and secretory IgA titers compared to IN booster vaccination.","Palomares, Roberto A; Bittar, João H J; Woolums, Amelia R; Hoyos-Jaramillo, Alejandro; Hurley, David J; Saliki, Jeremiah T; Ferrer, Maria S; Bullington, Anna C; Rodriguez, Adriana; Murray, Tyler; Thoresen, Merrilee; Jones, Katie; Stoskute, Agne",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,327,27

However, their effect on metabolic syndrome is not well-established. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from palm oil in high-fat-diet-treated rats. Male, post-weaning Sprague Dawley rats were provided high-fat (60% kcal) diet for eight weeks followed by a TRF (60 mg/kg) treatment for another four weeks. Physical, metabolic, and histological changes were compared to those on control and high-fat diets respectively. High-fat feeding for eight weeks induced all hallmarks of metabolic syndrome. The TRF reversed systolic and diastolic hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis, impaired antioxidant defense, and myeloperoxidase hyperactivity triggered by the high-fat diet. It also conferred an inhibitory effect on protein glycation to reduce glycated hemoglobin A1c and advanced glycation end products (AGE). This was accompanied by the suppression of the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) expression in the liver. The treatment effects on visceral adiposity, glycemic control, triglyceride level, as well as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and γ expression were negligible. To conclude, treatment with a TRF exhibited protective effects on the cardiovascular and liver health in addition to the amelioration of plasma redox imbalance and AGE-RAGE activation. Further investigation as a therapy for metabolic syndrome is therefore worthwhile.","Cheng, Hong Sheng; Ton, So Ha; Tan, Joash Ban Lee; Abdul Kadir, Khalid",Nutrients,327,16

The key question is ""what is health for?"". Also, covid-19 confronted us with a question which engages directly with this issue of tradeoffs and balance: what are we willing to give up in order to get to health? How we respond depends on how we define health. Health could be better defined as an activity capable of balancing risk mitigation with the reasonable risk inherent in the pursuit of a full life, with health seen as a means to live a fulfilling life. If we truly believe that health matters, our pursuit of it should reflect the understanding that we do not live to be healthy: we aspire to be healthy so we can live.","Galea, Sandro",Recenti progressi in medicina,327,16

These stressors are laid on top of a resident selection process already under duress with exploding application and interview numbers-the latter likely to be exacerbated with the widespread shift to virtual interviewing. Leveraging their trainee perspective, the authors propose enforcing a cap on the number of interviews that applicants may attend through a novel interview ticket system (ITS). Specialties electing to participate in the ITS would select an evidence-based, specialty-specific interview cap. Applicants would then receive unique electronic tickets-equal in number to the cap-that would be given to participating programs at the time of an interview, when the tickets would be marked as used. The system would be self-enforcing and would ensure each interview represents genuine interest between applicant and program, while potentially increasing the number of interviews-and thus match rate-for less competitive applicants. Limitations of the ITS and alternative approaches for interview capping, including an honor code system, are also discussed. Finally, in the context of capped interview numbers, the authors emphasize the need for transparent pre-interview data from programs to inform applicants and their advisors on which interviews to attend; learning from prior experiences and studies on virtual interviewing; adherence to best practices for interviewing; and careful consideration of how virtual interviews may shift inequities in the resident selection process.","Burk-Rafel, Jesse; Standiford, Taylor",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,327,1

However, a minority feel that they have received adequate instruction in medical school. This novel supplemental reproductive and sexual health curriculum at a large academic medical center aimed to address this gap and to improve attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about sexual and reproductive health topics among learners. METHODS Students participated in a series of sexual and reproductive health workshops taught by interdisciplinary health care workers, with the first cohort in a classroom setting and the second cohort using a virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We administered a novel pre- and postcourse survey to assess attitudes, comfort, and knowledge about the topics. We performed unpaired 1-tailed t tests and χ2 tests to compare the scores on the pre- and postcourse surveys. RESULTS Sample size was 12 students for the first cohort and 23 students for the second cohort. Reported levels of comfort with taking sexual histories in different age groups and discussing reproductive and sexual health topics increased significantly: 0.92 for the classroom setting, and 0.50 for the virtual setting, with an average increase of 0.65 points on a 4-point Likert scale. There were no significant changes in student attitudes toward or knowledge of reproductive and sexual health. CONCLUSION This course elaborated on topics to which medical students traditionally lack adequate exposure, with significant improvement in comfort counseling patients. A disparity between the classroom and virtual setting suggests limitations of online learning for these topics.","Friedlander, Rachel; Mou, Sophie; Shearer, Lee",Family medicine,327,1

This report details the experience hosting a virtual meeting and presents attendee feedback on the platform. METHODS AND MATERIALS The ROECSG Symposium was hosted virtually on May 15, 2020. A post-symposium survey was distributed electronically to assess attendee demographics, participation, and experience. Attendee preference and experience were queried using 3-point and 5-point Likert-type scales, respectively. Symplur LLC was used to generate analytics for the conference hashtag (#ROECSG). RESULTS The survey was distributed to all 286 registrants with a response rate of 67% (n=191). Seventeen non-attendee responses were omitted from this analysis, for a total of 174 respondents included. Forty-seven percent (n=82) of attendees were present for the entire symposium. A preference for a virtual symposium was expressed by 45% (n=78) of respondents, while 25% (n=44) had no preference and 30% (n=52) preferred an in-person meeting; 86% (n=150) of respondents rated the symposium as ""extremely"" well-organized. Respondents who had not attended a prior in-person ROECSG symposium were more likely to prefer the virtual format (p=0.03). Respondents reported a preference for the virtual platform for reviewing scholarly work (n=78, 45%) and an in-person platform for networking (n=103, 59%).

However, it remains to be investigated which type of RT (high loads (HLs) vs low loads (LLs)) is more efficacious in improving exercise performance, cardio-metabolic health and quality of life. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A randomised, controlled, clinical trial will enrol 20 patients with CAD into each of three study arms (total 60 patients): HL-RT (70%-80% of one repetition maximum (1-RM)) combined with AT; LL-RT (30%-40% of 1-RM) combined with AT and AT alone as standard care. Primary outcomes (maximal aerobic capacity, maximal leg isometric strength) will be assessed at baseline and after 36 training sessions. Other outcomes will include acute haemodynamic responses to LL-RT and HL-RT, body composition, physical performance, blood biomarkers (lipids, glucose metabolism, inflammation, growth factors), physical activity and quality of life. The intention-to-treat principle will be used to analyse the data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study design and protocol have been approved by the National Medical Ethics Committee of Slovenia (registration number: 0120-573/2019/15). The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The results of the study will be published as peer-reviewed manuscripts and congress presentations, communicated with patients and the clinical community, and shared through posts on social media. The findings of the study will be disseminated among the national CR clinical community (CR centres, Slovenian association of coronary clubs) with active participation of the patients enrolled in the study. This study will expand our knowledge of RT in combination with AT in CR. We expect to find different effects of HL-RT versus LL-RT, with implications for RT strategies in rehabilitation of patients with CAD.

MATERIAL AND METHODS An approved, observational, retrospective study was conducted between March 15 to April 15, 2020. 150 adult patients aged less than 75 with Charlson comorbidity index ≤ 6 diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Seventy-five patients were randomly selected from those admitted to the critical care units (Critical care group (CG)) and seventy-five hospitalized patients who did not require critical care (Non-Critical care group (nCG)) represent the control group. One additional cohort of hospitalized patiens with COVID-19 were used to validate the score. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical care associated with increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (odds ratio 1.052 (1.009-1.101); p=0·0043) and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (1.968 (1.389-2.590); p<0·0001), both at the time of hospital admission. The AUC-ROC for the combined model was 0.83 (0.76-0.90) (vs AUC-ROC SOFA p<0.05). The AUC-ROC for the validation cohort was 0.89 (0.82-0.95) (p>0.05 vs AUC-ROC development). CONCLUSION Patients COVID-19 presenting at admission SOFA score ≥2 combined with CRP ≥ 9,1 mg/mL could help clinicians to identify them at high risk to require critical care.","Vaquero-Roncero, Luis Mario; Sánchez-Barrado, Elisa; Escobar-Macias, Daniel; Arribas-Pérez, Pilar; González, Rafael; Ramón Gonzalez-Porras, José; Sánchez-Hernandez, Miguel Vicente",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,327,27

METHODS We searched four databases from inception to July 1st, 2020. We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which assessed the effectiveness and safety of mirogabalin in patients with DPNP. We evaluated the quality of the included RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. We pooled dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios and continuous outcomes as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals, both under the random- or fixed-effects model. RESULTS Three RCTs matched our inclusion criteria with a total of 1732 patients with DPNP: 1057, 534, and 141 patients received mirogabalin, placebo, and pregabalin, respectively. The quality of included RCTs was marked as moderate-to-high. Mirogabalin treatment was significantly associated with a significant reduction in the average daily pain score (ADPS) compared to placebo over seven weeks. Compared to pregabalin, mirogabalin was significantly associated with more decrease in ADPS only after three, four, and five weeks. The proportion of patients with ≥30% and ≥50% reduction in the ADPS was significantly higher in the mirogabalin versus placebo and pregabalin groups. Compared to placebo, mirogabalin was significantly associated with more adverse events of dizziness, increased weight, peripheral edema, and somnolence. The safety profile was comparable between mirogabalin and pregabalin. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that in patients with DPNP, mirogabalin treatment was superior to placebo and pregabalin in decreasing the ADPS over time. Besides, mirogabalin was largely safe and associated with some adverse events that could be managed conservatively.","Alyoubi, Reem Abdullah; Alshareef, Aysha Abdulmalek; Aldughaither, Saud Musaab; Aljaroudi, Abeer Mahdi; Alabdulwahed, Alwaleed; Alduraibi, Faisal Muhammed; Taher Masoud, Ahmed; Abu-Zaid, Ahmed",International journal of clinical practice,327,11

It is difficult to diagnose, partly due to its relative rarity, its multiple and various clinical manifestations (different from 'conventional' stroke, and often mimicking other acute neurological conditions), and because it is often challenging to obtain and interpret optimal and timely brain imaging. Although CVT can result in death or permanent disability, it generally has a favourable prognosis if diagnosed and treated early. Neurologists involved in stroke care therefore also need to be aware of the treatments for CVT (with varying degrees of supporting evidence): the mainstay is prompt anticoagulation but patients who deteriorate despite treatment can be considered for endovascular procedures (endovascular thrombolysis or thrombectomy) or neurosurgery (decompressive craniotomy).

All malaria cases were treated at baseline (September 2012). We used baseline SF and malaria status indicated by positive microscopy at endline (March 2013) to define exposure and outcome, respectively. Iron status was defined as deficient (corrected or uncorrected SF <12 or <15 μg/L, depending on age <5 or ≥5 y, respectively), moderate (<75 μg/L, excluding deficient), or high (≥75 μg/L). We used a modified Poisson regression to model the risk of malaria in the high transmission seasons (endline) as a function of iron status assessed in the low malaria seasons (baseline).Results: We observed an age-dependent, positive dose-response association between ferritin in the low malaria season and malaria incidence during the high malaria season in younger children. In children aged <6 y (but not older children), we observed a relative increase in malaria risk in the moderate iron status [incidence rate ratio (IRR) with SF: 1.56; 95% CI: 0.64, 3.86; IRR with inflammation-corrected SF: 1.92; 95% CI: 0.75, 4.93] and high iron status (IRR with SF: 2.66; 95% CI: 1.10, 6.43; or IRR with corrected SF: 2.93; 95% CI: 1.17, 7.33) categories compared with the deficient iron status category. The relative increase in malaria risk for children with high iron status was statistically significant only among those with a concurrently normal serum soluble transferrin receptor concentration (<8.3 mg/L; IRR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.20, 7.37).Conclusions: Iron adequacy in 4- to 8-y-old children in rural Zambia was associated with increased malaria risk.

Little information is available regarding the potential impact of different bispectral index (BIS) levels on electrocorticographic spike identification for surgical epileptic foci resection. METHODS Twenty-two intractable epilepsy subjects were randomly allocated to the propofol-remifentanil or sevoflurane-remifentanil groups, and were further randomized to four BIS85 (BIS 71-85), BIS70 (BIS 56-70), BIS55 (BIS 41-55), and BIS40 (BIS ≤40) sequence order. RESULTS Two-way ANOVA revealed no differences between groups in spike frequency (P = 0.720), spike amplitude (P = 0.647), or number of spiking leads (P = 0.653). In the propofol and sevoflurane groups, decreasing BIS levels increased mean ± SD spike/min frequency (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) at BIS85 (10 ± 12 and 10 ± 8), BIS70 (19 ± 17 and 17 ± 15), BIS55 (22 ± 17 and 18 ± 8), and BIS40 (25 ± 15 and 23 ± 17). Furthermore, in the propofol and sevoflurane groups, decreasing BIS levels increased spike microvolt amplitude (P = 0.006 and P = 0.009) at BIS85 (1,100 ± 400 and 750 ± 400), BIS70 (1,200 ± 460 and 850 ± 490), BIS55 (1,300 ± 560 and 940 ± 700), and BIS40 (1,400 ± 570 and 1,300 ± 700). Whereas, in the propofol and sevoflurane groups, there was no difference in the location or number of spiking leads (P = 0.057 and P = 0.109) at the four BIS levels. Compared with BIS85, spike frequency in the propofol and sevoflurane groups increased 100 and 170% at BIS70, 116 and 180% at BIS55, and 132 and 230% at BIS40. Compared with BIS85, spike amplitude increased 108 and 113% at BIS70, 121 and 125% at BIS55, and 128 and 170% at BIS40.

The health care costs associated with the combined use of these 2 measures aimed at preventing VARI are not known, however. The objective of this study was to determine whether the simultaneous use of these 2 preventive measures for VARI could save health care costs. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study of patients who needed mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit. The health care costs considered here included only the costs of the endotracheal tube, cuff control, and antimicrobials used to treat VARI. RESULTS The study cohort comprised 656 patients, including 241 with intermittent control of cuff pressure and without SSD (standard group), 260 with CCCP and without SSD (CCCP group), 84 with intermittent control of cuff pressure and with SSD (SSD group), and 71 with CCCP and SSD (CCCP + SSD group).

More than 91,000 responders were exposed to a range of hazards during the recovery and clean-up operation that followed. Various health programs track the on-going health effects of 9/11, including the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program (WTCHP). The objective of this research was to review WTCHP statistics reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to analyze health trends among enrolled responders as the 20-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks approaches. METHODS The WTCHP statistics reported by the CDC were analyzed to identify health trends among enrolled responders from 2011 through 2021. Statistics for non-responders were excluded. RESULTS A total of 80,745 responders were enrolled in the WTCHP as of March 2021: 62,773 were classified as general responders; 17,023 were Fire Department of New York (FDNY) responders; and 989 were Pentagon and Shanksville responders. Of the total responders in the program, 3,439 are now deceased. Just under 40% of responders with certified health issues were aged 45-64 and 83% were male. The top three certified conditions among enrolled responders were: aerodigestive disorders; cancer; and mental ill health. The top ten certified cancers have remained the same over the last five years, however, leukemia has now overtaken colon and bladder cancer as the 20-year anniversary approaches. Compared to the general population, 9/11 first responders had a higher rate of all cancers combined, as well as higher rates of prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and leukemia. DISCUSSION Trends in these program statistics should be viewed with some caution. While certain illnesses have been linked with exposure to the WTC site, differences in age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, and other factors between exposed and unexposed groups should also be considered. Increased rates of some illnesses among this cohort may be associated with heightened surveillance rather than an actual increase in disease. Still, cancer in general, as well as lung disease, heart disease, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), seem to be increasing among 9/11 responders, even now close to 20 years later. CONCLUSION Responders should continue to avail themselves of the health care and monitoring offered through programs like the WTCHP.","Smith, Erin; Holmes, Lisa; Larkin, Brigid",Prehospital and disaster medicine,327,17

Vaccination strategies based on heterologous prime-boost protocols using Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as primer and modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain expressing the mycobacterial antigen Ag85A (MVA85A) as booster may increase the protective efficacy of BCG. In addition, vaccination with the recombinant viral vaccine vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-846 (Rv3615c, Mtb10.4, and Rv2660c) can elicit a remarkable T-cell-mediated immune response and provide an effective long-term protection after the BCG challenge. In this study, we used VSV-846 to boost BCG and evaluated its immunogenicity in BALB/c mice. In this prime-boost approach, boosting with VSV-846 significantly enhanced IFN-γ CD4 T cell responses, which are crucial for anti-TB immune responses. Moreover, VSV-846 boosting significantly reduced pathology compared with mock vaccination, and decreased the bacterial loads in lung tissues compared with BCG or VSV-846 vaccination alone.

Recent studies indicate that mesh implantation during formation of a colostomy might prevent a PSH. To determine if placement of a retromuscular mesh at the colostomy site is a feasible, safe and effective procedure in preventing a parastomal hernia, we performed a multicentre randomized controlled trial in 11 large teaching hospitals and three university centres in The Netherlands. METHODS Augmentation of the abdominal wall with a retromuscular light-weight polypropylene mesh (Parietene Light™, Covidien) around the trephine was compared with traditional colostomy formation. Patients undergoing elective open formation of a permanent end-colostomy were eligible. 150 patients were randomized between 2010 and 2012. Primary endpoint of the PREVENT trial is the incidence of parastomal hernia. Secondary endpoints are morbidity, pain, quality of life, mortality and cost-effectiveness. This article focussed on the early results of the PREVENT trial and, therefore, operation time, postoperative morbidity, pain, and quality of life were measured. RESULTS Outcomes represent results after 3 months of follow-up. A total of 150 patients were randomized. Mean operation time of the mesh group (N = 72) was significantly longer than in the control group (N = 78) (182.6 vs. 156.8 min; P = 0.018). Four (2.7 %) peristomal infections occurred of which one (1.4 %) in the mesh group. No infection of the mesh occurred. Most of the other infections were infections of the perineal wound, equally distributed over both groups. No statistical differences were discovered in stoma or mesh-related complications, fistula or stricture formation, pain, or quality of life. CONCLUSIONS During open and elective formation of an end-colostomy, primary placement of a retromuscular light-weight polypropylene mesh for prevention of a parastomal hernia is a safe and feasible procedure.

METHODS REPLENISH (NCT01942668) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, evaluating single, oral, softgel E2/P4 capsules in postmenopausal women (40-65 y) with a uterus and vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Women with moderate to severe hot flushes (≥7/d or ≥50/wk) were randomized (VMS substudy) to daily E2/P4 (mg/mg) of 1/100, 0.5/100, 0.5/50, 0.25/50, or placebo. Proportions of women with ≥50% or ≥75% reductions in moderate to severe VMS (responders), and those with no severe VMS as well as the weekly number of days without moderate to severe VMS with TX-001HR versus placebo were determined. Mixed model repeated measures was used to analyze data and Fisher exact test was employed to compare E2/P4 versus placebo. RESULTS Seven hundred twenty-six women were eligible for the VMS efficacy analysis (E2/P4 1/100 [n = 141], 0.5/100 [n = 149], 0.5/50 [n = 147], 0.25/50 [n = 154], or placebo [n = 135]). Significantly more women treated with all E2/P4 doses versus placebo were ≥50% responders and ≥75% responders at weeks 4 and 12 (P < 0.05) and also had significantly more days per week without moderate to severe VMS at week 12 (1.9-3.0 d for E2/P4 versus 1.3 d for placebo; P < 0.05). The proportion of women without severe hot flushes at week 12 was 43% to 56% for all E2/P4 doses versus 26% for placebo (P ≤ 0.01).

Sufficient ingestion of iodine is necessary for normal growth and development. If iodine requirements are not met, growth can be impaired. Salt iodisation and supplementation with iodine can prevent iodine deficiency disorders and stunted growth. No systematic review has yet collated the evidence linking iodine to growth. With an increased emphasis on stunting within the WHO Global Nutrition Targets for 2025, we propose a systematic review to address this question. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will undertake a systematic review, and if appropriate, meta-analyses, evaluating the effects of iodised salt or iodine supplements on prenatal and postnatal somatic growth, until age 18. We will search a number of databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Library, including the CENTRAL register of Controlled Trials and also the WHO library and ICTRP (International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), which includes the Clinicaltrials.gov repository. We will also search Wanfang Data and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. Included studies must have compared exposure to iodised salt, iodine supplements or iodised oil, to placebo, non-iodised salt or no intervention. Primary outcomes will be continuous and categorical markers of prenatal and postnatal somatic growth. Secondary outcomes will cover further measures of growth, including growth rates and indirect markers of growth such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and will be sent directly to the WHO, United Nations Children's Fund, International Council for the Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders and other stakeholders. The results generated from this systematic review will provide evidence to support future programme recommendations regarding iodine fortification or supplementation and child growth.

However, bisulfite treatment damages DNA, which results in fragmentation, DNA loss, and biased sequencing data. To overcome these problems, enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) was developed. This method detects 5mC and 5hmC using two sets of enzymatic reactions. In the first reaction, TET2 and T4-BGT convert 5mC and 5hmC into products that cannot be deaminated by APOBEC3A. In the second reaction, APOBEC3A deaminates unmodified cytosines by converting them to uracils. Therefore, these three enzymes enable the identification of 5mC and 5hmC. EM-seq libraries were compared with bisulfite-converted DNA, and each library type was ligated to Illumina adaptors before conversion. Libraries were made using NA12878 genomic DNA, cell-free DNA, and FFPE DNA over a range of DNA inputs. The 5mC and 5hmC detected in EM-seq libraries were similar to those of bisulfite libraries. However, libraries made using EM-seq outperformed bisulfite-converted libraries in all specific measures examined (coverage, duplication, sensitivity, etc.). EM-seq libraries displayed even GC distribution, better correlations across DNA inputs, increased numbers of CpGs within genomic features, and accuracy of cytosine methylation calls. EM-seq was effective using as little as 100 pg of DNA, and these libraries maintained the described advantages over bisulfite sequencing. EM-seq library construction, using challenging samples and lower DNA inputs, opens new avenues for research and clinical applications.","Vaisvila, Romualdas; Ponnaluri, V K Chaithanya; Sun, Zhiyi; Langhorst, Bradley W; Saleh, Lana; Guan, Shengxi; Dai, Nan; Campbell, Matthew A; Sexton, Brittany S; Marks, Katherine; Samaranayake, Mala; Samuelson, James C; Church, Heidi E; Tamanaha, Esta; Corrêa, Ivan R; Pradhan, Sriharsa; Dimalanta, Eileen T; Evans, Thomas C; Williams, Louise; Davis, Theodore B",Genome research,327,19

The emergence of EIDs has been associated with interconnected economic, social and environmental changes. Understanding these changes is crucial for EID preparedness and subsequent prevention and control of EID events. The aim of this review is to describe tools currently available for identification, prioritization and investigation of EIDs impacting human and animal health, and how these might be integrated into a systematic approach for directing EID preparedness. Environmental scanning, foresight programmes, horizon scanning and surveillance are used to collect and assess information for rapidly responding to EIDs and to anticipate drivers of emergence for mitigating future EID impacts. Prioritization of EIDs - using transparent and repeatable methods - based on disease impacts and the importance of those impacts to decision-makers can then be used for more efficient resource allocation for prevention and control. Risk assessment and simulation modelling methods assess the likelihood of EIDs occurring, define impact and identify mitigation strategies. Each of these tools has a role to play individually; however, we propose integration of these tools into a framework that enhances the development of tactical and strategic plans for emerging risk preparedness.","Brookes, V J; Hernández-Jover, M; Black, P F; Ward, M P",Epidemiology and infection,327,1

Common assumptions underlying standard single-cell analyses don’t hold when examining low-expressed genes, with the result that standard workflows can produce misleading results. Key Points Lowly expressed genes in single-cell RNA-seq can be easliy misanalyzed. log(1+x) count normalization introduces errors for lowly expressed genes The average log(1+x) expression differs considerably from log(x) when x is small An alternative approach is to use the fraction of cells with non-zero expression","Booeshaghi, A.

The backbone of the response is a test-trace-isolate strategy, where suspected infected get tested and isolated and possible secondary cases get traced, tested and isolated. Because more accurate tests often take longer to analyze, and the benefits of contact tracing are strengthened by rapid diagnosis, there exists a trade-off in test sensitivity and test waiting time in test-trace-isolate strategies. Here we ask: How many false negatives can be tolerated in a rapid test so that it reduces transmission better than a slower, more accurate test? How does this change with contact tracing efficiency and test waiting time? We find that a rapid, less sensitive test performs best for many test-parameter choices and that this is true even for modest contact tracing efficiency. For COVID-19-like viral parameters, a test with 40% false negatives and immediate result might reduce transmission as well as a test with no false negatives and a 3-day waiting time. Our analysis suggests employing rapid tests to reduce test waiting times as a viable strategy to reduce transmission when testing infrastructure is under stress.","Juul, J.

Stress modifying techniques such as MBSR may improve CV function and quality of life (QOL). We present data of a pilot study assessing the impact of MBSR on endothelial dysfunction and psychosocial outcomes. Methods: 31 women with locally advanced breast cancer and taking an AI were randomized 1:1 to 8 weekly MBSR classes or wait-list control. Subjects with tobacco use, known hypertension or hyperlipidemia were excluded. Participants completed surveys and vascular testing at baseline and 10 weeks. With the COVID 19 pandemic, MBSR classes were held on a virtual platform. Endothelial function was measured using the Endo-PAT2000 system;reductions in EndoPAT ratio (&lt;1.6) are indicative of worsening endothelial function and increased CV risk. Questionnaires included the CDC's 4-item Healthy Days Core Module (HRQOL), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-8 for depression, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Functional test markers were compared between groups using t-tests. Results: Baseline mean age was 59 years, body mass index was 28.4 kg/m2, mean systolic blood pressure was 128.1 mmHg and cholesterol was 226.9 mg/dL. These measures did not differ between groups. Baseline EndoPAT ratio (0.60) and follow up (0.52) were low in all participants. As statewide COVID- 19 cases spiked, 3/31 participants did not return for a second assessment, and for another 5 participants, one EndoPAT ratio measurement was not interpretable. Both groups showed a decline in EndoPat ratio pre-to-post, but the decline among MBSR participants (all of whom completed the intervention) was five times less than that observed among controls [Table]. Groups did not differ on QOL or psychosocial outcomes. Conclusions: Breast cancer survivors on AIs have endothelial dysfunction, a measure of increased CV risk. Stress reduction techniques, using virtual platforms, are feasible and acceptable to this patient population, and may help improve endothelial function. Further research and longer follow up is warranted in understanding the longterm impact of these interventions on CV risk and psychosocial well-being.

Travel was inevitably associated with the rapid global transmission of COVID-19. In the UK, public health authorities took action to reduce risks of travel-associated spread by providing public health information at ports of entry. This study aims to understand individual risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official advice among international travellers; to provide evidence to inform future policy on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Study design This study is a qualitative study evaluation. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate risk assessment processes, decision making, and adherence to official Public Health England (PHE) advice among travellers. Results Participants regarded official advice as adequate at the time, despite observing differences between the intervention measures implemented in the countries of departure. Participants however also described adopting precautionary measures including self-isolation and the use of face coverings that went beyond official advice, and variability in the extent to which they adhered to guidance on contacting health authorities. Adherence to official guidance was informed by the perceived salience of specific transmission possibilities and containment measures assessed in relation to participants' social and institutional environments. Conclusion Analysis of travellers' reported motivations demonstrates that responses to public health advice constitute a proactive process of risk assessment and rationalised decision-making that incorporates consideration of living situation, trust in information sources, correspondence with cultural logics, and willingness to accept potential risk to self and significant others in guiding preventive action. Our findings concerning international passengers' understanding of, and compliance with, official advice and mitigation measures provide valuable evidence to inform future policy and we provide recommendations on the presentation of public health information to facilitate safer international travel. Access to a central source of regularly updated official information would help minimise confusion between different national guidelines. Greater attention to the differentiated information needs of diverse groups in creating future public-facing guidance would help to minimise the uncertainties generated by receipt of generic information.","Cai, S.; Zhang, T.; Robin, C.; Sawyer, C.; Rice, W.; Smith, L.

Given the risk it poses, the Government of Uganda (GOU) adopted and recommended face mask use as one of the preventive measures to limit its transmission in communities. However, there is limited data on the levels of face mask usage and associated factors among students in schools in Uganda. This study aimed at assessing the face mask usage and associated factors among students in schools in rural Eastern Uganda amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross sectional quantitative descriptive study was conducted among 423 students in schools in rural Eastern Uganda. Multi-stage sampling method was employed in the selection of study participants. The data was collected by trained data collectors using structured questionnaires pre-installed on ODK enabled smart phones. The data entered was cleaned using Excel 2016 and exported to Stata14.0 statistical software (Statacorp, College station, Texas, USA) for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed using 95% CI (confidence interval). Variables with p-value < 0.20 and those with literature backup evidence were included in the multivariable model. Variables with p-value < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. This study revealed that less than three quarters (62.3%) wore face masks correctly. Results: Almost all, 98.9% of the participants mentioned that they wore face masks due to fear of missing classes and 49.0% disagreed that they were vulnerable to COVID-19. Students in boarding schools (AOR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.05-2.47), those who believed that they were vulnerable to COVID-19 (AOR = 1.70, 95%CI: 1.11-2.10), and those who disagreed that masks are uncomfortable (AOR = 1.62, 95%CI: 1.06-2.46) were more likely to wear facemasks correctly. Conclusion: This study revealed that more than a third of the students did not wear face masks correctly. Correct wearing of face masks was associated with being in a boarding school, belief that they were susceptible to COVID-19, and disagreeing that masks were uncomfortable. This therefore highlights the need for sensitization programmes in academic institutions in order to improve the perceptions of students toward COVID-19 and face masks, and consequently increase correct face mask usage in schools.","Mwesige, D.; Nalugya, A.; Bulafu, D.; Tigaiza, A.; Nagawa, B.

Here, we analyze the first 1918 IAV genomes from Europe and from the first, milder wave of the pandemic. 1918 IAV genomic diversity is consistent with local transmission and frequent long-distance dispersal events and in vitro polymerase characterization suggests potential phenotypic variability. Comparison of first and second wave genomes shows variation at two sites in the nucleoprotein gene associated with resistance to host antiviral response, pointing at a possible adaptation of 1918 IAV to humans. Finally, phylogenetic estimates based on extended molecular clock modelling suggests a pure pandemic descent of seasonal H1N1 IAV as an alternative to the hypothesis of an intrasubtype reassortment origin.

The book encompasses the various governments’ communication of the crisis, the role played by opposition and the vibrancy of the information environment within each nation. The chapters analyse the communication drawing on theoretical perspectives drawn from the fields of crisis communication, political communication and political psychology. In doing so the book develops a framework to assess the extent to which state communication followed the key indicators of effective communication encapsulated in the principles of: being first;being right;being credible;expressing empathy;promoting action;and showing respect. The book also examines how communication circulated within the mass and social media environments and what impact differences in spokespersons, messages and the broader context has on the success of implementing measures likely to reduce the spread of the virus. Cumulatively, the authors develop a global analysis of the responses and how these are shaped by their specific contexts and by the flow of information, while offering lessons for future political crisis communication. This book will be of great interest to students and researchers of politics, communication and public relations, specifically on courses and modules relating to current affairs, crisis communication and strategic communication, as well as practitioners working in the field of health crisis communication. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Darren Lilleker, Ioana A.

SARS-CoV-2 is viewed as a continuous global health threat resulting in an alarming number of fatalities worldwide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been recognized as one of the vital receptors for the SARS-CoV-2, leading to viral entry into the host cells. It also helps many other receptors, which initiate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in the host body. A variety of proteins and enzymes are involved in triggering the transport mechanism. The route of viral infection depends on the distribution and expression of receptors, as the virus reaches the cell by binding to cell receptors to complete intracellular replication, virus release, and cause cytotoxicity. In addition to alveolar lung tissues, ACE2 also plays a pivotal role in other organs. Due to the abundant presence in lung cells, SARS-CoV-2 mostly affects the lungs and causes their destruction. The spike protein utilizes the digestion of ACE2, which strongly contributes to the pathogenesis of severe lung failure. Different experiments show that ACE2 not only helps the virus to migrate in the host cell but also allow us to fight against this pandemic disease. This review article summarizes the current progress that highlights the critical biological functionalities and mechanisms of ACE2 as the novel receptor to transport SARS-CoV-2 into host cells matrix.","Bilal, M.; Iqbal, M.

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte (MucFRE) fungi were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with the rare plant Lycopodiella inundata (‘marsh clubmoss’), one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1,297 individual L. inundata roots collected during spring and autumn 2019 from 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of MucFRE-like hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. MucFRE-like hyphae were the dominant mycorrhizal fungi observed in all of the examined heathlands. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonised in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, and correlated with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about mycorrhizal status - typically drawn from single time point collections - should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are directly relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation nutrient enhancement treatments, microbial diversity and functional studies of host plants and symbionts.","Kowal, Jill; Arrigoni, Elena; Serra, Jordi; Bidartondo, Martin",bioRxiv,327,25

Fever, cough, sore throat, headache, exhaustion, muscular aches, and difficulty breathing are all typical symptoms of COVID-19. A reliable detection technique is needed to identify affected individuals and care for them in the early stages of COVID-19 and reduce the virus's transmission. The most accessible method for COVID-19 identification is RT-PCR; however, due to its time commitment and false-negative results, alternative options must be sought. Indeed, compared to RT-PCR, chest CT scans and chest X-ray images provide superior results. Because of the scarcity and high cost of CT scan equipment, X-ray images are preferable for screening. In this paper, a pre-trained network, DenseNet169, was employed to extract features from X-ray images. Features were chosen by a feature selection method (ANOVA) to reduce computations and time complexity while overcoming the curse of dimensionality to improve predictive accuracy. Finally, selected features were classified by XGBoost. The ChestX-ray8 dataset, which was employed to train and evaluate the proposed method.

The purpose of the most studies was to study the effect of COVID-19 on the visual organ indicate that the most common ophthalmological manifestation of this disease is conjunctivitis, which occurs in 3–10 % of cases. Our observations showed that patients with COVID-19, when applying for an appointment with an ophthalmologist after 1–3 months, make complaints about the feeling of dryness, discomfort in the eyes, itching and redness of the eyelids. These complains arose immediately after the illness and persisted during the above terms. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that any inflammatory process occurring on the eye surface disrupts the process of lacrimation and leads to the emergence of dry eye syndrome. It is necessary to pay close attention to complaints from the visual organ not only in patients with COVID-19 in the early stages of the disease, but also in the coming months after stopping the acute pathological process. As studies have shown, coronavirus can involve the posterior segment of the eye in the pathological process, since this virus has a retinotropic effect. This hypothesis can be confirmed by the reports of several authors who studied with optical coherence tomography (OCT) the state of the retina 11–33 days after the onset of symptoms in patients with COVID-19. OCT data indicate the presence of hyperreflexive zones at the level of the ganglion cell layer and the plexiform layer, the severity of these zones being greater in the papillomacular bundle region. In addition, cases of thromboembolic complications affecting the vascular system of the eye are described. Considering the fact that in the development of thromboembolism of the central artery and retinal vein, therapy is as effective as possible in the first hours from the beginning of this pathological process development, close attention should be paid to patients’ complaints to visual impairment occurred against the background of coronavirus infection.

By comparing the electricity profiles for the lockdown period 2020 with the normal condition in previous years, it showed that the electricity demand in the two educational institutions was almost on the same level, while there were apparent changes for the residential buildings. To estimate the energy saving potential and increase, three scenarios were developed considering different operation strategies: Scenario 1 considered operation under normal settings;Scenario 2 considered operation of educational buildings under nighttime and weekend settings;Scenario 3 considered operation of residential buildings under work-at-home conditions. Energy signature curve models were built to predict yearly demand. The results showed that the electricity demand might be reduced by one-third in educational buildings by following Scenario 2.

Currently, scholars and practitioners screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text.

However, representative typhoid surveillance data are lacking in many low-income countries because of the costs and challenges of diagnostic clinical microbiology. Environmental surveillance (ES) of Salmonella Typhi in sewage and wastewater using molecular methods may offer a low-cost alternative, but its performance in comparison with clinical surveillance has not been assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed a harmonised protocol for typhoid ES and its implementation in communities in India and Malawi where it will be compared with findings from hospital-based surveillance for typhoid fever. The protocol includes methods for ES site selection based on geospatial analysis, grab and trap sample collection at sewage and wastewater sites, and laboratory methods for sample processing, concentration and quantitative PCR to detect Salmonella Typhi. The optimal locations for ES sites based on digital elevation models and mapping of sewage and river networks are described for each community and their suitability confirmed through field investigation. We will compare the prevalence and abundance of Salmonella Typhi in ES samples collected each month over a 12-month period to the incidence of blood culture confirmed typhoid estimated from cases recorded at referral hospitals serving the study areas and community surveys of healthcare seeking for individuals with fever. Significance: If environmental detection of Salmonella Typhi correlates with the incidence of typhoid fever estimated through clinical surveillance, typhoid ES may be a powerful and low-cost tool to estimate the local burden of typhoid fever and support the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines. Typhoid ES could also allow the impact of vaccination to be assessed and rapidly identify circulation of drug resistant strains.","Uzzell, C. B.; Troman, C. M.; Rigby, J.; Mohan, V.

However, the scale and the complexity of the sc datasets poses a great challenge in its utility and this problem is further exacerbated when working with larger datasets typically generated by consortium efforts. As the scale of single cell datasets continues to increase exponentially, there is an unmet technological need to develop database platforms that can evaluate key biological hypothesis by querying extensive single-cell datasets. Large single-cell datasets like human cell atlas and COVID-19 cell atlas (collection of annotated sc datasets from various human organs) are excellent resources for profiling target genes involved in human diseases and disorders ranging from oncology, auto-immunity, as well as infectious diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a worldwide pandemic with massive loss of lives, infections exceeding 7 million cases. The virus uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as key viral entry associated proteins expressed in human cells for infections. Evaluating the expression profile of key genes in large single-cell datasets can facilitate testing for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine targets; as the world struggles to cope with the on-going spread of COVID-19 infections. In this manuscript we describe, REVEAL: SingleCell which enables storage, retrieval and rapid query of single-cell datasets inclusive of millions of cells. The analytical database described here enables selecting and analyzing cells across multiple studies. Cells can be selected using individual metadata tags, more complex hierarchical ontology filtering, and gene expression threshold ranges, including co-expression of multiple genes. The tags on selected cells can be further evaluated for testing biological hypothesis. One such example includes identifying the most prevalent cell type annotation tag on returned cells. We used REVEAL: SingleCell to evaluate expression of key SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes, and queried the current database (2.2 Million cells, 32 projects) to obtain the results in <60 seconds.

The aim of this study is to report a new technical approach to the rehabilitation of a complex oronasal defect by means of a zygoma-implant-supported full-arch dental prosthesis combined with a nasal epithesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS The patient presented with a subtotal bilateral maxillectomy and total rhinectomy defect because of a squamous cell carcinoma of the nose. No reconstructive surgery was performed because of the high risk of recurrence; moreover, the patient refused any secondary procedure. After surgery, the patient presented a wide palatal defect associated to the absence of the nasal pyramid. Zygoma-retained prostheses are well documented, and they offer good anchorage in rehabilitating wide defects after oncological surgery and a good chance for patients to improve their quality of life. We hereby describe two prosthetic devices rehabilitating two iatrogenic defects by means of a single intraoral implant-supported bar extending throughout the oronasal communication, thus offering nasal epithesis anchorage. RESULTS At 1-year follow-up after functional prosthetic loading, no implant failure has been reported. Clinical and radiological follow-up showed no sign of nasal infection or peri-implantitis. The patient reported a sensitive improvement of his quality of life. CONCLUSIONS Simultaneous oral and nasal rehabilitation of complex oronasal defects with zygoma-implant-supported dental prosthesis and nasal epithesis represents a reliable surgical technique. According to this clinical report, the above-mentioned technique seems to be a valuable treatment option as it is safe, reliable and easy to handle for both surgeon and patient.","Trevisiol, Lorenzo; Procacci, Pasquale; D'Agostino, Antonio; Ferrari, Francesca; De Santis, Daniele; Nocini, Pier Francesco",International journal of implant dentistry,327,19

The present study aimed to understand clinical characteristics and prognosis of pediatric SARS patients in Guangzhou area. METHODS Clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiologic findings, therapeutic approaches and prognosis of the 33 children with SARS in Guangzhou area were analyzed. RESULTS Of the 33 cases, 17 were males and 16 were females. The age was between 3 months to 13 years, and 3 - 12 years old patients accounted for 82%. Five (15%) cases had an evident history of contacting SARS patient before the symptoms occurred. Another 5 (15%) cases had a history that contacts of these patients (family members or friends) developed fever and/or cough later. The most common symptoms in this cohort were fever (100%) and cough (91%). Most of the cases had high fever, higher than 39 degrees C. Near half of the cases had nonproductive cough. The initial blood cells count showed that total white blood cell (WBC) count was (2.5 - 9.7) x 10(9)/L. In 22 (67%) cases the WBC count was < 5.0 x 10(9)/L, and in 10 (30%) WBC was (5.0 - 7.0) x 10(9)/L, in 18 cases most of the WBC were lymphocyte count. Chest radiograph showed patchy infiltrates, in 15 cases the changes were unilateral, and in 18 were bilateral. The radiologic changes developed fast, in some cases the changes progressed from one side to both sides. The opacity was absorbed slowly, significant absorption took in average two weeks. Elevated ALT was found in 3 cases and elevated CK-MB in 2 cases. Treatment included isolation, good ventilation of the ward, bed rest, supportive regimens, low volume oxygen inhalation, use of Chinese traditional medicine, antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, and anti-inflammation therapy. All the patients recovered and discharged from hospital after a mean period of 10.0 +/- 3.8 days. CONCLUSION SARS in children may have its own characteristics. The main clinical manifestations were high fever and cough while no severe toxic symptoms, nor respiratory failure was seen; few symptoms or signs suggesting involvement of systems other than respiratory system were seen. Chest radiograph showed uni- or bilateral asymmetric air-space infiltrates which could worsen quickly and were absorbed slowly. Though there were severe changes in the lung, the patients might not have corresponding symptoms or signs. The total white blood cell count in peripheral blood did not increase. All the patients studied had a favorable outcome after the combined treatment.","Zeng, Qi-yi; Liu, Li; Zeng, Hua-song; Yu, Ming-hua; Ye, Qi-ci; Den, Li; Gong, Si-tang; Lai, Jian-pu; Su, Yan-li; Tao, Jian-ping",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,327,9

Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of HBoV in respiratory tract samples of children world-wide. HBoV has recently also been detected in blood and fecal samples. Most studies so far have studied virus prevalence, and only a few reports provide data regarding the linkage of HBoV to disease. These reports indicate that HBoV infection is indeed associated with acute respiratory tract symptoms, but also that HBoV may persist in the respiratory tract for a longer time than other respiratory agents, resulting in frequent detection of low load HBoV carriage. This phenomenon has complicated the use of PCR diagnostics, which has been the only available diagnostic method. Development of alternative diagnostic strategies such as serology will be important for future studies of HBoV and its association with disease.","Allander, Tobias",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,327,26

The goal of this article is to review current literature describing pneumonia in pregnancy. This review will identify maternal risk factors, potential complications, and prenatal outcomes associated with pneumonia and describe the contemporary management of the varied causes of pneumonia in pregnancy. RESULTS Coexisting maternal disease, including asthma and anemia, increase the risk of contracting pneumonia in pregnancy. Neonatal effects of pneumonia in pregnancy include low birth weight and increased risk of preterm birth, and serious maternal complications include respiratory failure. Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common form of pneumonia in pregnancy, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for most identified bacterial organisms. Beta-lactam and macrolide antibiotics are considered safe in pregnancy and are effective for most community-acquired pneumonia in pregnancy. Viral respiratory infections, including varicella, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, can be associated with maternal pneumonia. Current antiviral and respiratory therapies can reduce maternal morbidity and mortality from viral pneumonia. Influenza vaccination can reduce the prevalence of respiratory hospitalizations among pregnant women during influenza season. Pneumocystis pneumonia continues to carry significant maternal risk to an immunocompromised population. Prevention and treatment of Pneumocystis pneumonia with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is effective in reducing this risk. CONCLUSIONS Prompt diagnosis and treatment with contemporary antimicrobial therapy and intensive care unit management of respiratory compromise has reduced the maternal morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia in pregnancy. Prevention with vaccination in at-risk populations may reduce the prevalence and severity of pneumonia in pregnant women.","Goodnight, William H; Soper, David E",Critical care medicine,327,22

Similar to Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), FV assemble into capsids intracellularly. The capsids are then transported to a cellular membrane for acquisition of envelope (Env) glycoproteins and budding. However, unlike MPMV, budding of FV is dependent upon the presence of Env. Previous work suggested that FV Env proteins are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where budding takes place. However, very little was known about the details of FV assembly. We have used immunofluorescence and electron microscopy to visualize the intracellular location of FV assembly and budding. We have found that, as in the case of MPMV, FV capsids assemble at a pericentriolar site in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, FV Env is mostly absent from this site and, contrary to expectations, FV capsid structural protein (Gag) is absent from the ER. Gag and Env only co-localize at the trans-Golgi network, suggesting that Env-Gag interactions that are required for viral egress from the cell, occurs at this site. Finally, inhibitor studies suggest an important role of microtubule networks for foamy viral assembly and budding.","Yu, Shuyuarn F; Eastman, Scott W; Linial, Maxine L",Traffic,327,16

However, knowledge of their etiology is often lacking. Moreover, most cases of infections with reportable enteric pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Cryptosporidia and Giardia) have sporadic modes of acquisition, yet control measures are often biased towards mitigation of risks discerned by outbreak analysis. To determine the etiology of unexplained diarrhea it is important to study populations that can be matched to appropriate controls and to couple thorough classic microbiologic evaluation on receipt of specimens with archiving and outgrowth capabilities. Research evaluations should address the potential roles of a broad panel of candidate bacterial pathogens including diarrheagenic E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Helicobacters and jejuni Campylobacters, and also apply novel massively parallel sequencing and nucleic acid detection technologies that allow the detection of viral pathogens. To fill voids in our knowledge regarding sources of known enteric pathogens it will be critical to extend case-control studies to assess risk factors and exposures to patients with non-epidemic illnesses and to appropriate controls.

Electrosurgical injuries due to insulation defects or capacitive coupling remain an issue in laparoscopic surgery with a prevalence of 0.6-5 per thousand cases. Shielded instruments with active electrode monitoring (AEM) have been postulated to prevent these injuries. The benefit of these instruments has not been quantified. Most bowel injuries are unrecognized intra-operatively. Injury is revealed only after the patient exhibits peritonitis symptoms and surgical intervention to repair the bowel is required. These injuries may result in devastating and costly complications or mortality. The extent of bowel injury possible with commonly used generator settings and associated energy output has never been histologically defined. Our objectives in this experimental study were: quantify and compare the energy released through insulation defects or capacitive coupling with standard unshielded monopolar versus shielded instruments with (AEM), determine energy required to cause a visible burn, and relate the histological burn depth to a given amount of energy. METHODS Ex vivo porcine jejunum was used for tissue testing. An oscilloscope measured energy output from three common electrosurgical generators at recommended power settings with standard or AEM instruments with insulation defects and in capacitive coupling scenarios. Presence of a visible burn was noted, and depth of tissue damage for a given amount of energy was measured histologically. RESULTS All samples that received ≥3.8 J of energy had visible burns. As little as 10 J caused full wall thickness burns. 3.8 J was exceeded at the 30- and 50-W power settings in every experimental scenario using standard monopolar instruments; AEM instruments never approached this much energy. CONCLUSIONS Serious burn injury results from small amounts of energy leaked from standard instruments. AEM instruments appeared protective and did not leak sufficient energy to cause burn injuries to the bowel.","Martin, Kimberly E; Moore, Camille M; Tucker, Robert; Fuchshuber, Pascal; Robinson, Thomas",Surgical endoscopy,327,16

Historically, the biomedical disease paradigm established its dominance in tackling emerging infectious illnesses mainly due to innovation in medication and advances in technology. Traditional and religious remedies have emerged as plausible options for prevention and treatment of COVID-19, especially in Africa and Asia. The appeal of religious and traditional therapies against COVID-19 in the African setting must be understood within the historical, social, and political context. This study explored how women and community members dealt with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 in Mwanza, Tanzania. METHODS: This study was conducted in Nyamagana and Ilemela districts of Mwanza, Tanzania, between July and August 2020. We conducted 18 mobile phone in-depth interviews with a purposively selected sample of women aged 27-57 years participating in an existing longitudinal study. For safety reasons, smart mobile phones were used to collect the data. Each interview was audio recorded after obtaining verbal consent from the participants. The audio files were transferred to computers for analysis. Four researchers conducted a multistage, inductive analysis of the data. RESULTS: Participants reported wide use and perceived high efficacy of traditional remedies and prayer to prevent and treat suspected symptoms of COVID-19. Use was either alone or combined with public health recommendations such as hand washing and crowd avoidance. Despite acknowledging that a pathogen causes COVID-19, participants attested to the relevance and power of traditional herbal medication and prayer to curb COVID-19. Four main factors underline the symbolic efficacy of the traditional and religious treatment paradigms: personal, communal, and official reinforcement of their efficacy; connection to local knowledge and belief systems; the failure of biomedicine to offer a quick and effective solution; and availability. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of emerging contagious illnesses, communities turn to resilient and trusted treatment paradigms to quell fear and embrace hope. To tackle emerging infections effectively, it is essential to engage the broader sociopolitical landscape, including communal considerations of therapeutic efficacy.","Mshana, Gerry; Mchome, Zaina; Aloyce, Diana; Peter, Esther; Kapiga, Saidi; Stöckl, Heidi",J Ethnobiol Ethnomed,327,16

The role of research ethics in pandemic times,20.570728,4.10371,2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are especially vulnerable to infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among HCWs from February 24th to April 30th, 2020, in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Cumulative COVID-19 incidence was calculated for all HCWs and categorized according to presumed level of COVID-19 exposure (high, medium, and low). FINDINGS: Among 1911 HCWs, 213 (11.1%) had COVID-19 during the study period. Cases increased gradually from March 8th, peaking on March 17th and declining thereafter. The peak of cases among HCWs was reached 14 days before the peak in admitted COVID-19 cases in the hospital. There were no significant differences in the proportion of COVID-19 cases according to level of occupational exposure (P = 0.123). There were five departments and two professions in which >20% of the workers had confirmed COVID-19. Temporal clusters were identified in three of these departments and one profession, with most of the cases occurring over a period of less than five days. The prevalence of comorbidities was low and 91.5% of patients had mild or moderate symptoms. Eleven patients were admitted to the hospital and one patient needed intensive care. None of the patients died. The median time of sick leave was 20 (interquartile range: 15-26) days. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HCW-HCW transmission accounted for part of the cases. In spite of a low prevalence of comorbidities and a mild clinical course in most cases, COVID-19 caused long periods of sick leave.","Suárez-García, I; Martínez de Aramayona López, M J; Sáez Vicente, A; Lobo Abascal, P",J Hosp Infect,327,24

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model. Further work to facilitate person-centered abortion information and care can build on initial modifications in response to the pandemic.","Karlin, Jennifer; Sarnaik, Shashi; Holt, Kelsey; Dehlendorf, Christine; Joffe, Carole; Steinauer, Jody",Contraception,327,29

METHODS: Biweekly institutional payroll data was evaluated for unscheduled absences as a marker for acute illness-related work absences. Linear regression models, stratified by payroll status (salaried vs hourly employees) were developed for unscheduled absences as a function of local ILI. RESULTS: Both hours worked and unscheduled absences were significantly related to the community prevalence of influenza-like illness in our cohort. These effects were stronger in hourly employees.

To date, the impact of G-quadruplex (G4) regulation in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD) has not been analysed. In this study, in silico potential G4s located in deregulated genes related to the nervous system were initially identified and were found to be significantly enriched. Several G4 sequences found in the 5' untranslated regions (5'UTR) of mRNAs associated with Parkinson's disease were demonstrated to in fact fold in vitro by biochemical assays. Subcloning of the full-length 5'UTRs of these candidates upstream of a luciferase reporter system led to the demonstration that the G4s of both Parkin RBR E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase (PRKN) and Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein 35 (VPS35) significantly repressed the translation of both genes in SH-SY5Y cells. Subsequently, a strategy of using label-free RNA affinity purification assays with either of these two G4 sequences as bait isolated the Guanine Nucleotide-Binding Protein-Like 1 (GNL1). The latter was shown to have a higher affinity for the G4 sequences than for their mutated version.

In order to cope with green analytical chemistry principles and the trending development of miniaturized portable and handheld devices, an innovative microfabricated ion-selective electrode for the analysis of metoclopramide (MTP) was developed. The fabricated electrode adopted a two-step optimization process. The first step of optimization depended on screening different ionophores in order to enhance the sensor selectivity. Calix-4-arene showed the maximal selectivity towards MTP. The second step was utilizing a graphene nanocomposite as an ion-to-electron transducer layer between the calix-4-arene polymeric membrane and the microfabricated copper solid-contact ion-selective electrode. The graphene nanocomposite layer added more stability to electrode potential drift and short response times (10 s), probably due to the hydrophobic behavior of the graphene nanocomposite, which precludes the formation of a water layer at the Cu electrode/polymeric membrane interface. The proposed MTP sensor has been characterized according to IUPAC recommendations and the linear dynamic range estimated to be 1 × 10-6 to 1 × 10-2 M with LOD of 3 × 10-7 M. The proposed sensor has been successfully employed in the selective determination of MTP in bulk powder, pharmaceutical formulation, and biological fluid.

It is almost always associated with cirrhosis and it is usually diagnosed in later stages of the disease. Furthermore, recurrence rate following liver transplantation ranges between 15 and 30%. The most important factor determining the recurrence is vascular invasion. METHODS: In this review, the issue of microvascular invasion causing hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence is reviewed. Macroscopic vascular invasion is almost easy to diagnose on radiologic evaluation. However, microscopic vascular invasion is almost always diagnosed with pathologic evaluation. On the other hand, microscopic vascular invasion is associated with early recurrences and reduced disease-free survival. The type of vessel that is invaded determines the nature of the spread of the tumor cells. Invasion of the hepatic venous tributaries leads to systemic metastasis whereas portal venous invasions lead to intrahepatic spread of the tumor. Microscopic vascular invasion should be diagnosed before liver transplantation or liver resection in order to deliver the appropriate therapy to the patients. RESULTS: Yet, there is no ideal marker to suggest microscopic vascular invasion before any intervention. Markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, des carboxy prothrombin, or gamma-glutamyl transferase have been found to be correlated with microscopic vascular invasion. These parameters are not very efficient to be used in routine clinical practice. CONCLUSION: Therefore, further research is needed to define ideal marker associated with microscopic vascular invasion.","Isik, Burak; Gonultas, Fatih; Sahin, Tolga; Yilmaz, Sezai",,327,24

Also, it is commonly used to attempt suicide. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a therapeutic method that supports the function of the heart and lungs, giving body enough time for detoxification and organ function improvement;therefore, management of the problem using ECMO is critical in these patients and increases the survival chance. Moreover, the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment course during the COVID-19 pandemic and the patients' involvement and contact with the virus is a critical issue with unknown consequences. Case presentation: The patient was an 18-year-old girl who was hospitalized due to the poisoning aluminum phosphate. The ECMO was connected to the patient during CPR. Then, the patient was transported to a specialized healthcare facility. At the time of arrival, the EF (Ejection Fraction) was less than 5%. During the course of poisoning, the patient developed ARDS, fulminant hepatitis, massive gastrointestinal and vaginal bleeding, and septicemia. The ECMO was weaned on day 5 when the EF was reported 55%. In the following, the general and pulmonary conditions of the patient exacerbated when she was suspected of having COVID-19. The necessary therapeutic measures were done and finally, the patient was discharged after 45 days. Conclusion: ECMO is a useful therapeutic procedure in ALP poisoned patients. In case of careful management, it can be used in multiple organ involvement and prolonged PCR. Considering the COVID-19 pandemic, it is very important to notice the chance of COVID-19 infection in ICU during treatment.","Daliri, M.; Amin, A.; Totonchi, Z.; Schmitto, J.; Naderi, N.; Yadollahi, M.; Hosseini, S.",Asia Pacific Journal of Medical Toxicology,327,22

We used random effects modeling to estimate the overall prevalence rates of psychological/psychosomatic symptoms and the I2 statistic. We included 86 studies, reporting data from 75,991 participants. Frontline staff showed a wide range of symptoms, including concern about transmitting the virus to the family (60.39%, 95% CI 42.53-76.96), perceived stress (56.77%, 95% CI 34.21-77.95), concerns about own health (45.97%, 95% CI 31.08-61.23), sleeping difficulties (39.88%, 95% CI 27.70-52.72), burnout (31.81%, 95% CI 13.32-53.89), symptoms of depression (25.72%, 95% CI 18.34-33.86), symptoms of anxiety (25.36%, 95% CI 17.90-33.64), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (24.51%, 95% CI 18.16-31.46), mental health issues (23.11%, 95% CI 15.98-31.10), and symptoms of somatization (14.68%, 95% CI 10.67-19.18). We found consistent evidence for the pervasive and profound impact of large-scale outbreaks on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers. As the CO-VID-19 crisis continues to unfold, guaranteeing easy access to support structures for the entire healthcare workforce is vitally important.","Busch, Isolde M; Moretti, Francesca; Mazzi, Mariangela; Wu, Albert W; Rimondini, Michela",Psychother Psychosom,327,16

People's knowledge, attitudes, and preventive behaviors about diseases affect the degree of adherence to control measures. This study aimed to survey the affecting factors of COVID-19 prevention behavior among nursing students in China. MATERIAL AND METHODS Six-hundred thirteen nursing students in Anhui, China participated in an online survey from March 30 to April 5, 2020. The survey collected demographic information, electronic health (eHealth) literacy, COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and prevention behavior data using descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression to analyze the data. RESULTS The mean age of study participants was 20.88 years, of which 31.8% were male (n=613). Television (84.9%) and WeChat (79.6%) were the major sources of their information. Nursing students had good knowledge (14.68±2.83), had positive attitudes (4.03±0.59), had good practices (3.92±0.65), and had basic eHealth literacy (30.45±6.90). Nursing students with higher eHealth literacy (odds ratio [OR]=0.89, P<0.01), good knowledge (OR=0.89, P<0.01), and positive attitudes (OR=0.24, P<0.01) took more preventive behaviors. Students living in the countryside (OR=0.09, P<0.01) and of a young age (OR=1.51, P<0.05) seldom took preventive actions. Men, compared with women, were less likely to take preventive measures. (OR=1.44, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Good eHealth literacy, good knowledge, and a positive attitude were the most important variables that affected the prevention behavior against COVID-19. Targeted health education should be conducted for male students and students living in the countryside by providing reliable and effective online sources.","Yuan, Ting; Liu, Huan; Li, Xiang Dong; Liu, Hai Rong",Med Sci Monit,327,1

Improvement in city air quality has emerged as a benefit of this lockdown in India. The objective of this paper is to quantify the health benefits due to this lockdown. PM2.5 concentrations in nonattainment cities (NACs) in Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) in North India were studied. Data from prelockdown and the various lockdown phases were compared, with 2019 as a benchmark. Compared with those in 2019, the PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown Phase 1 were approximately 44.6% lower for cities in Uttar Pradesh and approximately 58.5% lower for the Delhi-NCR. The health impacts of particle inhalation were quantified using the multiple-path particle dosimetry and AirQ+ models, which revealed that the most considerable improvement was during lockdown Phase 1. Among the prelockdown and lockdown phases, Phase 1 exhibited the minimum PM2.5 concentration and thus the greatest health benefits. For the selected cities, the concentration of particle deposition in the tracheobronchial region of human lungs showed its maximum reduction during lockdown Phase 1(30.14%). Furthermore, the results highlighted a decrease of 29.85 deaths per 100,000 persons during lockdown Phase 1, primarily due to the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations. This quantification of the health benefits due to a decrease in PM2.5 may help policymakers implement suitable control measures, especially for NACs, where the respirable particulate matter concentrations remain very high. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

The impact of COVID-19 on TB control in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is little known. Methods: Based on the national TB Information Management System (TBIMS), this study accessed the actual impact of COVID-19 on TB by comparing TB notifications, pre-treatment delays, and clinical characteristics of TB cases between 2020 COVID-19 period and 2017-2019 baseline. The data were divided into three periods based on the response started to fight against COVID-19 in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, including the control period (10 weeks before the pandemic), intensive period (10 weeks during the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region lockdown), and regular (10 additional weeks after Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region reopen). Results: TB notification dropped sharply in the first week of the intensive period but took significantly longer to return to the previous level in 2020 compared with the 2017-2019 baseline. Totally, the TB notification rates decreased by more than 60% in the intensive period of COVID-19 compared with the average level of 2017-2019. The sputum smear-positive rate of TB patients diagnosed in intensive period of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in the corresponding periods of 2017-2019 (P < 0.001). The rate of cavity on X-ray inspection of TB cases diagnosed in the intensive period of COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in period 2 of 2017-2019 (23.5 vs. 15.4%, P = 0.004). The patients' delay in the intensive period was significantly longer than that before the pandemic (P = 0.047). Conclusions: The TB notification in Ningxia was impacted dramatically by the pandemic of COVID-19. To compensate for the large numbers of missed diagnosis as well as delayed diagnosis during the intensive period of COVID-19, an urgent restoration of normal TB services, and further emphasis on enhanced active case finding and scale-up of household contact tracing and screening for TB-related symptoms or manifestation, will be essential.","Wang, Xiaolin; He, Wencong; Lei, Juan; Liu, Guangtian; Huang, Fei; Zhao, Yanlin",Front Public Health,327,15

Areas of controversy remain, and we discuss these in further detail, relating to the mode of anaesthesia, surgical delay, blood management and transfusion thresholds, echocardiography, anticoagulant and antiplatelet management and postoperative discharge destination. Finally, these guidelines provide links to supplemental online material that can be used at readers' institutions, key references and UK national guidance about the peri-operative care of people with hip and periprosthetic fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Griffiths, R; Babu, S; Dixon, P; Freeman, N; Hurford, D; Kelleher, E; Moppett, I; Ray, D; Sahota, O; Shields, M; White, S",Anaesthesia (Lond.),327,1

In this article, we explore the psychosocial impact of pandemics, as presented through literature and poetry, and attempt to draw similarities with the current COVID-19 pandemic. We explore topics such as fear and anxiety, hopelessness, and suicide ideation. Overall, the psychological devastation caused by epidemics has influenced many major writers and will undoubtedly impact the writers of our generation. These writings are perhaps the richest source of knowledge of humanity's remarkable capacity to endure suffering.","Panayi, Adriana C; Haug, Valentin",J Nerv Ment Dis,327,5

This study performed a multidimensional association analysis to explore the correlation between the GHS Index and COVID-19-associated morbidity, mortality, and disease increase rate (DIR) in 178 countries (regions). METHODS: The GHS Index and COVID-19 pandemic data - including total cases per million (TCPM), total deaths per million (TDPM), and daily growth rate - were extracted from online databases. The Spearman correlation coefficient was applied to describe the strength of the association between the GHS Index, sociological characteristics, and the epidemic situation of COVID-19. DIRs were compared, and the impact of the GHS Index on the DIR by the time of ""lockdown"" was visualized. RESULTS: The overall GHS Index was positively correlated with TCPM and TDPM, with coefficients of 0.34 and 0.41, respectively. Countries categorized into different GHS Indextiers had different DIRs before implementing lockdown measures. However, no significant difference was observed between countries in the middle and upper tiers after implementing lockdown measures. The correlation between GHS Index and DIR was positive five days before lockdown measures were taken, but it became negative 13 days later. CONCLUSIONS: The GHS Index has limited value in assessing a country's capacity to respond to a global pandemic. Nevertheless, it has potential value in determining the country's ability to cope with a local epidemic situation.","Ji, Ye; Shao, Jun; Tao, Bilin; Song, Huan; Li, Zhongqi; Wang, Jianming",Int J Infect Dis,327,29

Case morbidity and mortality rates for any type of infection have always been much higher in CKD, haemodialysis (HD) and RT patients than in the general population. A large study comparing COVID-19 outcome in moderate to advanced CKD (Stages 3-5), HD and RT patients with a control group of patients is still lacking. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, retrospective, observational study, involving hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 47 centres in Turkey. Patients with CKD Stages 3-5, chronic HD and RT were compared with patients who had COVID-19 but no kidney disease. Demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory tests, COVID-19 treatments and outcome [in-hospital mortality and combined in-hospital outcome mortality or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU)] were compared. RESULTS: A total of 1210 patients were included [median age, 61 (quartile 1-quartile 3 48-71) years, female 551 (45.5%)] composed of four groups: control (n = 450), HD (n = 390), RT (n = 81) and CKD (n = 289). The ICU admission rate was 266/1210 (22.0%). A total of 172/1210 (14.2%) patients died. The ICU admission and in-hospital mortality rates in the CKD group [114/289 (39.4%); 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.9-45.2; and 82/289 (28.4%); 95% CI 23.9-34.5)] were significantly higher than the other groups: HD = 99/390 (25.4%; 95% CI 21.3-29.9; P < 0.001) and 63/390 (16.2%; 95% CI 13.0-20.4; P < 0.001); RT = 17/81 (21.0%; 95% CI 13.2-30.8; P = 0.002) and 9/81 (11.1%; 95% CI 5.7-19.5; P = 0.001); and control = 36/450 (8.0%; 95% CI 5.8-10.8; P < 0.001) and 18/450 (4%; 95% CI 2.5-6.2; P < 0.001). Adjusted mortality and adjusted combined outcomes in CKD group and HD groups were significantly higher than the control group [hazard ratio (HR) (95% CI) CKD: 2.88 (1.52-5.44); P = 0.001; 2.44 (1.35-4.40); P = 0.003; HD: 2.32 (1.21-4.46); P = 0.011; 2.25 (1.23-4.12); P = 0.008), respectively], but these were not significantly different in the RT from in the control group [HR (95% CI) 1.89 (0.76-4.72); P = 0.169; 1.87 (0.81-4.28); P = 0.138, respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CKDs, including Stages 3-5 CKD, HD and RT, have significantly higher mortality than patients without kidney disease. Stages 3-5 CKD patients have an in-hospital mortality rate as much as HD patients, which may be in part because of similar age and comorbidity burden. We were unable to assess if RT patients were or were not at increased risk for in-hospital mortality because of the relatively small sample size of the RT patients in this study.","Ozturk, Savas; Turgutalp, Kenan; Arici, Mustafa; Odabas, Ali Riza; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza; Aydin, Zeki; Cebeci, Egemen; Basturk, Taner; Soypacaci, Zeki; Sahin, Garip; Elif Ozler, Tuba; Kara, Ekrem; Dheir, Hamad; Eren, Necmi; Suleymanlar, Gultekin; Islam, Mahmud; Ogutmen, Melike Betul; Sengul, Erkan; Ayar, Yavuz; Dolarslan, Murside Esra; Bakirdogen, Serkan; Safak, Seda; Gungor, Ozkan; Sahin, Idris; Mentese, Ilay Berke; Merhametsiz, Ozgur; Oguz, Ebru Gok; Genek, Dilek Gibyeli; Alpay, Nadir; Aktas, Nimet; Duranay, Murat; Alagoz, Selma; Colak, Hulya; Adibelli, Zelal; Pembegul, Irem; Hur, Ender; Azak, Alper; Taymez, Dilek Guven; Tatar, Erhan; Kazancioglu, Rumeyza; Oruc, Aysegul; Yuksel, Enver; Onan, Engin; Turkmen, Kultigin; Hasbal, Nuri Baris; Gurel, Ali; Yelken, Berna; Sahutoglu, Tuncay; Gok, Mahmut; Seyahi, Nurhan",Nephrol Dial Transplant,327,1

However, previous studies have indicated possible cross-reactivity of these assays, including in malaria-endemic areas.Methods: We tested 213 well-characterized pre-pandemic samples from Nigeria using two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays: Abbott Architect IgG and Euroimmun NCP IgG assay, both targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. To assess antibody binding strength, an avidity assay was performed on these samples and on plasma from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive persons.Results: Thirteen (6.1%) of 212 samples run on the Abbott assay and 38 (17.8%) of 213 run on the Euroimmun assay were positive. Anti-Plasmodium IgG levels were significantly higher among false-positives for both Abbott and Euroimmun; no association was found with active P. falciparum infection. An avidity assay using various concentratIons of urea wash in the Euroimmun assay reduced loosely-bound IgG: of 37 positive/borderline pre-pandemic samples, 46%, 86%, 89%, and 97% became negative using 2M, 4M, 5M, and 8M urea washes, respectively. The wash slightly reduced avidity of antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 patients within 28 days of PCR confirmation; thereafter avidity increased for all urea concentrations except 8M.Conclusions: This validation found moderate to substantial cross-reactivity on two SARS-CoV-2 serological assays using samples from a malaria-endemic setting. A simple urea wash appeared to alleviate issues of cross-reactivity.","Steinhardt, Laura C; Ige, Fehintola; Iriemenam, Nnaemeka C; Greby, Stacie M; Hamada, Yohhei; Uwandu, Mabel; Aniedobe, Maureen; Stafford, Kristen A; Abimiku, Alash039; le,; Mba, Nwando; Agala, Ndidi; Okunoye, Olumide; Mpamugo, Augustine; Swaminathan, Mahesh; Onokevbagbe, Edewede; Olaleye, Temitope; Odoh, Ifeanyichukwu; Marston, Barbara J; Okoye, McPaul; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Rangaka, Molebogeng X; Rogier, Eric; Audu, Rosemary",J. clin. microbiol,327,20

The aim of this work is to evaluate the risk of fertilizing crops with manure from livestock treated with anthelmintics. The present study was designed to follow the fate of the commonly used anthelmintic drug, ivermectin (IVM) and its metabolites in soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), a plant that is grown and consumed world-wide for its high content of nutritional and health-beneficial substances. In vitro plantlets and soybean plants, cultivated in a greenhouse, were used for this purpose. Our results showed the uptake of IVM and its translocation to the leaves, but not in the pods and the beans. Four IVM metabolites were detected in the roots, and one in the leaves. IVM exposure decreased slightly the number and weight of the beans and induced changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, the presence of IVM affected the proportion of individual isoflavones and reduced the content of isoflavones aglycones, which might decrease the therapeutic value of soybeans. Fertilization of soybean fields with manure from IVM-treated animals appears to be safe for humans, due to the absence of IVM in beans, the food part of plants. On the other hand, it could negatively affect soybean plants and herbivorous invertebrates.","Navrátilová, Martina; Raisová Stuchlíková, Lucie; Motková, Katerina; Szotáková, Barbora; Skálová, Lenka; Langhansová, Lenka; Podlipná, Radka",Molecules (Basel),327,1

The aim of this report is to describe the clinical profiles of these Covid-19 infected patients admitted in Sawai Mansingh Hospital(S.M.S), Jaipur ranging from their age, sex, travel history, clinical symptoms, laboratory evaluation, radiological characteristics, treatment provided along with common side effects and the final outcome. The described cases are one of the earliest cases of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent. Methods: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA. Results and Discussion: During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment. Conclusion: Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Bhargava, Abhishek; Sharma, Shrikant; Keshwani, Prakash; Sharma, Raman; Banerjee, Subrata",J Assoc Physicians India,327,16

This study aimed to identify correlated factors for depression/anxiety among children and adolescents after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: An online survey by cluster sampling was conducted after lockdown in 5175 Chinese children and adolescents with informed consents from their parents. The 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales with 10-point cutoff were used to measure depression and anxiety, separately. Stepwise logistic regression was conducted. Stata 15.1 Version was used. RESULTS: 12.33% and 6.26% of all participants reported depression and anxiety after lockdown, separately. Suicidal ideation, quarreling with parents, insomnia, difficulty in concentrating during online learning, and anxious and depressed mood during lockdown were positively associated with depression and anxiety after lockdown. Missing teachers was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Living in urban and not living with parents were positively associated with depression. LIMITATIONS: The past history and familial history of mental disorders have not been collected. The recall biases for collecting self-reporting information might exist, and the causal inferences cannot be drawn. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents might decline a bit after lockdown but is still at a high level after lockdown. Gatekeepers should pay more attention to modifiable factors of psychological well-being in children and adolescents, including family and school contexts and even feelings and behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.","Liu, Yan; Yue, Song; Hu, Xiaoran; Zhu, Jin; Wu, Zifan; Wang, JianLi; Wu, Yili",J Affect Disord,327,30

This paper aimed to compare the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 responses of adult patients with mental disorders to their family caregivers. METHODS: In this study, 205 pairs of patients with mental disorders and primary family caregivers were consecutively recruited from one inpatient mental health department in a large hospital in China. All participants completed the 12-item version WHODAS 2.0 to assess patients' functioning in the 30 days prior to the hospitalization. Measurement invariance, including configural, metric and scalar invariance, was tested across patient and proxy groups, using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis. Agreement between patients and proxies was examined by paired Wilcoxon tests and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Subgroup analyses for proxy reliability were conducted within strata of proxy kinship and patient psychiatric diagnosis. RESULTS: The 12-item WHODAS 2.0 achieved configural, metric and partial scalar invariance across patient and proxy groups. Unsatisfactory consistency was found for most items (ICC < 0.75, P < 0.05), especially for items on Cognition, Getting along, Life activities, and Participation in society (ICC < 0.4, P < 0.05). Spouses agreed with patients more often than parents (ICC &#8805; 0.4, P < 0.05). The paired Wilcoxon tests found that impairment of patients with psychotic disorders tended to be overestimated by proxies while proxies tended to underestimate impairment of patients with mood disorders. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals inconsistency between self and proxy reports in the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 among adult patients with mental disorders. When proxy reports is needed, spouses are preferred than parents. We should be aware of proxies' impairment overestimation among patients with psychotic disorders and underestimation among patients with mood disorders.","Zhou, Wei; Liu, Qian; Yu, Yu; Xiao, Shuiyuan; Chen, Lizhang; Khoshnood, Kaveh; Zheng, Shimin",Qual. life res,327,23

Predicting the severity and clinical outcome of individual patients is a major unmet clinical need that remains challenging due to intra- and inter-patient variability. Here, we longitudinally profiled and integrated more than 150 clinical, laboratory and immunological parameters of 173 patients with mild to fatal COVID-19. Using systems biology, we detected progressive dysregulation of multiple parameters indicative of organ damage that correlated with disease severity, particularly affecting kidneys, hepatobiliary system, and immune landscape. By performing unsupervised clustering and trajectory analysis, we identified T and B cell depletion as early indicators of a complicated disease course. In addition, markers of hepatobiliary damage emerged as robust predictor of lethal outcome in critically ill patients. This allowed us to propose a novel clinical COVID-19 SeveriTy (COST) score that distinguishes complicated disease trajectories and predicts lethal outcome in critically ill patients.","Woo, Marcel S; Haag, Friedrich; Nierhaus, Axel; Jarczak, Dominik; Roedl, Kevin; Mayer, Christina; Brehm, Thomas T; van der Meirschen, Marc; Hennigs, Annette; Christopeit, Maximilian; Fiedler, Walter; Karagiannis, Panagiotis; Burdelski, Christoph; Schultze, Alexander; Huber, Samuel; Addo, Marylyn M; Schmiedel, Stefan; Friese, Manuel A; Kluge, Stefan; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian",iScience,327,21

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how and to what extent the severe restrictions affected the mental health and health-related quality of life of non-infected people, in a comparison between Israel and Italy. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first week of May 2020 among 510 Israeli and 505 Italian participants. Anxiety and depression levels were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and the short form-8 health survey (SF-8) questionnaire measured health-related quality of life. Linear hierarchic regression forced steps analysis was performed to measure the unique contribution of each variable to predicting health-related quality of life. RESULTS: After adjusting for socioeconomic variables, the results showed a significantly higher anxiety level and lower health-related quality of life in the Italian participants. The anxiety and depression variables predicted lower health-related quality of life. Physical activity was found to be a protective factor. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that early monitoring of anxiety and depression in situations such as quarantine may detect the risk for decline in health-related quality of life.

We aim to describe in detail technical and legal considerations regarding international teleproctoring, a tool that could waive the need for in-person supervision during procedures. METHODS: International teleproctoring was chosen to provide remote supervision during the first three intracranial aneurysm treatments with a new flow diverter (currently subject of a clinical trial) in the US. Real-time, high-resolution transmission software streamed audiovisual data to a proctor located in Canada. The software allowed the transmission of images in a de-identified, HIPAA-compliant manner. RESULTS: All three flow diverters were implanted as desired by operator and proctor and without complication. The proctor could swap between images from multiple sources and reported complete spatial and situational awareness, without any significant lag or delay in communication. Procedural times and radiologic dose were similar to those of uncomplicated, routine flow diversion cases at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: International teleproctoring was successfully implemented in our clinical practice. Its first use provided important insights for establishing this tool in our field. With no clear horizon for lifting the current travel restrictions, teleproctoring has the potential to remove the need for proctor presence in the angiography suite, thereby allowing the field to advance through the continuation of trials and the introduction of new devices in clinical practice. In order for this tool to be used safely and effectively, highly reliable connection and high-resolution equipment is necessary, and multiple legal nuances have to be considered.","Orru039,; Emanuele,; Marosfoi, Miklos; Patel, Neil V; Coon, Alexander L; Wald, Christoph; Repucci, Nicholas; Nicholson, Patrick; Pereira, Vitor M; Wakhloo, Ajay K",J. neurointerv. surg.

How aberrant fibrinolysis influences the clinical progression of COVID-19 presents a clinicopathological dilemma challenging intensivists. Methods: We performed meta-analysis and meta regression to analyze the associations of plasma D-dimer with 106 clinical variables to identify a panoramic view of the derangements of fibrinolysis in 14,862 patients of 42 studies. There were no limitations of age, gender, race, and country. Raw data of each group were extracted separately by two investigators. Individual data of case series, median and interquartile range, and ranges of median or mean were converted to SDM (standard deviation of mean). Findings: The weighted mean difference of D-dimer was 0.97 µg/mL (95% CI 0.65, 1.29) between mild and severe groups, as shown by meta-analysis. Publication bias was significant. Meta-regression identified 58 of 106 clinical variables were associated with plasma D-dimer levels. Of these, 11 readouts were negatively related to the level of plasma D-dimer. Further, age and gender were confounding factors. There were 22 variables independently correlated with the D-dimer level, including respiratory rate, dyspnea plasma K+, glucose, SpO2, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), bilirubin, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), systolic blood pressure, and CK (creatine kinase). Interpretation: These findings support elevated D-dimer as an independent predictor for both mortality and complications. The identified D-dimer-associated clinical variables draw a landscape integrating the aggregate effects of systemically suppressive and pulmonary hyperactive derangements of fibrinolysis, and the D-dimer-associated clinical biomarkers, and conceptually parameters could be combined for risk stratification, potentially for tracking thrombolytic therapy or alternative interventions.","Zhao, Runzhen; Su, Zhenlei; Komissarov, Andrey A; Liu, Shan-Lu; Yi, Guohua; Idell, Steven; Matthay, Michael A; Ji, Hong-Long",Front Immunol,327,23

However, the claims between the previous papers are not always consistent and may even contradict each other, for example, some claims the virus infects more men than women in Wuhan. In this large-scale cohort study, we aimed to update the demographic, signs and symptoms, imaging characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the whole quarantine of Wuhan, China. METHODS: A cohort of 2126 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) who were admitted to one hospital in Wuhan were retrospectively enrolled. Data were collected between January 13, 2020, and April 8, 2020, the end of Wuhan quarantine. Demographic, signs and symptoms, imaging characteristics were analyzed. CT imaging characteristics associated with respiratory failure or death were identified. RESULTS: Of the 2126 patients with COVID-19, 1051 (49.44%) were men and 1075 (50.56%) were women, 1933 (90.92%) have fever and 1328 (62.46%) have dry cough. The mean age was 57.43â¯years of age (range 1-95). The CT imaging findings were bilateral pneumonia (1883[88.57%]), unilateral pneumonia (243[11.43%]), ground-glass opacity (GGO) or consolidation (1175[55.27%]), pleural effusion (69[3.25%]). Patients with respiratory failure or death were more likely to have pleural effusion on CT than patients without respiratory failure or death (pâ¯<â¯0.05). CONCLUSION: Men and women have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 in roughly equal numbers. Fever and cough are the most prevalent symptoms at disease onset in patients. Other prevalent symptoms include fatigue, and sputum production. COVID-19 patients with bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion are more likely to develop respiratory failure or death.","Yin, Xi; Li, Qiubai; Hou, Shengchao; Zhong, Qiang; Fan, Zhongjie; Huang, Qiuhan; Kurkar, Vishal; Kang, Zhen; Huang, Zhaojun; Wang, Liang",Clin Imaging,327,16

Thus, in this study, we evaluated the performance of a disinfection chamber designed for instantaneous dispersion of the biocidal agent solution, in order to characterize a new device that can be used to protect individuals by reducing the transmissibility of the disease through contaminated surfaces. We proposed the necessary adjustments in the configuration to improve the dispersion on surfaces and the effectiveness of the developed equipment. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the present technology with a chamber having six nebulizer nozzles were performed and validated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and experimental tests were conducted using the method Water-Sensitive Paper (WSP), with an exposure to the biocidal agent for 10 and 30 s. After evaluation, a new passage procedure for the chamber with six nozzles and a new configuration of the disinfection chamber were proposed. In the chamber with six nozzles, a deficiency was identified in its central region, where the suspended droplet concentration was close to zero. However, with the new passage procedure, there was a significant increase in wettability of the surface. With the proposition of the chamber with 12 nozzles, the suspended droplet concentration in different regions increased, with an average increase of 266%. The experimental results of the new configuration proved that there was an increase in wettability at all times of exposure, and it was more significant for an exposure of 30 s. Additionally, even in different passage procedures, there were no significant differences in the results for an exposure of 10 s, thereby showing the effectiveness of the new configuration or improved spraying and wettability by the biocidal agent, as well as in minimizing the impact caused by human factor in the performance of the disinfection technology.","Freitas Neves, Paulo Roberto; Oliveira, Turan Dias; Magalhães, Tarcísio Faustino; Dos Reis, Paulo Roberto Santana; Tofaneli, Luzia Aparecida; Bandeira Santos, Alex Álisson; Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza; Oliveira, Fabricia Oliveira; da Silva Andrade, Leone Peter Correia; Badaró, Roberto; Brêda Mascarenhas, Luis Alberto",PLoS One,327,33

Here, we conducted a detailed clinical evaluation of four Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays in samples from acutely ill COVID-19 patients and in two negative cohorts. METHODS: 443 serum specimens from serial sampling of 29 COVID-19 patients were used to determine clinical sensitivities. Patients were stratified for the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Individual serum specimens from a pre-COVID-19 cohort of 238 healthy subjects and from a PCR-negative clinical cohort of 257 patients were used to determine clinical specificities. All samples were measured side-by-side with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgG), Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) and Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) (Euroimmun AG, Lübeck, Germany) and the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ECLIA (Roche Diagnostics International, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). RESULTS: Median seroconversion occurred earlier in ARDS patients (8-9 days) than in non-ARDS patients (11-17 days), except for EUR N-IgG. Rates of positivity and mean signal ratios in the ARDS group were significantly higher than in the non-ARDS group. Sensitivities between the four tested immunoassays were equivalent. In the set of negative samples, the specificity of the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA (IgA) was lower (93.9%) compared to all other assays (&#8805;98.8%) and the specificity of Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NCP-ELISA (IgG) was lower (98.8%) than that of Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (100%). CONCLUSIONS: Serial sampling in COVID-19 patients revealed earlier seroconversion and higher signal ratios of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as a potential risk marker for the development of ARDS, suggesting a utility for antibody testing in acutely diseased patients.","Buchholtz, Marie-Luise; Arend, Florian M; Eichhorn, Peter; Weigand, Michael; Kleinhempel, Alisa; Häusler, Kurt; Bruegel, Mathias; Holdt, Lesca M; Teupser, Daniel",PLoS One,327,20

Identifying patients at risk is critical for optimized care and early therapeutic interventions. We investigated the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding relative to disease severity.We analyzed nasopharyngeal and tracheal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in 92 patients with diagnosed COVID-19. Upon admission, standardized nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum were collected. If patients were mechanically ventilated, tracheal aspirates were additionally obtained. Viral shedding was quantified by real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.45% (41 of 92) of COVID-19 had a severe disease course with the need for mechanical ventilation (severe group). At week 1, the initial viral shedding determined from nasopharyngeal swabs showed no significant difference between non-severe and severe cases. At week 2, a difference could be observed as the viral shedding remained elevated in severely ill patients. A time course of C-reactive-Protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (Il-6), and Procalcitonin (PCT) revealed an even more protracted inflammatory response following the delayed drop of virus shedding load in severely ill patients. A significant proportion (47.8%) of patients showed evidence of prolonged viral shedding (>17â days), which was associated with severe disease courses (73.2%).We report that viral shedding does not differ significantly between severe and non-severe cases upon admission to the hospital. Elevated SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the second week of hospitalisation, a systemic inflammatory reaction peaking between second and third week and prolonged viral shedding are associated with a more severe disease course.","Munker, Dieter; Osterman, Andreas; Stubbe, Hans; Muenchhoff, Maximilian; Veit, Tobias; Weinberger, Tobias; Barnikel, Michaela; Mumm, Jan-Niclas; Milger, Katrin; Khatamzas, Elham; Klauss, Sarah; Scherer, Clemens; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Giessen-Jung, Clemens; Zoller, Michael; Herold, Tobias; de Toni, Enrico N; Schulz, Christian; Kneidinger, Nikolaus; Keppler, Oliver T; Behr, Jürgen; Mayerle, Julia; Munker, Stefan",Eur. respir. j,327,23

Uridine diphosphate dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT) UGT76G1, as a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of SGs with a low heterologous expression level, hinders its application. In this study, a suitable fusion partner, Smt3, was found to enhance the soluble expression of UGT76G1 by 60%. Additionally, a novel strategy to improve the expression of Smt3-UGT76G1 was performed, which co-expressed endogenous genes prpD and malK in Escherichia coli. Notably, this is the first report of constructing an efficient E. coli expression system by regulating prpD and malK expression, which remarkably improved the expression of Smt3-UGT76G1 by 200% as a consequence. Using the high-expression strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) M/P-3-S32U produced 1.97 g/L of Smt3-UGT76G1 with a yield rate of 61.6 mg/L/h by fed-batch fermentation in a 10 L fermenter.

The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2% (95%CI 5.6-8.7%), with 97.3% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3% (95%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence: 32.6% (95%CI 4.8-60.4%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3% (95%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1% (95%CI0.0-44.6%). DISCUSSION: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.","Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Cardona-Trujillo, María C; García-Barco, Alejandra; Holguin-Rivera, Yeimer; Cortes-Bonilla, Isabella; Bedoya-Arias, Hugo A; Patiño-Cadavid, Leidy Jhoana; Tamayo-Orozco, Juan David; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto; Zambrano, Lysien I; Dhama, Kuldeep; Sah, Ranjit; Rabaan, Ali A; Balbin-Ramon, Graciela J; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Infez Med,327,10

Engineering of these molecules would be enhanced by a better understanding of AMP sequence-activity relationships to improve efficacy in vivo and limit effects of off-target activity. Towards this goal, we experimentally evaluated 210 natural and variant class IIa bacteriocins for antimicrobial activity against six strains of enterococci. Inhibitory activity was ridge regressed to AMP sequence to predict performance, achieving an area under the curve of 0.70 and demonstrating the potential of statistical models for identifying and designing AMPs. Active AMPs were individually produced and evaluated against eight enterococci strains and four Listeria strains to elucidate trends in susceptibility. It was determined that the mannose phosphotransferase system sequence is informative of susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins, yet other factors, such as membrane composition, also contribute strongly to susceptibility. A broadly potent bacteriocin variant (lactocin DT1) from a Lactobacillus ruminis genome was identified as the only variant with inhibitory activity towards all tested strains, while a novel enterocin variant (DT2) from an E. faecium genome demonstrated specificity towards Listeria strains. Eight AMPs were evaluated for proteolytic stability to trypsin, chymotrypsin, and pepsin, and three C-terminal disulfide-containing variants, including divercin V41, were identified as compelling for future in vivo studies given high potency and proteolytic stability.Importance Class IIa bacteriocin antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), an alternative to traditional small-molecule antibiotics, are capable of selective activity towards various Gram-positive bacteria, limiting negative side effects associated with broad-spectrum activity. This selective activity is achieved through targeting of the mannose phosphotransferase system (manPTS) of a subset of Gram-positive bacteria, although factors affecting this mechanism are not entirely understood. Peptides identified from genomic data, as well as variants of previously characterized AMPs, can offer insight into how peptide sequence affects activity and selectivity. The experimental methods presented here identify promising potent and selective bacteriocins for further evaluation, highlight the potential of simple computational modeling for prediction of AMP performance, and demonstrate that factors beyond manPTS sequence affect bacterial susceptibility to class IIa bacteriocins.","Tresnak, Daniel T; Hackel, Benjamin J",,327,21

This assay utilizes a custom CRISPR Cas12a/gRNA complex and a fluorescent probe to detect target amplicons produced by standard RT-PCR or isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), to allow sensitive detection at sites not equipped with real-time PCR systems required for qPCR diagnostics. We found this approach allowed sensitive and robust detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, with a sample-to-answer time of ~50 min, and a limit of detection of 2 copies per sample. CRISPR assay diagnostic results obtained nasal swab samples of individuals with suspected COVID-19 cases were comparable to paired results from a CDC-approved quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay performed in a state testing lab, and superior to those produced by same assay in a clinical lab, where the RT-qPCR assay exhibited multiple invalid or inconclusive results. Our assay also demonstrated greater analytical sensitivity and more robust diagnostic performance than other recently reported CRISPR-based assays. Based on these findings, we believe that a CRISPR-based fluorescent application has potential to improve current COVID-19 screening efforts.","Huang, Zhen; Tian, Di; Liu, Yang; Lin, Zhen; Lyon, Christopher J; Lai, Weihua; Fusco, Dahlene; Drouin, Arnaud; Yin, Xiaoming; Hu, Tony; Ning, Bo",Biosens Bioelectron,327,20

While, healthcare systems are globally operating at maximum capacity, healthcare workers and especially anesthesia providers are facing extreme pressures, something that is also leading to declining availability and increasing stress. In this regard, it is extremely concerning the fact that some regions worldwide have reported up to 20% of their cases to be healthcare workers. When considering that the global case fatality rate may be as much as 5.4%, these numbers are concerning and unacceptable. As this pandemic accelerates, access to personal protective equipment for health workers is a key concern since at present, healthcare workers are every country's most valuable resource in the fight against COVID-19. Governments and heath organizations should take care of their staff and support them in any way possible. This review aims to describe the current situation anesthesia providers are facing in the setting of COVID-19 and provide solutions and evidence on important concerns, including which guidance to follow, the level of equipment that is adequate, and the level of protection they need for every patient being administered an anesthetic.","Rekatsina, Martina; Paladini, Antonella; Moka, Eleni; Yeam, Cheng Teng; Urits, Ivan; Viswanath, Omar; Kaye, Alan D; Morgan, John A; Varrassi, Giustino",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,327,16

The remarkable features for the occurrence time of Fa, that the positive Fa (CO2 emission from soil) and negative Fa (CO2 absorption by soil) generally occurred in the daytime and nighttime, respectively, suggested that the generation of Fa is related to temperature. Previous studies have focused on the sole effect of soil temperature (Ts) or air temperature (Ta) on Fa, but very little is regarding to the overall response of Fa to both Ta and Ts in the air-soil system. In the Mu Us Desert, China, we continuously measured the hourly Fa, Ts, Ta and the difference between Ta and Ts (Ta-Ts) at 4-day intervals from June to October 2016. During this period, soil abiotically absorbed atmospheric CO2 at a rate of 0.32 ± 0.19 g m-2 d-1. Fa was not correlated with Ts and was weakly correlated with Ta, however, it was strongly and positively correlated with Ta-Ts. A quadratic model adequately fitted the relationship between Fa and Ta-Ts, and similar relationships were also observed between positive Fa and Ta-Ts and between negative Fa and Ta-Ts. The results of Fa measurement highlight that desert soils can absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through abiotic processes. The relationships of Fa with Ts, Ta and Ta-Ts indicate that, abiotic CO2 exchange between soil and atmosphere depends on air-soil temperature gradient in desert. Furthermore, the thermal convection driven by Ta-Ts may play a major role in the generation of nocturnal negative Fa. Our findings provide a new possible perspective for revealing the reasons of Fa generation in drylands.","Gao, Yang; Zhao, Zhong; Zhang, Yuqing; Liu, Jiabin",Sci Total Environ,327,29

We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on 'PubMed' and Google Scholar. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable. CONCLUSION: IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission. This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.","Islam, M Saiful; Rahman, Kazi M; Sun, Yanni; Qureshi, Mohammed O; Abdi, Ikram; Chughtai, Abrar A; Seale, Holly",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,327,29

More than four million cases of COVID-19, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have been confirmed as of May 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic and transmissible coronavirus that primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and close contact. A growing body of clinical data suggests that a cytokine storm is associated with COVID-19 severity and is also a crucial cause of death from COVID-19. In the absence of antivirals and vaccines for COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of the features of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathological features, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatments of the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. Additionally, we suggest that the identification and treatment of the cytokine storm are important components for rescuing patients with severe COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Compliance is essential for SCIT to obtain maximal benefit as it is a long-term treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the level of real-life SCIT compliance in pediatric patients and the associated factors. Additional aims were to determine how SCIT compliance was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and why some patients dropped out SCIT. METHOD: Pediatric patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or venom allergy that received SCIT between September 2012 and July 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 201 children (66.7% male) with a median (interquartile range) age of 12.8 years (9.4-15.2) at the time of the first SCIT injection. The overall compliance rate before COVID-19 pandemic was 86.1%. Short SCIT follow-up time and venom anaphylaxis were found to be risk factors for drop out. The leading causes of drop outs were moving to another city/country (32.1%), symptom improvement (17.8%), treatment ineffectiveness (14.2%), and adverse reactions (14.2%). Among the 108 patients that were still receiving SCIT during the COVID-19 pandemic, 31 (28.7%) dropped out the therapy. The most frequent reasons for drop-out were fear of being infected with COVID-19 (35.4%) and thinking that the AIT practise stopped due to COVID-19 pandemic (29%). Male gender and older age were found to be the independent risk factors for drop-out of SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Real life compliance in children was found 13.9% and it was higher than adults. Nearly one-third of children dropped out during the CO-VID-19 pandemic. Male gender and older age are associated with SCIT drop-out during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Aytekin, Elif Soyak; Soyer, Özge; Sekerel, Bülent E; Sahiner, Ümit M",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,327,30

DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic review of all English and French language full-text articles addressing surgical management of colorectal endometriosis and compared the postoperative complications according to surgical technique by meta-analysis. The PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant studies published before March 27, 2020. The search strategy used the following MeSH terms: (""bowel endometriosis"" or ""colorectal endometriosis"") AND (""surgery for endometriosis"" or ""conservative management"" or ""radical management"" or ""colorectal resection"" or ""shaving"" or ""full thickness resection"" or ""disc excision"") AND (""treatment"", ""outcomes"", ""long term results"" and ""complications""). METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Two authors conducted the literature search and independently screened abstracts for inclusion, with resolution of any difference by three other authors. Studies were included when data on surgical management (shaving, disc excision and/ or segmental resection) were provided and when postoperative outcomes were detailed with at least the number of complications. The risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane recommendations. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of the168 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 60 were included in the qualitative synthesis. Seventeen of these were included in the meta-analysis on rectovaginal fistula, 10 on anastomotic leakage, five on anastomotic stenosis, and nine on voiding dysfunction <30 days. The mean complication rate according to shaving, discoid excision and segmental resection were 2.2%, 9.7% and 9.9%, respectively. Rectal shaving was less associated with rectovaginal fistula than discoid excision (OR=0.19; 95% CI [0.10-0.36], p<0.00001, I2=33%) and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.26, 95% IC [0.15-0.44], p<0.00001, I2=0%). No difference was found in the occurrence of rectovaginal fistula between discoid excision and segmental colorectal resection (OR=1.07, 95%CI [0.70-1.63], p=0.76, I2=0%). Rectal shaving was less associated with leakage than disc excision (OR=0.22, 95% IC [0.06-0.73], p=0.01, I2=86%). No difference was found in the occurrence of leakage between rectal shaving and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.32, 95% IC [0.10-1.01], p=0.05, I2=71%) or between disc excision and segmental colorectal resection (OR=0.32, 95% IC [0.30-1.58], p=0.38, I2=0%). Disc excision was less associated with anastomotic stenosis than segmental resection (OR=0.15, 95% IC [0.05-0.48], p=0.001, I2=59%). Disc excision was associated with more voiding dysfunction <30 days than rectal shaving (OR=12.9, 95% IC [1.40-119.34], p=0.02, I2=0%). No difference was found in the occurrence of voiding dysfunction <30 days between segmental resection and rectal shaving (OR=3.05, 95% IC [0.55-16.87], p=0.20, I2=0%) or between segmental colorectal and discoid resection (OR=0.99, 95% IC [0.54-1.85], p=0.99, I2=71%). CONCLUSION: Colorectal surgery for endometriosis exposes patients to a risk of severe complications such as rectovaginal fistula, anastomotic leakage, anastomotic stenosis and voiding dysfunction. Rectal shaving appears to be less associated with postoperative complications than disc excision and segmental colorectal resection. However, this technique is not suitable in all patients with large bowel infiltration. Compared to segmental colorectal resection, disc excision has several advantages including shorter operating time, shorter hospital stay and lower risk of postoperative bowel stenosis.

Communal screening of air in a highly crowded space has the potential to provide early warning on the presence and potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 as suggested by studies early in the epidemic. As hospitals and public facilities apply varying degrees of restrictions and regulations, it is important to provide multiple methodological options to enable environmental SARS-CoV-2 surveillance under different conditions. This study assessed the feasibility of using high-flowrate air samplers combined with RNA extraction kit designed for environmental sample to perform airborne SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in hospital setting, tested by RT-qPCR. The success rate of the air samples in detecting SARS-CoV-2 was then compared with surface swab samples collected in the same proximity. Additionally, positive RT-qPCR samples underwent viral culture to assess the viability of the sampled SARS-CoV-2. The study was performed in inpatient ward environments of a quaternary care university teaching hospital in Singapore housing active COVID-19 patients within the period of February to May 2020. Two types of wards were tested, naturally ventilated open-cohort ward and mechanically ventilated isolation ward. Distances between the site of air sampling and the patient cluster in the investigated wards were also recorded. No successful detection of airborne SARS-CoV-2 was recorded when 50 L/min air samplers were used. Upon increasing the sampling flowrate to 150 L/min, our results showed a high success rate in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 from the air samples (72%) compared to the surface swab samples (9.6%). The positive detection rate of the air samples along with the corresponding viral load could be associated with the distance between sampling site and patient. The furthest distance from patient with PCR-positive air samples was 5.5 m. The airborne SARS-CoV-2 detection was comparable between the two types of wards with 60%?87.5% success rate. High prevalence of the virus was found in toilet areas, both on surfaces and in air. Finally, no successful culture attempt was recorded from the environmental air or surface samples.","Ang, Alicia X.

We report a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) signature to distinguish SAH patients with CVS from SAH patients without CVS. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from SAH patients without CVS (n = 10) and SAH patients with CVS (n = 10). lncRNAs ZFAS1 and MALAT1 were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05), whereas lncRNAs LINC00261 and LINC01619 were significantly downregulated in SAH patients with CVS (p < 0.05) compared to SAH patients without CVS. We applied this lncRNA signature to retrospectively predict CVS in SAH patients (n = 38 for SAH patients without CVS, and n = 27 for SAH patients with CVS). The 4-lncRNA signature was found to be predictive in >40% of samples and the 2-lncRNA comprising MALAT1 and LINC01619 accurately predicted CVS in â¼90% cases.

Whether its cardiac involvement is a specific feature consisting of myocarditis, or simply due to microvascular injury and systemic inflammation, is yet unclear and presently debated. Because myocardial injury is also common in other kinds of pneumonias, we investigated and compared such occurrence in severe pneumonias due to COVID-19 and other causes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed data from 156 critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation in four European tertiary hospitals, including all n = 76 COVID-19 patients with severe disease course requiring at least ventilatory support, matched to n = 76 from a retrospective consecutive patient cohort of severe pneumonias of other origin (matched for age, gender, and type of ventilator therapy). When compared to the non-COVID-19, mortality (COVID-19 = 38.2% vs. non-COVID-19 = 51.3%, P = 0.142) and impairment of systolic function were not significantly different. Surprisingly, myocardial injury was even more frequent in non-COVID-19 (96.4% vs. 78.1% P = 0.004). Although inflammatory activity [C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6] was indifferent, d-dimer and thromboembolic incidence (COVID-19 = 23.7% vs. non-COVID-19 = 5.3%, P = 0.002) driven by pulmonary embolism rates (COVID-19 = 17.1% vs. non-COVID-19 = 2.6%, P = 0.005) were higher. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury was frequent in severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, but still less frequent than in similarly severe pneumonias of other origin, indicating that cardiac involvement may not be a specific feature of COVID-19.

This study tested the application of the Theory of Planned Behaviors (TPB) to three types of social/physical distancing indicators (i.e., the number of close physical contacts on a single day in public venues, the frequencies of avoiding social gathering, and the levels of physical distancing in public venues). A population-based random telephone survey interviewed 300 Hong Kong Chinese adults in April 2020 when gatherings involving >4 people were banned. The participants on average made 15.3 close physical contacts (<1.5 m and for >3 min) in a day (5.0 in public transportation). About 80% practiced social distancing (avoided/reduced social gatherings) and physical distancing in public spaces (e.g., avoidance of going out, visiting crowded places, and gatherings of >4 people) but only 35.4% avoided using public transportations. Positive but not negative attitudes (inconvenience and lack of necessity), perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm were significantly associated with the three social/physical distancing outcomes. The data suggest that the levels of social/physical distancing were relatively high in the Hong Kong general population, and it, in general, supports the application of TPB to understand factors of social distancing for preventing COVID-19. Health promotion should take the findings into account. Furthermore, cross-cultural and time-series studies are warranted to compare the levels of social/physical distancing across countries and further explore their effectiveness in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yu, Yanqiu; Lau, Joseph Tak Fai; Lau, Mason M C",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),327,16

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in this study. A NIDEK NCT was used for intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement for patients who visited Department of Ophthalmology in Qilu Hospital of Shandong University during March 18-25 2020. After ultra-violate (UV) light disinfection, the room air was sampled for 5 minutes. Before and after alcohol disinfection, the air samples and nozzle surface samples were respectively collected by plate exposure method and sterile moist cotton swab technique after predetermined times of NCT air-puff. Microbial colony counts were calculated after incubation for 48 hours. Finally, mass spectrometry was performed for the accurate identification of microbial species. RESULTS: Increased microbial colonies were detected from air samples close to NCT nozzle after air-puff compared with air samples at a distance of 1 meter from the nozzle (p = 0.001). Interestingly, none microbes were detected on the surface of NCT nozzle. Importantly, after 75% alcohol disinfection less microbes were detected in the air beside the nozzle (p = 0.003). Microbial species identification showed more than ten strains of microbes, all of which were non-pathogenic. CONCLUSION: Aerosols containing microbes were produced by NCT air-puff in the ophthalmic consultation room, which may be a possible virus transmission route in the department of ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alcohol disinfection for the nozzle and the surrounding air was efficient at decreasing the microbes contained in the aerosols and theoretically this prevention measure could also inhibit the virus. This will give guidance for the prevention of virus transmission and protection of hospital staff and patients.","Guo, Hui; Li, Wei; Huang, Yingying; Li, Xiaoyan; Li, Zhi; Zhou, Hongxia; Sun, Enhua; Li, Li; Li, Jisheng",PLoS One,327,1

To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.","Imbriano, Gabriella; Larsen, Emmett M; Mackin, Daniel M; An, Akaisha Kaixuan; Luhmann, Christian C; Mohanty, Aprajita; Jin, Jingwen",Front Public Health,327,1

A subclass of these WCI Hamiltonians admits \emph{emergent singular solutions} for certain initial conditions. These singular solutions are identified with a singular momentum map for left action of the diffeomorphisms on a semidirect-product Lie algebra. This semidirect-product Lie algebra comprises vector fields representing horizontal current velocity acting on scalar functions representing wave elevation. We use computational simulations to demonstrate the dynamical interactions of the emergent wavefront trains which are admitted by this special subclass of Hamiltonians for a variety of initial conditions. In particular, we investigate: (1) A variety of localised initial current configurations in still water whose subsequent propagation generates surface-elevation dynamics on an initially flat surface; and (2) The release of initially confined configurations of surface elevation in still water that generate dynamically interacting fronts of localised currents and wave trains. The results of these simulations show intricate wave-current interaction patterns whose structures are similar to those seen, for example, in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken from the space shuttle.","Holm, Darryl D.; Hu, Ruiao",,327,1

The World Health Organization (WHO) firstly used the term ""new coronavirus 2019"" on December 29, 2019. This pandemic, which is currently called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was subsequently called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in all employees of the Nouakchott National Hospital Center (CHN). The study was conducted during the week 20/05/2020 to 27/05/2020. It involved 853 employees of all ranks (doctors, pharmacists, nurses, secretaries, security personnel, administrators...) of whom 504 were male and 331 were female, with a sex ratio of 1,52 with an average age of 39 years, ranging from 20 to 60 years. The screening for IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was performed using Biotime (Xiamen Biotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) immunochromatographic technique. Out of 835 employees included in our study, 14 were positive (1.67%) of whom 12 had IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and 2 had isolated IgM. Nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed in these 14 patients and was positive in six. While PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, in particular rapid tests (RDTs) are a diagnostic complement to COVID-19. They have the advantage of being easy to realize, of being safe both in the laboratories and outside the laboratories. RDTs enabled us to detect asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within CHN employees.

The aim of the study was to estimate sensitivity of admission LUS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 lung involvement using Chest-CT (Computed Tomography) as reference standard in order to assess LUS usefulness in ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: Eighty-two patients with confirmed COVID-19 and signs of lung involvement on Chest-CT were consecutively admitted to our hospital and recruited in the study. Chest-CT and LUS examination were concurrently performed within the first 6-12h from admission. Sensitivity of LUS was calculated using CT findings as a reference standard. Results: Global LUS sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 pulmonary lesions was 52%. LUS sensitivity ranged from 8% in case of focal and sporadic ground-glass opacities (mild disease), to 52% for a crazy-paving pattern (moderate disease) and up to 100% in case of extensive subpleural consolidations (severe disease), although LUS was not always able to detect all the consolidations assessed at Chest-CT. LUS sensitivity was higher in detecting a typical Chest-CT pattern (60%) and abnormalities showing a middle-lower zone predominance (79%). Conclusions: As admission LUS may result falsely negative in most cases, it should not be considered as a reliable imaging tool in ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia in patients presenting in ED. It may at least represent an expanded clinical evaluation that needs integration with other diagnostic tests (e.g., nasopharyngeal swab, Chest-CT).","Quarato, Carla Maria Irene; Mirijello, Antonio; Lacedonia, Donato; Russo, Raffaele; Maggi, Michele Maria; Rea, Gaetano; Simeone, Annalisa; Borelli, Cristina; Feragalli, Beatrice; Scioscia, Giulia; Barbaro, Maria Pia Foschino; Massa, Valentina; De Cosmo, Salvatore; Sperandeo, Marco",Medicina (Kaunas),327,24

Limited data are available for convalescent patients. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of discharged COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we extracted data for 134 convalescent patients with COVID-19 in Guizhou Provincial Staff Hospital from February 15 to March 31, 2020. Cases were analyzed on the basis of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data as well as radiological features. RESULTS: Of 134 convalescent patients with COVID-19, 19 (14.2%) were severe cases, while 115 (85.8%) were non-severe cases. The median patient age was 33 years (IQR, 21.8 to 46.3), and the cohort included 69 men and 65 women. Compared with non-severe cases, severe patients were older and had more chronic comorbidities, especially hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease (P < 0.05). Leukopenia was present in 32.1% of the convalescent patients and lymphocytopenia was present in 6.7%, both of which were more common in severe patients. 48 (35.8%) of discharged patients had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, which was more common in adults than in children (40.2% vs 13.6%, P = 0.018).

Its mutations have been implicated in multiple muscular diseases. These FHL1 related myopathies are characterized by symptoms such as progressive muscle loss, rigid or bent spine, even cardiac or respiratory failure in some patients, which implies pathological problems not only in muscles, but also in the nervous system. Moreover, decreased FHL1 protein level has been found in patients with FHL1 mutations, indicating the protein loss-of-function as a pathological cause of such diseases. These findings suggest the significance of understanding the systemic role of FHL1 in the homeostasis of nervous system and muscle. Here we reported that Fhl1 loss in C2C12 myotubes obscured acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering in addition to myotube fusion, which was associated with impaired MuSK phosphorylation. Mechanistically, myostatin-SMAD2/3 signaling was enhanced, whereas IGF-PI3K-AKT signaling was suppressed in Fhl1-/- C2C12 myotubes. Reversion of these molecular alterations rescued AChR clustering and differentiation deficits. These data outline a systemic regulation of AChR clustering and myotube fusion by FHL1, which may offer clues for mechanism study and development of therapeutic strategies to treat FHL1 related myopathies.","Wu, Jiamei; Zhao, Kai; Du, Zengmin; Chen, Ying; Zhang, Feixu; Jiang, Wei; Zheng, Jing; Wu, Xia; Shen, Chengyong; Xiao, Xiao",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,327,16

By taking advantage of a peptide microarray with full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results, we identified several S protein-derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnostic performance.

On the other hand, the lockdown period which has lasted for nearly 2 months and is actually involving several countries worldwide, obliged a large part of human population to sedentary behaviors, drastically reducing their physical activity level, and reducing their cardiopulmonary fitness. Therefore, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be beneficial, so that a safe and well-weighted return to pre-lockdown active lifestyle can be efficiently planned.

Citizens were forced to stay at home. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we will provide an analysis of food consumption in Italy during the emergency from a social stance. Secondly, we will consider the risks in relation to health of these food product choices. METHODS AND RESULT: This analysis is based on IRi's data on consumption trends (percentage increase in sales in value) during the first period of the spread of coronavirus, from 23rd of February through the 29th of March, 2020. The sample includes 10 769 stores. There was an increase in the consumption of pasta, flour, eggs, long-life milk and frozen foods, in comparison to a reduction of fresh food goods. The sales of snacks have dropped in relation to the production of homemade bread, pizza and cakes. CONCLUSION: The increase in the consumption of some types of food is linked with their symbolic value and its tendency to carry on at home some external socialization habits.

One method involves granting the population relative freedom within the actual, physical realm, while the other method involves strengthening data surveillance within the virtual realm. This articulation of the actual and the virtual, and of freedom and surveillance, is at the core of Korea’s biopolitical governmentality, which is currently intertwined not only with an infectious virus, but also with data technology. I would like to suggest a slight silver lining with respect to the possibility of overcoming this dilemma: a dilemma that involves physical survival under data colonialism on the one hand, and freedom from data colonialism on the other – both elements complicated by the potential risk of transmission. This may be a starting point toward digital democracy in the age of pandemics: social equality for life instead of augmenting the thanapolitical database;respect toward vulnerable singularities instead of deceitful exclusion;and sensitivity toward redressing embedded inequality instead of reinforcing stigmatization.

There have been concerns that lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) increases angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 levels. Conversely, pleiotropic effects of statins can theoretically protect against severe COVID19 infection, supporting evidence from other respiratory illnesses in which statin use probably confers benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: There is an abundance of studies that show that statins are safe and potentially protect against severe COVID19 infection (critical illness and death), even when adjustment for potential confounders is undertaken. However, the evidence is limited to retrospective cohorts. The benefit for patients with diabetes is less clear. There is a paucity of evidence for other LLT agents. Available clinical guidelines recommend the ongoing use of LLT in patients with COVID19 (unless specifically contra-indicated) and the data from available studies support these. SUMMARY: In patients with COVID19 infection, LLT should be continued. However, the current findings need substantiating in larger prospective clinical studies with specific examination of the possible mechanisms by which LLT confers benefit from COVID19.","Adam, Safwaan; Ho, Jan Hoong; Bashir, Bilal; Iqbal, Zohaib; Ferdousi, Maryam; Syed, Akheel A; Soran, Handrean",Curr Opin Lipidol,327,1

Lung-protective ventilation in coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure may result in severe respiratory acidosis without significant hypoxemia. Low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal can facilitate lung-protective ventilation and avoid the adverse effects of severe respiratory acidosis. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal Co2 removal using the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System in correcting severe respiratory acidosis in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 mechanically ventilated with severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis and treated with low-flow extracorporeal Co2 removal. Setting: Eight tertiary ICUs in the United States. Patients: Adult patients supported with the Hemolung Respiratory Assist System from March 1, to September 30, 2020. Interventions: Extracorporeal Co2 removal with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System under a Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was improvement in pH and Paco2 from baseline. Secondary outcomes included survival to decannulation, mortality, time on ventilator, and adverse events. Thirty-one patients were treated with Hemolung Respiratory Assist System with significant improvement in pH and Pco2 in this cohort. Two patients experienced complications that prevented treatment. Of the 29 treated patients, 58% survived to 48 hours post treatment and 38% to hospital discharge. No difference in age or comorbidities were noted between survivors and nonsurvivors. There was significant improvement in pH (7.24 ± 0.12 to 7.35 ± 0.07; p < 0.0001) and Paco2 (79 ± 23 to 58 ± 14; p < 0.0001) from baseline to 24 hours.

While the disease primarily presents as a respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have been reported in up to one-third of confirmed cases, and patients may have mild symptoms that do not prompt them to seek medical attention. Internet-based infodemiology offers an approach to studying symptoms at a population level, even in individuals who do not seek medical care. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between internet searches for gastrointestinal symptoms and the confirmed case count of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: The search terms chosen for analysis in this study included common gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Furthermore, the search terms fever and cough were used as positive controls, and constipation was used as a negative control. Daily query shares for the selected symptoms were obtained from Google Trends between October 1, 2019 and June 15, 2020 for all US states. These shares were divided into two time periods: pre-COVID-19 (prior to March 1) and post-COVID-19 (March 1-June 15). Confirmed COVID-19 case numbers were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering data repository. Moving averages of the daily query shares (normalized to baseline pre-COVID-19) were then analyzed against the confirmed disease case count and daily new cases to establish a temporal relationship. RESULTS: The relative search query shares of many symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and constipation, remained near or below baseline throughout the time period studied; however, there were notable increases in searches for the positive control symptoms of fever and cough as well as for diarrhea. These increases in daily search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea preceded the rapid rise in number of cases by approximately 10 to 14 days. The search volumes for these terms began declining after mid-March despite the continued rises in cumulative cases and daily new case counts. CONCLUSIONS: Google searches for symptoms may precede the actual rises in cases and hospitalizations during pandemics. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, this study demonstrates that internet search queries for fever, cough, and diarrhea increased prior to the increased confirmed case count by available testing during the early weeks of the pandemic in the United States. While the search volumes eventually decreased significantly as the number of cases continued to rise, internet query search data may still be a useful tool at a population level to identify areas of active disease transmission at the cusp of new outbreaks.","Rajan, Anjana; Sharaf, Ravi; Brown, Robert S; Sharaiha, Reem Z; Lebwohl, Benjamin; Mahadev, SriHari",JMIR Public Health Surveill,327,16

Considering the findings of previous studies on the use of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for treating severe H1N1 infection and the satisfying results for reducing viral load and mortality, this study aimed to investigate the potential usefulness of IVIg for the management of severe cases. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 84 patients were included: 52 in the IVIg group and 32 in the control group. The intervention group received IVIg at a dose of 400 mg/kg, IV, daily for three days. Both groups received hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and supportive care. The demographic data, mortality rate, the need for mechanical ventilation, length of stay in hospital and in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and imaging findings were recorded and compared in terms of the mentioned factors. RESULTS: The mean time from admission to IVIg initiation was 3.84 ± 3.35 days. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of mortality rate (P-value = 0.8) and the need for mechanical ventilation (P-value = 0.39). The length of hospital stay was significantly lower for the control group than that of the intervention group (P-value = 0.003).

The purpose of this review is to discuss and differentiate typical imaging findings of COVID-19 from those of other diseases, which can appear similar in the first instance. The typical CT findings of COVID-19 are bilateral and peripheral predominant ground-glass opacities. As per the Fleischner Society consensus statement, CT is appropriate in certain scenarios, including for patients who are at risk for and/or develop clinical worsening. The probability that CT findings represent COVID-19, however, depends largely on the pretest probability of infection, which is in turn defined by community prevalence of infection. When the community prevalence of COVID-19 is low, a large gap exists between positive predictive values of chest CT versus those of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. This implies that with use of chest CT there are a large number of false-positive results. Imaging differentiation is important for management and isolation purposes and for appropriate disposition of patients with false-positive CT findings. Herein the authors discuss differential pathology with close imaging resemblance to typical CT imaging features of COVID-19 and highlight CT features that may help differentiate COVID-19 from other conditions.","Parekh, Maansi; Donuru, Achala; Balasubramanya, Rashmi; Kapur, Sangita",Radiology,327,29

Mental health issues among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly reported across the globe. Henceforth, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prevalence and determinants of mental health outcomes (anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD, insomnia) among nurses across the globe due to the COVID-19. Methods: A PRISMA compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42020204120) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of mental health outcomes among nurses. Proportion random effect analysis, I2 statistic, quality assessment, and sensitivity analysis were carried out. Results: Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-44%, n (number of studies) = 21, N (sample size) = 13 641), 40.6% stress (95% CI = 25.4%-56.8%, n = 10, N = 4204), 32% depression (95% CI = 21%-44%, n = 17, N = 12 294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CI = 4.8%-38%, n = 3, N = 638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CI = 5.8%-78.6%, n = 2, N = 261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever). Conclusion: The study results highlighted a higher proportion of poor mental health outcomes namely, anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD and insomnia among nurses from different parts of the world. Poor mental health outcomes among nurses warrants the need to implement proactive psychological interventions to deter the collapse of health care systems in responding to the pandemic and in particular all possible efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the risk factors. Health care organizations should provide support to nurses with sufficient flexibility. The disaster preparedness plan envisaged by nations should have provisions to address the mental health of nurses. Greater investment in addressing the global shortage of nurses should be given priority in national health policies. Attractive salary packages should be offered to nurses to prevent their emigration from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Vaccine hesitancy, identified as a top threat to global health by the World Health Organization, is a significant barrier to vaccine uptake. With COVID-19 vaccination programs in effect since December 2020, it is critical that vaccination barriers are proactively identified. With limited information surrounding college students' perspectives on COVID-19 vaccines, outreach measures will play a pivotal role in vaccine uptake in this population. Development of informative, cohort-driven vaccination campaigns requires proactive assessment of factors influencing vaccine hesitancy, access, and uptake. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to investigate the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy among college students at the University of Rhode Island (URI). The secondary objective was to identify differences in COVID-19 and influenza vaccine hesitancy rates in this population. METHODS: A 22-item, Institutional Review Board-approved, anonymous questionnaire was developed to survey URI students who voluntarily attended 2 joint University Health Services and College of Pharmacy influenza vaccination clinics in November 2020. RESULTS: A total of 237 vaccination clinic participants consented and responded to at least 1 question on the survey. Once available to their respective priority group, 92% are very/somewhat likely to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and 50% will receive a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. Only 3% of the participants stated that they would never receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The top 3 reported COVID-19 vaccine-related concerns were safety (37%), effectiveness (24%), and limited information (16%). When asked if COVID-19 vaccines and influenza vaccines should be mandated, 85% and 83%, respectively, were in favor. CONCLUSION: Understanding the spectrum of vaccine hesitancy is critical in achieving COVID-19 community immunity thresholds. URI students are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 provided that the vaccines are proven safe and efficacious.","Silva, Jessica; Bratberg, Jeffrey; Lemay, Virginia",,327,24

Nerman's celebrated law of large numbers [{\it Z.~Wahrsch.~Verw.~Gebiete} 57, 365--395, 1981] states that, under some mild assumptions, $e^{-\alpha t} \mathcal Z_t^\varphi$ converges almost surely as $t \to \infty$ to $aW$. Here, $\alpha>0$ is the Malthusian parameter, $a$ is a constant and $W$ is the limit of Nerman's martingale, which is positive on the survival event. In this general situation, under additional (second moment) assumptions, we prove a central limit theorem for $(\mathcal Z_t^{\varphi})_{t \geq 0}$. More precisely, we show that there exist a constant $k \in \mathds N_0$ and a function $H(t)$, a finite random linear combination of functions of the form $t^j e^{\lambda t}$ with $\alpha/2 \leq \mathrm{Re}(\lambda)<\alpha$, such that $(\mathcal Z_t^\varphi - a e^{\alpha t}W -H(t))/\sqrt{t^k e^{\alpha t}}$ converges in distribution to a normal law with random variance.

Stool may remain positive for SARS-CoV-2, even when the respiratory tract becomes negative, and the interaction with the gastrointestinal tract poses a series of questions about wastewater and its treatments. This review aims to understand the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces and sewage and its fate in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The viral load in the faeces of persons testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated at between 5·103 to 107.6 copies/mL, depending on the infection course. In the sewerage, faeces undergo dilution and viral load decreases considerably in the wastewater entering a WWTP with a range from 2 copies/100 mL to 3·103 copies/mL, depending on the level of the epidemic. Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, although no evidence of COVID-19 transmission has been found via this route, could be advantageously exploited as an early warning of outbreaks. Preliminary studies on WBE seem promising; but high uncertainty of viral loads in wastewater and faeces remains, and further research is needed. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, based on RNA sequences and RT-PCR, requires a shared approach on sample pre-treatment and on-site collection to ensure comparable results. The finding of viral RNA in stools does not imply that the virus is viable and infectious. Viability of CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2 decreases in wastewater - due to temperature, pH, solids, micropollutants - but high inactivation in WWTPs can be obtained only by using disinfection (free chlorine, UVC light). A reduction in the quantity of disinfectants can be obtained by implementing Membrane-Bioreactors with ultrafiltration to separate SARS-CoV-2 virions with a size of 60-140 nm. In sludge treatment, thermophilic digestion is effective, based on the general consensus that CoVs are highly sensitive to increased temperatures.","Foladori, Paola; Cutrupi, Francesca; Segata, Nicola; Manara, Serena; Pinto, Federica; Malpei, Francesca; Bruni, Laura; La Rosa, Giuseppina",Sci Total Environ,327,32

METHODS: We searched relevant databases/websites (up to September 2020) and selected English-language RCT publications of remdesivir for COVID-19. We conducted meta-analysis using an inverse variance, random-effects model in addition to trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the efficacy outcomes: all-cause mortality, viral burden and clinical progression. Safety outcomes were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We included five RCTs (7540 participants) from 7237 citations. Most (80%) were of an unclear to high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a significant improvement with remdesivir (100 mg, 10 days) regarding all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, CI 0.82-1.07; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; 7143 patients), clinical progression (RR 1.08, CI 0.99-1.18; I2 = 70.4%; 3 RCTs; 1692 patients), or diarrhoea (RR 0.82, CI 0.40-1.66; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). Nausea occurred more often with remdesivir (RR 2.77, CI 1.28-6.03; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). TSA showed that the required information size was not reached for firm conclusions to be drawn.

One challenge is that health care professionals are at high risk of infection themselves. Therefore, in-person visits need to be reduced to an absolute minimum. Connected care solutions, including telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and secure communications between clinicians and their patients, may rapidly become the first choice in such public health emergencies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the COVID-19 Caregiver Cockpit (C19CC) was to implement a free-of-charge, web- and app-based tool for patient assessment to assist health care professionals working in the COVID-19 environment. METHODS: Physicians in Argentina, Germany, Iran, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United States explained their challenges with COVID-19 patient care through unstructured interviews. Based on the collected feedback, the first version of the C19CC was built. In the second round of interviews, the application was presented to physicians, and more feedback was obtained. RESULTS: Physicians identified a number of different scenarios where telemedicine or connected care solutions could rapidly improve patient care. These scenarios included outpatient care, discharge management, remote tracking of patients with chronic diseases, as well as incorporating infected physicians under quarantine into telehealth services. CONCLUSIONS: The C19CC is the result of an agile and iterative development process that complements the work of physicians.

Relative to the least vulnerable quintile, counties in the most vulnerable quintile had twice the rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths (rate ratios 2.11 (95% CI 1.97 to 2.26) and 2.42 (95% CI 2.22 to 2.64), respectively). Similarly, the prevalence of major chronic conditions was 24%-41% higher in the most vulnerable counties. Geographical clustering of counties with high COVID-19 mortality, high chronic disease prevalence and high social vulnerability was found, especially in southern USA. CONCLUSION: Some counties are experiencing a confluence of epidemics from COVID-19 and chronic diseases in the context of social disadvantage. Such counties are likely to require enhanced public health and social support.","Islam, Nazrul; Lacey, Ben; Shabnam, Sharmin; Erzurumluoglu, A Mesut; Dambha-Miller, Hajira; Chowell, Gerardo; Kawachi, Ichiro; Marmot, Michael",J. epidemiol. community health (1979),327,24

This research evaluates the association between mandibular symphysis dimensions and anteroposterior and vertical skeletal patterns in adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional cephalometric study included 90 lateral cephalograms of untreated subjects presenting for orthodontic treatment. The inclusion criteria were adults with lateral cephalograms showing the symphyseal region and anterior cranial base. One investigator traced and analyzed all cephalograms. Symphyseal height, thickness, and ratio between height and thickness were measured in relation to seven anteroposterior and vertical skeletal measurements in females and males. RESULTS: Symphyseal measurements were associated with SNAo (anteroposterior) in females and Gonial angle (vertical) in males. When analyzed by anteroposterior skeletal classification (ANBo), no significant differences in symphyseal dimensions were found. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that Gonion-Nerve (mm) and Gonial angle were significantly associated with symphyseal height. Gonion-Nerve (mm), basal bone width (mm), and alveolar bone height (mm) were associated with symphyseal thickness. Basal bone width (mm) and alveolar bone height (mm) were associated with symphyseal ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Symphyseal dimensions were significantly associated with vertical but not anteroposterior skeletal patterns. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the Gonion-nerve measurements concerning the symphysis in relation to vertical and anteroposterior skeletal patterns.","Marghalani, H Y A; Guan, G; Hyun, P; Tabbaa, S; Linjawi, A I; Al-Jewair, T",Folia morphol.

A month-long survey using mist netting found 13 genera comprising at least 26 species. As expected from mist net bias, virtually all the bats captured were understory phyllostomids, with few exceptions. Nonetheless, high ecological diversity was confirmed with frugivorous, nectarivorous, insectivorous and sanguivorous guilds represented. Estimates using extrapolation place the real understory diversity somewhere above 30 species, making this a key site for conservation of bats in general, and the genera Sturnira, Platyrrhinus, and Vampyressa, in particular.","M.

Several novel methods for preparing vaccine candidates are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in response to the urgent need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In many cases, these methods rely on new approaches for vaccine production and immune stimulation. We report on the use of a novel method (SolaVAX) for production of an inactivated vaccine candidate and the testing of that candidate in a hamster animal model for its ability to prevent infection upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The studies employed in this work included an evaluation of the levels of neutralizing antibody produced post-vaccination, levels of specific antibody sub-types to RBD and spike protein that were generated, evaluation of viral shedding post-challenge, flow cytometric and single cell sequencing data on cellular fractions and histopathological evaluation of tissues post-challenge. The results from this preliminary evaluation provide insight into the immunological responses occurring as a result of vaccination with the proposed vaccine candidate and the impact that adjuvant formulations, specifically developed to promote Th1 type immune responses, have on vaccine efficacy and protection against infection following challenge with live SARS-CoV-2. This data may have utility in the development of effective vaccine candidates broadly. Furthermore, the results of this preliminary evaluation suggest that preparation of a whole virion vaccine for COVID-19 using this specific photochemical method may have potential utility in the preparation of one such vaccine candidate.","Ragan, I.

One of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is a mother’s anxiety during pregnancy and the puerperium. This anxiety can put mothers at risk for postpartum mood disorders. Prevention of postpartum mood disorders can be done from the pregnancy time with preparatory education in dealing with the mothers’ roles for their babies. As an effort to maintain health protocols in this pandemic era, services to pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic can be done through online communication media. This service aims to determine the data of the risk of postpartum mood disorders or postpartum depression since pregnancy and prepare mothers to welcome their role as postpartum mothers. The service method was carried out by screening the risk of postpartum mood disorders using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and health education about the management of postpartum care for mothers and babies to the third-trimester pregnant women through online media. The results showed that six pregnant women (42.86%) had no risk of depression;seven pregnant women (50%) indicated that depression might occur, and one pregnant woman (7.14%) indicated the possibility of depression. During the counselling session, the mothers were less active in group discussions in online media and some mothers preferred private consultations. In addition, the mothers also expressed their desire to learn materials about pregnancy exercise, postpartum exercise, and lactation management during the outreach activities. From the results of screening using EPDS regarding postpartum mood disorders since pregnancy, it was found that there was a risk of depression during pregnancy and a possible risk of postpartum depression. Online health education for postpartum care management for postpartum mothers and babies as an effort to prevent postpartum mood since pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic can be done using the online method","Handayani, Dwi Sri; Purwati, Yuni; id,",Jurnal Surya Masyarakat,327,16

This study determined the longitudinal degree of hospital variation in proportion of patients with gallstone disease undergoing cholecystectomy, while adjusted for case-mix, and the effect on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A nationwide, longitudinal, database study was performed in all hospitals in the Netherlands in 2013-2015. Patients with gallstone disease were collected from the diagnosis-related group database. Hospital variation in case-mix-adjusted cholecystectomy rates was calculated per year. Clinical outcomes after cholecystectomy were compared between hospitals in the lowest/highest 20th percentile of the distribution of adjusted cholecystectomy rates in all 3 subsequent years. RESULTS: In total, 96,673 patients with gallstones were included. The cholecystectomy rate was 73.6%. In 2013-2015, the case-mix-adjusted performance of cholecystectomies was in hospitals with high rates 1.5-1.6 times higher than in hospitals with low rates. Hospitals with a high adjusted cholecystectomy rate had a higher laparoscopy rate, shorter time to surgery, and less emergency department visits after a cholecystectomy compared to hospitals with a low-adjusted cholecystectomy rate. CONCLUSION: Hospital variation in cholecystectomies in the Netherlands is modest, cholecystectomy rates varies by <2-fold, and variation is stable over time. Cholecystectomies in hospitals with high adjusted cholecystectomy rates are associated with improved outcomes.","Latenstein, Carmen S S; Wennmacker, Sarah Z; Groenewoud, Stef; Noordenbos, Mark W; Atsma, Femke; de Reuver, Philip R",Dig Surg,327,29

Combined, these factors lead to increased risk of acute and chronic illness and mental health issues. It is acknowledged that physical activity independently contributes to improved physical and mental health and may be a driver for mental well-being in carers. The aim of this pilot research was to understand how movement behaviour and health behaviours of carers of veterans in Australia relate to carers' physical and psychological well-being. Assessment occurred between February and July 2019 and included objective, validated measures to examine physical and psychological well-being. To assess the association between physical and psychological factors, correlational analyses were performed. Twenty-eight carers participated in the pilot study (96% female, mean age 61.6 years). Exercise capacity varied, and 84% of carers met the recommended 150 min of physical activity per week, with carers spending 8.6% of their time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; and 37.9% of the day sedentary. Psychological health outcomes reflect a population with high distress levels and lower than average mental well-being, but with normal resilience scores. Carers with higher levels of resilience had greater exercise capacity, covering further distance in the 6-min walk test, and as resilience increased, number of sedentary bouts decreased. This research demonstrates that there is a relationship between health behaviours and psychological well-being in carers of veterans and serving personnel. Based on the findings of this pilot study, programmes to support family carers should include information about physical activity, reducing sedentary time, and increasing resilience. Interventions designed to improve physical and psychological well-being should be trialled and evaluated for effectiveness.","Post, Dannielle; van Agteren, Joep; Kasai, Daiki; Barrett, Alison; Doyle, Matthew; Kernot, Jocelyn; Baker, Amy; Parfitt, Gaynor",Heal. soc. care community,327,28

The study found that the pandemic did not affect all groups of society uniformly, rather the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as economic status and family institutions. The lower socioeconomic class is the worst affected as the pandemic made them unemployed, leading them to an uncertain future. Despite such variations, the general population has experienced a subsequent increase in workload, and challenges in using routine health facilities that increased behavioural changes, higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and suicides.","Ahmed, Faria; Sifat, Ridwan Islam",Int. j. health plann. manage,327,11

Concerns exist regarding the risk of infections and drug-related toxicities. We sought to evaluate the incidence of these TCZ complications among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All adult inpatients with COVID-19 between 1 March and 25 April 2020 that received TCZ were included. We compared the rate of late-onset infections (>48 hours following admission) to a control group matched according to intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation requirement. Post-TCZ toxicities evaluated included: elevated liver function tests (LFTs), GI perforation, diverticulitis, neutropenia, hypertension, allergic reactions, and infusion-related reactions. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients were included in each group. Seventeen infections in the TCZ group (23%) and 6 (8%) infections in the control group occurred >48 hours after admission (P = .013). Most infections were bacterial with pneumonia being the most common manifestation. Among patients receiving TCZ, LFT elevations were observed in 51%, neutropenia in 1.4%, and hypertension in 8%. The mortality rate among those that received TCZ was greater than the control (39% versus 23%, P = .03). CONCLUSION: Late onset infections were significantly more common among those receiving TCZ. Combining infections and TCZ-related toxicities, 61% of patients had a possible post-TCZ complication. While awaiting clinical trial results to establish the efficacy of TCZ for COVID-19 related CRS, the potential for infections and TCZ related toxicities should be carefully weighed when considering use.","Pettit, Natasha N; Nguyen, Cynthia T; Mutlu, Gökhan M; Wu, David; Kimmig, Lucas; Pitrak, David; Pursell, Kenneth",J. med. virol,327,23

With the expanding domain of presentations in COVID-19 patients, the full range of manifestations is yet to unfold. The classical clinical symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 affected patients are dry cough, high fever, dyspnoea, lethal pneumonia whereas many patients have also been found to be associated with a few additional signs and clinical manifestations of isolated vasculopathy. Albeit a deep and profound knowledge has been gained on the clinical features and management of COVID-19, less clear association has been provided on SARS-CoV-2 mediated direct or indirect vasculopathy and its possible correlation with disease prognosis. The accumulative evidences suggest that novel coronavirus, apart from its primary respiratory confinement, may also invade vascular endothelial cells of several systems including cerebral, cardio-pulmonary as well as renal microvasculature, modulating multiple visceral perfusion indices. Here we analyse the phylogenetic perspective of SARS-CoV-2 along with other strains of ß-coronaviridae from a standpoint of vasculopathic derangements. Based on the existing case reports, literature and open data bases, we also analyse the differential pattern of vasculopathy related changes in COVID-19 positive patients. Besides, we debate the need of modulation in clinical approach from a hemodynamical point of view, as a measure towards reducing disease transmission, morbidity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 affected patients.","Mondal, Ritwick; Lahiri, Durjoy; Deb, Shramana; Bandyopadhyay, Deebya; Shome, Gourav; Sarkar, Sukanya; Paria, Sudeb R; Thakurta, Tirthankar Guha; Singla, Pratibha; Biswas, Subhash C",J Thromb Thrombolysis,327,20

For those working in technical and professional communication, the Zoom example illustrates not only a way to communicate in an emergency but also a way that privacy can cause a crisis in the first place. Drawing from literature on crisis communication and the experiences users described in the Zoom CEO’s blog post, the author concludes that while Zoom did indeed have technical issues that contributed to its privacy crisis, users also experienced its technology in unexpected ways, and the company underestimated the privacy expectations of its new users. Zoom’s privacy crisis ultimately provides a useful discussion of why it is increasingly important for companies to incorporate privacy by design and to be frank about their privacy practices with a public who has a growing interest in, and dissatisfaction with, corporate privacy practices.","Young, Sarah",J.

These gradient copolymers have been studied by H NMR and size exclusion chromatography to characterize the gradient composition molecular structure. The evolution of the composition was correlated with the glass transition temperature () of the copolymers. The gradient copolymers exhibit one with a value in between the of polystyrene and poly(butyl acrylate), indicating that the materials did not present well defined microphase separation. Specific organization at the air-polymer interface of such copolymers has also been demonstrated by comparison between classical and attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infra-red spectra. This bulk soft matter assembly was confirmed by AFM analysis, which showed a different morphology at the surface and in the bulk following removal of the top layer.

Nevertheless, their antiviral activity may also have detrimental effects on the host. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the antiviral activity of restriction factors are frequently well investigated, potential undesired effects of their antiviral functions on the host cell are hardly explored.

In MOTTD columns, the flow channels are straight, parallel, cylindrical tubes arranged in a hexagonal compact array. A mesoporous material or stationary phase (130 Å bridged-ethyl hybrid (BEH) silica support) is filling the volume between the flow channels. The model is based on Giddings' random-walk theory of non-equilibrium chromatography. It is calibrated for the unknown configuration factor, qs, related to the specific geometry of the stationary phase in MOTTD columns. qs values are found based on the best fit of the model to simulated dispersion data obtained by the lattice-Boltzmann method for modelling fluid flow and a random-walk particle-tracking technique to address advective-diffusive transport of the analytes. For the model calibration, simulations are performed for different ratios, &#961;, of the average inner diameter of the flow channels to their closest center-to-center distance under retained and non-retained conditions. The model is successfully validated (average relative errors below 10%) under both retained and non-retained conditions. For the same column format (4.6 mm i.d. × 150 mm), external porosity, zone retention factor, and relative standard deviation of the distribution of the inner diameters of the flow channels, the derived model reveals the intrinsic advantage of MOTTD columns (center-to-center distance between flow channels of 5 µm and &#961; = 0.62) over a conventional column packed with 5 µm 130 Å BEH silica particles and the same multiple porous-layer open-tubular column (MPLOT) disabling transverse dispersion. MOTTD columns are weakly affected by the polydispersity of the inner diameter of the flow channels. Provided MOTTD columns could be prepared at a small feature size of 5 µm or less, they are expected to deliver a significant improvement in column technology relative to current particulate and silica monolithic columns.","Gritti, Fabrice; Hlushkou, Dzmitry; Tallarek, Ulrich",J Chromatogr A,327,16

Methods: A recently developed PBPK model was employed. Nine virtual patients (i.e. individualized PBPK models) were used to perform simulations of pharmacokinetics for different combinations of perfusion (0.001-0.1 mL/g/min) and receptor density (1-100 nmol/L). The TCP for each combination was determined for three different treatment strategies: 1) for a standard treatment (4 cycles of 7.4 GBq and 105 nmol), 2) maximizing the number of cycles based on BEDmax for red marrow and kidneys and 3) for 4 cycles with optimized ligand amount and activity. The red marrow and the kidneys (BEDmax of 2 Gy15 and 40 Gy2.5, respectively) were assumed to be OARs. Additionally, the influence of varying glomerular filtration rates, kidney somatostatin receptor densities, tumor volumes and release rates was investigated. Results: To achieve a TCP &#8805;99% in the standard treatment, a minimal tumor perfusion of 0.036±0.023 mL/g/min and receptor density of 34±20 nmol/L were determined for the nine virtual patients. With the optimization of the number of cycles, the minimum values of perfusion and receptor density were considerably lower with 0.022±0.012 mL/g/min and 21±11 nmol/L, respectively. However, even better results (perfusion = 0.018±0.009 mL/g/min and receptor density = 18±10 nmol/L) were obtained for strategy 3. The release rate of 177Lu (or labelled metabolites) from the cells had the strongest effect on the minimal perfusion and receptor density for standard and optimized treatments. Conclusion: PBPK modeling and simulations represent an elegant approach to individually determine the minimal tumor perfusion and minimal receptor density required to achieve an adequate TCP. This computational method can be employed in the radiopharmaceutical development process for ligand and target selection for specific types of tumors. In addition, this method could be used to optimize clinical trials.","Jiménez-Franco, Luis David; Glatting, Gerhard; Prasad, Vikas; Weber, Wolfgang Andreas; Beer, Ambros J; Kletting, Peter",J. nucl. med,327,24

Both Hong Kong and Singapore have a 2-tiered health system with the majority of primary care provided in the private sector. The primary care system in Beijing consists of community health facilities, township health centers, and village clinics. The role of primary care in Hong Kong includes using the public primary care clinics as part of an enhanced surveillance program together with accident and emergency departments, as well as triaging patients with suspected infection to hospitals. Singapore's response to COVID-19 has included close cooperation between redeveloped polyclinics and private and public health preparedness clinics to provide screening with swab tests for suspected cases in the primary care setting. Beijing's unique response has consisted of using online platforms for general practitioners to facilitate monitoring among community residents, as well as public health education and a mobilized pharmacy refill program to reduce risk of transmission. Established challenges, however, include shortages of personal protective equipment and the heavy workload for health care staff. Regardless, all 3 cities have demonstrated enhanced preparedness since experiencing the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, and the responses of their primary care systems therefore may offer learning points for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wong, Samuel Y S; Tan, David H Y; Zhang, Yun; Ramiah, Anbumalar; Zeng, Xuejun; Hui, Eric; Young, Doris Y L",Ann Fam Med,327,21

A random effects model meta-analysis was used, and I2 was utilized to assess the heterogeneity. In-hospital mortality was defined as the endpoint. Sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: A total of 18,506 patients were included in this meta-analysis (3713 diabetics and 14,793 non-diabetics). Patients with diabetes were associated with a higher risk of death compared with patients without diabetes (OR 1.65; 95% CI 1.35-1.96; I2 77.4%). The heterogeneity was high. A study-level meta-regression analysis was performed for all the important covariates, and no significant interactions were found between the covariates and the outcome of mortality. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis shows that that the likelihood of death seems to be higher in diabetic patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with non-diabetic patients.

METHODS: All EMS missions in the Northern Ostrobothnia region, Finland (population 295 500) between 1 March to 30 June 2020 were screened and analyzed as the study group. A control group was composed from the EMS calls between the corresponding months in the years 2016-2019. RESULTS: A total of 74 576 EMS missions were screened for the study. Within the first two months after the first COVID-19 cases in the study area, the decline in the number of EMS missions was 5.7% - 13% compared to the control group average. EMS time intervals (emergency call to dispatch, dispatch, en-route, on-scene and hospital handover) prolonged in the COVID-19 period. Dispatches concerning mental health problems increased most in the study period (+1.2%, p < 0.001). Only eleven confirmed COVID-19 infections were encountered by EMS in the study period. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the present COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions lead to changes in the EMS usage. These preliminary findings emphasize the importance of developing new strategies and protocols in response to the oncoming pandemic waves.","Laukkanen, Lauri; Lahtinen, Sanna; Liisanantti, Janne; Kaakinen, Timo; Ehrola, Ari; Raatiniemi, Lasse",Eur. j. public health,327,24

The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton (1H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze-thaw cycles, sample storage at -80 °C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 °C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 °C for up to 48 h, freezing at -80 °C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 °C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 °C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable. We also present several simple blood sample handling recommendations for optimal NMR-based biomarker discovery investigations in SARS CoV-2 studies and general clinical biomarker research.","Loo, Ruey Leng; Lodge, Samantha; Kimhofer, Torben; Bong, Sze-How; Begum, Sofina; Whiley, Luke; Gray, Nicola; Lindon, John C; Nitschke, Philipp; Lawler, Nathan G; Schäfer, Hartmut; Spraul, Manfred; Richards, Toby; Nicholson, Jeremy K; Holmes, Elaine",,327,22

METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-five patients with DFI were admitted in a tertiary care center from January 2019 to December 2020. Antibiotic resistance was evaluated by microbiological examination of soft tissues' or bone's biopsy. RESULTS: Compared with 2019 group (n = 105), 2020 group (n = 120) had a significantly higher prevalence of antibiotic resistance [2019 vs 2020, 36% vs 63%, P <0.001] and more often was admitted with recent or current antibiotic therapy (18% vs 52%, P <0.001), which was frequently self-administered (5% vs 30%, P = 0.032).

The resulting modelling approach is close to the Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered model framework. We focused on predicting the peaks (time and size) in positive cases, active cases and new infections. We applied the approach to data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy.

Acute respiratory complications that require intensive care unit (ICU) management are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Among other important risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes, obesity has emerged along with undernutrition-malnutrition as a strong predictor of disease risk and severity. Obesity-related excessive body fat may lead to respiratory, metabolic and immune derangements potentially favoring the onset of COVID-19 complications. In addition, patients with obesity may be at risk for loss of skeletal muscle mass, reflecting a state of hidden malnutrition with a strong negative health impact in all clinical settings. Also importantly, obesity is commonly associated with micronutrient deficiencies that directly influence immune function and infection risk. Finally, the pandemic-related lockdown, deleterious lifestyle changes and other numerous psychosocial consequences may worsen eating behaviors, sedentarity, body weight regulation, ultimately leading to further increments of obesity-associated metabolic complications with loss of skeletal muscle mass and higher non-communicable disease risk. Therefore, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies should be routinely included in the management of COVID-19 patients in the presence of obesity; lockdown-induced health risks should also be specifically monitored and prevented in this population. In the current document, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) aims at providing clinical practice guidance for nutritional management of COVID-19 patients with obesity in various clinical settings.","Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C; Busetto, Luca; Cederholm, Tommy; Chourdakis, Michael; Cuerda, Cristina; Delzenne, Nathalie; Genton, Laurence; Schneider, Stephane; Singer, Pierre; Boirie, Yves",Clin. nutr.

Although APA disruption has been associated with FoG, there is scarce knowledge about its neural correlates. We sought to better understand the neural networks involved with APA in patients with FoG by assessing the level of hemodynamic response of specific brain regions and the functional connectivity during the leg lifting task. In the current investigation, APAs of patients with PD, with and without (nFoG) freezing were assessed during a leg lifting task in an event-related, functional magnetic resonance imaging (er-fMRI) protocol. Results identified a high hemodynamic response in the right anterior insula (AI) and supplementary motor area (SMA) in the FoG group when an APA was required. The nFoG had stronger connectivity between the right and left insulae than the FoG group. The strength of this connectivity was negatively correlated with the severity of FoG. Both groups showed different brain network organizations comprising the SMA and the bilateral AI. The SMA was found to be a hub in patients with FoG when an APA was required for the task. Our findings suggest that both groups used compensatory mechanism comprising the insulae during APA. Neither group used the entire network comprised of the insulae and SMA to accomplish the task. The FoG group relied more on SMA as a hub than as part of a broader network to exchange information during the APA.","de Lima-Pardini, Andrea C; Coelho, Daniel B; Nucci, Mariana P; Boffino, Catarina C; Batista, Alana X; de Azevedo Neto, Raymundo M; Silva-Batista, Carla; Barbosa, Egberto R; Cohen, Rajal G; Horak, Fay B; Teixeira, Luis A; Amaro, Edson",Neuroimage Clin,327,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyse ACE2 expression in salivary glands, bulk RNA-seq profiles from four public datasets including 31 COVID-19 patients were recruited. Saliva and oropharyngeal swabs were collected. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in saliva were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, a questionnaire survey on various oral symptoms such as dry mouth and amblygeustia was also carried out on COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: ACE2 expression was present at detectable levels in the salivary glands. In addition, of four cases with positive detection of salivary SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, three (75%) were critically ill on ventilator support. Furthermore, we observed the two major oral-related symptoms, dry mouth (46.3%) and amblygeustia (47.2%), were manifested by a relatively high proportion of 108 COVID-19 patients who accepted the questionnaire survey. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the expression of ACE2 in the salivary glands and demonstrates the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection of salivary glands. Saliva may be a new source of diagnostic specimens for critically ill patients, since it can be easily collected without any invasive procedures. In addition, dry mouth and amblygeustia can be considered as initial symptoms of COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Lili; Zhao, Jiajia; Peng, Jinfeng; Li, Xiaoshuang; Deng, Xuliang; Geng, Zhi; Shen, Zhenyu; Guo, Fengyuan; Zhang, Qianwen; Jin, Yang; Wang, Lin; Wang, Songlin",Cell Prolif,327,33

This study aimed to explore the perceived stress and its relation to the duration of dealing with COVID-19 patients in medical doctors. METHODS: The doctors who work in different medical settings in Iraqi Kurdistan during coronavirus outbreak were invited into this cross-sectional study. The doctors were invited from one pediatric, one emergency, one special corona, and one maternity and gynecology hospital. The ""Perceived Stress Scale -10 (PSS)"" measured the perceived degree of a doctor who experienced stress. The information was collected through a web-based technique to avoid the disease spread. RESULTS: Doctors' mean duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19 was 1.2 (Range: 0-16 days). The mean stress score was 18.81 out of 40. Most of the doctors had a moderate level of stress (69.4%), followed by a low (21.1%) and a high level of stress (9.6%). The general physicians and medical lab specialties had higher stress scores; 21.56 and 19.88, respectively. The high level of stress was among general physicians and community and family medicine doctors; 20.0% and 25.0%, respectively. Whether or not doctors dealt with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19, did not have a significant difference over the perceived stress score; 19.02 vs. 18.87; P=0.786). The mean score of stress was raised with increasing duration of dealing with suspected/confirmed cases of COVID-19; r=0.202; P=0.004 and decreased with increasing age (r=-0.141; P=0.045), and clinical experience (r=-0.139, P=0.048).

We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 3 years) and remaining life-years (12.3 years per death), which for one million deaths can be valued at six to 10 trillion dollars. The age-patterns of Covid-19 mortality observed in other countries are remarkably similar and exhibit the typical rate of increase by age of normal mortality. The scenario of one million Covid-19 deaths is similar in scale to the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than the Spanish Flu of 1918.

CONCLUSIONS: There was a large and quick response on ClinicalTrials.gov to the COVID-19 outbreak. Many of the registered trials are currently recruiting new patients, whereas some will begin in the near future. Specific potential experimental therapies, including dosing and monitoring, might be found by reviewing content. Within ClinicalTrials.gov, patients, family members, health care professionals, and researchers can search and find ongoing and future trials for COVID-19.","Mousa, Albeir Y; Broce, Mike; Lucas, B Daniel",J. vasc. surg,327,32

Methods: he multicentre (six European study sites) Prospective Validation of a Proteomic Urine Test for Early and Accurate Prognosis of Critical Course Complications in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Study (Crit-COV-U) is recruiting consecutive patients (&#8805; 18 years) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. A urinary proteomic biomarker (COV50) developed by capillary-electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) technology, comprising 50 sequenced peptides and identifying the parental proteins, was evaluated in 228 patients (derivation cohort) with replication in 99 patients (validation cohort). Death and progression along the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale were assessed up to 21 days after the initial PCR test. Statistical methods included logistic regression, receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and comparison of the area under the curve (AUC). Findings: in the derivation cohort, 23 patients died, and 48 developed worse WHO scores. The odds ratios (OR) for death per 1 standard deviation (SD) increment in COV50 were 3·52 (95% CI, 2·02-6·13, p <0·0001) unadjusted and 2·73 (1·25-5·95, p = 0·012) adjusted for sex, age, baseline WHO score, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities. For WHO scale progression, the corresponding OR were 2·63 (1·80-3·85, p<0·0001) and 3·38 (1·85-6·17, p<0·0001), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) for COV50 as a continuously distributed variable was 0·80 (0·72-0·88) for mortality and 0·74 (0·66-0·81) for worsening WHO score. The optimised COV50 thresholds for mortality and worsening WHO score were 0·47 and 0·04 with sensitivity/specificity of 87·0 (74·6%) and 77·1 (63·9%), respectively. On top of covariates, COV50 improved the AUC, albeit borderline for death, from 0·78 to 0·82 (p = 0·11) and 0·84 (p = 0·052) for mortality and from 0·68 to 0·78 (p = 0·0097) and 0·75 (p = 0·021) for worsening WHO score. The validation cohort findings were confirmatory. Interpretation: this first CRIT-COV-U report proves the concept that urinary proteomic profiling generates biomarkers indicating adverse COVID-19 outcomes, even at an early disease stage, including WHO stages 1-3. These findings need to be consolidated in an upcoming final dataset.","Wendt, Ralph; Thijs, Lutgarde; Kalbitz, Sven; Mischak, Harald; Siwy, Justyna; Raad, Julia; Metzger, Jochen; Neuhaus, Barbara; Leyen, Heiko von der; Dudoignon, Emmanuel; Mebazaa, Alexandre; Spasovski, Goce; Milenkova, Mimoza; Canevska-Talevska, Aleksandra; Czerwienska, Beata; Wiecek, Andrzej; Peters, Björn; Nilsson, Åsa; Schwab, Matthias; Rothfuss, Katja; Lübbert, Christoph; Staessen, Jan A; Beige, Joachim",EClinicalMedicine,327,22

This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently, treating COVID-19 patients, particularly those afflicted with severe pneumonia, is challenging as no specific drugs or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are available. Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking. Additional studies in a larger cohort of patients are needed to validate this therapeutic intervention further, however.","Shetty, Ashok K.",Aging Dis.,327,1

The primary diagnostic tool currently employed is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which can have good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Unfortunately, implementation costs and logistical problems with reagents during the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have hindered its universal on demand adoption. Lateral flow assays (LFAs) represent a class of diagnostic that, if sufficiently clinically sensitive, may fill many of the gaps in the current RT-PCR testing regime, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). To date, many serology LFAs have been developed, though none meet the performance requirements necessary for diagnostic use cases, primarily due to the relatively long delay between infection and seroconversion. However, on the basis of previously reported results from SARS-CoV-1, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 assays may have significantly better clinical sensitivity than serology assays. To date, only a very small number of antigen-detecting LFAs have been developed. Development of a half-strip LFA is a useful first step in the development of any LFA format. In this work, we present a half-strip LFA using commercially available antibodies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested this LFA in buffer and measured an LOD of 0.65 ng/mL (95% CI of 0.53 to 0.77 ng/mL) ng/mL with recombinant antigen using an optical reader with sensitivity equivalent to a visual read. Further development, including evaluating the appropriate sample matrix, will be required for this assay approach to be made useful in a point of care setting, though this half-strip LFA may serve as a useful starting point for others developing similar tests.","Grant, Benjamin D; Anderson, Caitlin E; Williford, John R; Alonzo, Luis F; Glukhova, Veronika A; Boyle, David S; Weigl, Bernhard H; Nichols, Kevin P",Anal Chem,327,29

Here, we present the rationale and design of a large, international trial that combines features of adaptive platform trials with pragmatic point-of-care trials to determine best treatment strategies for patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe community-acquired pneumonia. The trial uses a novel design, entitled ""a randomized embedded multifactorial adaptive platform."" The design has five key features: 1) randomization, allowing robust causal inference; 2) embedding of study procedures into routine care processes, facilitating enrollment, trial efficiency, and generalizability; 3) a multifactorial statistical model comparing multiple interventions across multiple patient subgroups; 4) response-adaptive randomization with preferential assignment to those interventions that appear most favorable; and 5) a platform structured to permit continuous, potentially perpetual enrollment beyond the evaluation of the initial treatments. The trial randomizes patients to multiple interventions within four treatment domains: antibiotics, antiviral therapy for influenza, host immunomodulation with extended macrolide therapy, and alternative corticosteroid regimens, representing 240 treatment regimens. The trial generates estimates of superiority, inferiority, and equivalence between regimens on the primary outcome of 90-day mortality, stratified by presence or absence of concomitant shock and proven or suspected influenza infection. The trial will also compare ventilatory and oxygenation strategies, and has capacity to address additional questions rapidly during pandemic respiratory infections. As of January 2020, REMAP-CAP (Randomized Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform for Community-acquired Pneumonia) was approved and enrolling patients in 52 intensive care units in 13 countries on 3 continents.

We propose here a two-step bias-reduced estimation methodology called GARCH-UGH (Unbiased Gomes-de Haan), whereby financial returns are first filtered using an AR-GARCH model, and then a bias-reduced estimator of extreme quantiles is applied to the standardized residuals to estimate one-step ahead dynamic extreme VaR. Our results indicate that the GARCH-UGH estimates are more accurate than those obtained by combining conventional AR-GARCH filtering and extreme value estimates from the perspective of in-sample and out-of-sample backtestings of historical daily returns on several financial time series.","Kaibuchi, Hibiki; Kawasaki, Yoshinori; Stupfler, Gilles",,327,0

This review considers the empirical literature to date on using videoconferencing to deliver psychological therapy to adults presenting with mental health problems. METHOD: Papers were identified via search of relevant databases. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted and synthesized on uptake, feasibility, outcomes, and participant and therapist experiences. RESULTS: Videoconferencing has an established evidence base in the delivery of cognitive behavioural therapies for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, with prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation non-inferior to in-person delivery. There are large trials reporting efficacy for health anxiety and bulimia nervosa compared with treatment-as-usual. Initial studies show applicability of cognitive behavioural therapies for other anxiety and eating disorders and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders, but there has yet to be study of use in severe and complex mental health problems. Therapists may find it more difficult to judge non-verbal behaviour, and there may be initial discomfort while adapting to videoconferencing, but client ratings of the therapeutic alliance are similar to in-person therapy, and videoconferencing may have advantages such as being less confronting. There may be useful opportunities for videoconferencing in embedding therapy delivery within the client's own environment. CONCLUSIONS: Videoconferencing is an accessible and effective modality for therapy delivery. Future research needs to extend beyond testing whether videoconferencing can replicate in-person therapy delivery to consider unique therapeutic affordances of the videoconferencing modality. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Videoconferencing is an efficacious means of delivering behavioural and cognitive therapies to adults with mental health problems. Trial evidence has established it is no less efficacious than in-person therapy for prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and behavioural activation. While therapists report nonverbal feedback being harder to judge, and clients can take time to adapt to videoconferencing, clients rate the therapeutic alliance and satisfaction similarly to therapy in-person. Videoconferencing provides opportunities to integrate therapeutic exercises within the person's day-to-day environment.","Thomas, Neil; McDonald, Caity; de Boer, Kathleen; Brand, Rachel M; Nedeljkovic, Maja; Seabrook, Liz",Psychol. psychother,327,26

Managing the competitive/cooperative nature of the interactions is crucial for applications in which we wish to control physical aspects of the cycling behavior (e.g. heart rate and breathing rate).

Identifying such species is thus a key component of predicting and possibly mitigating future epidemics. Despite this importance, intermediate host species have not been investigated in much detail, and have generally only been identified by testing for the presence of pathogens in multiple candidate species. In this paper, we present a mathematical model able to identify likely intermediate host species for emerging zoonoses based on ecological data for the candidates and epidemiological data for the pathogen. Since coronaviruses frequently emerge through intermediate host species and, at the time of writing, pose an urgent pandemic threat, we apply the model to the three emerging coronaviruses of the twenty-first century, accurately predicting palm civets as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-1 and dromedary camels as intermediate hosts for MERS. Further, we suggest mink, pangolins, and ferrets as intermediate host species for SARS-CoV-2. With the capacity to evaluate intermediate host likelihood among different species, researchers can focus testing for possible infection sources and interventions more effectively.","Royce, Katherine",J Theor Biol,327,16

Participants were 1175 children of the population-based birth cohort Generation XXI, who provided food diaries and complete data on socio-demographic variables, anthropometric measures, and the Portuguese Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (P-CEBQ). Foods were grouped according to NOVA classification into: ""unprocessed, minimally or moderately processed, and culinary preparations""; ""processed""; ""ultra-processed"". To assess tracking of groups' consumption, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) were calculated. Generalized linear models were fitted to test main associations, mediators, and interactions among the variables. Ultra-processed consumption exhibited a fair level of stability between ages 4 and 7 (r=0.34; ICC=0.32; 95%CI: 0.25; 0.39), corresponding respectively to 27.3% (449.8 kcal per day; SD=217.2) and 29.3% (526.9 kcal per day; SD=229.7) of total energy intake. After adjusting for maternal and child characteristics, higher ultra-processed consumption at 4 years was associated directly with 'Food Responsiveness' (ßÌ = 0.019; 95%CI: 0.007; 0.037), and indirectly through energy intake with avoidant traits: 'Food Fussiness' (ßÌ = -0.007; 95% CI: 0.002; 0.012) and 'Satiety Responsiveness' (ßÌ = -0.007; 95% CI: 0.003; 0.012). Ultra-processed consumption at 4 years old was associated with BMI at 10 years old, but appetitive behaviours were not powerful mediators of this association. The results suggest a path by which ultra-processed products may impact on later appetitive traits and higher BMI in children.","Vedovato, Gabriela Milhassi; Vilela, Sofia; Severo, Milton; Rodrigues, Sara; Lopes, Carla; Oliveira, Andreia",Br J Nutr,327,13

METHODS: A cross-sectional seroprevalence study with prospective recruitment of volunteer families that included at least one first-reported adult case positive by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and at least one child aged less than 15 years living in the same household under strict home confinement was conducted in the Health Region of metropolitan Barcelona (Spain) during the pandemic period April 28-June 3, 2020. All household members were tested at home by a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay in finger-prick obtained capillary blood. RESULTS: A total of 381 family households including 381 first-reported PCR-positive adult cases and 1,084 contacts (672 children, 412 adults) were enrolled. SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence rates were 17.6% (118/672) in children and 18.7% (77/335) in adult contacts (p=0.64). Among first-reported cases, seropositivity rates varied from 84.0% in adults previously hospitalized and tested within 6 weeks since the first positive PCR result to 31.5% in those not hospitalized and tested after that lag time (p<0.001). Nearly all (99.9%) positive pediatric contacts were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: Children appear to have similar probability as adults to become infected by SARS-CoV-2 in quarantined family households but remain largely asymptomatic once infected. Adult antibody protection against SARS-CoV-2 seems to be weak at early convalescence and beyond 6 weeks post-infection confirmation, especially in cases that have experienced mild disease.","Brotons, Pedro; Launes, Cristian; Buetas, Elena; Fumado, Vicky; Henares, Desiree; de Sevilla, Mariona Fernandez; Redin, Alba; Fuente-Soro, Laura; Cuadras, Daniel; Mele, Maria; Jou, Cristina; Millat, Pere; Jordan, Iolanda; Garcia-Garcia, Juan Jose; Bassat, Quique; Muñoz-Almagro, Carmen",Clin. infect. dis,327,16

To support the current combat against the disease, this research aims to propose a machine learning-based pipeline to detect COVID-19 infection using lung computed tomography scan images (CTI). This implemented pipeline consists of a number of sub-procedures ranging from segmenting the COVID-19 infection to classifying the segmented regions. The initial part of the pipeline implements the segmentation of the COVID-19-affected CTI using social group optimization-based Kapur's entropy thresholding, followed by k-means clustering and morphology-based segmentation. The next part of the pipeline implements feature extraction, selection, and fusion to classify the infection. Principle component analysis-based serial fusion technique is used in fusing the features and the fused feature vector is then employed to train, test, and validate four different classifiers namely Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function, and Decision Tree. Experimental results using benchmark datasets show a high accuracy (> 91%) for the morphology-based segmentation task; for the classification task, the KNN offers the highest accuracy among the compared classifiers (> 87%). However, this should be noted that this method still awaits clinical validation, and therefore should not be used to clinically diagnose ongoing COVID-19 infection.","Dey, Nilanjan; Rajinikanth, V; Fong, Simon James; Kaiser, M Shamim; Mahmud, Mufti",Cognit Comput,327,16

We investigated the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms 5 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a control cohort. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 183 controls responded to an online questionnaire about symptoms and signs during the acute phase of the infection and after 4.8 ± 0.3 months. Presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, anxiety, and depression were recorded with standardized questionnaires. Stool form and presence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also recorded. Any association between exposure to infection and symptoms was evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted RR values and score differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). KEY RESULTS: Fever, dyspnea, loss of smell/taste/weight, diarrhea, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia were reported by more than 40% of patients during the acute phase. Compared with controls, adjusted RRs for loose stools, chronic fatigue, and somatization were increased after infection: 1.88 (95% CI 0.99-3.54), 2.24 (95% CI 1.48-3.37), and 3.62 (95% CI 1.01-6.23), respectively. Gastrointestinal sequelae were greater in patients with diarrhea during the acute phase. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Mild gastroenterological symptoms persist 5 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular in patients reporting diarrhea in the acute phase. Infected patients are at increased risk of chronic fatigue and somatoform disorders, thus supporting the hypothesis that both functional gastrointestinal and somatoform disorders may have a common biological origin.","Noviello, Daniele; Costantino, Andrea; Muscatello, Antonio; Bandera, Alessandra; Consonni, Dario; Vecchi, Maurizio; Basilisco, Guido",Neurogastroenterol Motil,327,10

This is quite similar to that observed in the autoimmune and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was hypothesized that RA patients are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19; however, recent studies reported that they are not when compared to the rest of the population. In this review, we aim to highlight the mutual pathological features, cytokine profiles and risk factors between COVID-19 and RA. Also, many researchers are currently working to explore therapeutic agents that could aid in the eradication of COVID-19 infection. Due to the similarity between the inflammation status in COVID-19 and RA, many anti-rheumatic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, baricitinib and anakinra were proposed to be therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 infection.","Elemam, Noha Mousaad; Maghazachi, Azzam A; Hannawi, Suad",Curr Med Res Opin,327,29

Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, has been administered for decades in many countries against tuberculosis. Today, when a solution against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed, the BCG vaccine has again come into the limelight owing to its earlier prevention of non-specific diseases. Data suggest a higher mortality rate of COVID-19 in non-BCG vaccinated countries, whereas the nations opting for BCG immunization have a comparatively lower mortality rate. The BCG vaccine is known to induce ‘trained immunity’ and generate ‘non-specific’ heterologous immune responses. It can confer anti-viral immunity by eliciting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-1β. Though the initial results look promising, a long trail still needs to be followed to avoid false promises. The accuracy of nationwide data, the role of an already activated immune system against ‘cytokine storms’, optimization and timing of vaccine dosage, and balancing demand-supply are some of the relevant issues that must be resolved before reaching a final conclusion.","Kamat, Siya; Kumari, Madhuree",Front.

COVID-19 infection has been observed with a high mortality rate especially in patients undergoing maintenance haemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients over 18 years of age, who underwent a maintenance haemodialysis program at our unit, and being tested positive for COVID-19 by PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs and/or were observed to have disease-related signs in their CTs were included in the study. RESULTS: In this study, 23 of 42 patients receiving haemodialysis support in our clinic were included. The median age was 67 years (min 35; max 91 years) and all of them had primary hypertension and other comorbidities. Their clinical evaluation showed that dry cough (47.8%) and shortness of breath (47.8%) were the most common symptoms. Fever was less pronounced (30.4%). The median time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 1 day (min 0; max ) and time from hospitalization to death was 18 days (min:1; max 22). Transfer from the inpatient ward to ICU took a median of 7 days (min 1; max 13). Among the 23 patients, three died during the follow-up and 20 were discharged with full recovery. Baseline ferritin, procalcitonin levels and CRP/albumin rates higher and neutrophil/lymphocyte levels lower in patient who died. In these patients, despite being non-significant, there were more diabetic patients and D-dimer levels were higher than 1000 ugFEU/L. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection is associated with increased mortalit in chronic kidney diseases patients.

Indeed, COVID19 increases the risk of cardiovascular occlusive/thrombotic events and is linked to poor outcomes. The pathophysiological processes underlying COVID19-induced thrombosis are complex, and remain poorly understood. To this end, platelets play important roles in regulating our cardiovascular system, including via contributions to coagulation and inflammation. There is an ample of evidence that circulating platelets are activated in COVID19 patients, which is a primary driver of the thrombotic outcome observed in these patients. However, the comprehensive molecular basis of platelet activation in COVID19 disease remains elusive, which warrants more investigation. Hence, we employed gene co-expression network analysis combined with pathways enrichment analysis to further investigate the aforementioned issues. Our study revealed three important gene clusters/modules that were closely related to COVID19. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that these three modules were mostly related to platelet metabolism, protein translation, mitochondrial activity, and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation, and apoptosis, suggesting a hyperactivation status of platelets in COVID19. We identified the three hub genes from each of three key modules according to their intramodular connectivity value ranking, namely: COPE, CDC37, CAPNS1, AURKAIP1, LAMTOR2, GABARAP MT-ND1, MT-ND5, and MTRNR2L12.

We explored changes in children's daily life and effects on their mental health during school closures. METHODS: Participants included elementary and junior high school students 9 years of age and older seen in the outpatient clinic during school closures and were required to complete the Japanese version of WHO Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5-J). The results were compared with those of students seen after schools reopened. RESULTS: Participants included 78 students in the school closure group and 113 in the school reopening group.

Conversely, a sedentary lifestyle-associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders-negatively impacts on general health status, including susceptibility to infections. At a time of a pandemic SARS-CoV2 infection, and in the context of the multiorgan crosstalk (widely accepted as a mechanism participating in the pathophysiology of all organs and systems), we examine the complex interplay mediated by skeletal muscle contraction involving the immune system and how this contributes to control health status and to counteract viral infections. In so doing, we review the molecular mechanisms and expression of molecules modulated by PA, able to provide the proper molecular equipment against viral infections such as the current SARS-CoV2. METHODS: A critical review of the literature was performed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and mediators induced by PA that potentially impact on viral infections such as SARS-CoV2. RESULTS: We showed the effects mediated by regular moderate PA on viral adverse effects through the regulation of biological processes involving the crosstalk between skeletal muscle, the immune system and adipose tissue. Evidence was provided of the effects mediated by modulation of the expression of inflammation markers. CONCLUSION: A tigth association between PA and reduction in inflammation status allows effective counteracting of SARS-CoV2 infection.

It is widely accepted that an active lifestyle contributes to the improvement of general health and preservation of cardiovascular, respiratory, osteo-muscular and immune system capacities. The positive effects of regular physical activity on the immune system have emerged as a pivotal trigger of general health, underlying the beneficial effects of physical activity on multiple physiological systems. Accordingly, recent studies have already pointed out the negative impact of physical inactivity caused by the social isolation imposed by the public sanitary authorities due to COVID-19. Nevertheless, there are still no current narrative reviews evaluating the real impact of COVID-19 on active lifestyle or even discussing the possible beneficial effects of exercise-promoted immune upgrade against the severity or progression of COVID-19.

However, the role of maternal-fetal genetic interactions (MFGI) and parent-of-origin (imprinting) effects in PA remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate MFGI in MB-OP, and imprinting effects in relation to risk of PA. METHODS: Among Peruvian mother-infant pairs (503 PA cases and 1052 controls), independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with linkage-disequilibrium coefficient <0.80, were selected to characterize genetic variations in MB-OP (78 SNPs in 24 genes) and imprinted genes (2713 SNPs in 73 genes). For each MB-OP SNP, four multinomial models corresponding to fetal allele effect, maternal allele effect, maternal and fetal allele additive effect, and maternal-fetal allele interaction effect were fit under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, random mating, and rare disease assumptions. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used for model selection. For each SNP in imprinted genes, imprinting effect was tested using a likelihood ratio test. Bonferroni corrections were used to determine statistical significance (p-value < 6.4e-4 for MFGI and p-value < 1.8e-5 for imprinting). RESULTS: Abruption cases were more likely to experience preeclampsia, have shorter gestational age, and deliver infants with lower birthweight compared with controls. Models with MFGI effects provided improved fit than models with only maternal and fetal genotype main effects for SNP rs12530904 (p-value = 1.2e-04) in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase [CaM kinase] II beta (CAMK2B), and, SNP rs73136795 (p-value = 1.9e-04) in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG), both MB genes. We identified 320 SNPs in 45 maternally-imprinted genes (including potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 [KCNQ1], neurotrimin [NTM], and, ATPase phospholipid transporting 10 A [ATP10A]) associated with abruption. Top hits included rs2012323 (p-value = 1.6E-16) and rs12221520 (p-value1.3e-13) in KCNQ1, rs8036892 (p-value = 9.3E-17) and rs188497582 in ATP10A, rs12589854 (p-value = 2.9E-11) and rs80203467 (p-value = 4.6e-11) in maternally expressed 8, small nucleolar RNA host (MEG8), and rs138281088 in solute carrier family 22 member 2 (SLC22A2) (p-value = 6.8e-9). CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development.

Patients with severe COVID-19 disease progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, with respiratory and multiple organ failure. It is believed that dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and endothelial dysfunction contribute to the pathogenesis of severe diseases. However, the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the role of endothelial cells are poorly understood. METHODS: Well-differentiated human airway epithelial cells were used to explore the cytokine and chemokine production after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We measured the susceptibility to infection, immune response, and expression of adhesion molecules, in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) exposed to conditioned medium from infected epithelial cells. The effect of imatinib on HPMVECs exposed to conditioned medium was evaluated. RESULTS: We demonstrated the production of IL-6, IP-10 and MCP-1 from the infected human airway cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVECs) did not support productive replication of SARS-CoV-2, treatment of HPMVECs with conditioned medium collected from infected airway cells induced an up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and vascular adhesion molecules. Imatinib inhibited the up-regulation of these cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules in HPMVECs treated with conditioned medium. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the role of endothelial cells in the development of clinical disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and the importance of endothelial cell-epithelial cell interaction in the pathogenesis of human COVID-19 diseases.","Hui, Kenrie Pui-Yan; Cheung, Man-Chun; Lai, Ka-Ling; Ng, Ka-Chun; Ho, John Chi-Wang; Peiris, Malik; Nicholls, John Malcolm; Chan, Michael Chi-Wai",Clin. infect. dis,327,16

Targeting of BTK with small molecule inhibitors has proven to be efficacious in several B cell malignancies. Interestingly, recent studies reveal increased BTK protein expression in circulating resting B cells of patients with systemic autoimmune disease (AID) compared with healthy controls. Moreover, BTK phosphorylation following BCR stimulation in vitro was enhanced. In addition to its role in BCR signaling, BTK is involved in many other pathways, including pattern recognition, Fc, and chemokine receptor signaling in B cells and myeloid cells. This broad involvement in several immunological pathways provides a rationale for the targeting of BTK in the context of inflammatory and systemic AID. Accordingly, numerous in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies support the potential of BTK targeting in these conditions. Efficacy of BTK inhibitors in various inflammatory and AID has been demonstrated or is currently evaluated in clinical trials. In addition, very recent reports suggest that BTK inhibition may be effective as immunosuppressive therapy to diminish pulmonary hyperinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we review BTK's function in key signaling pathways in B cells and myeloid cells. Further, we discuss recent advances in targeting BTK in inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies.","Neys, S. F.

Less is known about severe COVID-19 illness requiring hospitalization in children. During March 1-July 25, 2020, 576 pediatric COVID-19 cases were reported to the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a population-based surveillance system that collects data on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in 14 states (2,3). Based on these data, the cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among children aged <18 years during March 1-July 25, 2020, was 8.0 per 100,000 population, with the highest rate among children aged <2 years (24.8). During March 21-July 25, weekly hospitalization rates steadily increased among children (from 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000, with a weekly high of 0.7 per 100,000). Overall, Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) and non-Hispanic black (black) children had higher cumulative rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations (16.4 and 10.5 per 100,000, respectively) than did non-Hispanic white (white) children (2.1). Among 208 (36.1%) hospitalized children with complete medical chart reviews, 69 (33.2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU); 12 of 207 (5.8%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and one patient died during hospitalization. Although the cumulative rate of pediatric COVID-19-associated hospitalization remains low (8.0 per 100,000 population) compared with that among adults (164.5),* weekly rates increased during the surveillance period, and one in three hospitalized children were admitted to the ICU, similar to the proportion among adults. Continued tracking of SARS-CoV-2 infections among children is important to characterize morbidity and mortality. Reinforcement of prevention efforts is essential in congregate settings that serve children, including childcare centers and schools.","Kim, Lindsay; Whitaker, Michael; O039,; Halloran, Alissa; Kambhampati, Anita; Chai, Shua J; Reingold, Arthur; Armistead, Isaac; Kawasaki, Breanna; Meek, James; Yousey-Hindes, Kimberly; Anderson, Evan J; Openo, Kyle P; Weigel, Andy; Ryan, Patricia; Monroe, Maya L; Fox, Kimberly; Kim, Sue; Lynfield, Ruth; Bye, Erica; Shrum Davis, Sarah; Smelser, Chad; Barney, Grant; Spina, Nancy L; Bennett, Nancy M; Felsen, Christina B; Billing, Laurie M; Shiltz, Jessica; Sutton, Melissa; West, Nicole; Talbot, H Keipp; Schaffner, William; Risk, Ilene; Price, Andrea; Brammer, Lynnette; Fry, Alicia M; Hall, Aron J; Langley, Gayle E; Garg, Shikha",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,327,10

We reconstructed the progression of almond leaf scorch disease by using broad phylogenetic evidence supported by epidemiological data. Bayesian phylogenetic inference predicted that both Xf subspecies found in Majorca, fastidiosa ST1 (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 1990-1997) and multiplex ST81 (95% HPD: 1991-1998), shared their most recent common ancestors with Californian Xf populations associated with almonds and grapevines.

Mass coral bleaching and mortality have recently occurred where reefs have experienced chronic low oxygen events. However, the mechanistic basis of tolerance to oxygen levels inadequate to sustain normal functioning (i.e. hypoxia) and whether it contributes to bleaching susceptibility, remain unknown. We therefore experimentally exposed colonies of the environmentally resilient Acropora tenuis, a common reef-building coral from the Great Barrier Reef, to deoxygenation-reoxygenation stress that was aligned to their natural night-day light cycle. Specifically, the treatment involved removing the 'night-time O2 buffer' to challenge the inherent hypoxia thresholds. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that coral possess a complete and active hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated hypoxia response system (HRS) homologous to other metazoans. As expected, A. tenuis exhibited bleaching resistance and showed a strong inducibility of HIF target genes in response to deoxygenation stress. We applied this same approach in parallel to a colony of Acropora selago, known to be environmnetally susceptible, which conversely exhibited a bleaching phenotype response. This phenotypic divergence of A. selago was accompanied by contrasting gene expression profiles indicative of varied effectiveness of their HIF-HRS. Based on our RNA-Seq analysis, we propose (a) that the HIF-HRS is central for corals to manage deoxygenation stress and (b) that key genes of this system (and the wider gene network) may contribute to variation in coral bleaching susceptibility. Our analysis suggests that heat shock protein (hsp) 70 and 90 are important for low oxygen stress tolerance and further highlights how hsp90 expression might also affect the inducibility of coral HIF-HRS in overcoming a metabolic crisis under deoxygenation stress. We propose that differences in coral HIF-HRS could be central in regulating sensitivity to other climate change stressors-notably thermal stress-that commonly drive bleaching.","Alderdice, Rachel; Suggett, David J; Cárdenas, Anny; Hughes, David J; Kühl, Michael; Pernice, Mathieu; Voolstra, Christian R",,327,21

In-depth interviews were audio-recorded between March 10 and May 5, 2020. The essence of the nurses' experiences caring for patients with COVID-19 was categorized as three themes and eight subthemes: (a) Strong pressure because of coronavirus: initial fear, loneliness, communication challenges, exhaustion. (b) Turn threats into opportunities: improvement of nursing image, professional development. (c) Nurses' expectations: expectations of people, expectations of government. The findings of this study showed that identifying the challenges and needs of health-care providers is necessary to create a safe health-care system and to prepare nurses and expand their knowledge and attitudes to care for patients in new crises in the future.","Bahramnezhad, Fatemeh; Asgari, Parvaneh",Creat. nurs,327,20

It has robust historical precedence and sound biological plausibility. Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe as a treatment for COVID-19.METHODSThus, we analyzed key safety metrics after transfusion of ABO-compatible human COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, with 66% in the intensive care unit, as part of the US FDA expanded access program for COVID-19 convalescent plasma.RESULTSThe incidence of all serious adverse events (SAEs), including mortality rate (0.3%), in the first 4 hours after transfusion was <1%. Of the 36 reported SAEs, there were 25 reported incidences of related SAEs, including mortality (n = 4), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (n = 7), transfusion-related acute lung injury (n = 11), and severe allergic transfusion reactions (n = 3). However, only 2 of 36 SAEs were judged as definitely related to the convalescent plasma transfusion by the treating physician. The 7-day mortality rate was 14.9%.CONCLUSIONGiven the deadly nature of COVID-19 and the large population of critically ill patients included in these analyses, the mortality rate does not appear excessive.

These interactions are known as the cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). The main aims of the study were to evaluate whether renal resistive index (RRI) may be useful as a non-invasive marker in subclinical stage of kidney injury in dogs with MMVD and to compare RRI with SDMA and Cyst C. METHODS: Forty-four dogs were divided into two groups: control-15 healthy dogs and the heart group-29 dogs with MMVD (ACVIM class Cc). Study protocol included: anamnesis, clinical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, chest radiography, abdominal ultrasonography with measurements of the renal resistive index (RRI), urine, and blood analysis. RESULTS: The RRI in the heart group was significantly higher 0.725 ± 0.035 versus control group 0.665 ± 0.028 (p < 0.00085). The RRI cut-off point in dogs with stable chronic heart failure (CHF) under 8 years is 0.775, in older 0.64. RRI was similar in MMVD dogs treated with ACE-I + furosemide and dogs treated ACE-I + torasemide + pimobendan + spironolactone. There was no correlation between RRI and SDMA or Cyst C. CONCLUSION: RRI is more sensitive than creatinine, SDMA and Cyst C to reveal kidney injury in MMVD dogs class Cc younger than 8 years.","Szczepankiewicz, Barbara; Paslawska, Urszula; Siwinska, Natalia; Plens, Krzysztof; Paslawski, Robert",J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst,327,26

Given the rapid growth of COVID-19 clinical trials, there is an urgent need for a better clinical trial information retrieval that supports searching by specifying criteria including both eligibility criteria and structured trial information. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We built a linked graph for registered COVID-19 clinical trials: the COVID-19 Trial Graph, to facilitate retrieval of clinical trials. Natural language processing (NLP) tools were leveraged to extract and normalize the clinical trial information from both their eligibility criteria free texts and structured information from ClinicalTrials.gov. We linked the extracted data using the COVID-19 Trial Graph and imported it to a graph database, which supports both query and visualization. We evaluated trial graph using case queries and graph embedding. RESULTS: The graph currently (as of 10-05-2020) contains 3,392 registered COVID-19 clinical trials, with 17,480 nodes and 65,236 relationships. Manual evaluation of case queries found high-precision and recall scores on retrieving relevant clinical trials searching from both eligibility criteria and trial-structured information. We observed clustering in clinical trials via graph embedding, which also showed superiority over the baseline (0.8704 vs. 0.8199) in evaluating whether a trial can complete its recruitment successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Trial Graph is a novel representation of clinical trials that allows diverse search queries and provides a graph-based visualization of COVID-19 clinical trials. High-dimensional vectors mapped by graph embedding for clinical trials would be potentially beneficial for many downstream applications, such as trial end recruitment status prediction, and trial similarity comparison. Our methodology also is generalizable to other clinical trials, such as cancer clinical trials.","Du, Jingcheng; Wang, Qing; Wang, Jingqi; Ramesh, Prerana; Xiang, Yang; Jiang, Xiaoqian; Tao, Cui",J. am. med. inform. assoc,327,20

Profilins are one of the important hazelnut allergens; these proteins are considered panallergens due to their high capacity for cross-reactivity with other allergens. In the present work, we evaluated the thermostability of hazelnut profilin, combining molecular dynamics simulation and immunoinformatic techniques. This approach helped us to have reliable results in immunogenicity studies. We modeled Cor a 2 profilin and applied annealing simulation, equilibrium, and production simulation at constant temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 K using Gromacs software. Despite the hazelnut profilins being able to withstand temperatures of up to 400 K, this does not seem to reduce its allergenicity. We have found that profilin subjected to temperatures of 450 and 500 K could generate cross-reactivity with other food allergens. In conclusion, we note a remarkable thermostability of Cor a 2 at 400 K which avoids its structural unfolding.","Barazorda-Ccahuana, Haruna L; Theiss-De-Rosso, Vinicius; Valencia, Diego Ernesto; Gómez, Badhin",,327,10

Moreover, several studies reported a correlation between 25OHD levels and different clinical outcomes of the disease. AIM: Aim of the current review was to approach the topic of vitamin D and COVID-19 from a different perspective summarizing the data which led to the evidence of the existence of an endocrine phenotype of COVID-19.

Factoring in the baseline rate of the disease, we estimate broader confidence intervals for the efficacy rates of the vaccines recently developed for COVID-19. We propose new confidence intervals for the relative risk. We further show that sample sizes required for phase 3 efficacy trials are routinely underestimated and propose a new method for sample size calculation where the efficacy is of interest.

However, the prevalence of malnutrition and its outcomes is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and outcome of malnutrition among patients with COVID-19. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed/Medline; Science direct and LILACS from December 29, 2019 to September, 2020 without language restriction. All observational studies reporting the prevalence of malnutrition were included while case reports and reviews were excluded. The data were extracted with two independent authors with a customized format and the disagreements were resolved by the other authors. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using a standardized critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: A total of 511 articles were identified from different databases and 27 articles were selected for evaluation after the successive screening. Fourteen articles with 4187 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of malnutrition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 49.11% (95% CI: 31.67 to 66.54). The odd of mortality among patients COVID-19 with malnutrition was 10 times more likely as compared to those who were well-nourished. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition and mortality associated with malnutrition among COVID-19 hospitalized patients was very high which entails a mitigating strategy by different stakeholders to prevent and manage malnutrition and its outcomes. REGISTRATION: This systematic review was registered in Prospero's international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42020215396).","Abate, Semagn Mekonnen; Chekole, Yigrem Ali; Estifanos, Mahlet Birhane; Abate, Kalkidan Hassen; Kabthymer, Robel Hussen",Clin Nutr ESPEN,327,26

Currently, there are more than 140 COVID-19 vaccines under development. However, the challenge will be to induce an effective immune response in the elderly population. Analysis of B cell epitopes indicates the minor role of the stalk domain of spike protein in viral neutralization due to low surface accessibility. Nevertheless, the accumulation of mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) might reduce the vaccine efficacy in all age groups. We also propose the concept of chimeric vaccines based on the co-expression of SARS-CoV-2 spike and influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix protein 1 (M1) proteins to generate chimeric virus-like particles (VLP). This review discusses the possible approaches by which influenza-specific memory repertoire developed during the lifetime of the elderly populations can converge to mount an effective immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the possibilities of designing single vaccines for COVID-19 and influenza.

The effectiveness of these policies has varied with geography, population distribution, and effectiveness in implementation. Consequently, some nations (e.g., Taiwan, Haiti) have been more successful than others (e.g., United States) in curbing the outbreak. A data-driven investigation into effective public health policies of a country would allow public health experts in other nations to decide future courses of action to control the outbreaks of disease and epidemics. We chose Spain and India to present our analysis on regions that were similar in terms of certain factors: (1) population density, (2) unemployment rate, (3) tourism, and (4) quality of living. We posit that citizen ideology obtainable from twitter conversations can provide insights into conformity to policy and suitably reflect on future case predictions. A milestone when the curves show the number of new cases diverging from each other is used to define a time period to extract policy-related tweets while the concepts from a causality network of policy-dependent sub-events are used to generate concept clouds. The number of new cases is predicted using sentiment scores in a regression model. We see that the new case predictions reflects twitter sentiment, meaningfully tied to a trigger sub-event that enables policy-related findings for Spain and India to be effectively compared.","Asawa, Parth; Gaur, Manas; Roy, Kaushik; Sheth, Amit",,327,1

We sought to explore the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on routine and emergency care for multimorbidity among community-dwelling adults in Odisha, India. A community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken pandemic lockdown, in Khurda district of Odisha, India. Around 600 individuals having at least one chronic disease residing in rural, urban residential and slums were interviewed using a specifically developed questionnaire MAQ COVID-19. The association of socio-demographic characteristics and multimorbidity with pandemic-related care challenges was examined by multiple logistic regression. Principal Component Analysis was employed to minimize the dimensionality of factors related to multimorbidity care. Multimorbidity was highly prevalent in younger age group (46-60 years) with cardio-metabolic clusters being dominant. Individuals with multimorbidity experienced significantly higher care challenges than those with single condition (AOR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.01-2.05) with notable disruption in treatment and routine check-up. Most frequently cited concerns were-physician consultation (43%), diagnostic-services (26%), transport (33%), and mobility restrictions (21%). Multivariate analysis revealed older adults living alone in urban residence to have higher challenges than their rural counterparts. Patient activation for self-care, multimorbidity literacy, and technology-enabled tele-consultation could be explored as potential interventions. Future studies should qualitatively explore the challenges of physicians as well as garner an in-depth understanding of multimorbidity management in the vulnerable subgroups.","Pati, Sanghamitra; Mahapatra, Pranab; Kanungo, Srikanta; Uddin, Azhar; Sahoo, Krushna Chandra",Front Public Health,327,9

Although many banks and financial institutions have offered online loan application services during the COVID-19 pandemic, few have developed verification of loan applications submitted online. The results of this study show that the COVID-19 has brought a drastic change in the key determinants of P2P lending. The results imply that FinTech P2P lending has become the most viable alternative credit option available to borrowers.

However, these strategies cannot always be applied to patients with ARDS who sometimes require deep sedation and/or paralysis. Patients with severe ARDS may be under-represented in analgesia/sedation studies and currently recommended strategies may not be feasible. With lightened sedation, distress-related symptoms (e.g., pain and discomfort, anxiety, dyspnea) and patient-ventilator asynchrony should be systematically assessed and managed through interprofessional collaboration, prioritizing analgesia and anxiolysis. Adaptation of ventilator settings (e.g., use of a pressure-set mode, spontaneous breathing, sensitive inspiratory trigger) should be systematically considered before additional medications are administered. Managing the mechanical ventilator is of paramount importance to avoid the unnecessary use of deep sedation and/or paralysis. Therefore, applying an ""ABCDEF-R"" bundle (R = Respiratory-drive-control) may be beneficial in ARDS patients. Further studies are needed, especially regarding the use and long-term effects of fast-offset drugs (e.g., remifentanil, volatile anesthetics) and the electrophysiological assessment of analgesia/sedation (e.g., electroencephalogram devices, heart-rate variability, and video pupillometry). This review is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic given drug shortages and limited ICU-bed capacity.","Chanques, Gerald; Constantin, Jean-Michel; Devlin, John W; Ely, E Wesley; Fraser, Gilles L; Gélinas, Céline; Girard, Timothy D; Guérin, Claude; Jabaudon, Matthieu; Jaber, Samir; Mehta, Sangeeta; Langer, Thomas; Murray, Michael J; Pandharipande, Pratik; Patel, Bhakti; Payen, Jean-François; Puntillo, Kathleen; Rochwerg, Bram; Shehabi, Yahya; Strøm, Thomas; Olsen, Hanne Tanghus; Kress, John P",Intensive Care Med,327,16

Currently, severe and nonsevere COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few features, which do not comprehensively characterize the complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different disease types. In addition, these type-defining features may not be readily testable at the time of diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use a machine learning approach to understand COVID-19 more comprehensively, accurately differentiate severe and nonsevere COVID-19 clinical types based on multiple medical features, and provide reliable predictions of the clinical type of the disease. METHODS: For this study, we recruited 214 confirmed patients with nonsevere COVID-19 and 148 patients with severe COVID-19. The clinical characteristics (26 features) and laboratory test results (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest models based on all the features in each modality as well as on the top 5 features in each modality combined were developed and validated to differentiate COVID-19 clinical types. RESULTS: Using clinical and laboratory results independently as input, the random forest models achieved >90% and >95% predictive accuracy, respectively. The importance scores of the input features were further evaluated, and the top 5 features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, and diabetes for the clinical features modality, and dimerized plasmin fragment D, high sensitivity troponin I, absolute neutrophil count, interleukin 6, and lactate dehydrogenase for the laboratory testing modality, in descending order). Using these top 10 multimodal features as the only input instead of all 52 features combined, the random forest model was able to achieve 97% predictive accuracy.

Quarantine and isolation have been shown to negatively affect the mental health of individuals. Qatar has a unique population, with around 90% of the population being economic migrants and a majority being blue-collar workers and labourers. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to evaluate the psychological impact of institutional isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Qatar. The study also explored the sociodemographic correlates of this psychological impact. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: A cross-sectional study involving 748 consenting individuals in institutional quarantine and isolation in Qatar during the months of June and July 2020 was carried out. Relevant sociodemographic data along with depressive and anxiety symptomatology scores were collected from consenting adults at these facilities. RESULTS: 37.4% (n=270) of respondents reported depressive symptoms and 25.9% (n=189) reported anxiety symptoms. The scores were higher for individuals in isolation facilities and higher for migrants from poor socioeconomic group (p<0.001 for both). Within this group, although worries about infection were widely reported, lack of contact with the family was cited as one of the most important sources of distress. Respondents reported that contact with the family and reliable information were important factors that helped during the duration of isolation and quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported significantly elevated scores for depression and anxiety during institutional quarantine, which is in keeping with emerging evidence. However, in contrast to other studies reporting mostly from native populations, this study of a population with an overwhelming majority of immigrants highlights the special mental health needs of this specific group and can inform future healthcare policies.","Reagu, Shuja; Wadoo, Ovais; Latoo, Javed; Nelson, Deborah; Ouanes, Sami; Masoodi, Naseer; Karim, Mustafa Abdul; Iqbal, Yousaf; Al Abdulla, Samya; Al Nuaimi, Saleem Khaldoun; Abdelmajid, Alaaeldin Abdelmajid Basheer; Al Samawi, Musaed Saad; Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah; Khoodoruth, Widaad Nuzhah Chut-Kai; Al-Maslamani, Muna A Rahman S; Alabdulla, Majid",BMJ Open,327,17

The overall (5 years) survival rate of PC is less than 9% and is anticipated to be aggravated in the future due to the lack of molecular acquaintance and diagnostic tools for its early detection. Multiple factors are involved in the course of PC development, including genetics, cigarette smoking, alcohol, family history, and aberrant epigenetic signatures of the epigenome. In this review, we will mainly focus on the genetic mutations and epigenetic signature of PC. Multiple tumor suppressor and oncogene mutations are involved in PC initiation, including K-RAS, p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. The mutational frequency of these genes ranges from 50 to 98% in PC. The nature of mutation diagnosis is mostly homozygous deletion, point mutation, and aberrant methylation. In addition to genetic modification, epigenetic alterations particularly aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation also predispose patients to PC. Hypermethylation is mostly involved in the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and leads to PC, while multiple genes also represent a hypomethylation status in PC. Several renewable drugs and detection tools have been developed to cope with this aggressive malady, but all are futile, and surgical resection remains the only choice for prolonged survival if diagnosed before metastasis. However, the available therapeutic development is insufficient to cure PC. Therefore, novel approaches are a prerequisite to elucidating the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PC progression for healthier lifelong survival.","Khan, Aamir Ali; Liu, Xinhui; Yan, Xinlong; Tahir, Muhammad; Ali, Sakhawat; Huang, Hua",Cancer metastasis. rev,327,16

Methods This study actively followed a cohort of social security workers from March to December 2020 to determine the number of laboratory-confirmed symptomatic cases, asymptomatic associated contacts and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths. Workers were classified into those providing direct care to infected patients (COVID teams), other active healthcare workers (OAHCW), and workers under home protection (HPW). The number of cases and rates were also estimated by job category. Results Among a total of 542 381 workers, 41 461 were granted stay-at-home protection due to advanced age or comorbidities. Among the 500 920 total active workers, 85 477 and 283 884 were classified into COVID teams and OAHCW, respectively. Infection rates for COVID teams, OAHCW, and HPW were 20.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 19.8-20.4], 13.7% (95% CI 15.0-15.3), and 12.2% (95% CI 11.8-12.5), respectively. The risk of hospitalization was higher among HPW. COVID teams had lower mortality rate per 10 000 workers compared to HPW (5.0, 95% CI 4.0-7.0 versus 18.1, 95% CI 14.0-23.0). Compared to administrative workers, ambulance personnel (RR 1.20; 95% CI 1.09-1.32), social workers (RR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08-1.24), patient transporters (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09-1.22) and nurses (RR 1.13; 95% CI 1.10-1.15) had a higher risk of infection after adjusting for age and gender. Crude differences in mortality rates were observed according to job category, which could be explained by differences in age, sex, and comorbidity distribution. Diabetes, obesity, hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV were associated with increased fatality rates. Conclusions COVID team workers had higher infection rates compared to the total population of active workers and HPW. Doctors had lower risk of infection than respiratory therapists, nurses, and patient transporters, among whom interventions should be reconsidered to reduce risks. The presence of comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension, hemolytic anemia, and HIV, increased the likelihood of complications caused by COVID-19, culminating in a poor prognosis.","Robles-Pérez, Eduardo; González-Díaz, Belinda; Miranda-García, Maximino; Borja-Aburto, Victor Hugo",Scand. j. work environ. health,327,0

The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) is a WHO-led initiative to promote vaccine access equity to LMICs and is providing many of the doses available in these settings. However, initial doses are limited and countries, such as Madagascar, need to develop prioritization schemes to maximize the benefits of vaccination with very limited supplies. There is some consensus that dose deployment should initially target health care workers, and those who are more vulnerable including older individuals. However, questions of geographic deployment remain, in particular associated with limits around vaccine access and delivery capacity in underserved communities, for example in rural areas that may also include substantial proportions of the population. MethodsTo address these questions, we developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and simulated various vaccination allocation strategies for Madagascar. Simulated strategies were based on a number of possible geographical prioritization schemes, testing sensitivity to initial susceptibility in the population, and evaluating the potential of tests for previous infection. ResultsUsing cumulative deaths due to COVID-19 as the main outcome of interest, our results indicate that distributing the number of vaccine doses according to the number of elderly living in the region or according to the population size results in a greater reduction of mortality compared to distributing doses based on the reported number of cases and deaths. The benefits of vaccination strategies are diminished if the burden (and thus accumulated immunity) has been greatest in the most populous regions, but the overall strategy ranking remains comparable. If rapid tests for prior immunity may be swiftly and effectively delivered, there is potential for considerable gain in mortality averted, but considering delivery limitations modulates this. ConclusionAt a subnational scale, our results support the strategy adopted by the COVAX initiative at a global scale.","Rasambainarivo, Fidisoa; Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Raherinandrasana, Antso; Randrianarisoa, Santatra; Rice, Benjamin L; Evans, Michelle V.; ROCHE, Benjamin; Randriatsrafara, Fidiniaina Mamy; Wesolowski, Amy; Metcalf, C.

In this study, the potential of in silico molecular docking-based drug repositioning approach was exploited for identifying the inhibitors of Mpro and SP of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: A total of 196 compounds including various US-FDA-approved drugs, vitamins and their analogs were docked with Mpro (PDB IDs: 6YB7 and 6Y84), and the top six ligands were further tested for ADME properties followed by docking with SP (PDB IDs: 6LXT and 6W41). RESULTS: Out of 196 compounds, binding energy (DE) of Silybin B (6YB7: DE: -11.20 kcal/mol; 6Y84: DE: -10.18 kcal/mol; 6LXT:DE: -10.47 kcal/mol; 6W41:DE: -10.96 kcal/mol) and Cianidanol (6YB7:DE: -8.85 kcal/mol; 6Y84:DE:-10.02 kcal/mol; 6LXT:DE:-9.36 kcal/mol; 6W41:DE: -9.52 kcal/mol) demonstrated better binding and ADME properties compared with the currently endeavored drugs like Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir. Additionally, Elliptinone, Diospyirin, SCHEMBL94263 and Fiboflavin have shown encouraging results. Fiboflavin, an immunity booster, was found to inhibit both the Mpro and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It was observed that amino acid residues MET6, ALA7, PHE8, PRO9, ASP295, GLY302, VAL303 and THR304 play significant roles in protein-ligand interactions through hydrogen bonds and Vander Waals forces. CONCLUSION: Silybin B and Cianidanol showed excellent binding and ADME properties compared with the currently endeavored drugs and can be exploited as therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2 infection after experimental validation and clinical trials.","Srivastava, Rashi; Tripathi, Shubham; Unni, Sreepoorna; Hussain, Arif; Haque, Shafiul; Dasgupta, Nandita; Singh, Vineeta; Mishra, Bhartendu Nath",Curr. pharm. des,327,16

Objective: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of using a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study included 2 components: a national survey to examine the acceptability of using robotic systems to perform health care tasks in a hospital setting and a single-site cohort study of patient experiences and satisfaction with the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate triage and telehealth tasks in the emergency department (ED). The national survey comprised individuals living in the US who participated in a sampling-based survey via an online analytic platform. Participants completed the national survey between August 18 and August 21, 2020. The single-site cohort study included patients living in the US who presented to the ED of a large urban academic hospital providing quaternary care in Boston, Massachusetts between April and August 2020. All data were analyzed from August to October 2020. Exposures: Participants in the national survey completed an online survey to measure the acceptability of using a mobile robotic system to perform health care tasks (facilitating telehealth interviews, acquiring vital signs, obtaining nasal or oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, performing phlebotomy, and turning a patient in bed) in a hospital setting in the contexts of general interaction and interaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients in the cohort study were exposed to a mobile robotic system, which was controlled by an ED clinician and used to facilitate a triage interview. After exposure, patients completed an assessment to measure their satisfaction with the robotic system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Acceptability of the use of a mobile robotic system to facilitate health care tasks in a hospital setting (national survey) and feasibility and patient satisfaction regarding the use of a mobile robotic system in the ED (cohort study). Results: For the national survey, 1154 participants completed all acceptability questions, representing a participation rate of 35%. After sample matching, a nationally representative sample of 1000 participants (mean [SD] age, 48.7 [17.0] years; 535 women [53.5%]) was included in the analysis. With regard to the usefulness of a robotic system to perform specific health care tasks, the response of ""somewhat useful"" was selected by 373 participants (37.3%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 350 participants (35.0%) for acquiring vital signs, 307 participants (30.7%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 228 participants (22.8%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 249 participants (24.9%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. The response of ""extremely useful"" was selected by 287 participants (28.7%) for facilitating telehealth interviews, 413 participants (41.3%) for acquiring vital signs, 192 participants (19.2%) for obtaining nasal or oral swabs, 159 participants (15.9%) for placing an intravenous catheter, 167 participants (16.7%) for performing phlebotomy, and 371 participants (37.1%) for turning a patient in bed. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the median number of individuals who perceived the application of robotic systems to be acceptable for completing telehealth interviews, obtaining nasal and oral swabs, placing an intravenous catheter, and performing phlebotomy increased. For the ED cohort study, 51 individuals were invited to participate, and 41 participants (80.4%) enrolled. One participant was unable to complete the study procedures because of a signaling malfunction in the robotic system. Forty patients (mean [SD] age, 45.8 [2.7] years; 29 women [72.5%]) completed the mobile robotic system-facilitated triage interview, and 37 patients (92.5%) reported that the interaction was satisfactory. A total of 33 participants (82.5%) reported that their experience of receiving an interview facilitated by a mobile robotic system was as satisfactory as receiving an in-person interview from a clinician. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a mobile robotic system was perceived to be acceptable for use in a broad set of health care tasks among survey respondents across the US. The use of a mobile robotic system enabled the facilitation of contactless triage interviews of patients in the ED and was considered acceptable among participants. Most patients in the ED rated the quality of mobile robotic system-facilitated interaction to be equivalent to in-person interaction with a clinician.","Chai, Peter R; Dadabhoy, Farah Z; Huang, Hen-Wei; Chu, Jacqueline N; Feng, Annie; Le, Hien M; Collins, Joy; da Silva, Marco; Raibert, Marc; Hur, Chin; Boyer, Edward W; Traverso, Giovanni",JAMA Netw Open,327,31

Therefore, this research seeks to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on work-related quality of life (WRQoL) in a Portuguese-speaking sample, through the lens of sexual orientation. One thousand, five hundred and seventy-seven individuals participated in this study, of which 1396 (88.5%) self-identified as heterosexual, 95 (6.0%) as gay or lesbian, and 87 (5.5%) as bisexual. Participants responded to the “Work-Related Quality of Life” scale, the “Fear of COVID-19” scale, and the “Negative Impact of COVID-19” scale. Bisexuals scored higher on “Fear of COVID-19” and “Negative Impact of COVID-19” than heterosexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Differences between sexual orientations for all dimensions of WRQoL were found: heterosexual participants scored higher on general well-being, home–work interface, career satisfaction, working conditions, and lower on stress at work, compared to bisexual, and gay, or lesbian participants. Gay or lesbian participants scored lower than heterosexual and bisexual participants on career satisfaction and working conditions. Sexual orientation, the fear of COVID-19, and the negative impact of COVID-19 were significant predictors of overall WRQoL (explaining 13% of variance). Moderation analysis also showed that sexual orientation is a significant moderator of the association between the fear of COVID-19, the negative impact of COVID-19, and WRQoL. LGB people (especially bisexuals) suffer more severe impacts of COVID-19 and have lower WRQoL than heterosexual people. Inevitably, this has consequences in terms of mental health and overall quality of life for sexual minorities, thus reinforcing the need to adopt inclusive policies in organizations and companies to improve their WRQoL.","Mendes, Cindy Pereira Henrique",Behavioral Sciences,327,24

Among patients with cancer, those undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) or adjuvant chemotherapy (Adj chemo) for early breast cancer (EBC) are at particularly high risk for inferior outcomes, in part, because optimal timing of chemotherapy is essential for promoting distant disease-free survival. COVID-19 data from the ongoing multicenter I-SPY 2 trial of NAC for EBC provides a window into the magnitude of the problem of treatment interruption, not only for the trial itself but also for routine Adj chemo. In the I-SPY 2 trial, 4.5% of patients had disruption of therapy by COVID-19, prior to wide vaccine availability, suggesting that nationally up to 5,700 patients with EBC were at risk for adverse outcomes from COVID-19 infection in 2020. To address this problem, vaccine education and public engagement are essential to overcome hesitancy, while equity of distribution is needed to address access. To accomplish these goals, healthcare organizations (HCO) need to not only call out disinformation but also engage the public with vaccine education and find common ground for vaccine acceptance, while partnering with state/local governments to improve efficiency of vaccine distribution. These approaches are important to improve trial access and to reduce susceptibility to COVID-19, as the pandemic could continue to impact access to clinical trials and routine cancer treatment.","Potter, David A; Thomas, Alexandra; Rugo, Hope S",Clin. cancer res,327,23

There is evidence of worldwide distribution of such devices, but some experts have warned of possible negative impacts of their use. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of an aerosol box on intubation performance across a variety of simulated difficult airway scenarios in the emergency department. METHODS: This was a randomized, crossover design study. Participants were randomized to intubate one of five airway scenarios with and without an aerosol box in place, with randomization of intubation sequence. The primary outcome was time to intubation. Secondary outcomes included number of intubation attempts, Cormack-Lehane view, percent of glottic opening, and resident physician perception of intubation difficulty. RESULTS: Forty-eight residents performed 96 intubations. Time to intubation was significantly longer with box use than without (mean 17 seconds [range 6-68 seconds] vs mean 10 seconds [range 5-40 seconds], p <0.001). Participants perceived intubation as being significantly more difficult with the aerosol box. There were no significant differences in the number of attempts or quality of view obtained. CONCLUSION: Use of an aerosol box during difficult endotracheal intubation increases the time to intubation and perceived difficulty across a range of simulated ED patients.","Turner, Joseph S; Falvo, Lauren E; Ahmed, Rami A; Ellender, Timothy J; Corson-Knowles, Dan; Bona, Anna M; Sarmiento, Elisa J; Cooper, Dylan D",West J Emerg Med,327,2

Our Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation model uses a recently developed theory for how the migration barriers are affected by the presence of an electric field. All parameters of the model are physically motivated and no fitting parameters are used. The model has been validated by reproducing characteristic faceting patterns of tungsten surfaces that have in previous experiments been observed to only appear in the presence of strong electric fields.

Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these high-risk populations. Objective: To evaluate COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes associated with contact-targeted interventions and testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modeling study developed an agent-based susceptible-exposed-infectious (asymptomatic/symptomatic)-recovered model between July and September 2020 to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff of a simulated nursing home with 100 residents and 100 staff split among 3 shifts were modeled individually; residents were split into 2 cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September to October 2020. Exposures: In the resident cohorting intervention, residents who had recovered from COVID-19 were moved back from the COVID-19 (ie, infected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort to the non-COVID-19 (ie, susceptible and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non-COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aimed to reduce the fraction of people's contacts that were presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replaced them with recovered (immune) contacts. A secondary aim of was to evaluate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with 2 types of screening tests (ie, rapid antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing) conducted with varying frequency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated cumulative incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months. Results: Among the simulated cohort of 100 residents and 100 staff members, frequency and type of testing were associated with smaller outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The testing strategy associated with the greatest estimated reduction in infections was daily antigen testing, which reduced the mean cumulative incidence proportion by 49% in absence of contact-targeted interventions. Under all screening testing strategies, the resident cohorting intervention and the immunity-based staffing intervention were associated with reducing the final estimated size of the outbreak among residents, with the immunity-based staffing intervention reducing it more (eg, by 19% in the absence of testing) than the resident cohorting intervention (eg, by 8% in the absence of testing). The estimated reduction in transmission associated with these interventions among staff varied by testing strategy and community prevalence. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes may reduce outbreaks in this high-risk setting.

The aim of this project was to elaborate EULAR Points to consider (PtCs) on COVID-19 pathophysiology and immunomodulatory therapies. METHODS: PtCs were developed in accordance with EULAR standard operating procedures for endorsed recommendations, led by an international multidisciplinary Task Force, including rheumatologists, translational immunologists, haematologists, paediatricians, patients and health professionals, based on a systemic literature review up to 15 December 2020. Overarching principles (OPs) and PtCs were formulated and consolidated by formal voting. RESULTS: Two OPs and fourteen PtCs were developed. OPs highlight the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need of a multifaceted approach to target the different pathophysiological mechanisms. PtCs 1-6 encompass the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 including immune response, endothelial dysfunction and biomarkers. PtCs 7-14 focus on the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection with immunomodulators. There was evidence supporting the use of glucocorticoids, especially dexamethasone, in COVID-19 cases requiring oxygen therapy. No other immunomodulator demonstrated efficacy on mortality to date, with however inconsistent results for tocilizumab. Immunomodulatory therapy was not associated with higher infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Multifactorial pathophysiological mechanisms, including immune abnormalities, play a key role in COVID-19. The efficacy of glucocorticoids in cases requiring oxygen therapy suggests that immunomodulatory treatment might be effective in COVID-19 subsets. Involvement of rheumatologists, as systemic inflammatory diseases experts, should continue in ongoing clinical trials delineating optimal immunomodulatory therapy utilisation in COVID-19.","Alunno, Alessia; Najm, Aurélie; Machado, Pedro M; Bertheussen, Heidi; Burmester, Gerd R; Carubbi, Francesco; De Marco, Gabriele; Giacomelli, Roberto; Hermine, Olivier; Isaacs, John D; Koné-Paut, Isabelle; Magro-Checa, César; McInnes, Iain; Meroni, Pier Luigi; Quartuccio, Luca; Ramanan, Athimalaipet V; Ramos-Casals, Manuel; Rodríguez Carrio, Javier; Schulze-Koops, Hendrik; Stamm, Tanja A; Tas, Sander W; Terrier, Benjamin; McGonagle, Dennis G; Mariette, Xavier",Ann. rheum. dis,327,26

Aim and objective: The objective of this work was to utilize potentials of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) for improvement of the oral bioavailability of artemether and lumefantrine combination and to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of malaria. This study reports a method of formulation, characterization and evaluation of the therapeutic efficacies of caprol-based NLC delivery systems with artemether and lumefantrine. Method: The artemether-lumefantrine co-loaded NLCs were prepared using the lipid matrix (5% w/w) (containing beeswax and Phospholipon® 90H and Caprol-PGE 860), artemether (0.1%w/w) and lumefantrine (0.6%w/w), sorbitol (4%w/w), Tween® 80(2%w/w as surfactant) and distilled water (q.s to 100%) by high shear homogenization and evaluated for physicochemical performance. The in vivo antimalarial activities of the NLC were tested in chloroquine-sensitive strains of Plasmodium berghei (NK-65) using Peter´s 4-day suppressive protocol in mice and compared with controls. Histopathological studies were also carried out on major organs implicated in malaria. Results: The NLC showed fairly polydispersed nano-sized formulation (z-average:188.6 nm; polydispersity index, PDI=0.462) with no major interaction occurring between the components while the in vivo study showed a gradual but sustained drug release from the NLC compared with that seen with chloroquine sulphate and Coartem®. Results of histopathological investigations also revealed more organ damage with the untreated groups than groups treated with the formulations. Conclusion: This study has shown the potential of caprol-based NLCs for significant improvement in oral bioavailability and hence antimalarial activity of poorly soluble artemether and lumefantrine. Importantly, this would improve patient compliance due to decrease in dosing frequency as a sustained release formulation.","Akpa, Paul Achile; Ugwuoke, Joseph Abuchi; Attama, Anthony Amaechi; Ugwu, Chinenye Nnenna; Ezeibe, Ezinwanne Nneoma; Momoh, Mumuni Audu; Echezona, Adaeze Chidiebere; Kenechukwu, Franklin Chimaobi",Afr Health Sci,327,32

In addition to the impact on global health caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of related misinformation poses an additional health threat. Detecting and controlling the spread of misinformation using algorithmic methods is a challenging task. Relying on human fact-checking experts is the most reliable approach, however, it does not scale with the volume and speed with which digital misinformation is being produced and disseminated. In this paper, we present the SAMS Human-in-the-loop (SAMS-HITL) approach to combat the detection and the spread of digital misinformation. SAMS-HITL leverages the fact-checking skills of humans by providing feedback on news stories about the source, author, message, and spelling. The SAMS features are jointly integrated into a machine learning pipeline for detecting misinformation. First results indicate that SAMS features have a marked impact on the classification as it improves accuracy by up to 7.1%. The SAMS-HITL approach goes one step further than the traditional human-in-the-loop models in that it helps raising awareness about digital misinformation by allowing users to become self fact-checkers. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Italy is the hardest hit country after China. Considering the deleterious consequences of malnutrition, which certainly can affect patients with COVID-19, the aim of this article is to present a pragmatic protocol for early nutritional supplementation of non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. It is based on the observation that most patients present at admission with severe inflammation and anorexia leading to a drastic reduction of food intake, and that a substantial percentage develops respiratory failure requiring non-invasive ventilation or even continuous positive airway pressure. METHODS: High-calorie dense diets in a variety of different consistencies with highly digestible foods and snacks are available for all patients. Oral supplementation of whey proteins as well as intravenous infusion of multivitamin, multimineral trace elements solutions are implemented at admission. In the presence of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficit, cholecalciferol is promptly supplied. If nutritional risk is detected, two to three bottles of protein-calorie oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are provided. If <2 bottles/d of ONS are consumed for 2 consecutive days and/or respiratory conditions are worsening, supplemental/total parenteral nutrition is prescribed. CONCLUSION: We are aware that our straight approach may be debatable. However, to cope with the current emergency crisis, its aim is to promptly and pragmatically implement nutritional care in patients with COVID-19, which might be overlooked despite being potentially beneficial to clinical outcomes and effective in preventing the consequences of malnutrition in this patient population.","Caccialanza, Riccardo; Laviano, Alessandro; Lobascio, Federica; Montagna, Elisabetta; Bruno, Raffaele; Ludovisi, Serena; Corsico, Angelo Guido; Di Sabatino, Antonio; Belliato, Mirko; Calvi, Monica; Iacona, Isabella; Grugnetti, Giuseppina; Bonadeo, Elisa; Muzzi, Alba; Cereda, Emanuele",Nutrition,327,23

Societalization refers to the process through which institutional failures are transformed into societal crises, with the civil sphere mobilized to discuss institutional dysfunctions, push for reforms, and attempt to democratize or otherwise transform institutional cultures. The societalization of pandemic unpreparedness in Taiwan led to reforms of the public health administration and the medical profession, thereby establishing state mechanisms for encouraging early responses and coordinating centralized command during outbreaks, and healthcare infrastructures for coordinating patient transfer and ensuring supplies of personal protective equipment. Reflections upon past uncivil acts among citizens motivated the civil sphere to foster a discourse of interdependence, redefining the boundaries between individual choices and civic virtues. Meanwhile, unaddressed challenges remained, including threats related to Taiwan's political polarization. Our paper challenges the thesis of ""authoritarian advantage,"" highlighting how democratic societies can foster social preparedness to respond to crises. By illustrating how societalization can reach temporary closures but become reactivated subsequently, our study extends the theory of societalization by explicating its historical dimension.","Lo, Ming-Cheng M; Hsieh, Hsin-Yi",Am J Cult Sociol,327,16

They discovered a relationship between the whole microbial colonization and the initiation and development of different medical disorders. Besides already known probiotics, novel products such as postbiotics and paraprobiotics have been developed in recent years to create new non-viable micro-organisms or bacterial-free extracts, which can provide benefits to the host with additional bioactivity to probiotics, but without the risk of side effects. The best alternatives in the use of probiotics and postbiotics to maintain the health of the intestinal microbiota and to prevent the attachment of pathogens to children and adults are highlighted and discussed as controversies and challenges. Updated knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the balance between microbiota and immune system for the introspection on the gut-lung-brain axis could reveal the latest benefits and perspectives of applied photobiomics for health. Multiple interconditioning between photobiomodulation (PBM), probiotics, and the human microbiota, their effects on the human body, and their implications for the management of viral infectious diseases is essential. Coupled complex PBM and probiotic interventions can control the microbiome, improve the activity of the immune system, and save the lives of people with immune imbalances. There is an urgent need to seek and develop innovative treatments to successfully interact with the microbiota and the human immune system in the coronavirus crisis. In the near future, photobiomics and metabolomics should be applied innovatively in the SARS-CoV-2 crisis (to study and design new therapies for COVID-19 immediately), to discover how bacteria can help us through adequate energy biostimulation to combat this pandemic, so that we can find the key to the hidden code of communication between RNA viruses, bacteria, and our body.","Ailioaie, Laura Marinela; Litscher, Gerhard",Int. j. mol. sci.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked widespread disruption to clinical nurses' work. It is important to understand clinical nurses' processes of coping during disasters to support the nursing workforce during events such as global pandemics. DESIGN: We employed the Corbin and Strauss variant of grounded theory methodology, informed by symbolic interactionism, and applied the EQUATOR guidelines for qualitative research publication (COREQ). METHODS: Data collection entailed semi-structured interviews with experienced clinical nurses (n =20) across diverse settings. We analysed data by identifying key points in the nurses' coping processes inductively building concepts around these points. RESULTS: The predictor of nurses' outcomes in this grounded theory was their confidence in their ability to cope during the pandemic. When nurses lacked confidence, they experienced working in the context of acute COVID-a state of chaos and anxiety, with negative consequences for nurses. However, when nurses were confident in their abilities to cope with the pandemic, they experienced working in the context of chronic COVID, a calmer state of acceptance. There were many workplace factors that influenced nurses' confidence, including adequacy of personal protective equipment, clear information and guidance, supportive leadership, teamwork and adequate staffing. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding clinical nurses' experience of coping during COVID-19 is essential to maintain the nursing workforce during similar disasters. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurse leaders can target areas that support nurses' confidence, such as adequate PPE and staffing. In turn, increased confidence enables clinical nurses to cope during disasters such as a global pandemic.","Nowell, Lorelli; Dhingra, Swati; Andrews, Kimberley; Jackson, Jennifer",J. clin. nurs,327,1

Bivalirudin, a member of the direct thrombin inhibitor drug class, offers potential advantages during ECMO, including to its ability to exert its effect by directly attaching to and inhibiting freely circulating and fibrin-bound thrombin. Herein, the successful use of an anticoagulation strategy using the off-label use of a continuous infusion of bivalirudin in a case of severe hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure caused by COVID-19 requiring venovenous ECMO is reported. Importantly, therapeutic anticoagulation intensity was achieved rapidly with stable pharmacokinetics, and there was no need for any circuit interventions throughout the patient's 27-day ECMO course.

This review examines the emerging role of unconventional T cell subsets, including Î³Î´ T cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in human SARS-CoV-2 infection.Some of these T cell subsets have been shown to play protective roles in anti-viral immunity by suppressing viral replication and opsonising virions of SARS-CoV. Here, we explore whether unconventional T cells play a protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection as well. Unconventional T cells are already under investigation as cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. We discuss the potential use of these cells as therapeutic agents in the COVID-19 setting. Due to the rapidly evolving situation presented by COVID-19, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of this disease and the mechanisms underlying its immune response.

Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) may provide time efficient means of rapid multiparametric quantitative MRI. The accuracy of MRF, however, relies on adequate control over system imperfections, such as eddy currents and B1+, which are different and not as well established on MRL systems compared to diagnostic systems. In this study we investigate the technical feasibility of gradient spoiled 2D MRF on a 1.5T MRL. We show with phantom experiments that the MRL generates reliable MRF signals that are temporally stable during the day and have good agreement with spin-echo reference measurements. Subsequent in-vivo MRF scans in healthy volunteers and a patient with a colorectal liver metastasis showed good image quality, where the quantitative values of selected organs corresponded with the values reported in literature. Therefore we conclude that gradient spoiled 2D MRF is feasible on a 1.5T MRL with similar performance as on a diagnostic system. The precision and accuracy of the parametric maps are sufficient for further investigation of the clinical utility of MRF for online quantitatively MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Bruijnen, T.; Heide, O. van der; Intven, M.P.W.; Mook, S.; Lagendijk, J.J.W.; Berg, C.A.T. van den; Tijssen, R.H.N.",,327,1

Currently, there is no treatment for it, but the world is in a race that yielded, in a relatively short time than usual, several approved, promising vaccines in the middle of a storm of debates because of the speed of their production and approval. Objective: This study assessed the willingness of Middle Eastern Arab publics to receive COVID-19 vaccines and investigated the factors behind any reluctance to receive them. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was distributed through social media applications in four Arab countries (Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Iraq). Participants' demographics, medical history, their experience with COVID-19, and their willingness to receive the available vaccines were obtained and analyzed. Results: A total of 2,925 completed forms were included. Only 25% of the participants were willing to receive a vaccine while 33% were hesitant. Iraqis were the most willing to receive it while Jordanians were the least (35% and 17% of each country, respectively). Interestingly, 60% of the acceptors were ready to pay for the vaccine if not covered by governments. It was also found that American vaccines were preffered by 50% of the acceptors. However, 30% of acceptors were unsure of which vaccine is the best and 11% stated that any vaccine is good. Social media were the major source of information about COVID-19 and its vaccines. Finally, predictors of acceptance of the vaccines included living in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, being unmarried, having monthly income > $1,000, holding a medical degree, having high fear from COVID-19, feeling of being at risk of getting infected with COVID-19, and previous reception of influenza vaccine, whereas predictors of refusal included female sex and previous infection with COVID-19. Conclusion: Middle Eastern Arabs are less likely to accept receiving the COVID-19 vaccines compared with non-Arabs. Health authorities in these countries are advised to intensify their awareness-raising activities about the vaccines while ensuring fair distribution of them.","Abu-Farha, Rana; Mukattash, Tareq; Itani, Ranai; Karout, Samar; Khojah, Hani; Al-Mahmood, Asia; Alzoubi, Karem",Saudi pharmaceutical journal,327,1

Superantigen specificity for different Vß chains results in Vß skewing, whereby T cells with specific Vß chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCRß variable gene 11-2 (TRBV11-2), with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion shared HLA class I alleles A02, B35, and C04, indicating what we believe is a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modeling indicated that polyacidic residues in the Vß chain encoded by TRBV11-2 (Vß21.3) strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion. Overall, our data indicate that a CDR3-independent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and TCR leads to T cell expansion and possibly activation, which may account for the clinical presentation of MIS-C.","Porritt, Rebecca A; Paschold, Lisa; Rivas, Magali Noval; Cheng, Mary Hongying; Yonker, Lael M; Chandnani, Harsha; Lopez, Merrick; Simnica, Donjete; Schultheiß, Christoph; Santiskulvong, Chintda; Van Eyk, Jennifer; McCormick, John K; Fasano, Alessio; Bahar, Ivet; Binder, Mascha; Arditi, Moshe",J. clin. invest,327,20

Literature highlights numerous benefits of using e-learning solutions, yet many still consider ‘online learning’ as the cheap/‘low-quality’ alternative to traditional ‘face-to-face’ models. In this research we ask two questions that are critical to the effective development of future e-learning solutions: Do students prefer face-to-face (traditional) learning methods or e-learning technology enabled solutions? Does perception of e-learning, and/or device preference, vary between individuals? Methods: A three part, quantitative questionnaire was developed, based on previously used questionnaire items, which collected: demographic data, student preference concerning learning, and individual variance - via use of the Cultural Value (CV) Scale dimension test. Data was collected from 518 participants using convenience sampling from a range of universities in Pakistan. EFA and CFA showed that questions and factor loading was good. CV Scale results show clear loading and model fit at the individual level, allowing application of results beyond Pakistan. Results: By considering the CV Scale dimensions, our results highlighted three distinct technology preference clusters: i) students, with a high-power distance score, who prefer traditional face-to-face teaching methods;ii) students with low power distance and high uncertainty avoidance scores, who prefer use of e-learning on their mobile devices, and iii) students with low power distance and low uncertainty avoidance scored, who prefer to use laptop devices. Conclusions: This paper highlights that the majority of students are happy to engage with online blended learning solutions, however a one-solution fits all approach to technology use in education fail to satisfy the interaction preferences need of all student groups. Only by embracing flexible and mixed blend delivery models, supporting interaction across a range of pervasive devices, can we maximize student perception towards education service provision. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ali, S.; Gulliver, S.

The novel virus appears to be highly contagious and is rapidly spreading worldwide, becoming a pandemic. The disease is causing a high toll of deaths. Effective public health responses to a new infectious disease are expected to mitigate and counteract its negative impact on the population. However, time and economic-financial constraints, as well as uncertainty, can jeopardize the answer. The aim of the present paper was to discuss the role of Universal Health Coverage to counteract the economic impact of the COVID-19 infection. Appropriate financing of the health system and ensuring equitable access to health services for all can, indeed, protect individuals against high medical costs, which is one of the most important goals of any health system. Financing profoundly affects the performance of the health system, and any policy that the health system decides to implement or not directly depends on the amount of available funding. Developed countries are injecting new funding to cope with the disease and prevent its further transmission. In addition to psychological support and increased societal engagement for the prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19, extensive financial support to governments by the community should be considered. Developed and rich countries should support countries that do not have enough financial resources. This disease cannot be controlled and contained without international cooperation. The experience of the COVID-19 should be a lesson for further establishing and achieving universal health coverage in all countries. In addition to promoting equity in health, appropriate infrastructure should be strengthened to address these crises. Governments should make a stronger political commitment to fully implement this crucial set of policies and plans.","Behzadifar, Masoud; Imani-Nasab, Mohammad-Hasan; Martini, Mariano; Ghanbari, Mahboubeh Khaton; Bakhtiari, Ahad; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi",J Prev Med Hyg,327,21

DesignRetrospective cohort study Setting130 Dialysis Clinic, Inc (DCI) facilities ParticipantsMaintenance dialysis patients without known prior COVID-19 or a positive baseline antibody titer Exposure(s)Vaccine type and clinical characteristics Main Outcome(s)Using a semi-quantitative assay for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen, vaccine response was defined as at least one titer [≥]1 U/L between 14 and 74 days after completion of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine series. Regression analysis was used to identify characteristics associated with response. ResultsAmong 1528 patients, 437 received BNT162b2/Pfizer vaccine, 766 received mRNA-1273/Moderna, and 325 received Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen.

Epidemiological studies have identified air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection and severity of illness, in addition to numerous factors such as pre-existing conditions, aging and smoking. However, the mechanisms by which air pollution is involved in the manifestation and/or progression of COVID-19 is still unknown. In this study, we used a mouse model exposed to crude PM, collected by the cyclone method, to evaluate the pulmonary expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), the two molecules required for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into host cells. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed that exposure to PM increased the expression of these two molecules at the same site. Furthermore, image cytometry analysis revealed increased expression of these proteins, particularly, in the alveolar type 2 cells and macrophages, which are potential targets for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings provide an experimental evidence that exposure to PM may adversely affect the manifestation and progression of COVID-19, mediated by the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the site of entry. The study results suggest that examining these effects might help to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and aid the development of appropriate social interventions.","Sagawa, Tomoya; Tsujikawa, Takahiro; Honda, Akiko; Miyasaka, Natsuko; Tanaka, Michitaka; Kida, Takashi; Hasegawa, Koichi; Okuda, Tomoaki; Kawahito, Yutaka; Takano, Hirohisa",Environ Res,327,1

While SARS-CoV2 is considered a predominantly respiratory virus, we report a trend of bradycardia among hospitalized patients, particularly in association with mortality. METHODOLOGY: The multi-center retrospective analysis consisted of 1053 COVID-19 positive patients from March to August 2020. A trend of bradycardia was noted in the study population. Absolute bradycardia and profound bradycardia was defined as a sustained heart rate < 60 BPM and < 50 BPM, respectively, on two separate occasions, a minimum of 4 h apart during hospitalization. Each bradycardic event was confirmed by two physicians and exclusion criteria included: less than 18 years old, end of life bradycardia, left AMA, or taking AV Nodal blockers. Data was fetched using a SQL program through the EMR and data was analyzed using SPSS 27.0. A logistic regression was done to study the effect of bradycardia, age, gender, and BMI on mortality in the study group. RESULTS: 24.9% patients had absolute bradycardia while 13.0% had profound bradycardia. Patients with absolute bradycardia had an odds ratio of 6.59 (95% CI [2.83-15.36]) for mortality compared with individuals with a normal HR response. The logistic regression model explained 19.6% (Nagelkerke R2 ) of variance in the mortality, correctly classified 88.6% of cases, and was statistically significant X2 (5)=47.10, p < .001. For each year of age > 18, the odds of dying increased 1.048 times (95% CI [1.25-5.27]). CONCLUSION: The incidence of absolute bradycardia was found in 24.9% of the study cohort and these individuals were found to have a significant increase in mortality.","Kumar, Sabina; Arcuri, Christina; Chaudhuri, Sumanta; Gupta, Rahul; Aseri, Mahendra; Barve, Pranav; Shah, Shivang",Clin Cardiol,327,14

In the ideological dimension, media and state discourse utilized a combination of vilifying and nationalist rhetoric that framed one?s acquiescence to surveillance as a demonstration of national belonging. Meanwhile, the apps also performed ambivalent roles in facilitating essential care services and mobilizing self-tracking activities, which contributed to the manufacturing of pseudonormality in these societies.

This paper examines the enabling factors of digital transformation in the small retailers' context through the lens of stakeholder theory, deepening the knowledge about the implications of such transformations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The authors employed a mixed methodology based on a single case study, semi-structured interviews, focus groups and a survey to illustrate the dynamics behind and the impacts of the development of a digital platform created to support the commercial activity of 100 small retailer entrepreneurs located in Italy during the 2020 lockdowns. The platform has been developed in partnership with public and private local stakeholders with different degrees of involvement in the project. Findings The authors demonstrated that stakeholder relationships based on trust, engagement and empowerment are enablers of digital transformation in entrepreneurial contexts based on analogic relationships and communal sharing relational models. The authors also outlined the implications of empowerment and digital contamination among small retailers. Originality/value The authors' findings foster the understanding of digital transformation in small entrepreneurial contexts by highlighting the potential of digital transformation as a powerful bridge between the urgent call for digitalisation and the maintenance of valuable relationships with customers by small retailer entrepreneurs, supporting the creation of entrepreneurial ecosystems.","Candelo, E.; Casalegno, C.

There is an instant need to discover how the new variants interact with the host receptor (ACE2). Among the reported mutations in the Spike glycoprotein of the new variants, three are specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and required insightful scrutiny for new therapeutic options. These structural evolutions in the RBD domain may impart a critical role to the unique pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 new variants. Herein, using structural and biophysical approaches, we explored that the specific mutations in the UK (N501Y), South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y), and hypothetical (N501Y-E484K) variants alter the binding affinity, create new inter-protein contacts and changes the internal structural dynamics thereby increases the binding and eventually the infectivity. Our investigation highlighted that the South African (K417N-E484K-N501Y), Brazilian (K417T-E484K-N501Y) variants are more lethal than the UK variant (N501Y). The behavior of the wild type and N501Y is comparable. Free energy calculations further confirmed that increased binding of the spike RBD to the ACE2 is mainly due to the electrostatic contribution. Further, we find that the unusual virulence of this virus is potentially the consequence of Darwinian selection-driven epistasis in protein evolution.

In this study, we report the oncologic safety results of EABS compared with CBS. METHODS: Patients underwent EABS for breast cancer during the period June 2010 to March 2020 were collected from the EABS database from single institute, and another cohort of patients, who received CBS, were identified to determine the effectiveness and oncologic safety of EABS. A case-control study was conducted using propensity score matching (PSM) to prevent bias from cases selection. RESULTS: A total of 3426 patients were enrolled in the current study, including 405 patients receiving EABS and 3021 underwent CBS. Before PSM, patients selected for EABS tend to be smaller in tumor size, node negative, early stage, low histologic grade, and HER-2 negative. After PSM, 343 patients underwent EABS were compared with another 343 patients received CBS. The margin involved rate in EABS group is 2.6%, and 5.6% in CBS group (p = 0.054) after PSM. In breast conserving cases, the margin involved rates were 2% in EABS group, and 7.2% in CBS group (p = 0.04). In Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis, there was no difference in local regional recurrence (p = 0.89), distant metastasis (p = 0.08), and overall survival (p = 0.14). CONCLUSION: The preliminary oncologic safety analysis from current study showed EABS is a safe procedure and results in low margin involved rate, and no increase of locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis or mortality compared with CBS.","Lai, Hung-Wen; Chen, Shou-Tung; Liao, Chiung-Ying; Mok, Chi Wei; Lin, Ying-Jen; Chen, Dar-Ren; Kuo, Shou-Jen",Ann. surg. oncol,327,16

However, these studies have been mostly performed in patients admitted to the hospital and hence likely already (severely) affected. Another suggested approach uses prophylactic (H)CQ treatment aimed at preventing either severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection or the development of disease. A substantial number of clinical trials are planned or underway aimed at assessing the prophylactic benefit of (H)CQ. However, (H)CQ may lead to QT prolongation and potentially induce life-threatening arrhythmias. This may be of particular relevance to patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and those taking other QT-prolonging drugs. In addition, it is known that a certain percentage of the population carries genetic variant(s) that reduces their repolarization reserve, predisposing them to (H)CQ-induced QT prolongation, and this may be more relevant to female patients who already have a longer QT interval to start with. This review provides an overview of the current evidence on (H)CQ therapy in patients with COVID-19 and discusses different strategies for prophylactic (H)CQ therapy (ie, preinfection, postexposure, and postinfection). In particular, the potential cardiac effects, including QT prolongation and arrhythmias, will be addressed. Based on these insights, recommendations will be presented as to which preventive measures should be taken when giving (H)CQ prophylactically, including electrocardiographic monitoring.","Offerhaus, Joost A; Wilde, Arthur A M; Remme, Carol Ann",Heart Rhythm,327,26

SARS-CoV-2 enters the lungs through the ACE2 enzyme, a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Although there are no data for the lung, the expressions of RAS components in other tissues are modulated by sex hormones, androgens, and estrogens. However, there are no data on sex-specific differences in ACE2 expression. If there is a sex difference in the expression of ACE2 in the lung, this could theoretically explain the gender disparity in COVID-19 disease. More importantly, although modulation of ACE2 will certainly not provide a cure for the COVID-19 disease, modulation of ACE2 by sex hormone modulators, if they affect the expression of ACE2, could potentially be developed into a supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.","Majdic, Gregor",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,327,16

The SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into human cells through its ability to bind to a human ACE2 protein. Through our understanding of diabetic retinopathy, there are genetic-based variations in ACE2 levels that confer varying risk profiles for diabetic retinopathy. Similarly, emerging research suggests ACE2 levels confer varying risk profiles for COVID-19- Using data comparisons between geographic prevalence rates of diabetic retinopathy and existing COVID-19 mortality rates may enable improved predictions of the rates of spread of COVID-19 in various geographic regions.

METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats were divided into the following groups: no intervention, rapid restriction, regular exercise, and rapid restriction combined with regular exercise. Rats in the exercise group performed climbing exercise for 4 weeks. All rats consumed food ad libitum, and those in the rapid restriction group fasted for the last 3 days with no water on the last 1 day. RESULTS: Despite no significant differences in body weight among the groups, the kidney weight was decreased when rapid restriction and regular exercise were combined. Rapid restriction reduced the urine volume and increased the urine osmolality, whereas regular exercise did not. Rapid restriction but not regular exercise increased the levels of circulating aldosterone and the renal expression levels of the ion channel SGK-1 compared to those without rapid restriction, indicating the stimulation of RAAS. Conversely, VPS showed no significant response to these interventions. Moreover, rapid restriction combined with regular exercise induced the renal expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the active forms of apoptotic effector caspase-3 compared with the no intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Functional significance may differ between VPS and RAAS in water homeostasis in response to rapid restriction. Moreover, the combination of rapid restriction and regular exercise has potentially deleterious effects on the kidney.","Hasegawa, KazuyA; Yamaguchi, Yuya; Tanaka, Masashi",Physiol Rep,327,24

Many studies have already evaluated the clinical features of COVID-19, but how it compares with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative community-acquired pneumonia (SN-CAP) is still unclear. Moreover, COVID-19 mortality is correlated with disease severity, but indicators for severity grading have not been specified. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in comparison with SN-CAP and find indicators for disease severity in COVID-19. Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and SN-CAP were enrolled. Clinical, radiological, and laboratory data were analyzed. Results: The numbers of COVID-19 and SN-CAP patients enrolled were 304 and 138, respectively. The age of the patients was not significantly different between the groups. Compared with SN-CAP, COVID-19 patients had more symptoms of fever and dyspnea; and showed significant difference in blood count results. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of COVID-19 patients showed patchy ground-glass opacities that correlated with disease severity, whereas the CT imaging of SN-CAP patients showed patchy high-density shadows. COVID-19 patients were classified into moderate, severe, and critically severe groups. The severe and critically severe groups had elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, platelets, C-reaction protein (CRP), lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), troponin-I, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). However, they had decreased levels of lymphocytes, lymphocyte ratio, and albumin. Compared with the younger patients, the older COVID-19 individuals had more chronic diseases and significantly elevated levels of WBC, neutrophil, and CRP levels. Conclusion: SN-CAP showed more inflammatory reaction than COVID-19. Old people with chronic diseases are more susceptible to COVID-19 and have a high likelihood of developing severe and critically severe infection. Levels of WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CRP, NLR, PLR, troponin-I, creatinine, and BUN are important indicators for severity grading in COVID-19.","Zhou, Yutian; Guo, Shujin; He, Ye; Zuo, Qiunan; Liu, Danju; Xiao, Meng; Fan, Jinxiu; Li, Xiaohui",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,327,20

Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19 infection, two recent studies demonstrate that kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common, and that kidney involvement is associated with high risk of in-hospital death. Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.","Post, Adrian; Dullaart, Robin P F; Bakker, Stephan J L",Virus Res,327,3

Too high share of receivables that are not settled in a timely manner can result in various problems for enterprises, including, in particular, financial problems that can lead to large-scale bankruptcy. Considering a huge number of connections between individual entities, the bankruptcy of one may pose a risk of a wave of bankruptcy of others. The paper aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the payment situation of Polish enterprises. The research was conducted on the basis of an analysis of data on the payment situation of Polish enterprises from selected industries. Basic descriptive statistics was used in the study to characterize the material. The nonparametric Wilcoxon pair order test, which is the equivalent of the Student's t-test for related variables, was used for the research. The research proved that at enterprises from almost every industry, the value of debts at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was higher than in the first quarter. It can therefore be concluded that the outbreak of the pandemic contributed to an increase in arrears, which, in turn, resulted in an increased risk of doing business. The greater the share of arrears with contractors, the greater the risk of financial problems at the enterprise, and hence the increased risk of bankruptcy. © 2021 Robert Dankiewicz, Bartłomiej Balawejder, Tomasz Tomczyk, Viktor Trynchuk.","Dankiewicz, R.; Balawejder, B.; Tomczyk, T.; Trynchuk, V.",Investment Management and Financial Innovations,327,24

Pre-pandemic, such changes would have been considered potentially unsafe. This study outlines the impact of lockdown on the incidence and management of ENT emergencies at a large UK centre. METHODS: After modification of pre-pandemic guidelines, ENT emergency referrals data during the UK lockdown were prospectively captured. A comparative analysis was performed with retrospective data from a corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: An overall reduction (p < 0.001) in emergency referrals (n = 119) and admissions (n = 18) occurred during the lockdown period compared to the 2019 period (432 referrals and 290 admissions). Specifically, there were reduced admission rates for epistaxis (p < 0.0001) and tonsillar infection (p < 0.005) in the lockdown period. During lockdown, 90 per cent of patients requiring non-dissolvable nasal packing were managed as out-patients. CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 compelled modifications to pre-pandemic ENT guidelines. The enforced changes to emergency care appear to be safe and successfully adopted. Arguably, the measures have both economic and patient-related implications post-coronavirus disease 2019 and during future similar pandemics and lockdowns.","Stansfield, J; Dobbs, S; Harrison, R; Lee, K; Sharma, S; Okour, K; Agrawal, S; Miah, M S",J Laryngol Otol,327,16

To counteract this, actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders have been used termed as lockdown. This study aims to study lifestyle, behaviour, perception and practice of people regarding during the lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with structured questionnaire in Google forms after ethical approval from Nepal Health Research Council (Ref-2631). The attributes of knowledge, attitude and practices were explored using multiple-choice questions and results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-five respondents completed the survey with 280 (50.5%) males and 275 (49.5%) female. The knowledge regarding viral pandemic was increased in 496 (89.3%) respondents. 424 (76.4%) people developed stress due to pandemic. Three hundred fifty three (63.6%) were adversely affected by professional works or suffered economic loss in business. More than 42% participants are using their time for study in personal development, online classes etc. Conclusions: The knowledge of viral pandemic as well as personal hygiene habits have improved in majority of people but many also developed stress. They were convinced that lockdown lowered transmission of infection which in turn affected lifestyle behaviour and practices. Practicing social distancing becomes too difficult for the poor in the absence of proper social security system and government support. E-Learning has become more acceptable due to lockdown. Further studies with in-person interviews are warranted.","Kandel, Samikshya; Lamsal, Mahesh; Yadav, Saroj Adhikari; Bhandari, Dipak; Adhikari, Ganesh; Poudel, Sagar; Sharma, Pawan; Gautam, Swotantra",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,327,16

This article describes a hospital-based transport team's experience with interfacility transport of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: A retrospective study of transports for respiratory failure caused by SARS-CoV-2 was performed. All transports were performed by a single critical care transport team. The team was already trained in advanced mechanical ventilation, blood gas interpretation, and management of shock. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was followed regarding the use of personal protective equipment. RESULTS: Twenty patients were enrolled. The average patient age was 47 years (standard deviation [SD]â¯=â¯12 years). The average Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 10 (SDâ¯=â¯4) and 24 (SDâ¯=â¯7), respectively.

(Special section: From the FIGO Safe Motherhood & Newborn Health Committee.),20.901047,4.2822413,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The unprecedented worldwide social distancing response to COVID-19 resulted in a quick reversal of escalating case numbers. Recently, local governments globally have begun to relax social distancing regulations. Using the situation in Manitoba, Canada as an example, we estimated the impact that social distancing relaxation may have on the pandemic. METHODS: We fit a mathematical model to empirically estimated numbers of people infected, recovered, and died from COVID-19 in Manitoba. We then explored the impact of social distancing relaxation on: (a) time until near elimination of COVID-19 (< one case per million), (b) time until peak prevalence, (c) proportion of the population infected within one year, (d) peak prevalence, and (e) deaths within one year. RESULTS: Assuming a closed population, near elimination of COVID-19 in Manitoba could have been achieved in 4-6 months (by July or August) if there were no relaxation of social distancing. Relaxing to 15% of pre-COVID effective contacts may extend the local epidemic for more than two years (median 2.1). Relaxation to 50% of pre-COVID effective contacts may result in a peak prevalence of 31-38% of the population, within 3-4 months of initial relaxation. CONCLUSION: Slight relaxation of social distancing may immensely impact the pandemic duration and expected peak prevalence. Only holding the course with respect to social distancing may have resulted in near elimination before Fall of 2020; relaxing social distancing to 15% of pre-COVID-19 contacts will flatten the epidemic curve but greatly extend the duration of the pandemic.","Shafer, Leigh Anne; Nesca, Marcello; Balshaw, Robert",PLoS One,327,24

Acute psychological effects of quarantine in frail elderly subjects with special needs, such as patients with dementia, have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to assess modifications of neuropsychiatric symptoms during quarantine in patients with dementia and their caregivers. Methods: This is a sub-study of a multicenter nation-wide survey. A structured telephone interview was delivered to family caregivers of patients with diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VD), followed regularly at 87 Italian memory clinics. Variations in behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) were collected after 1 month since quarantine declaration and associations with disease type, severity, gender, and caregiver’s stress burden were analyzed. Results: A total of 4,913 caregivers participated in the survey. Increased BPSD was reported in 59.6% of patients as worsening of preexisting symptoms (51.9%) or as new onset (26%), and requested drug modifications in 27.6% of these cases. Irritability, apathy, agitation, and anxiety were the most frequently reported worsening symptoms and sleep disorder and irritability the most frequent new symptoms. Profile of BPSD varied according to dementia type, disease severity, and patients’ gender. Anxiety and depression were associated with a diagnosis of AD (OR 1.35, CI: 1.12–1.62), mild to moderate disease severity and female gender. DLB was significantly associated with a higher risk of worsening hallucinations (OR 5.29, CI 3.66–7.64) and sleep disorder (OR 1.69, CI 1.25–2.29), FTD with wandering (OR 1.62, CI 1.12–2.35), and change of appetite (OR 1.52, CI 1.03–2.25). Stress-related symptoms were experienced by two-thirds of caregivers and were associated with increased patients’ neuropsychiatric burden (p&lt;0.0001). Conclusion: Quarantine induces a rapid increase of BPSD in approximately 60% of patients and stress-related symptoms in two-thirds of caregivers. Health services need to plan a post-pandemic strategy in order to address these emerging needs.","Cagnin, Annachiara; Di Lorenzo, Raffaele; Marra, Camillo; Bonanni, Laura; Cupidi, Chiara; Laganà, Valentina; Rubino, Elisa; Vacca, Alessandro; Provero, Paolo; Isella, Valeria; Vanacore, Nicola; Agosta, Federica; Appollonio, Ildebrando; Caffarra, Paolo; Pettenuzzo, Ilaria; Sambati, Renato; Quaranta, Davide; Guglielmi, Valeria; Logroscino, Giancarlo; Filippi, Massimo; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Ferrarese, Carlo; Rainero, Innocenzo; Bruni, Amalia C.",Front.

It can beaudio, visual, or text. Its use has increased dramatically during theCOVID-19 pandemic to ensure patient and healthcare worker safety.Any healthcare professional can engage with it. It carries benefits likereduced stress and expense of traveling, maintenance of socialdistancing, and reduced risk of infection. There are some potentialdrawbacks such as lack of physical examination, liability andtechnological issues.MethodsA questionnaire was sent to 200 patients, selected from differentvirtual clinics (new and review, doctor and ANP led) run betweenMarch and May 2020 in the rheumatology department of UniversityHospital Waterford. We formulated 14 questions to cover the followingaspects: demography, the purpose of the consult, punctuality, feedback, medico-legal concerns, and free text for comments. A selfaddressed return envelope was included.Results83 responses were received. 2 were excluded. The ratio of females tomale respondents was 59: 41, with the majority over 60 years old. Themain appointment type was review 67 (83%). 80% of patients werecalled either before or at the time of their scheduled appointment. Thevast majority (98.8%) of our patients had confidence in our dataprotection and trusted our system to maintain their confidentiality.95% stated that they felt comfortable, were given enough time toexplain their health problem and felt free from stress. The respondentswho preferred attending the clinic in person (17 in total) compared tothe virtual were mostly follow up patients- 12 vs. 5 new.ConclusionPatient satisfaction among those surveyed was high, despite having tointroduce the service abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thereare many improvements we can adopt to improve our service andeven maintain after the pandemic as a way of communicating with ourstable patients. As we are covering a large geographical catchment, we can continue to implement the virtual clinic for some appointments.We should prioritize our efforts on identifying the right patient and thetype of service we can offer, further training of staff, and increasingawareness of the patients as to how to get the most out of a virtualappointment.","Altamimi, F.

The Call of Louisa Jordan: The Formation of the Spiritual Care Team at NHS Louisa Jordan, Glasgow, Scotland",20.59571,4.4221396,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic it is crucial for hospitals to implement infection prevention strategies to reduce nosocomial transmission to the lowest possible number. This is all the more important because molecular tests for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are uncertain, and the resources available for them are limited. In this view, a monocentric, retrospective study with an interventional character was conducted to investigate the extent to which the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mask requirement and daily screening for suspicious patients has an impact on the SARS-CoV-2 nosocomial rate in the pandemic environment. METHODS: All inpatients from a maximum care hospital in Regensburg (Bavaria) between March 1st and June 10th 2020 were included. Patient with respiratory symptoms were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at admission, patients were managed according to a standard hygiene protocol. At the end of March a strict hygiene bundle was introduced including a general mask obligation and a daily clinical screening of inpatients for respiratory symptoms. Nosocomial infection rate for COVID-19 and the risk for infection transmission estimated by the nosocomial incidence density before and after introduction the hygiene bundle were compared. The infection pressure for the hospital during the entire observational period was characterized by the infection reports in the region in relation to the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the number of infected employees. RESULTS: In fact, after the introduction of a strict hygiene bundle including a general mouth and nose protection obligation and a daily clinical screening of suspicious patients, a significant reduction of the nosocomial rate from 0.28 to 0.06 (p = 0.026) was observed. Furthermore, the risk of spreading hospital-acquired infections also decreased dramatically from 0.0007 to 0.00018 (p = 0.031; rate ratio after/before 0.25 (95%CI 0.06, 1.07) despite a slow decrease of the hospital COVID 19-prevalence and an increase of infected employees. CONCLUSION: The available data underline that a strict hygiene bundle seem to be associated with a decrease of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the pandemic situation.","Ambrosch, Andreas; Rockmann, Felix; Klawonn, Frank; Lampl, Benedikt",J Infect Public Health,327,14

SETTING: Nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital payment and cost data. DESIGN: Retrospective review and economic impact analysis. METHODS: The Nationwide Ambulatory Surgery Sample (NASS) was used to identify ophthalmic surgical procedures and associated charges that were performed at HOPDs. The highest volume elective ophthalmic procedures were identified. The total hospital cost and payment amount was calculated for each procedure using the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Net facility income (estimated payments less OPPS rates) was determined for each elective surgical procedure category and also stratified by hospital teaching status. RESULTS: In 2017, elective cataract, strabismus, and keratoplasty surgeries were performed 1,230,992 times at HOPDs. The total cost of these elective surgeries was 2,350 million USD, with a total hospital payment of 3,624-3,786 million USD. This led to an estimated net income of 1,278-1,440 million USD overall to U.S. hospitals in the NASS dataset from elective ophthalmic surgery (approximately 107-120 million USD per month), with a larger proportion performed in teaching hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: The cessation of elective ophthalmic surgeries at HOPDs during COVID-19 resulted in a significant loss of income for hospitals in the U.S. as well as teaching experiences for trainees at academic medical centers.","Fliotsos, Michael J; Best, Matthew J; Field, Matthew G; Srikumaran, Uma; Repka, Michael X; Woreta, Fasika A; Srikumaran, Divya",J Cataract Refract Surg,327,16

Preterm births contribute upto 10% of all births and incur significant impact on the child health and cost to the health care system. However, the association of city lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic with the rate of preterm births is unclear. In a cohort study, we examined the association of city lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic with the births at different gestations in three different cities. Compared with the pre-pandemic epoch, the associative relationships ranged from a decrease in all births, all births across all preterm gestations and to preterm births in moderately and late preterm gestations. We concluded that there were variable associative relationships of city lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic with preterm births. This could be related to the differences in health, societal and cultural factors, which will inspire further studies in this area.","Cheung, P.

To facilitate prospective surveillance for such evolution, we map how convalescent plasma antibodies are impacted by all mutations to the spike's receptor-binding domain (RBD), the main target of plasma neutralizing activity. Binding by polyclonal plasma antibodies is affected by mutations in three main epitopes in the RBD, but longitudinal samples reveal that the impact of these mutations on antibody binding varies substantially both among individuals and within the same individual over time. Despite this inter- and intra-person heterogeneity, the mutations that most reduce antibody binding usually occur at just a few sites in the RBD's receptor-binding motif. The most important site is E484, where neutralization by some plasma is reduced >10-fold by several mutations, including one in the emerging 20H/501Y.V2 and 20J/501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

A significantly higher rate of COVID-19 cases were employed as essential workers (45% vs 19%, p = 9x10-12). COVID-19 cases reporting a fever were more likely to require hospitalization (categorized as severe;OR = 4.4 [95% CI: 1.6-12.5, p = 0.005]) whereas respondents reporting rhinorrhea was less likely to require hospitalization (categorized as mild-to-moderate;OR = 0.16 [95% CI: 0.04-0.73, p = 0.018]).

During the Executive Order in Michigan, African Americans, women, and the lowest income group reported worsening health behaviors and higher overall concern for the potential detrimental effects of the pandemic. The higher risk of contracting COVID-19 observed among African Americans may be due to the increased rates of working as essential employees, lower socioeconomic status, and exposure to known positive cases.

Our study was undertaken to further understand hMPV-associated illness, compare clinical characteristics of hMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and establish the utility of routine screening for hMPV. We retrospectively identified hMPV-associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast Michigan during the 2006–2007 respiratory viral season. A convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hMPV. A medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hMPV, comparing them to RSV-positive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hMPV and RSV. We found that hMPV was the second most commonly identified virus after RSV. hMPV-positive patients were older than RSV-positive patients. Among hMPV-positive patients, pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2%, peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5%, antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2%, and admission to the ICU was seen in 37.5%. Finally, hMPV-positive patients were more likely to have fever than RSV-positive patients or patients negative for hMPV and RSV. We concluded that hMPV is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as RSV but in a slightly older population.

There are no available data in temporal trends of vaccination coverage rates in both influenza and pneumococcal vaccines among Thai patients with T2DM. AIM: This study aimed to elucidate influenza and pneumococcal vaccination trends and to identify factors that affect vaccination rates in those patients. METHOD: A retrospective study of randomly medical records stratified by 13 diabetologists was conducted in patients with T2DM from 2010-2018 at Theptarin Hospital, a private multi-disciplinary diabetes center in Bangkok. Adherence to influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations according to current guidance on adult immunization in Thailand had been studied. The rate of both vaccinations from each diabetologist had also been recorded. RESULTS: A total of 2,114 medical records (female 51.7%, mean age 65.2±12.8 years, BMI 26.5±4.6 kg/m(2), A1C 7.1±1.3%, median duration of diabetes 13 years) were retrospectively reviewed covering a 9-year period. We audited 3,554 selected outpatient visits for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations rates as key performance index in each year. The overall vaccination rate was 39.6% for influenza, 17.4% for the pneumococcal vaccine, and only 13.7%, for both vaccines. The trends of influenza vaccination rates increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 52.2% in 2018 but the trends of pneumococcal vaccination rates were relatively stable at less than 20%. The rate of both vaccinations varied considerably from 0-44% among our diabetologists. Age ≥ 65 years, duration of DM ≥ 15 years, the presence of chronic respiratory disease, and moderate to severe Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score were positively associated with both received vaccinations.

Iran was one of the first countries outside China to be affected in a major way and is now under the spell of a fourth wave. This study aims to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in north-eastern Iran through mapping the spatiotemporal trend of the disease. METHODS: The study comprises data of 4000 patients diagnosed by laboratory assays or clinical investigation from the beginning of the disease on Feb 14, 2020, until May 11, 2020. Epidemiological features and spatiotemporal trends of the disease in the study area were explored by classical statistical approaches and Geographic Information Systems. RESULTS: Most common symptoms were dyspnoea (69.4%), cough (59.4%), fever (54.4%) and weakness (19.5%). Approximately 82% of those who did not survive suffered from dyspnoea. The highest Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was related to those with cardiovascular disease (27.9%) and/or diabetes (18.1%). Old age (≥60 years) was associated with an almost five-fold increased CFR. Odds Ratio (OR) showed malignancy (3.8), nervous diseases (2.2), and respiratory diseases (2.2) to be significantly associated with increased CFR with developments, such as hospitalization at the ICU (2.9) and LOS (1.1) also having high correlations. Furthermore, spatial analyses revealed a geographical pattern in terms of both incidence and mortality rates, with COVID-19 first being observed in suburban areas from where the disease swiftly spread into downtown reaching a peak between 25 February to 06 March (4 incidences per km(2)). Mortality peaked 3 weeks later after which the infection gradually decreased. Out of patients investigated by the spatiotemporal approach (n = 727), 205 (28.2%) did not survive and 66.8% of them were men. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults and people with severe co-morbidities were at higher risk for developing serious complications due to COVID-19.

Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens.","Rashid, Md Tahmid; Wang, Dong",Artif Intell Rev,327,1

Disasters generate (i) direct economic losses due to reduced production in the locations where they occur, and (ii) to indirect losses from the supply shortages and demand changes that cascade along the supply chains. Firms can use inventories to reduce their risk of shortages. Since firms are interconnected through the supply chain, the level of inventory hold by one firm influences the risk of shortages of the others. Such interdependencies lead to systemic risks in supply chain networks. We introduce a stylized model of complex supply-chain networks in which firms adjust their inventory to maximize profit. We analyze the resulting risks and inventory patterns using evolutionary game theory. We report the following findings. Inventories significantly reduce disruption cascades and indirect losses at the expense of a moderate increase in direct losses. The more fragmented a supply chain is, the less beneficial it is for individual firms to maintain inventories, resulting in higher systemic risks. One way to mitigate such systemic risks is to prescribe inventory sizes to individual firms—a measure that could, for instance, be fostered by insurers. We found that prescribing firm-specific inventory sizes based on their position in the supply chain mitigates systemic risk more effectively than setting the same inventory requirements for all firms.","Colon, Célian; Brännström, Åke; Rovenskaya, Elena; Dieckmann, Ulf",PLoS One,327,23

The COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on communities of racial/ethnic minority groups in the US where long-standing health issues and structural inequities are now known to have resulted in increased risk for infection, severe illness, and death from the virus. The objective of our study was to describe demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, medical interventions and outcomes of pediatric patients with COVID-19 treated at Children’s Hospital of Michigan (CHM), a tertiary care center in urban Detroit, an early hotspot during the initial surge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed of children ≤18 years of age who had polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing via NP swab or serum IgG antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 during March 1, 2020–June 30, 2020. Results. Seventy-eight COVID-19 infected children were identified of whom 85.8% (67/78) were from minority populations (African American, Hispanic). Hospitalization rate was 82% (64/78). About 44% (34/78) had an associated comorbidity with asthma and obesity being most common. Although all ages were affected, infants <1 year of age had the highest hospitalization rate (19/64, 30%). In all disease severity categories, dichotomized non-whites had more severe disease by percentage within race/ethnicity than Whites, and also within percent disease severity (P-value = .197). Overall, 37% of hospitalized patients required intensive care. Conclusions. Extremely high rates of COVID-19 hospitalization and requirement of ICU care were identified in our patient population.

Previous studies have shown that some mutations in the open reading frames (ORF) 3c and 7b and the spike (S) gene have implications for the development of FIP, but mainly indirectly, likely also due to their association with systemic spread. The aim of the present study was to determine whether FCoV detected in organs of experimentally FCoV infected healthy cats carry some of these mutations. Viral RNA isolated from different tissues of seven asymptomatic cats infected with the field strains FCoV Zu1 or FCoV Zu3 was sequenced. Deletions in the 3c gene and mutations in the 7b and S genes that have been shown to have implications for the development of FIP were not detected, suggesting that these are not essential for systemic viral dissemination. However, deletions and single nucleotide polymorphisms leading to truncations were detected in all nonstructural proteins. These were found across all analyzed ORFs, but with significantly higher frequency in ORF 7b than ORF 3a. Additionally, a previously unknown homologous recombination site was detected in FCoV Zu1.","Lutz, Mirjam; Steiner, Aline R.; Cattori, Valentino; Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina; Lutz, Hans; Kipar, Anja; Meli, Marina L.",Pathogens,327,24

This report describes the secular trends in HCAI at the NTUH over the past 27 years according to site of infection, aetiological agents and control measures. Clinical and microbiological data were collected by infection prevention and control nurses using a standardised case-record form. Specific control programmes were implemented and/or intensified as needed. Poisson or negative binomial regression analysis was used to quantify time trends of the incidence of HCAI. The annual number of discharges increased from 25 074 to 91 234 with a parallel increase in the Charlson comorbidity index. Active HCAI surveillance and periodic feedback were associated with a marked decrease in surgical site infections from 1981 to 2007 (2.5 vs 0.5 episodes per 100 procedures, P < 0.0001). On the other hand, there was a 4.8-fold increase in bloodstream infections (BSIs) (0.39 vs 1.88 episodes per 100 discharges, P < 0.0001). The average annual increase of pathogen-specific HCAI incidence during 1981–2007 was 11.4% for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 75.4% for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDRAB), and 7.5% for Candida albicans (P < 0.0001, respectively). The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes, and decreases in rates of HCAI, BSI, MRSA and XDRAB were observed. This long term study demonstrates the need to couple surveillance of HCAI with focused control programmes.

Serum-virus neutralizing antibody (SVN) test titers were measured in colostrum and pigs at the next farrowing, and additional vaccination of sows prior to the third farrowing led to elevated SVN titers in serum, colostrum and all pigs. Six pigs from vaccinated sows challenged at 8 to 9 days of age with 1 × 106 TCID50 EEEV did not develop the high temperatures or signs of central nervous system disease that 6 pigs from non-vaccinated sows developed. Virus was isolated from blood and oropharyngeal swabs from all pigs from non-vaccinated sows with blood virus titers as high as 9.3 × 104 TCID50, while only low levels of virus were detected in blood and oropharyngeal swabs from pigs from vaccinated sows. Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.","Elvinger, François; Baldwin, Charles A.; Liggett, Alan D.; Tang, Kai N.; Dove, C.Robert",Veterinary Microbiology,327,10

The goal of our study was to test whether pandemic-related stress was associated with food intake, and whether relationships between stress and intake were modified by appetitive and cognitive traits. (2) Methods: We cross-sectionally surveyed 428 adults to examine current intake frequency of various food types (sweets/desserts, savory snacks, fast food, fruits, and vegetables), changes to food intake during the pandemic, emotional overeating (EOE), cognitive flexibility (CF), and COVID-19-related stress. Models tested associations of stress, EOE, and CF with food intake frequency and changes to intake. (3) Results: Models demonstrated that the positive relationship between stress and intake of sweets/desserts was stronger with higher EOE, while the positive relationship between stress and intake of chips/savory snacks was weaker with higher CF. Higher EOE was associated with greater risk of increased intake of palatable foods. (4) Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotional overeating may escalate stress-associated intake of high-sugar foods, and cognitive flexibility may attenuate stress-associated intake of high-fat foods. Differences in appetitive and cognitive traits may explain changes to and variability in food intake during COVID-19, and efforts to decrease emotional overeating and encourage cognitive flexibility could help lessen the effect of COVID-19-related stress on energy dense food intake.","Sadler, Jennifer R.; Thapaliya, Gita; Jansen, Elena; Aghababian, Anahys H.; Smith, Kimberly R.; Carnell, Susan",Nutrients,327,20

The purpose of this manuscript is to review a multi-institutional clinical experience in 200 consecutive patients at 29 hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 supported with ECMO. Methods This analysis includes our first 200 COVID-19 patients with complete data who were supported with and separated from ECMO. These patients were cannulated between March 17 and December 9, 2020. Differences by mortality group were assessed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests and Welch’s ANOVA for continuous variables. Results Median ECMO time was 15 days (IQR=9-28). All 200 patients have separated from ECMO: 90 patients (45%) survived and 110 patients (55%) died. Survival with veno-venous ECMO was 87 of 188 patients (46.3%), while survival with veno-arterial ECMO was 3 of 12 patients (25%). Of 90 survivors, 77 have been discharged from the hospital and 13 remain hospitalized at the ECMO-providing hospital. Survivors had lower median age (47 versus 56 years, p<0.001) and shorter median time interval from diagnosis to ECMO cannulation (8 days versus 12 days, p=0.003).In the 90 survivors, adjunctive therapies on ECMO included: intravenous steroids (64), Remdesivir (49), convalescent plasma (43), anti-interleukin-6 receptor blockers (39), prostaglandin (33), and hydroxychloroquine (22). Conclusions ECMO facilitates survival of select critically ill patients with COVID-19. Survivors tend to be younger and have a shorter duration from diagnosis to cannulation. Substantial variation exists in drug treatment of COVID-19, but ECMO offers a reasonable rescue strategy.","Jacobs, Jeffrey P.; Stammers, Alfred H.; St. Louis, James D.; Hayanga, J. W.

Evidence shows that chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11 and their receptor CXCR3 are involved in severity of dengue, but their genetic association with the susceptibility of vascular leakage during dengue infection has not been reported. We genotyped 14 common variants of these candidate genes in 176 patients infected with dengue. rs4859584 and rs8878 (CXCL10) were significantly associated with vascular permeability of dengue infection (P < 0.05); while variants of CXCL11 showed moderate significance of association (P = 0.0527). Haplotype blocks were constructed for genes CXCL10 and CXCL11 (5 and 7 common variants respectively). Haplotype association tests performed revealed that, “CCCCA” of gene CXCL10 and “AGTTTAC” of CXCL11 were found to be significantly associated with vascular leakage (P = 0.0154 and 0.0366 respectively).

Regression models estimated that early administration (≤5 days after admission) of IFN-α2b was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality compared to no IFN-α2b, while late administration of IFN-α2b was associated with increased mortality. Among survivors, early IFN-α2b was not associated with hospital discharge or CT scan improvement, while late IFN-α2b was associated with delayed recovery. Additionally, early IFN-α2b and umifenovir (UFV) alone or together were associated with reduced mortality and accelerated recovery compared to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) alone.

Currently, there is scarce literature on safety outcomes after bariatric surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection and associated complications during the first 30 days after bariatric surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study including all patients who consecutively underwent primary bariatric surgery between August and December 2020. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included. Median age and BMI were 36 (17–70) years and 38 (35–41) kg/m(2), respectively. Forty percent of patients were women (n = 76), 59.3% (n = 112) underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and 40.7% (n = 77) underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). All surgeries were performed laparoscopically. The median length of postoperative stay was 2 (0–5) days. Postoperative COVID-19 infection was detected in two patients (1.1%): one patient was readmitted without the need of intermediate or ICU care, and the other was managed as an outpatient. Major complications occurred in three patients (1.6%); none of them was COVID-19 related. Two patients required an unplanned reoperation. No patient required intermediate or ICU care, no severe COVID-19 complications were observed, and no mortality was reported. CONCLUSION: Bariatric surgery can be safely performed during the ongoing pandemic, albeit a low risk of COVID-19 symptomatic infection. Rigorous perioperative COVID-19 institutional protocols are required to perform bariatric surgery safely during the current pandemic.

Currently, the assessment of immune response after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is scarce. A total of 52 healthcare workers were immunized with the same lot of BNT162b2 vaccine. The immunological response against the vaccine was tested using a T-specific assay based on the expression of CD25 and CD134 after stimulation with anti-N, -S, and -M specific peptides of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, IgG anti-S2 and -RBD antibodies were detected using ELISA. Furthermore, the cell subsets involved in the response to the vaccine were measured in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. Humoral-specific responses against the vaccine were detected in 94% and 100% after the first and second doses, respectively. Therefore, anti-S T-specific responses were observed in 57% and 90% of the subjects after the first and second doses of the vaccine, respectively. Thirty days after the second dose, significant increases in T helper 1 memory cells (p < 0.001), peripheral memory T follicular helper (pT(FH)) cells (p < 0.032), and switched memory (p = 0.005) were observed.

B cells had a similar pattern of activation/exhaustion, with increased frequency of CD69 and CD95 during hospitalization, followed by an increase in PD1 frequencies in non-hospitalized individuals. Interestingly, many of these changes were found to increase over time in non-hospitalized longitudinal samples, suggesting a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in T-cell activation/exhaustion in non-hospitalized patients were found to positively correlate with age. Severely infected individuals had increased expression of activation and exhaustion markers. These data suggest a prolonged period of immune dysregulation following SARS-CoV-2 infection highlighting the need for additional studies investigating immune dysregulation in convalescent individuals.","Files, J.

The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (CTSI) spans three major and preeminent universities, four large academic campuses across the state of Indiana, and is mandate to provide best practices to a whole state. METHODS: To address the need to facilitate the availability of innovative technologies to its investigators, the Indiana CTSI implemented the Access Technology Program (ATP). The activities of the ATP, or any program of the Indiana CTSI, are challenged to connect technologies and investigators on the multiple Indiana CTSI campuses by the geographical distances between campuses (1–4 hr driving time). RESULTS: Herein, we describe the initiatives developed by the ATP to increase the availability of state-of-the-art technologies to its investigators on all Indiana CTSI campuses, and the methods developed by the ATP to bridge the distance between campuses, technologies, and investigators for the advancement of clinical translational research.

METHODS: As part of the experimental paradigm, participants were randomly assigned to read a fictitious news article about the utility of PPE (i.e., pro-PPE, anti-PPE, or neutral), and then rate images of a police officer using different items of PPE (i.e., masks, goggles, face shields, and/or medical gloves) along eight dimensions. RESULTS: The analyses reveal that participants overwhelmingly perceived the use of PPE as both important and beneficial, regardless of condition. The analyses also reveal that the use of PPE impacted perceptions of the pictured officer, but that the specific perceptual effects of such PPE varied by the item used. CONCLUSIONS: Police worldwide have attempted to reduce the risks associated with COVID-19 by using PPE.

The confinement of the population and the rising epidemic has disrupted the routine care for non-COVID-19 patients. Telehealth is a growing field, and its application in palliative care is seen as a solution to serve the population in this difficult crisis. METHODOLOGY: A exploratory survey was designed to assess the changes in the hospital-based practice of palliative care in the COVID-19 pandemic and patient/caregiver's perception about the provision of telehealth services to palliative care patients of a tertiary care cancer hospital of eastern India. RESULTS: There was a dramatic reduction in the outpatient clinic footfalls by 51% with teleconsultation. Although there was no change in the number of emergency visits, the inpatient admissions reduced by 44%. Nearly 82% of patient/caregivers gave a positive feedback about telemedicine care provided by the department and mentioned that the service provided them with support and connectedness. Almost 64% of the patients and caregivers reported that the service helped allay the fear and reassured them that there was a someone to support them. As high as 76% of the participants felt that they would prefer teleconsultation in future and were ready to pay for teleconsultations if charges were to be applied in the future. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine is an important tool and an essential service to care for palliative care patients in the community especially when the patient and health-care professionals are separated by a pandemic or natural disaster.","Atreya, Shrikant; Kumar, Gaurav; Samal, Jyotiprakash; Bhattacharya, Moitri; Banerjee, Shabnam; Mallick, Pallab; Chakraborty, Debratna; Gupta, Sunipa; Sarkar, Saswati",Indian J Palliat Care,327,23

Identification of biomarkers associated with ARDS risk may guide clinical diagnosis and prognosis. OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the association of blood metabolites with ARDS risk and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, data from the Molecular Epidemiology of ARDS (MEARDS) study, a prospective cohort of 403 patients with ARDS and 1227 non-ARDS controls, were analyzed. Patients were recruited in intensive care units (ICUs) at Massachusetts General Hospital and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, both in Boston, Massachusetts, from January 1, 1998, to December 31, 2014. Data analysis was performed from December 9, 2018, to January 4, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants were followed up daily for ARDS development defined by Berlin criteria, requiring fulfillment of chest radiograph and oxygenation criteria on the same calendar day during invasive ventilatory assistance. A 2-stage study design was used to explore novel metabolites associated with ARDS risk and survival. RESULTS: Of the 1630 participants from MEARDS who were admitted to the ICU , 403 (24.7%) were diagnosed with ARDS (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [17.0] years; 251 [62.3%] male) and 1227 (75.3%) were at-risk but did not have ARDS (mean [SD] age, 62.3 [16.9] years; 753 [61.4%] male). Mendelian randomization suggested that genetically regulated serum mannose was associated with ARDS risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.53-0.78; P = 7.46 × 10(−6)) in the discovery stage. In the functional validation stage incorporating 83 participants with ARDS and matched at-risk participants in the control group from the ICU, the protective association of mannose with ARDS risk was validated (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.97; P = .03). Furthermore, serum mannose was associated with 28-day (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.11-0.56; P = 6.95 × 10(−4)) and 60-day (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.19-0.71; P = 3.12 × 10(−3)) mortality and 28-day (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32-0.74; P = 6.41 × 10(−4)) and 60-day (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P = 2.11 × 10(−3)) survival. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, genetically regulated serum mannose appeared to be associated with ARDS risk and outcome, and increased serum mannose at admission was associated with reduced ARDS risk and better survival. These findings could inform prevention and clinical intervention in ARDS cases, which have increased with the expansion of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Wei, Yongyue; Huang, Hui; Zhang, Ruyang; Zhu, Zhaozhong; Zhu, Ying; Lin, Lijuan; Dong, Xuesi; Wei, Liangmin; Chen, Xin; Liu, Zhonghua; Zhao, Yang; Su, Li; Chen, Feng; Christiani, David C.",JAMA Netw Open,327,8

At the beginning of the pandemic, many physicians asked themselves what risk their patients, especially those with chronic diseases, were exposed to. We present an overview of all patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and SARS-CoV-2 infection published in the literature so far. In total, there are publications on 873 SARS-CoV-2 positive MS patients and information on the outcome can be given for 700 patients. With regard to the different disease modifying therapies (DMTs), by far the most cases were described under anti-CD20 treatment (n = 317). The mortality rate of all MS patients was 4% and a further 3% required invasive or non-invasive ventilation. When looking at the severe and fatal cases, it is particularly noticeable that patients without DMTs, with previous cardiovascular diseases, or with a severe degree of disability are at risk. Immunosuppressive therapy itself does not appear to be a substantial risk factor. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that the therapies could be protective, either directly, by mitigating the cytokine storm, or indirectly, by reducing the disease activity of MS.","Möhn, Nora; Konen, Franz F.; Pul, Refik; Kleinschnitz, Christoph; Prüss, Harald; Witte, Torsten; Stangel, Martin; Skripuletz, Thomas",J Clin Med,327,30

We draw on literature of agriculture innovations to provide a framework that takes into account process-driven and structural change occurring across multiple levels of governance, as well as different phases of scaling. We hypothesize that successful scaling requires engagement with all aspects of a governing regime, coalescing a range of actors, and therefore, is an enterprise that is larger than its parts.

Sequence specificity was ensured by both the ligation process and Cas13a/crRNA recognition, allowing us to identify viral RNA mutation. Light-up RNA aptamer allows sensitive output of amplification signals via target-activated ribonuclease activity of CRISPR-Cas13a. The RNA virus assay has been designed to detect coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and SARS, as well as the influenza viruses such as, H1N1, H7N9, and H9N2. It was accommodated to sense as low as 82 copies of SARS-CoV-2. Particularly, it allowed us to strictly discriminate key mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 variant, D614G, which may induce higher epidemic and pathogenetic risk.

Special attention is payed to immunocompromised patients with whom the virus is feared to be more aggressive . Our aim was to assess outcomes in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy who presented with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS- CoV-2) infection. METHOD: we monitored patients undergoing immunosuppressive regimens who presented with SARS- CoV-2 infection during a four months period from September to December 2020 in the Nephrology department of Charles Nicolle’s Teaching Hospital. The diagnosis was made through nasopharyngygeal swabs. Kidney transplant patients were not included. RESULTS: we identified 9 patients who presented a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (details are shown in figure 1). Age varied from 32 to 67 years. Gender ratio was 0,8. Six patients had hypertension and one patient had diabetes. Seven patients suffered from chronic kidney disease stage 4 (2 patients) and stage 5 (5 patients). Active smoking was noted in 4 patients. Indications for immunosuppressive therapy were vasculitis (5patients) , lupus nephritis (1 patient) , scleroderma (1patient), cryoglubulinemia (1 patient) and multiple myeloma (1 patient). Therapies used included corticosteroids alone (2 patients) or in association with cyclophosphamide (6 patients) and in one case bortezomib.COVID-19 symptoms included fever (6 patients), fatigue (7 patients), joint pain (3 patients), dry cough (all patients)and diarrhea ( one patient). Medium duration under immunosuppressive treatment was of 42,1 days when COVID-19 diagnosis was made Among the patients, six had a mild COVID-19 presentation and displayed favorable outcomes; whereas the remaining three had severe symptoms requiring high dose oxygen and died. As for the renal outcomes, we observed no detioration of kidney function following the COVID-19 infection in any of the patients .All of the patients were treated with antibiotics, heparin and vitamins. CONCLUSION: SARS- CoV-2 infection is a serious condition that can threaten prognosis especially in patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs responsible for a weaker immune response. Further work on a larger group of patients is necessary to establish whether this group is more prone to contract the COVID-19 infection and have poorer outcomes.","Houli, Rawnak; Barbouch, Samia; Nadia, Cherni; Mariem, Hajji; Sakay, Amira; Ben hamida, Fethi; Amel, Harzallah; Ben abdallah, Taieb",Nephrol Dial Transplant,327,12

Furthermore, given that BMI is an insensitive indicator of adiposity, the effect of adipose volume on Covid-19 outcomes is also unknown. METHODS: We used the UK Biobank repository, which contains clinical and anthropometric data and is linked to Public Health England Covid-19 healthcare records, to address our research question. We performed age- and sex- adjusted logistic regression and Chi-squared test to compute the odds for Covid-19-related mortality as a consequence of increasing BMI, and other more sensitive indices of adiposity such as waist:hip ratio (WHR) and percent body fat, as well as concomitant cardiometabolic illness. RESULTS: 13,502 participants were tested for Covid-19 (mean age 70 ± 8 years, 48.9% male). 1582 tested positive (mean age 68 ± 9 years, 52.8% male), of which 305 died (mean age 75 ± 6 years, 65.5% male). Increasing adiposity was associated with higher odds for Covid-19-related mortality. For every unit increase in BMI, WHR and body fat, the odds of death amongst Covid19-positive participants increased by 1.04 (95% CI 1.01–1.07), 10.71 (95% CI 1.57–73.06) and 1.03 (95% CI 1.01–1.05), respectively (all p < 0.05). Referenced to Covid-19 positive participants with a normal weight (BMI 18.5–25 kg/m(2)), Covid-19 positive participants with BMI > 35 kg/m(2) had significantly higher odds of Covid-19-related death (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.06–2.74, p < 0.05). Covid-19-positive participants with metabolic (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia) or cardiovascular morbidity (atrial fibrillation, angina) also had higher odds of death. CONCLUSIONS: Anthropometric indices that are more sensitive to adipose volume and its distribution than BMI, as well as concurrent cardiometabolic illness, are associated with higher odds of Covid-19-related mortality amongst the UK Biobank cohort that tested positive for the infection. These results suggest adipose volume may contribute to adverse Covid-19-related outcomes associated with obesity.","Patel, Kiran H.

Strategies to reduce workplace stress are needed. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a stress reduction strategy, an Internet-based Mantram Repetition Program (MRP), for nurses caring for hospitalized Veterans. METHODS: A one group pre-/post-test design was used to assess change in nurses’ perceived outcomes after participating in the MRP. A post-test-only design was used to assess hospitalized Veterans’ perceptions of nursing presence and satisfaction with care. Qualitative interviews were used to supplement quantitative data. FINDINGS: Patients perceived high levels of presence and satisfaction with care. Post MRP, nurses perceived increased mindfulness, compassion satisfaction, spiritual well-being, and nursing presence. Increased mindfulness was associated with greater compassion satisfaction and less burnout. DISCUSSION: For nurses working on the front lines of patient care, the potential for experiencing stress and burnout is a reality.

The sweeping whole-of-society measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may represent a unique opportunity to examine the impact of large-scale changes in work practices on sleep timing. As such, we examined the impact of the travel restrictions and work from home orders imposed in Ireland in March 2020 on sleep timing and quality. METHODS: We utilized a cross-sectional survey deployed shortly after the imposition of restrictions which assessed current and retrospective ratings of sleep timing and quality; the final response set analysed was from 797 adults. Participants completed the ultra-short Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, and answered questions pertaining to work status such as working from home during the period of restrictions. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There was a significant shift to later sleep start and end times, as well as delayed time of midsleep on both work and free days, during the period of restrictions. Sleep duration was longer for work days, while free day sleep duration was shorter and there was a reduction in social jetlag during the restrictions. Those who worked from home during restrictions had longer sleep duration on work day and had a significantly larger difference in sleep end on work day than “essential” workers who continued to attend their normal place of work.","Raman, Sudha; Coogan, Andrew N.",Sleep Med,327,5

This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. METHODS: An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). RESULTS: In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off ≥10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off ≥10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off ≥15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

An Internet-Based Cross-Sectional Study Exploring the Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on University Students in Jordan Using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale,20.587385,4.4393153,2020-05-18,"OBJECTIVE: During COVID-19, access to trustworthy news and information is vital to help people understand the crisis. The consumption of COVID-19-related information is likely an important factor associated with the increased anxiety and psychological distress that has been observed. We aimed to understand how people living with a kidney condition access information about COVID-19 and how this impacts their anxiety, stress, and depression. METHODS: Participants living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were recruited from 12 sites across England, UK. Respondents were asked to review how often they accessed and trusted 11 sources of potential COVID-19 information. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items was used to measure depression, anxiety, and stress. The 14-item Short Health Anxiety Inventory measured health anxiety. RESULTS: 236 participants were included (age 62.8 (11.3) years, male (56%), transplant recipients (51%), non-dialysis (49%)). The most frequently accessed source of health information was television/radio news, followed by official government press releases, and medical institution press releases. The most trusted source was via consultation with healthcare staff. Higher anxiety, stress, and depression was associated with less access and trust in official government press releases. Education status had a large influence on information trust and access. CONCLUSIONS: Traditional forms of media remain a popular source of health information in those living with kidney conditions. Interactions with healthcare professionals were the most trusted source of health information. Our results provide evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related information exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations.","Wilkinson, Thomas J; Lightfoot, Courtney J; Palmer, Jared; Smith, Alice C",Curr Med Res Opin,327,24

During this pandemic, ophthalmologists around the world adapted their clinical and surgical practice following such guidelines. This original research examines all publicly available COVID-19 recommendations from twelve major ophthalmology societies around the world. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Twelve ophthalmology societies recognised by the International Council of Ophthalmology were included in this study. One society per each WHO region was included: the society selected was the one who had the highest number of national COVID-19 confirmed cases on 11 May 2020. In addition to these countries, the major ophthalmology society in each G7 country was included. RESULTS: Ten out of 12 major international ophthalmology societies from countries covering all six WHO regions have given recommendations regarding urgent patient care, social distancing, telemedicine and personal protective equipment when caring for ophthalmic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While all guidelines emphasise the importance of postponing non-urgent care and taking necessary safety measures, specific recommendations differ between countries. CONCLUSIONS: As there is no clear consensus on ophthalmology guidelines across countries, this paper highlights the differences in international ophthalmic care recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge of the differences in ophthalmic management plans will allow ophthalmologists and all eye care providers to consider the variety of international approaches and apply best practices following evidence-based recommendations during pandemics.","Nguyen, Anne X; Gervasio, Kalla A; Wu, Albert Y",BMJ Open Ophthalmol,327,1

Although over 150 million people around the world have recovered from this disease, the long term effects of the disease are still under study. A year after the start of the pandemic, data from COVID-19 recovered patients shows multiple organs affected with a broad spectrum of manifestations. Long term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes fatigue, chest pain, cellular damage, and robust innate immune response with inflammatory cytokine production. More clinical studies and clinical trials are needed to not only document, but also to understand and determine the factors that predispose certain people to the long term side effects of his infection. In this manuscript, our goal was to explore the multidimensional landscape of infected lung tissue microenvironment to better understand complex interactions between SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, immune response and the lungs microbiome of COVID-19 patients. Each sample was analyzed with several machine learning tools allowing simultaneous detection and quantification of viral RNA amount at genome and gene level; human gene expression and fractions of major types of immune cells, as well as metagenomic analysis of bacterial and viral abundance. To contrast and compare specific viral response to SARS-COV-2 we have analyzed deep sequencing data from additional cohort of patients infected with NL63 strain of corona virus. Our correlation analysis of three types of measurements in patients i.e. fraction of viral RNA (at genome and gene level), Human RNA (transcripts and gene level) and bacterial RNA (metagenomic analysis), showed significant correlation between viral load as well as level of specific viral gene expression with the fractions of immune cells present in lung lavage as well as with abundance of major fractions of lung microbiome in COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study has provided novel insights into complex regulatory signaling interactions and correlative patterns between the viral infection, inhibition of innate and adaptive immune response as well as microbiome landscape of the lung tissue. These initial findings could provide better understanding of the diverse dynamics of immune response and the side effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bhuvaneshwar, Krithika; Madhavan, Subha; Gusev, Yuriy",bioRxiv,327,27

Multi-protein profiling of gastric fluids, obtained from the anatomic site of pathology, could reveal diagnostic proteomic fingerprints. METHODS: Protein profiles were generated from gastric fluid samples of 19 gastric cancer and 36 benign gastritides patients undergoing elective, clinically-indicated gastroscopy using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on multiple ProteinChip arrays. Proteomic features were compared by significance analysis of microarray algorithm and two-way hierarchical clustering. A second blinded sample set (24 gastric cancers and 29 clinically benign gastritides) was used for validation. RESULTS: By significance analysyis of microarray, 60 proteomic features were up-regulated and 46 were down-regulated in gastric cancer samples (p < 0.01). Multimarker clustering showed two distinctive proteomic profiles independent of age and ethnicity. Eighteen of 19 cancer samples clustered together (sensitivity 95%) while 27/36 of non-cancer samples clustered in a second group. Nine non-cancer samples that clustered with cancer samples included 5 pre-malignant lesions (1 adenomatous polyp and 4 intestinal metaplasia). Validation using a second sample set showed the sensitivity and specificity to be 88% and 93%, respectively. Positive predictive value of the combined data was 0.80. Selected peptide sequencing identified pepsinogen C and pepsin A activation peptide as significantly down-regulated and alpha-defensin as significantly up-regulated.

Excessive inflammation, exaggerated immune response, with ultimate apoptosis contribute to COVID-19 pathology that progress to acute lung acute respiratory distress. OBJECTIVE: To shed a light on the likely beneﬁts of the oral phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor adjuvant role in combating COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A literature review was performed in the PubMed/Medline database, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases using the keywords COVID-19; phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors; cytokine storm; respiratory distress. RESULTS: Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, still no drugs are validated to have significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in large-scale studies. While the progress toward a curative agent and/or vaccine is certainly hopeful, the principal limiting factor in such public health emergencies is always the time. Therefore, a preexisting licensed therapeutic(s) might offer a reprieve to the healthcare systems operating at the edge of capacity. In this context, the innovation of oral PDE5 inhibitors with their valuable effects on erection have provided a breakthrough in the treatment of erectile dysfunction and opened new fields of clinical application for this class of drugs. Oral PDE5 inhibitors have been demonstrated to possess many beneficial useful additional implications with acknowledged anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties have been elucidated through the nitric oxide/soluble guanylyl cyclase/cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway in addition to the emerged hemeoxygenase-1 enzyme as well as hydrogen sulfide pathways. These properties could support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in targeting different aspects of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Oral PDE5 inhibitors retain several acknowledged off-labeled useful implications with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune response regulation, and antiapoptotic properties. These properties may support repurposing oral PDE5 inhibitors' potential adjuvant use in the protocols combating COVID-19 manifestations. Mostafa T.

Especially the high rate of complications and nosocomial infections has caused severe public health problems in China and Canada. The number of persons infected with HIV is still rising rapidly globally. New regions with rapid spread include the countries of the former Soviet Union in East Europe and Central Asia. The introduction of modern antiretroviral therapy in countries with high prevalence is making slow progress, with no visible impact on transmission dynamics so far. The WHO has implemented a number of programs to eradicate or eliminate targeted infectious diseases. Polio eradication and elimination of neonatal tetanus are making slow progress, obstacles to the control of these diseases are ongoing armed conflicts in regions with high prevalence and underfinancing of programs. Lack of funding is especially obvious regarding programs for the control and therapy of malarial infections.

The 2 most common COVID-19 vaccine platforms currently in use, messenger RNA (mRNA) and adenovirus vector, were developed on the basis of previous research in use of this technology. Postauthorization surveillance of COVID-19 vaccines has identified safety signals, including unusual cases of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis reported in recipients of adenoviral vector vaccines. One of the devastating manifestations of this syndrome, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), is cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). This review summarizes the current evidence and indications regarding biology, clinical characteristics, and pharmacological management of VITT with CVST. Observations: VITT appears to be similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), with both disorders associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and presence of autoantibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4). Unlike VITT, HIT is triggered by recent exposure to heparin. Owing to similarities between these 2 conditions and lack of high-quality evidence, interim recommendations suggest avoiding heparin and heparin analogues in patients with VITT. Based on initial reports, female sex and age younger than 60 years were identified as possible risk factors for VITT. Treatment consists of therapeutic anticoagulation with nonheparin anticoagulants and prevention of formation of autoantibody-PF4 complexes, the latter being achieved by administration of high-dose intravenous immunoglobin (IVIG). Steroids, which can theoretically inhibit the production of new antibodies, have been used in combination with IVIG. In severe cases, plasma exchange should be used for clearing autoantibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab and eculizumab, can be considered when other therapies fail. Routine platelet transfusions, aspirin, and warfarin should be avoided because of the possibility of worsening thrombosis and magnifying bleeding risk. Conclusions and Relevance: Adverse events like VITT, while uncommon, have been described despite vaccination remaining the most essential component in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. While it seems logical to consider the use of types of vaccines (eg, mRNA-based administration) in individuals at high risk, treatment should consist of therapeutic anticoagulation mostly with nonheparin products and IVIG.","Rizk, John G; Gupta, Aashish; Sardar, Partha; Henry, Brandon Michael; Lewin, John C; Lippi, Giuseppe; Lavie, Carl J",JAMA cardiol.

While case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, SSA countries remain vulnerable to significant COVID morbidity and mortality due to systemic healthcare weaknesses, less financial resources and infrastructure to address the new crisis, and untreated comorbidities. Variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events. Methods: Confirmed cases reported by SSA countries were line-listed to capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries. Data were retrieved from publicly available sources, including institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts, with supplementary details obtained from news articles. A data availability score was calculated for each imported case in terms of how many indicators (sex, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected) could be identified. We assessed the relationship between time to first importation and overall Global Health Security Index (GHSI) using Cox regression. K-means clustering grouped countries according to healthcare capacity and health and demographic risk factors. Results: A total of 2417 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 30 days after the first known introduction to the region. Out of the 876 cases for which information was publicly available, 677 (77.3%) were considered importation events. At the regional level, imported cases tended to be male (67.3%), were a median 43.0 years old (Range: 6 weeks - 88 years), and most frequently had recent travel history from Europe (43.3%). The median time to reporting an introduction was 19 days; a country's time to report its first importation was not related to GHSI. Mean data availability scores were lowest for countries that had, on average, the highest case fatality rates, lowest healthcare capacity, and highest probability of premature death due to non-communicable diseases. Conclusion: Countries with systemic, demographic, and pre-existing health vulnerabilities to severe COVID-related morbidity and mortality are less likely to report any cases or are reporting with limited public availability of information. Reporting of information on COVID detection and response efforts, as well as on trends in non-COVID illness and care-seeking behavior, is critical to assessing direct and indirect consequences and capacity needs in resource-constrained settings. Such assessments aid in the ability to make data-driven decisions about interventions, country priorities, and risk assessment.","Skrip, Laura A; Selvaraj, Prashanth; Hagedorn, Brittany; Ouédraogo, Andre Lin; Noori, Navideh; Mistry, Dina; Bedson, Jamie; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Scarpino, Samuel V; Althouse, Benjamin Muir",,327,30

Cells with a similar phenotype have been described during chronic infection, but variable gating strategies and nomenclature have led to uncertainty of their relationship to each other. We isolated CD11c(hi) cells from peripheral blood and characterized them using transcriptome and IgH repertoire analyses. Gene expression data revealed the CD11c(hi) IgD(+) and IgD(−) subsets were highly similar to each other, but distinct from naive, memory, and plasma cell subsets. Although CD11c(hi) B cells were enriched in some germinal center (GC) transcripts and expressed numerous negative regulators of B cell receptor (BCR) activation, they were distinct from GC B cells. Gene expression patterns from SLE CD11c(hi) B cells were shared with other human diseases, but not with mouse age-associated B cells. IgH V-gene sequencing analysis showed IgD(+) and IgD(−) CD11c(hi) B cells had somatic hypermutation and were clonally related to each other and to conventional memory and plasma cells. However, the IgH repertoires expressed by the different subsets suggested that defects in negative selection during GC transit could contribute to autoimmunity. The results portray a pervasive B cell population that accumulates during autoimmunity and chronic infection and is refractory to BCR signaling.","Maul, Robert W.; Catalina, Michelle D.; Kumar, Varsha; Bachali, Prathyusha; Grammer, Amrie C.; Wang, Shu; Yang, William; Hasni, Sarfaraz; Ettinger, Rachel; Lipsky, Peter E.; Gearhart, Patricia J.",Front Immunol,327,1

When severe, chronic cough may significantly impact an individual's quality of life, and such patients are frequently referred for specialist evaluation. Current international guidelines provide algorithms for the management of chronic cough: in most cases, treatment of the underlying disease is sufficient to improve or resolve cough symptoms. Severe chronic cough may significantly affect patients' quality of life and necessitate frequent referral for specialist evaluations. In this narrative review, we summarize non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic management of adult patients with chronic cough of known cause that persists after proper treatment (chronic refractory cough, CRC) or chronic cough of unknown cause in adult patients. If chronic cough persists even after treatment of the underlying disease, or if the chronic cough is not attributable to any cause, then a symptomatic approach with neuromodulators may be considered, with gabapentin as the first choice, and opioids or macrolides as alternatives. Speech pathology treatment and/or neuromodulators should be discussed with patients and alternative options carefully considered, taking into account risk/benefit. Novel promising drugs are under investigation (e.g. P2×3 inhibitors), but additional studies are needed in this field. Speech pathology can be combined with a neuromodulator to give an enhanced treatment response of longer duration suggesting that non-pharmacologic treatment may play a key role in the management of CRC.","Visca, Dina; Beghè, Bianca; Fabbri, Leonardo Michele; Papi, Alberto; Spanevello, Antonio",Eur J Intern Med,327,9

Heifers (n = 33) were assigned randomly after parturition to lactating (L, n = 17) or nonlactating (NL, n = 16) groups. Cows were subjected to an ovulation synchronization program for a timed artificial insemination (TAI); 10 cows in L and 12 in NL were inseminated. Slaughter occurred 17 d after the day equivalent to TAI, and intercaruncular endometrial tissues were collected. Gene expression was determined by DNA microarray analysis for pregnant (L, n = 8; NL, n = 6) and noninseminated cyclic (L, n = 7; NL, n = 4) cows. Differentially expressed genes were selected with a P-value <0.01 and absolute expression >40. In addition, a fold effect >1.5 was used as a criterion for genes affected by pregnancy. In total, 210 genes were differentially regulated by lactation (136 downregulated and 74 upregulated), and 702 genes were differentially regulated by pregnancy (407 downregulated and 295 upregulated). The interaction effect of pregnancy and lactation affected 61 genes. Genes up- and downregulated in pregnant cows were associated with several gene ontology terms, such as defense response and interferon regulatory factor, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix. The gene ontology analyses of up- and downregulated genes of lactating cows revealed terms related to immunoglobulin-like fold, immune response, COMM domain, and non-membrane-bounded organelle. Several genes upregulated by lactation, such as IGHG1, IGLL1, IGK, and TRD, were related to immune function, particularly for B cells and γδ T cells. Developmental genes related to limb and neural development and glucose homeostasis (e.g., DKK1, RELN, PDK4) were downregulated by lactation, whereas an interaction was also detected for RELN. The stated genes associated with immune function and developmental genes expressed in the endometrium affected by lactational state are possible candidate genes for interventions to improve fertility of lactating dairy cows.","Cerri, R.L.A.; Thompson, I.M.; Kim, I.H.; Ealy, A.D.; Hansen, P.J.; Staples, C.R.; Li, J.L.; Santos, J.E.P.; Thatcher, W.W.",J Dairy Sci,327,1

But the physician in charge of the patient at the time of acute disease often does not have these information. It is therefore essential that the referring oncologist had an early discussion with the patient to inform him and collect his opinion. These information have to be noted in the patient’s medical chart. The prognostic criteria of lung cancer patients admitted in ICU are related to the patient’s characteristics, the cancer’s characteristics and the severity of acute disease.

The 2019 outbreak of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, has become a serious global pandemic. Many attempts have been made to forecast the spread of the disease using various methods, including time series models. Among the attempts to model the pandemic, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have used the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to forecast confirmed cases. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this paper is to construct a reliable, robust, and interpretable model for describing, decomposing, and forecasting the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and predicting the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A modified singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach was applied for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We proposed this approach and developed it in our previous studies regarding the separability and grouping steps in SSA, which play important roles in reconstruction and forecasting. The modified SSA approach mainly enables us to identify the number of interpretable components required for separability, signal extraction, and noise reduction. The approach was examined using different levels of simulated and real data with different structures and signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we examined the capability of the approach to analyze COVID-19 data. We then used vector SSA to predict new data points and the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: In the first stage, the confirmed daily cases on the first 42 days (March 02 to April 12, 2020) were used and analyzed to identify the value of the number of required eigenvalues (r) for separability between noise and signal. After obtaining the value of r, which was 2, and extracting the signals, vector SSA was used to predict and determine the pandemic peak. In the second stage, we updated the data and included 81 daily case values. We used the same window length and number of eigenvalues for reconstruction and forecasting of the points 90 days ahead. The results of both forecasting scenarios indicated that the peak would occur around the end of May or June 2020 and that the crisis would end between the end of June and the middle of August 2020, with a total number of infected people of approximately 330,000. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the impressive performance of modified SSA in analyzing COVID-19 data and selecting the value of r for identifying the signal subspace from a noisy time series and then making a reliable prediction of daily confirmed cases using the vector SSA method.","Alharbi, Nader",JMIRx Med,327,16

The need for, and successes of, MD simulations in providing this type of essential information are well documented, but so are the challenges presented by the size of the resulting datasets encoding the desired information. The difficulty of extracting information on mechanistically important state-to-state transitions in response to ligand binding and other interactions is compounded by these being rare events in the MD trajectories of complex molecular machines, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To address this problem, we have developed a protocol for the efficient detection of such events. We show that the novel Rare Event Detection (RED) protocol reveals functionally relevant and pharmacologically discriminating responses to the binding of different ligands to the 5-HT(2A)R orthosteric site in terms of clearly defined, structurally coherent, and temporally ordered conformational transitions. This information from the RED protocol offers new insights into specific ligand-determined functional mechanisms encoded in the MD trajectories, which opens a new and rigorously reproducible path to understanding drug activity with application in drug discovery.","Plante, Ambrose; Weinstein, Harel",Molecules,327,16

Methods This is a cross-sectional survey, using a questionnaire based on published approaches to understand the psychological impact of COVID-19. The survey will be repeated at 6 months because of rapidly changing situation. Results We have presented results from first 3 weeks of the survey. Conclusions may change as more individuals take part over time. 7,917 participants completed the survey in the first 3 weeks; 7,271 are from the United Kingdom. 49.7% of the participants are healthcare professionals. There is high representation of female participants. Participants reporting suicidal thoughts is 32%. Healthcare professionals have reported mild depression and anxiety in higher proportions. Increasing age and female gender report higher compliance with government advice on COVID 19 whereas higher education, homeowners, key worker status, high alcohol, drug use and participants with pre-existing suicidal thoughts reported low compliance with government advice. Participants who reported suicidal thoughts pre-COVID are less likely to communicate with friends and family, or engage in coping strategies. Conclusions Evidence has shown an adverse psychological impact of previous pandemics on the population, especially wellbeing of healthcare professionals.

This conversion can occur on the membranes of apoptotic or activated cells or on extracellular vesicles (EVs) shed from the cell surface. Here, we characterized the association of CRP with EVs in plasma from sepsis patients using flow cytometry, and found highly elevated levels of total EV counts and CRP(+) EVs as compared to healthy individuals. We further assessed the ability of PentraSorb CRP, an extracorporeal device for the adsorption of CRP, to deplete free CRP and CRP(+) EVs. Treatment of septic plasma with the adsorbent in vitro resulted in almost complete removal of both, free CRP and CRP(+) EVs, while total EV counts remained largely unaffected, indicating the detachment of CRP from the EV surface. EVs from septic plasma elicited a release of interleukin-8 from cultured human monocytes, which was significantly reduced by adsorbent treatment prior to EV isolation. Our findings provide evidence that CRP(+) EVs exhibit pro-inflammatory characteristics and can contribute to the spreading of inflammation throughout the circulation on top of their pro-coagulant activity.","Fendl, Birgit; Weiss, René; Eichhorn, Tanja; Linsberger, Ingrid; Afonyushkin, Taras; Puhm, Florian; Binder, Christoph J.; Fischer, Michael B.; Weber, Viktoria",Sci Rep,327,16

Most existing methods directly learn global feature representations from whole Chest X-ray (CXR) images, without considering in depth the richer visual cues lying around informative local regions. Thus, these methods often produce sub-optimal thorax disease classification performance because they ignore the very informative pathological changes around organs. In this paper, we propose a novel Part-Aware Mask-Guided Attention Network (PMGAN) that learns complementary global and local feature representations from all-organ region and multiple single-organ regions simultaneously for thorax disease classification. Specifically, multiple innovative soft attention modules are designed to progressively guide feature learning toward the global informative regions of whole CXR image. A mask-guided attention module is designed to further search for informative regions and visual cues within the all-organ or single-organ images, where attention is elegantly regularized by automatically generated organ masks and without introducing computation during the inference stage. In addition, a multi-task learning strategy is designed, which effectively maximizes the learning of complementary local and global representations. The proposed PMGAN has been evaluated on the ChestX-ray14 dataset and the experimental results demonstrate its superior thorax disease classification performance against the state-of-the-art methods.","Zhang, Ruihua; Yang, Fan; Luo, Yan; Liu, Jianyi; Li, Jinbin; Wang, Cong",Entropy (Basel),327,2

Healthcare workers, patients, and visitors were at increased risk for infection. Nonetheless, the ability of individual SARS patients to transmit disease was quite variable. Unrecognized SARS case-patients were a primary source of transmission and early detection and intervention were important to limit spread. Strict adherence to infection control precautions was essential in containing outbreaks. In addition, grouping patients into cohorts and limiting access to SARS patients minimized exposure opportunities. Given the difficulty in implementing several of these measures, controls were frequently adapted to the acuity of SARS care and level of transmission within facilities. Although these conclusions are based only on a retrospective analysis of events, applying the experiences of Toronto and Taiwan to SARS preparedness planning efforts will likely minimize future transmission within healthcare facilities.","McDonald, L.

Recently (2019), two extensive reports from preeminent federal authorities – the Chief Public Health Officer and the Mental Health Commission of Canada – have been tabled with detailed, core focus on the phenomenon of ‘stigma’ and its impacts on substance/opioid use and harms. The reports present extensive descriptions of the nature and effects, as well as a multitude of prescriptions for remedial measures and actions to “stop the cycle of stigma”. Closer reading of the documents, however, suggests substantial conceptual and empirical limitations in the characterization of the – multi-faceted and challenging – nature and workings of ‘stigma’ as a socio-political, structural or individual process or force, specifically as it applies to and negatively affects substance use and related outcomes, primarily the wellbeing of substance users. Concretely, it is unclear how the remedial actions proposed will materially alleviate stigma process and impacts, especially given apparent gaps in the issues examined, including essential strategies – for example, reform of drug user criminalization as a fundamental element and driver of structural stigma - for action that directly relate to the jurisdictions and privileged mandates of the report sources themselves as health and policy leaders.

Written Emotional Disclosure (WED) has been used extensively in a variety of settings with diverse populations as a means to promote emotional processing. The expressive writing protocol has been used to a limited extent in the context of sport and predominantly in support of athletes’ emotional processing during injury rehabilitation. We propose that WED offers an evidence-based treatment that can promote athletes’ mental health and support their return to competition. Research exploring the efficacy of the expressive writing protocol highlights a number of theoretical models underpinning the positive effects of WED; we outline how each of these potential mechanisms can address the multidimensional complexity of the challenging circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., loss of earnings, returning to training and competition).

In this study, we present a single-cell RNA-sequencing data based multilayer network method (scMLnet) that models not only functional intercellular communications but also intracellular gene regulatory networks (https://github.com/SunXQlab/scMLnet). scMLnet was applied to a scRNA-seq dataset of COVID-19 patients to decipher the microenvironmental regulation of expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 that has been reported to be correlated with inflammatory cytokines and COVID-19 severity. The predicted elevation of ACE2 by extracellular cytokines EGF, IFN-γ or TNF-α were experimentally validated in human lung cells and the related signaling pathway were verified to be significantly activated during SARS-COV-2 infection. Our study provided a new approach to uncover inter-/intra-cellular signaling mechanisms of gene expression and revealed microenvironmental regulators of ACE2 expression, which may facilitate designing anti-cytokine therapies or targeted therapies for controlling COVID-19 infection.

Through comprehensive, longitudinal evaluation and new consideration of all the data, we were able to better describe and understand factors affecting outcome after intubation. Methods: All vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administrations (time, date, dose, and route) were collected and organized. Further, each patient's prior medical records, including PBM data and available ECG, were reviewed by a physician. These data were incorporated into time-series database for statistical analysis. Results: By discharge or Day 90, 78.2% of the cohort expired. The most common pre-existing conditions were hypertension, (63.5%), diabetes (59.2%) and obesity (50.4%). Age correlated with death. Comorbidities and clinical status on presentation were not predictive of outcome. Admission markers of inflammation were universally elevated (>96%). The cohort's weight range was nearly 7-fold. Causal modeling establishes that weight-adjusted HCQ and AZM therapy improves survival by over 100%. QTc prolongation did not correlate with cumulative HCQ dose or HCQ serum levels. Discussion: This detailed approach gives us better understanding of risk factors, prognostic indicators, and outcomes of Covid patients needing IMV. Few variables were related to outcome. By considering more factors and using new methods, we found that when increased doses of co-administered HCQ and AZM were associated with >100% increase in survival. Comparison of absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration [≥]80 mg/kg of HCQ with > 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring Covid patients by over 100%. According to our data, HCQ is not associated with prolongation. Studies, which reported QTc prolongation secondary to HCQ, need to be re-evaluated more stringently and with controls. The weight ranges of Covid patient cohorts are substantially greater than those of most antibiotic RCTs. Future clinical trials need to consider the weight variance of hospitalized Covid patients and need to study therapeutics more thoughtfully.","Smith, L. G.; Mendoza, N.; Smith, S.; Dobesh, D.

To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern. Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon α/β (IFN-α/β) receptor (IFNAR(−/−)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections. Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals. Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance. Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections. A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(−/−) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(−/−) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host. Therefore, IFNAR(−/−) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines. In this review article, the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the IFNAR(−/−) mouse model will be reviewed.","Marín-Lopez, Alejandro; Calvo-Pinilla, Eva; Moreno, Sandra; Utrilla-Trigo, Sergio; Nogales, Aitor; Brun, Alejandro; Fikrig, Erol; Ortego, Javier",Viruses,327,1

Report of a young anesthesiologist in Assam developing cardiac arrest following HCQ intake for COVID-19 prophylaxis made us even more concerned. A conscious decision has been made by a large majority among us––to have or not to have HCQ. However, less severe complications such as gastrointestinal upset, skin-rash, visual-disturbance, headache, and dizziness even if experienced by HCQ users were likely to go unreported unless shared. The present survey was conducted to assess the prevailing perception among Indian anesthesiologists about HCQ's preventive effect against COVID-19. The information has been pooled together and discussed in this study. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 247 respondents participated in this pan-India survey. The survey questionnaire was prepared using “Google Forms” and conducted via links delivered through WhatsApp and electronic-mail. RESULTS: 55.9% (138/247) of the respondents had consumed HCQ, 38% (94/247) did not, and 6.1% (15/247) were undecided at the time of responding to the survey. In total, 47 respondents who ingested HCQ reported a side-effect, gastritis being the commonest (31). CONCLUSION: The evidence for the effectiveness of HCQ against COVID-19 in India is reportedly as strong and weak as other drugs that have been promoted. The survey highlights the reasons consumption of HCQ and represents the opinion of 247 practicing Indian anesthesiologists. It informs the benefits and side effects of HCQ, which can help others in reaching a balanced decision.","Shah, Shagun B.; Pahade, Akhilesh; Chawla, Rajiv",J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol,327,20

Movement-based zoning can be implemented to delineate the boundaries for movement restrictions. Previous studies used network community detection methods, which capture cohesive within-region movements, to delineate containment zones. However, most people usually travel and spend most of their time in several fixed locations, which implies that an infected person could transmit the pathogens to only a specific group of people with whom s/he usually has a contact in frequently-visited locations. Existing network community detection methods cannot reflect the regularity of the flow of people; thus, this study aims to use land-use patterns to reflect trip purposes to measure the regularity of human mobility. We propose a novel network community detection method, the Human Mobility Regularity-based Zoning (HuMoRZ) algorithm, to delineate containment zones incorporating mobility regularity. The Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The spatial diffusion of an emerging respiratory disease, novel influenza A/H1N1, is simulated for comparing three different quarantine zoning systems: (1) a minimum zoning unit, (2) optimal zoning without considering mobility regularity, and (3) optimal zoning considering mobility regularity. Two epidemiological performance indicators are used to compare simulation results: namely, the accumulated infected number (AN) on the 30th day, reflecting the severity of an epidemic, and the critical time (CT), the moment at which half of the population becomes infected, measuring the diffusion speed of an epidemic. To measure the variety of different facility types within a containment zone, we further use Shannon's entropy scores, representing a self-contained zone, and the boxplot of all zones' entropy scores, reflecting geospatial homogeneity of life functions across zones. Our results suggest that containment zones that incorporate mobility regularity could significantly delay the epidemic peak and critical time and decrease the severity of an epidemic. The zoning patterns proposed in our algorithm could also allow for more life functions in a zone and more evenly distributed life resources across zones than those of zones generated by other methods. These findings could provide insightful implications for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kuo, Fei-Ying; Wen, Tzai-Hung",Appl Geogr,327,24

Comparing the level of mortality across countries has proven difficult because of inherent limitations in the most commonly cited measures (e.g., case-fatality rates). We collected the cumulative number of confirmed deaths from COVID-19 by age in 2020 from the L’Institut National d’études Démographiques (INED) database and Statistics Canada for 15 European and North American countries. We calculated age-specific death rates and age-standardized death rates (ASDR) for each country over a 1-year period from 6 February 2020 (date of first COVID-19 death in Europe and North America) to 5 February 2021 using established demographic methods. We estimated that COVID-19 was the second leading cause of death behind cancer in England and Wales and France and the third leading cause of death behind cancer and heart disease in nine countries including the US. Countries with higher all-cause mortality prior to the COVID-19 experienced higher COVID-19 mortality than countries with lower all-cause mortality prior to the pandemic. The COVID-19 ASDR varied substantially within country (e.g., a 5-fold difference among the highest and lowest mortality states in Germany). Consistently strong public health measures may have lessened the level of mortality for some European and North American countries.

Despite Zika virus RNA was not detected, this study confirms circulation and/or sporadic spread of DENV‐2, DENV‐3, and AHFV, higher prevalence of DENV‐2, and a role for visitors from DENV endemic countries in DENV importation into the Kingdom. Further analysis also showed very low genetic diversity of AHFV confirming its slow microevolution. Accordingly, continuous and prospective surveillance for flaviviruses using such assay are warranted in Saudi Arabia which receives millions of Muslims annually to implement effective control measures in light of the global widespread and outbreaks of several flaviviruses.","Al‐Saeed, Moneerah S.; El‐Kafrawy, Sherif A.; Farraj, Suha A.; Al‐Subhi, Tagreed L.; Othman, Norah A.; Alsultan, Arwa; Ben Helaby, Huda G.; Alshawdari, Mustafa M.; Hassan, Ahmed M.; Charrel, Remi N.; Azhar, Esam I.; Hashem, Anwar M.",J Med Virol,327,24

In the latest decade, numerous studies have revealed that H(2)S has versatile functions in plants as well. In this review, we summarize H(2)S-mediated sulfur metabolic pathways, as well as the progress in the recognition of its biological functions in plant growth and development, particularly its physiological functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses. Besides direct chemical reactions, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) have complex relationships with H(2)S in plant signaling, both of which mediate protein post-translational modification (PTM) to attack the cysteine residues. We also discuss recent progress in the research on the three types of PTMs and their biological functions in plants. Finally, we propose the relevant issues that need to be addressed in the future research.

Here, the model is based upon the well-known susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model with the difference that a total population is not defined or kept constant per se and the number of susceptible individuals does not decline monotonically. To the contrary, as we show herein, it can be increased in surge periods! In particular, we investigate the time evolution of different populations and monitor diverse significant parameters for the spread of the disease in various communities, represented by countries and the state of Texas in the USA. The SIR model can provide us with insights and predictions of the spread of the virus in communities that the recorded data alone cannot. Our work shows the importance of modelling the spread of COVID-19 by the SIR model that we propose here, as it can help to assess the impact of the disease by offering valuable predictions. Our analysis takes into account data from January to June, 2020, the period that contains the data before and during the implementation of strict and control measures. We propose predictions on various parameters related to the spread of COVID-19 and on the number of susceptible, infected and removed populations until September 2020. By comparing the recorded data with the data from our modelling approaches, we deduce that the spread of COVID-19 can be under control in all communities considered, if proper restrictions and strong policies are implemented to control the infection rates early from the spread of the disease.","Cooper, Ian; Mondal, Argha; Antonopoulos, Chris G.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,327,26

However, as health care facilities have reopened, evidence about the risk of acquiring respiratory viral infections in medical office settings remains limited. To inform policy for reopening outpatient care settings, we analyzed rates of potential airborne disease transmission in medical office settings, focusing on influenza-like illness. We quantified whether exposed patients (that is, those seen in a medical office after a patient with influenza-like illness) were more likely to return with a similar illness in the next two weeks compared with nonexposed patients seen earlier in the day. Patients exposed to influenza-like illness in the medical office setting were more likely than nonexposed patients to revisit with a similar illness within two weeks (adjusted absolute difference: 0.7 per 1,000 patients). Similar patterns were not observed for exposure to urinary tract infection and back pain as noncontagious control conditions. These results highlight the potential threat of reopening outpatient clinics during the pandemic and the value of virtual visits for patients with suspected respiratory infections.","Neprash, Hannah T; Sheridan, Bethany; Jena, Anupam B; Grad, Yonatan H; Barnett, Michael Lawrence",Health Aff (Millwood),327,1

This is likely to continue when the social distancing restrictions have been eased. There have been a number of technological advances that have contributed to the roll-out and improved quality of telemedicine consultations. Telemedicine has a number of benefits including facilitating home working for clinicians, reduce travel time for families and allows multidisciplinary team working across different sites. In addition to these clinical benefits there are also the environmental benefits of reduced travel to and from the hospital setting. There are limitations to this change in practice including the need for repeat appointments if a telemedicine facilitated contact is not adequate and the perpetuation of inequality for vulnerable families, the so called “digital divide”. Due to the increase in the use of telemedicine it is important that clinicians develop effective consultation practices including appropriate selection of patients, technical setup and consultation tools.

In this paper, we propose a model predictive approach for the constrained control of a nonlinear compartmental model that captures the key dynamical properties of COVID-19. The control design uses the discrete-time version of the epidemic model, and it is able to handle complex, possibly time-dependent constraints, logical relations between model variables and multiple predefined discrete levels of interventions. A state observer is also constructed for the computation of non-measured variables from the number of hospitalized patients. Five control scenarios with different cost functions and constraints are studied through numerical simulations, including an output feedback configuration with uncertain parameters. It is visible from the results that, depending on the cost function associated with different policy aims, the obtained controls correspond to mitigation and suppression strategies, and the constructed control inputs are similar to real-life government responses. The results also clearly show the key importance of early intervention, the continuous tracking of the susceptible population and that of future work in determining the true costs of restrictive control measures and their quantitative effects.","Péni, Tamás; Csutak, Balázs; Szederkényi, Gábor; Röst, Gergely",Nonlinear Dyn,327,26

Survivors of COVID-19 may be left with substantial functional deficits requiring ongoing care. We aimed to determine whether pre-admission frailty was associated with increased care needs at discharge for patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: Patients were included if aged over 18 years old and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 between 27 February and 10 June 2020. The Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) was used to assess pre-admission frailty status. Admission and discharge care levels were recorded. Data were analysed using a mixed-effects logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, and admission CRP as a marker of severity of disease. RESULTS: Thirteen hospitals included patients: 1671 patients were screened, and 840 were excluded including, 521 patients who died before discharge (31.1%). Of the 831 patients who were discharged, the median age was 71 years (IQR, 58–81 years) and 369 (44.4%) were women. The median length of hospital stay was 12 days (IQR 6–24). Using the CFS, 438 (47.0%) were living with frailty (≥ CFS 5), and 193 (23.2%) required an increase in the level of care provided. Multivariable analysis showed that frailty was associated with an increase in care needs compared to patients without frailty (CFS 1–3). The adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were as follows: CFS 4, 1.99 (0.97–4.11); CFS 5, 3.77 (1.94–7.32); CFS 6, 4.04 (2.09–7.82); CFS 7, 2.16 (1.12–4.20); and CFS 8, 3.19 (1.06–9.56). CONCLUSIONS: Around a quarter of patients admitted with COVID-19 had increased care needs at discharge. Pre-admission frailty was strongly associated with the need for an increased level of care at discharge. Our results have implications for service planning and public health policy as well as a person's functional outcome, suggesting that frailty screening should be utilised for predictive modelling and early individualised discharge planning.","Vilches-Moraga, A.; Price, A.; Braude, P.; Pearce, L.; Short, R.; Verduri, A.; Stechman, M.; Collins, J.

The association(s) between clinically relevant, noncollinear variables, and the primary outcome was assessed with uni‐ and multivariable Logistic regression models. A total of 520 patients were hospitalized of whom 349 (67%) were males with a median age 61 (interquartile range: 50–72).

However, the exact mechanism of thymic atrophy has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we discovered a novel role for VSIG4-positive peritoneal macrophages (V4(+) cells) as the principal cells that induce thymic atrophy and thymocyte apoptosis. In CLP-induced mice, V4(+) cells were activated after ingestion of invading microbes, and the majority of these cells migrated into the thymus. Furthermore, these cells underwent a phenotypic shift from V4(+) to V4(−) and from MHC II(low) to MHC II(+). In coculture with thymocytes, V4(+) cells mainly induced apoptosis in DP thymocytes via the secretion of TNF-α. However, there was little effect on CD4 or CD8 SP and DN thymocytes. V4(−) cells showed low levels of activity compared to V4(+) cells. Thymic atrophy in CLP-induced V4(KO) mice was much less severe than that in CLP-induced wild-type mice. In addition, V4(KO) peritoneal macrophages also showed similar activity to V4(−) cells. Taken together, the current study demonstrates that V4(+) cells play important roles in inducing immunosuppression via thymic atrophy in the context of severe infection. These data also suggest that controlling the function of V4(+) cells may play a crucial role in the development of new therapies to prevent thymocyte apoptosis in sepsis.","Cho, Hae-Yun; Yang, Yun Gyeong; Jeon, Youkyoung; Lee, Chae-Kwan; Choi, InHak; Lee, Soo-Woong",Cell Death Dis,327,1

Older adults are disproportionately represented among those experiencing severe illness and death. Older adults, particularly those with pre-existing psychiatric conditions, may also be more vulnerable to the psychiatric impacts of the pandemic and its resulting social sequelae. During peak months of the pandemic, our inpatient geriatric psychiatry service has cared for patients who presented with severe psychiatric states related to the pandemic. In this study, we examine four cases to illustrate differing mechanisms by which the pandemic causes acute psychiatric distress in older adults and describe targeted interventions to address each mechanism. Methods Cases seen in the Geriatric Psychiatry/Neuropsychiatry inpatient service at Johns Hopkins Hospital late in the first wave of the pandemic (June 2020) are analyzed to identify the psychological and social mechanisms for acute psychiatric distress, using a timeline representation approach. Results The timeline analysis of the cases indicated four mechanisms for acute psychiatric distress during the pandemic: incitement of fear, social isolation, loss of routine and purpose, and disruption of medical services. These factors have been shown in other work to have adverse effects on the psychological well-being of older adults. Conclusions While the older adult population as a whole may be heterogeneous in their psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, those with fewer social resources, lower resilience, or pre-existing mental illness are likely to experience disproportionate distress in the face of these changes. Interventions should be tailored to promote flourishing in individuals; including assistance in navigating changes in the healthcare system, developing technological skills, and leveraging connections and resources in the individual's social circle and community.

METHODS: We investigated the causes and transmission routes of a primary school cluster of COVID-19 that occurred during November and December 2020 in Niigata, Japan. RESULTS: In the cluster, the virus spread among teachers, then from teachers to students, and then to their family members. This primary school cluster comprised 26 infected patients and included teachers (13/33, 39%), students (9/211, 4%), and family members (4/65, 6%). The secondary attack rate from the 3 index teachers to the remaining 30 teachers was 33%; however, the rate to students was only 4%. Factors contributing to cluster formation include the fact that 2 of the index teachers continued working while symptomatic and that the environment and infection prevention measures in the teachers’ room were inadequate.

To address public concerns, we measured the baseline incidence rates of major conditions potentially related to vaccine-related adverse events (VAEs). We aimed to provide a basis for evaluating VAEs and verifying causality. METHODS: Conditions of interest were selected from the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System Table of Reportable Events and a recent report from a European consortium on vaccine surveillance. We used the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea to identify the monthly numbers of cases with these conditions. Data from January 2006 to June 2020 were included. Prediction models were constructed from the observed incidences using an autoregressive integrated moving average. We predicted the incidences of the conditions and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for January through December 2021. In addition, subgroup analysis for the expected vaccination population was conducted. RESULTS: Mean values (95% CIs) of the predicted monthly incidence of vasovagal syncope, anaphylaxis, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Bell's palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalopathy, optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and systemic lupus erythematosus in 2021 were 23.89 (19.81–27.98), 4.72 (3.83–5.61), 57.62 (51.37–63.88), 0.03 (0.01–0.04), 8.58 (7.90–9.26), 0.26 (0.18–0.34), 2.13 (1.42–2.83), 1.65 (1.17–2.13), 0.19 (0.14–0.25), 0.75 (0.61–0.90), and 3.40 (2.79–4.01) cases per 100,000 respectively. The majority of the conditions showed an increasing trend with seasonal variations in their incidences. CONCLUSION: We measured the incidence of a total of 11 conditions that could potentially be associated with VAEs to predict the monthly incidence in 2021. In Korea, conditions that could potentially be related to VAEs occur on a regular basis, and an increasing trend is observed with seasonality.","Huh, Kyungmin; Kim, Young-Eun; Radnaabaatar, Munkhzul; Lee, Dae Ho; Kim, Dong Wook; Shin, Soon-Ae; Jung, Jaehun",J Korean Med Sci,327,11

Combining extreme gradient boosting, random forest, light gradient boosting machine, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and stacking model fusion theory, we establish a stacking model for film box office prediction. Our empirical results show that the model exhibits good prediction accuracy, with its 1-Away accuracy being 86.46%. Moreover, our results show that star influence has the strongest predictive power in this model.","Liao, Yi; Peng, Yuxuan; Shi, Songlin; Shi, Victor; Yu, Xiaohong",Ann Oper Res,327,1

Less defined are the hazards to HWs during pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, wars, conflicts, and other crises. How do crises affect the infrastructure of medical systems? What are the distinct needs of the patient population during crises? What are the peculiarities of the Crisis Health Worker (CHW)? What are the known CHWs’ occupational risks? What are the protective factors? By means of a PubMed search, we synthesized the most relevant publications to try to answer these questions. Failures of healthcare infrastructure and institutions include CHW shortages, insufficient medical supplies, medications, transportation, poorly paid health workers, security concerns, and the absence of firm guidance in health policy. Healthcare needs affecting the patient population and CHWs include crisis-induced injury and illness, hazardous exposures, communicable diseases, mental healthcare, and continuity of care for pre-crisis medical conditions. CHWs’ occupational hazards include supply deficiencies, infectious disease transmission, long working hours, staff shortages, financial reimbursements, mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, and inconsistent access to clean water, electricity, and Internet. CHWs suffer from injuries and illnesses that range from immediate, debilitating injuries to chronic, unforeseen effects like mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, anxiety, burnout, and even post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Protective factors include personal traits such as adaptability and resilience as well as skills learned through structured education and training. Success will be achieved by constructively collaborating with local authorities, local health workers, national military, foreign military, and aid organizations.","Harrell, Mason; Selvaraj, Saranya A.; Edgar, Mia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,327,16

METHODS: The study utilized a cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected electronically in the spring of 2020 from 265 nurses. The questionnaire included five sections: demographic characteristics, job satisfaction, turnover intentions, exposure to violence, and resilience levels. Multiple linear regression was used to determine factors associated with resilience. RESULTS: Results showed that the overall score of resilience among nurses was 66.91 ± 13.34. Most nurses were satisfied with their job (67.8%), and most nurses reported that it is unlikely for them to quit their present work in the coming year (76.2%). Over the last year, three-quarters of nurses (74.7%) reported being ever exposed to a form of occupational violence. The resilience of nurses was directly associated with job satisfaction and male gender and inversely associated with intention-to-quit and exposure to violence (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Enhancing the resilience of nurses at the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic improves their job satisfaction and retention and would help support the effectiveness and efficiency of care services. Nurse managers can regularly investigate the resilience of nurses and offer interventions that would strengthen it, especially at times of crisis.","Alameddine, Mohamad; Bou-Karroum, Karen; Ghalayini, Wahida; Abiad, Firas",Int J Nurs Sci,327,1

They can prolong QT interval, cause Torsade de pointes, and lead to sudden cardiac death. We aimed to assess QT interval prolongation and its risk factors in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. 172 patients with COVID-19 included, hospitalized at hospitals of Babol University of Medical Sciences between March 5, 2020, and April 3, 2020. Patients were divided into two groups: hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. Electrocardiograms were used for outcome assessment. Results: 83.1% of patients received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin vs 16.9% of patients who received only hydroxychloroquine. The mean age of patients was 59.2 {+/-} 15.4. The mean of post-treatment QTc interval in the monotherapy group was shorter than the mean of post-treatment QTc interval in the combination therapy group but it had no significant statistical difference (462.5 {+/-} 43.1 milliseconds vs 464.3 {+/-} 59.1 milliseconds; P = 0.488). Generally, 22.1% of patients had a prolonged QTc interval after treatment. Male gender, or baseline QTc [≥] 450 milliseconds, or high-risk Tisdale score increased the likelihood of prolonged QTc interval. Due to QTc prolongation, 14 patients did not continue therapy after 4 days. Conclusion: Hospitalized patients treated with hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, had no significant difference in prolongation of QT interval and outcome. But the number of patients with prolonged QT intervals in this study emphasizes careful cardiac monitoring during therapy; especially in high-risk patients.","Eftekhar, S.

Multiple vaccines have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials though real-world effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19 mortality in clinically and demographically diverse populations has not yet been reported. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort assembled from a cross-institution comprehensive data repository. Established patients of the health care system were categorized as not immunized, partially immunized, or fully immunized against SARS-CoV-2 with an mRNA vaccine through April 4, 2021. Outcomes were Covid-19 related hospitalization and death. Results: Of the 91,134 established patients, 70.2% were not immunized, 4.5% were partially immunized and 25.4% were fully immunized. Among the fully immunized 0.7% had a Covid-19 hospitalization, whereas 3.4% among the partially immunized and 2.7% non-immunized individuals were hospitalized with Covid-19. Of the 225 deaths among Covid-19 hospitalizations, 219 (97.3%) were in the not immunized, 5 (2.2%) in the partially immunized, and 1 (0.0041%) in the fully immunized group. mRNA vaccines were 96% (95%CI: 95 - 99) effective at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization and 98.7% (95%CI: 91.0 - 99.8) effective at preventing Covid-19 related death when participants were fully vaccinated. Partial vaccination was 77% (95%CI: 71 - 82) effective at preventing hospitalization and 64.2% (95%CI: 13.0 - 85.2) effective at preventing death. Vaccine effectiveness at preventing hospitalization was conserved across subgroups of age, race, ethnicity, Area Deprivation Index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Conclusions: In a large, diverse cohort in the United States, full immunization with mRNA vaccines was highly effective in the real-world scenario at preventing Covid-19 related hospitalization and death.","Vahidy, F.

These factors have also been shown to impact dietary behavior and physical activity which play a role in precipitating and maintaining obesity. Less is known about the impact of social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in which social distancing is a major component of public health initiatives. This narrative review will examine the existing literature on the relationships between social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and weight as they relate to the COVID-19 pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Individuals with obesity are at very high risk for worsening course of COVID-19, hospitalization, and death. This population may also be more significantly impacted by the dietary and physical activity consequences resulting from lockdown, social distancing, and isolation. SUMMARY: The pandemic has led to significant lifestyle disruptions. However, early studies have largely relied upon cross-sectional studies or convenience samples.

We thus sought to compare differential predictive values of demographic, clinical, and laboratory measures and identify predictor for hypoxia in COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is single-center retrospective analysis of patient admitted at AIIMS Patna between 15(th) June and 15(th) Aug. All the patients who had oxygen saturation less than 94% grouped under hypoxic group while ≥94% in non-hypoxic group at room air. Statistical analysis: Logistic regression model used to determine the predictor of hypoxia in COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Total 73 were used for analysis. Study patients had a mean age of 55.05 ± 12.7 year, of whom 78.08% were male (57/73). 39 (53.42%) patients were found hypoxic at time of admission while 34 (46.56%) were non-hypoxic. Presence of dyspnoea significantly found more frequently in hypoxic patients (P = 0.0003). Patients with O2 saturation of less than 94% have more likely to have diabetes (P = 0.002) and hypertension (P = 0.02). Analysis of laboratory variables showed that leucocytosis (P = 0.007) and neutrophilia (P = 0.01) were significantly higher in hypoxic group compare to non-hypoxic group. Univariate regression model showed patient with any one comorbidities, diabetes, or hypertension was found as strong risk factor for hypoxia after COVID-19 infection (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to identify predictor of hypoxia in COVID-19 infection. Patient with any one comorbidities, diabetes, or hypertension was found strong risk factor for hypoxia after COVID-19 infection. Among lab variable, leucocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, and CRP (>27.5 mg/L) were found as predictor of hypoxia in COVID infection.","Rai, Deependra K.; Thakur, Somesh",J Family Med Prim Care,327,1

Here, we investigated the impact of lockdown on surface ozone (O(3)) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) over a tropical coastal station – Thumba, Thiruvananthapuram (8.5°N, 76.9°E). Daytime as well as night-time NO(2) showed reduction by 0.8 (40%) and 2.3 (35%) ppbv, respectively during the lockdown period of 25–30 March 2020 as compared with the same period of previous 3 years. Unlike many urban locations, daytime surface O(3) is found to be dramatically reduced by 15 ppbv (36%) with O(3) production rate being lower by a factor of 3 during the lockdown. Interestingly, a feature of O(3)-hump during the onset of land breeze typically observed during 1997–1998 has reappeared with magnitude of 5–10 ppbv. A photochemical box model, capturing this feature, revealed that significant O(3) sustained till onset of land breeze over the land due to weaker titration with NO(x) during lockdown. It is suggested that the transport of this O(3) rich air with onset of land breeze led to the observed hump. Our measurements unravel a remarkable impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the chemistry and dynamics of O(3) over this tropical coastal environment.

This paper describes the layout and functioning of a typical Fangcang shelter hospital, Wuhan Dongxihu Fangcang shelter Hospital, where the author has worked, the working mechanism, experience and effectiveness. A set of patient management protocols was employed for daily practice, which included preset criteria and procedure for admission, examination, medication treatment, referral and discharge. WeChat platform with different groups was used for communication, ward round, test appointments and patient data communication. All these procedures and mechanisms of working enabled the effective management of a larger number of patients with relatively few doctors. As a result, 442 mild or moderate COVID‐19 patients in Hall C were successfully managed by a team of 40 doctors, with 246 (56%) patients were cured and discharged from the Fangcang shelter hospital while the remaining 196 (44%) patients were referred on to designated hospitals for further treatment. The reasons for referral included poor resolution in computerized tomography (CT) scan (59%), persistently positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by PCR after 9 days of admission (16%), deterioration in CT image (4%), development of dyspnoea (1%) and other (4%) or unclear reasons (16%) due to no record of reasons for referral on the document. There were no deaths and no complaints from the patients in Hall C. In summary, the Fangcang shelter hospital could be run successfully with a set of patient management protocols under conditions of limited facilities and medical staff. It was effective and safe in isolating patients, providing basic medical care and early identification of potential severe cases. This experience may provide a successful example of a working mechanism for the prevention and control of the COVID‐19 pandemic worldwide.","Liu, Pei; Zhang, Hongmei; Long, Xiang; Wang, Wei; Zhan, Danting; Meng, Xinke; Li, Duoyun; Wang, Lingwei; Chen, Rongchang",Clin Respir J,327,20

V-ATPases are conserved proton pumps that populate and acidify multiple organelles of the secretory and the endocytic pathway. Complete loss of V-ATPase activity causes embryonic lethality in higher animals and conditional lethality in yeast, while partial loss of V-ATPase function is associated with multiple disease states. On the other hand, many cancer cells increase their virulence by upregulating V-ATPase expression and activity. The pH of individual organelles is tightly controlled and essential for function, but the mechanisms for compartment-specific pH regulation are not completely understood. There is substantial evidence indicating that the PIP content of membranes influences organelle pH. We present recent evidence that PIPs interact directly with subunit isoforms of the V-ATPase to dictate localization of V-ATPase subpopulations and participate in their regulation. In yeast cells, which have only one set of organelle-specific V-ATPase subunit isoforms, the Golgi-enriched lipid PI(4)P binds to the cytosolic domain of the Golgi-enriched a-subunit isoform Stv1, and loss of PI(4)P binding results in mislocalization of Stv1-containing V-ATPases from the Golgi to the vacuole/lysosome. In contrast, levels of the vacuole/lysosome-enriched signaling lipid PI(3,5)P(2) affect assembly and activity of V-ATPases containing the Vph1 a-subunit isoform. Mutations in the Vph1 isoform that disrupt the lipid interaction increase sensitivity to stress. These studies have decoded “zip codes” for PIP lipids in the cytosolic N-terminal domain of the a-subunit isoforms of the yeast V-ATPase, and similar interactions between PIP lipids and the V-ATPase subunit isoforms are emerging in higher eukaryotes. In addition to direct effects on the V-ATPase, PIP lipids are also likely to affect organelle pH indirectly, through interactions with other membrane transporters. We discuss direct and indirect effects of PIP lipids on organelle pH, and the functional consequences of the interplay between PIP lipid content and organelle pH.","Banerjee, Subhrajit; Kane, Patricia M.",Front Cell Dev Biol,327,1

Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, and beliefs that the virus is man-made and used for population control. In particular, those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources—such as YouTube—that have recommendations tailored by watch history, and who hold general conspiratorial beliefs, are less willing to be vaccinated. Since an increasing number of individuals use social media for gathering health information, interventions require action from governments, health officials, and social media companies.

Individuals in both A and I may go directly to an immune class V, and in I to a dead class D. Upon this SCLAIV formulation we impose a set of drivers that can be used to develop policy to manage current Covid-19 and similar type disease outbreaks. These drivers include surveillance, social distancing (rate and efficacy), social relaxation, quarantining (linked to contact tracing), patient treatment/isolation and vaccination processes that can either be a non-negative constant or an s-shaped switching curve. The latter are defined in terms of onset and switching times, initial and final values, and abruptness of switching. We built a Covid-19 NMB-DASA web app to generate both deterministic and stochastic solutions to our SCLAIV and drivers model and use incidence and mortality data to provide both maximum-likelihood frequentist and Bayesian fitting of parameters. In the context of South African and English Covid-19 incidence data we demonstrate how to both identify and evaluate the role of drivers in ongoing outbreaks. In particular, we show that early social distancing in South Africa likely averted around 80,000 observed cases (actual number is double if only half the case are observed) during the months of June and July. We also demonstrated that incidence rates in South Africa will increase to between a conservative estimate of 15 and 30 thousand observed cases per day (again, actual number considerably higher) by the end of August if stronger social distancing measures are not effected during July and August, 2020. On different a note, we show that comparably good local optimal fits of the English data using surveillance, social distancing and social relaxation drivers can represent very different kinds of outbreaks---one with close to 90% and another with under 8% immune individuals. This latter result provides a cautionary tale of why fitting SEIR-like models to incidence or prevalence data can be extremely problematic when not anchored by other critical measures, such as levels of immunity in the population. Our presentation illustrates how our Covid-19 web app can be used by individuals without any programming skills to carry out forensic and scenario analyses in spatially contained populations such as small countries or metropolitan areas.","Getz, W.

Telehealth and telemedicine systems aim to deliver remote healthcare services to mitigate the spread of COVID-9. Also, they can help to manage scarce healthcare resources to control the massive burden of COVID-19 patients in hospitals. However, a large portion of today's telehealth and telemedicine systems are centralized and fall short of providing necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients’ insurance claims and physician credentials. Methods. The current study has explored the potential opportunities and adaptability challenges for blockchain technology in telehealth and telemedicine sector. It has explored the key role that blockchain technology can play to provide necessary information security and privacy, operational transparency, health records immutability, and traceability to detect frauds related to patients’ insurance claims and physician credentials. Results. Blockchain technology can improve telehealth and telemedicine services by offering remote healthcare services in a manner that is decentralized, tamper-proof, transparent, traceable, reliable, trustful, and secure. It enables health professionals to accurately identify frauds related to physician educational credentials and medical testing kits commonly used for home-based diagnosis. Conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association among social media exposure, risk perception, preventive behaviors, and attitudes toward the COVID-19 epidemic in Bolivia. METHODS: We launched an online survey in La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia, during April and May 2020. The questionnaire examined: Socio-demographic factors, Social media use, Risk Perception, Preventive behaviors, attitudes and the willingness to use a vaccine if it were available in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic. A logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with risk perception and a structural equation model (SEM) was performed to explore the pathway of the relationship among social media exposure, risk perception and preventive behaviors and attitudes. RESULTS: Among 886 participants, the most were young adults, between 18–25 years old (73.4%) and 577 (65.1%) were female. During the the week before the survey 387 (43.7%) reported be exposure to social media Covid-19 information almost always or always. Moreover 304 (34.3%) were categorized as with a high risk perception. The multivariable analyses show that being female (aOR = 1.5, CI 95% 1.1–2.1) and having high exposure to Covid-19 information on social media (aOR = 2.5, CI 95% 1.3–5.3) were associated with a higher risk perception for Covid-19. Furthermore, SEM results indicated that risk perception is associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors and attitudes (β = 0.605, p < 0.001) including the acceptance of a vaccine if one were available (β = 0.388, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Social media exposure to COVID-19 information influences the adoption of preventive attitudes and behaviors through shaping risk perception.

Among those with FIB‐4 score of 1.45‐3.25, hospitalization rate/1000‐person‐years was 41.4 among HCV+ and 20.2 among HCV−, while among those with a FIB‐4 > 3.25, the rate‐ was 9.4 and 0.6 (P < .0001). There was no difference in all‐cause mortality by age, gender, FIB‐4 score, number of comorbidities or treatment with remdesivir and/or systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: HCV+ persons with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are more likely to be admitted to a hospital. The hospitalization rate also increased with higher FIB‐4 score. However, admission to an ICU and mortality are not different between those with and without HCV infection.","Butt, Adeel A.; Yan, Peng; Chotani, Rashid A.; Shaikh, Obaid S.",Liver Int,327,1

Therefore, the community treatment center (CTC) with a digital health care monitoring system based on the smartphone application and personal health record platform (PHR) was implemented. Thus, we report our experience in one of the CTCs to investigate the role of CTC and the feasibility of the digital health care monitoring system in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The Gyeongbuk-Daegu 2 CTC was set up at the private residential facility. Admission criteria were 1) patients < 65 years with COVID-19, 2) patients without underlying medical comorbidities, and 3) COVID-19 disease severity of mild class. Admitted patients were placed under monitoring of vital signs and symptoms. Clinical information was collected using the smartphone application or telephone communication. Collected information was displayed on the PHR platform in a real-time fashion for close monitoring. RESULTS: From Mar 3, 2020, to Mar 26, 2020, there was a total of 290 patients admitted to the facility. Males were 104 (35.9%). The median age was 37 years. The median time between the COVID-19 diagnosis and admission was 7 days. Five patients were identified and were transferred to the designed COVID-19 treatment hospital for their urgent medical needs. The smartphone application usage to report vital signs and symptoms was noted in 96% of the patients. There were no deaths of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that implementation of the CTC using a commercial residence facility and digital health care technology may offer valuable solutions to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.","Kim, Jong Hun; Choi, Won Suk; Song, Joon Young; Yoon, Young Kyung; Kim, Min Ja; Sohn, Jang Wook",BMC Infect Dis,327,16

The source COVID-19 is not absolutely clear; however, the disease may be transmitted by either by COVID-19-positive individuals or from a contaminated environment. In this review, we focused on how the COVID-19 virus is transmitted in the community. An extensive literature search was conducted using specific keywords and criteria. Based on the published report, it is concluded that COVID-19 is primarily transmitted human-to-human via oral and respiratory aerosols and droplets with the virus-contaminated environment play a lesser role in the propagation of disease.

The inflammatory response to COVID-19 infection in children remains poorly characterised. Methods We retrospectively analysed the medical records of 127 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 1 month to 16 years from Wuhan and Jingzhou of Hubei Province. Patients presented between January 25th and March 24th 2020. Information on clinical features, laboratory results, plasma cytokines/chemokines and lymphocyte subsets were analysed. Findings Children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 were more likely to be male (67.7%) and the median age was 7.3 [IQR 4.9] years. All but one patient with severe disease was aged under 2 and the majority (5/7) had significant co-morbidities. Despite 53% having viral pneumonia on CT scanning only 2 patients had low lymphocyte counts and no differences were observed in the levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha; and interferon (IFN)-gamma; between patients with mild, moderate or severe disease. Interpretations We demonstrated that the immune responses of children to COVID-19 infection is significantly different from that seen in adults. Our evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger a robust inflammatory response or ""cytokine storm"" in children with COVID-19, and this may underlie the generally better outcomes seen in children with this disease. These data also imply anti-cytokine therapies may not be effective in children with moderate COVID-19.","Qian, G.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, Y.; Hu, W.; Hall, I.; Yue, J.; Lu, H.; Ruan, L.; Ye, M.; Mei, J.",,327,24

METHODS: HCWs participating in regular SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing were invited for serological testing prior to first and second vaccination, and 4 weeks post-vaccination if receiving a 12-week dosing interval. Quantitative post-vaccination anti-spike antibody responses were measured using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (detection threshold: ≥50 AU/ml). We used multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of seropositivity and generalised additive models to track antibody responses over time. RESULTS: 3570/3610(98.9%) HCWs were seropositive >14 days post-first vaccination and prior to second vaccination, 2706/2720(99.5%) after Pfizer-BioNTech and 864/890(97.1%) following Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. Previously infected and younger HCWs were more likely to test seropositive post-first vaccination, with no evidence of differences by sex or ethnicity. All 470 HCWs tested >14 days after second vaccine were seropositive. Quantitative antibody responses were higher after previous infection: median(IQR) >21 days post-first Pfizer-BioNTech 14,604(7644-22,291) AU/ml vs. 1028(564-1985) AU/ml without prior infection (p<0.001). Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine recipients had lower readings post-first dose compared to Pfizer-BioNTech, with and without previous infection, 10,095(5354-17,096) and 435(203-962) AU/ml respectively (both p<0.001 vs. Pfizer-BioNTech). Antibody responses >21 days post-second Pfizer vaccination in those not previously infected, 10,058 (6408-15,582) AU/ml, were similar to those after prior infection and one vaccine dose. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination leads to detectable anti-spike antibodies in nearly all adult HCWs. Whether differences in response impact vaccine efficacy needs further study.","Eyre, David W.; Lumley, Sheila F.; Wei, Jia; Cox, Stuart; James, Tim; Justice, Anita; Jesuthasan, Gerald; O’Donnell, Denise; Howarth, Alison; Hatch, Stephanie B.; Marsden, Brian D.; Jones, E Yvonne; Stuart, David I.; Ebner, Daniel; Hoosdally, Sarah; Crook, Derrick W.; Peto, Tim EA.; Walker, Timothy M.; Stoesser, Nicole E.; Matthews, Philippa C.; Pouwels, Koen B.; Walker, A Sarah; Jeffery, Katie",Clin Microbiol Infect,327,20

However, it utilizes time-consuming procedures and expensive instruments, making it infeasible for point-of-care (POC) analysis especially in resource-limited settings. In this work, a multicolorimetric ELISA biosensor integrated on a paper/polymer hybrid microfluidic device was developed for rapid visual detection of disease biomarkers at point of care, without using costly equipment. This multicolormetric ELISA platform was built on multiple distinct color variants resulted from the catalytic oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and the etching of gold nanorods (AuNRs). The vivid color changes could be easily distinguished by the naked eye, and their red mean values allowed quantitative biomarker detection, without using any sophisticated instruments. When this multicolorimetric ELISA was integrated on a paper/polymer hybrid analytical device, it not only provided integrated processing and high portability but also enabled fast assays in about 50 min due to the unique advantages of paper/polymer hybrid devices. The limit of detection of 9.1 ng/μL of the hepatitis C virus core antigen, a biomarker for hepatitis C, was achieved using this multicolorimetric ELISA platform. This multicolor ELISA analytical device provides a new versatile, user-friendly, affordable, and portable immunosensing platform with high potential for on-site detections of various viruses, proteins, and biomarkers for low-resource settings such as at home, public venues, rural areas, and developing nations.

To examine the value of wildlife rehabilitation records for characterizing local human-wildlife conflicts and prevalence of select wildlife diseases, we reviewed 45,668 records representing over 280 species admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation facility over a 10-year period (2005–2014). We identified the most frequently recorded causes of admission for commonly admitted species, and evaluated how causes of admission may vary across taxa throughout the year. Our analyses support the value of wildlife rehabilitation facility data for characterizing some pressures from human-wildlife conflict and select disease trends for certain taxa, as well as utility for informing topics to emphasize in local conservation education efforts. For example, orphaned neonatal wildlife accounted for the largest proportion of admissions to this facility, and highlights a opportunity for conservation education regarding when wildlife is truly orphaned and requires professional intervention. Additionally, domestic dog attack cases accounted for a proportion of admissions comparable to that of domestic cat attacks, demonstrating a need for the conversation surrounding the impact of domestic pets on local wildlife to expand to include dogs in addition to cats.","Long, Rachel B.; Krumlauf, Kristi; Young, Anna M.",PLoS One,327,22

Prior to August 2018, African Swine Fever (ASF) had not been reported in Asia, but has since spread throughout China, Mongolia, Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Papua New Guinea. Using data collated from reports of confirmed cases, we applied spatio-temporal analysis to describe ASFV spread throughout Asia during its early phase - from 1 August 2018 (reported start date) to 31 December 2019 - to provide an overview and comparative analysis. Analysis revealed a propagating epidemic of ASFV throughout Asia, with peaks corresponding to increased reports from China, Vietnam and Laos. Two clusters of reported outbreaks were found. During the epidemic, ASFV primarily spread from the North-East to the South-East: a larger, secondary cluster in the North-East represented earlier reports, whilst the smaller, primary cluster in the South-East was characterised by later reports. Significant differences in country-specific epidemics, morbidity, mortality and unit types were discovered. The initial number of outbreaks and enterprise size are likely predictors of the speed of spread and the effectiveness of ASFV stamping out procedures. Biosecurity methods, wild boar populations and the transportation of pigs and movement of infected fomites are discussed as likely risk factors for facilitating ASFV spread across Asia.","Mighell, E; Ward, M P",Transboundary and emerging diseases,327,28

We used linear mixed-effects regression to examine changes in health climate, safety climate, and worker well-being, prior to the pandemic and at two timepoints during it. We also examined whether employees at organizations that had received a TWH leadership development intervention prior to COVID-19 would better maintain pre-pandemic perceptions of climates and well-being. The final study cohort consisted of 261 employees from 31 organizations. No differences were observed in mean outcome scores between the leadership intervention groups at any of the survey timepoints. We combined intervention groups to examine the difference across timepoints. Perceptions of health and safety climates remained stable across all timepoints. However, employee well-being scores declined between the pre-pandemic period and subsequent COVID-19 timepoints. These findings suggest that while small organizations continued to be viewed as supporting employees’ health and safety over the course of the pandemic, well-being scores declined, indicating that other factors contributed to decreased well-being. The findings from this study have implications for small business leaders as they navigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health, safety, and well-being on their organizations and employees.","Brown, Carol E.; Dexter, Lynn; Schwatka, Natalie V.; Dally, Miranda; Tenney, Liliana; Shore, Erin; Newman, Lee S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,327,15

Efficient utilization of health resources requires information regarding the trends of TJR. This study investigated the association of TJR with the demographic characteristics in Taiwan from 1998 to 2009. It also estimated the demand for total knee replacement (TKR) and total hip replacement (THR) in the next two decades. METHODS: International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) procedure codes were used to identify the data for primary and revision TKRs and THRs between the years 1998 and 2009 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Age- and sex-specific rates of such procedures were calculated. The trend in TJR rate and its future estimation were studied with regression analyses. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2009, the number of primary TKRs increased by 99.1% and that of primary THRs increased by 11.3%. The number of revision TKRs increased by 3.1% and that of revision THRs decreased by 13.2%. Compared with their respective rates in 2005, the rates of primary TKR and primary THR were projected to increase by 508.2% and 69.7%, respectively, in 2030. The rate of revision TKR was predicted to increase by 75.3% and that of revision THR to decrease by 36.1%. CONCLUSION: This study gives an insight into the current status burden of TJR in Taiwan.

Many mild infections are typically not reported and, depending on their contagiousness, may support stealth transmission and the spread of documented infection. METHODS: Here we use observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data, a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference, to infer critical epidemiological characteristics associated with the emerging coronavirus, including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness. RESULTS: We estimate 86% of all infections were undocumented (95% CI: [82%−90%]) prior to the Wuhan travel shutdown (January 23, 2020). Per person, these undocumented infections were 52% as contagious as documented infections ([44%−69%]) and were the source of infection for two-thirds of documented cases. Our estimate of the reproductive number (2.23; [1.77–3.00]) aligns with earlier findings; however, after travel restrictions and control measures were imposed this number falls considerably. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of COVID-19 infections were undocumented prior to implementation of control measures on January 23, and these undocumented infections substantially contributed to virus transmission. These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of COVID-19 and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging. Our findings also indicate that heightened awareness of the outbreak, increased use of personal protective measures, and travel restriction have been associated with reductions of the overall force of infection; however, it is unclear whether this reduction will be sufficient to stem the virus spread.","Li, Ruiyun; Pei, Sen; Chen, Bin; Song, Yimeng; Zhang, Tao; Yang, Wan; Shaman, Jeffrey",medRxiv,327,3

To date, various models of Artificial Intelligence (AI) entered into the real-world to detect the COVID-19 disease from human-generated sounds such as voice/speech, cough, and breath. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented for solving a lot of real-world problems on machines based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this context, one dimension (1D) CNN is suggested and implemented to diagnose respiratory diseases of COVID-19 from human respiratory sounds such as a voice, cough, and breath. An augmentation-based mechanism is applied to improve the preprocessing performance of the COVID-19 sounds dataset and to automate COVID-19 disease diagnosis using the 1D convolutional network. Furthermore, a DDAE (Data De-noising Auto Encoder) technique is used to generate deep sound features such as the input function to the 1D CNN instead of adopting the standard input of MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient), and it is performed better accuracy and performance than previous models. RESULTS: As a result, around 4% accuracy is achieved than traditional MFCC. We have classified COVID-19 sounds, asthma sounds, and regular healthy sounds using a 1D CNN classifier and shown around 90% accuracy to detect the COVID-19 disease from respiratory sounds. CONCLUSION: A Data De-noising Auto Encoder (DDAE) was adopted to extract the acoustic sound signals in-depth features instead of traditional MFCC.

It has been causing a huge fatality and death toll reported. Besides, a very swift transmission of viruses distributed within 213 countries, including Ethiopia. Therefore, this empirical study investigates all government and stakeholders’ effects in line with identifying the current status found in Ethiopia. METHODS: Qualitative approach of data collections and thematic analysis were used. RESULTS: The outcomes indicate that COVID-19 situations gain the highest momentum by increasing alarmingly. It shows significant differences after two months since March 2020 it has reported the first case in Ethiopia. The government took several measures ranging from public health emergency response to the state of emergency. The communication strategy and state of emergency are in place to reduce the prospective risks of COVID-19. The strategy segmented the population by tailoring activities of risk communication and community engagement at all levels. The government has strongly obtained various measures like lockdown and a state of emergency. However, it was not strict and has not been heavy-handed that much. CONCLUSION: KAP’s practices are inadequate to fight and minimize the impacts of the pandemic. Such negligence among the public and related factors undermined the preparedness and responses towards COVID-19 in Ethiopia. New cases and deaths are non-stoppable. The government is using several strategies and need to strengthen those efforts to mobilize and upbeat the KAP’s of the public through different communication forms to reinforce the existing efforts and alleviate socio-cultural, political, economic factors to drive out COVID-19 among the people. The efforts are building and strengthening up to the standard level of KAP’s while enhancing and promoting existing strategies and the drawing of new documents by focusing on high-risk parts of the population.","Zikargae, Mekonnen Hailemariam",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,327,16

They are activated by ligands produced during microbial biosynthesis of riboflavin that is presented by major histocompatibility complex class I-related (MR1) molecules on antigen-presenting cells. MAIT cells also possess interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 receptors and can be activated by the respective cytokines released from microbially stimulated antigen-presenting cells. Therefore, MAIT cells can be involved in bacterial and viral defenses and are a significant part of the human immune system. They are particularly abundant in the liver, an organ serving as the second firewall of gut microbes next to the intestinal barrier. Therefore, the immune functions of MAIT cells are greatly impacted by changes in the gut-microbiota and play important roles in the gut-liver pathogenesis axis. In this review, we discuss the nature and mechanisms of MAIT cell activation and their dynamics during different types of liver pathogenesis conditions. We also share our perspectives on important aspects that should be explored further to reveal the exact roles that MAIT cells play in liver pathogenesis in the context of the gut microbiota.","Gebru, Yoseph Asmelash; Choi, Mi Ran; Raja, Ganesan; Gupta, Haripriya; Sharma, Satya Priya; Choi, Ye Rin; Kim, Hyeong Seop; Yoon, Sang Jun; Kim, Dong Joon; Suk, Ki Tae",Microorganisms,327,24

For people with disabilities, public health resources are often of greater importance; they additionally provide disability context-specific information. However, to leverage the benefits of such resources for the widest demographic groups, Web accessibility requirements should be met at an acceptable level (e.g., WCAG 2.0, Level AA). This study evaluates the accessibility of a number of public health websites from 25 countries. The choice of the selected websites is determined by the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak in the corresponding countries and their rank as of late April, 2020. Ultimately, this study aims at shedding light on the current situation of accessibility to health information and pinpointing the aspects where accessibility to information falls short in public health websites. Using different evaluation tools, the overall results show that the vast majority of public health websites, of a number of different countries, still have many critical accessibility barriers, especially with regards to the perception of information and operability of the interface items. The findings of this study suggest a need for major efforts toward ensuring accessible public health resources in most of the evaluated websites. As this pattern has repeatedly occurred in many relevant studies in different parts of the world, legislation along with educating Web developers regarding Web accessibility requirements and universal design principles become an urgent necessity.","Alajarmeh, Nancy",Univers Access Inf Soc,327,16

Dying in a hospital can be highly stressful for patients and families. Persons with dementia are particularly vulnerable to negative outcomes in hospital. This study aims to describe changes in the proportion of older adults with and without dementia dying in nursing homes, home, hospital and other locations over an 11-year period covering the reform. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a repeated cross-sectional, population-level study using mortality data from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry hosted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants were Norwegian older adults 65 years or older with and without dementia who died from 2006 to 2017. The policy intervention was the 2012 Coordination Reform that increased care infrastructure into communities. The primary outcome was location of death listed as a nursing home, home, hospital or other location. The trend in the proportion of location of death, before and after the reform was estimated using an interrupted time-series analysis. All analyses were adjusted for sex and seasonality. Of the 417,862 older adult decedents, 61,940 (14.8%) had dementia identified on their death certificate. Nursing home deaths increased over time while hospital deaths decreased for the total population (adjusted Relative Risk Ratio (aRRR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.82–0.92) and persons with dementia (aRRR: 0.93, 95%CI 0.91–0.96) after reform implementation. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the 2012 Coordination Reform was associated with decreased older adults dying in hospital and increased nursing home death; however, the number of people dying at home did not change.","MacNeil Vroomen, Janet L.; Kjellstadli, Camilla; Allore, Heather G.; van der Steen, Jenny T.; Husebo, Bettina",PLoS One,327,10

METHODS: Seventy-four COVID-19 patients admitted between March 16th and June 3rd 2020 to the Asklepios Lung Clinic Munich-Gauting, Germany, were included in the study. Patients were categorized in a non-severe group including patients hospitalized on general wards only and in a severe group including patients requiring intensive care treatment. Fully automated quantification of CT scans was performed via IMBIO CT Lung Texture analysis™ software. Predictive biomarkers were assessed with receiver-operator-curve and likelihood analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (44% female) presented with non-severe COVID-19 and 19 patients (32% female) with severe disease. Five fatalities were reported in the severe group. Accurate automated CT analysis was possible with 61 CTs (82%). Disease severity was linked to lower residual normal lung (72.5% vs 87%, p = 0.003), increased ground glass opacities (GGO) (8% vs 5%, p = 0.031) and increased reticular pattern (8% vs 2%, p = 0.025). Disease severity was associated with advanced age (76 vs 59 years, p = 0.001) and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP, 92.2 vs 36.3 mg/L, p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 485 vs 268 IU/L, p < 0.001) and oxygen supplementation (p < 0.001) upon admission. Predictive risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were oxygen supplementation, LDH >313 IU/L, CRP >71 mg/L, <70% normal lung texture, >12.5% GGO and >4.5% reticular pattern. CONCLUSION: Automated low dose CT analysis upon admission might be a useful tool to predict COVID-19 severity in patients.","Stoleriu, Mircea Gabriel; Gerckens, Michael; Obereisenbuchner, Florian; Zaimova, Iva; Hetrodt, Justin; Mavi, Sarah-Christin; Schmidt, Felicitas; Schoenlebe, Anna Auguste; Heinig-Menhard, Katharina; Koch, Ina; Jörres, Rudolf A; Spiro, Judith; Nowak, Lorenz; Hatz, Rudolf; Behr, Jürgen; Gesierich, Wolfgang; Heiß-Neumann, Marion; Dinkel, Julien",Clin Imaging,327,28

In the current emergent situation, drug repurposing of well-known traditional and/or approved drugs could be the most effective strategy. Herein, through computational approaches, we aimed to screen 14 natural compounds from limonoids and terpenoids class for their ability to inhibit the key therapeutic target proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Among these, some limonoids, namely deacetylnomilin, ichangin and nomilin, and the terpenoid β-amyrin provided good interaction energies with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) in molecular dynamic simulation. Interestingly, deacetylnomilin and ichangin showed direct interaction with the catalytic dyad of the enzyme so supporting their potential role in preventing SARS-CoV-2 replication and growth. On the contrary, despite the good affinity with the spike protein RBD site, all the selected phytochemicals lose contact with the amino acid residues over the course of 120ns-long molecular dynamics simulations therefore suggesting they scarcely can interfere in SARS-CoV-2 binding to the ACE2 receptor. The in silico analyses of docking score and binding energies, along with predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, indicate that these triterpenoids might have potential as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, recommending further in vitro and in vivo investigations for a complete understanding and confirmation of their inhibitory potential.","Giofrè, Salvatore Vincenzo; Napoli, Edoardo; Iraci, Nunzio; Speciale, Antonio; Cimino, Francesco; Muscarà, Claudia; Molonia, Maria Sofia; Ruberto, Giuseppe; Saija, Antonella",Comput Biol Med,327,26

There were many studies about rheumatology and COVID-19. But there is no study about bibliometric analysis of these studies. This study provides a general overview of studies on rheumatology and COVID-19. METHODS: Data were taken from the Web of Science (WoS) website. Analysis and network visualization mapping processes were carried out using VOSviewer. We used the following keywords: “COVID-19” and “Rheumatology”; “Coronavirus” and “Rheumatology”; “2019-nCoV” and “Rheumatology”; “SARS-CoV-2” and “Rheumatology”; “COVID-19” and “Rheumatic Disease”; “Coronavirus” and “Rheumatic Disease”; “2019-nCoV” and “Rheumatic Disease”; “SARS-CoV-2” and “Rheumatic Disease”; “COVID-19” and “Rheumatism”; “Coronavirus” and “Rheumatism”; “2019-nCoV” and “Rheumatism”; and “SARS-CoV-2” and “Rheumatism.” A total of 234 publications were analyzed, and the correlations between citation numbers and reference counts, usage counts, and page numbers were analyzed with Spearman correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The average number of citations per item was 6.03. The studies were cited 1411 times in total, and 1121 times without self-citations. The countries with the highest number of publications on rheumatology and COVID-19 were the USA and England; the countries with the highest number of citations were Italy and the USA, and Jinoos Yazdany was the most cited author. The Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases was the most cited journal, whereas the highest number of articles on rheumatology and COVID-19 were published in Arthritis and Rheumatology. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliometric analysis of rheumatology and COVID-19 can be useful to future studies because it provides a general perspective on the studies.

Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH ≥ 57%. Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival. Uncovering the exact properties and components that make saliva a favorable environment for the survival of viruses, in particular enveloped ones like Phi6, is thus of great importance for reducing transmission of viral respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.","Fedorenko, Aliza; Grinberg, Maor; Orevi, Tomer; Kashtan, Nadav",Sci Rep,327,18

A total of 14 monkeys were divided into four groups: A) Prophylactic group (n=03), (B) Treatment group (n=03), (C) infection control group (n=04) and (D) negative control group (n=04) and were housed in BSL-3 Animal facility while group D was housed at another animal house. Group A was administered with Renessans @ 2.85 mg/7 kg from 5 days prior to the infection to 08 days post infections (DPI). Group B was administered with Renessans from 03-08 DPI @ 2.85 mg/7 kg. Group C was administered with WIF only. The infection @ 2 × 106 TCID of SARS-CoV-2 was given to all group monkeys through intranasal and oral route under anesthesia. Nasal swab samples (at different times) and fecal matter on daily basis were collected for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 through real-time quantitative PCR. Three monkeys (one from each of group A, B and C) were euthanized at 07 DPI to determine the gross pathological lesions and SARS-CoV-2 detection from internal tissues. Nasal swabs from all the monkeys from group A, B and C were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at 02 and 07 DPI (Day 05 of treatment). At 14 DPI, all (100%) nasal swabs from group A were negative for SARS-CoV-2 while 50% and 100% were positive from group B and C, respectively. At 21 DPI, monkeys from group B were negative and all in group C were still positive for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, fecal matter of monkeys in group A and B was returned negative in significantly lesser time as compared to monkeys from infection control group. Based on these research findings it is concluded that the Renessans has in-vivo SARS-CoV-2 activity and may result in early clearance of SARS-CoV-2.

The United States (U.S.) leads the world with 30,291,863 confirmed reported cases and 549,664 deaths as of March 29, 2021 compared to globally confirmed cases at 127,442,926 and 2,787,915 deaths as of March 29, 2021. The U.S. federal government primarily left the response to the virus to individual states, and each implemented varying measures designed to protect health of citizens and the state’s economic well-being. Unintended consequences of the virus and measures to stop its spread may include decreased physical activity and exercise, shifting access and consumption of food, and lower quality-of-life. Therefore, our primary goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on health and well-being by measuring changes in physical activity, mental health-quality of life, food security and nutrition in adults ages 40 and older. We believed shifts in health behaviors would be more prevalent in minorities, less educated, lower socio-economic status, older adults, and those with underlying health conditions, so a secondary goal was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on these sub-populations. METHODS: We conducted an online survey with 9969 adults 40 years and older between 9 August and 15 September 2020 in urban areas across the four U.S. census regions. The survey included questions about demographic variables, pre-existing health conditions, physical activity, access to food, quality-of-life, and nutritional food status and asked participants to respond with information from pre-pandemic and pandemic conditions. We used paired-sample t-tests to detect changes in variables after the start of the pandemic and Cohen’s d to determine effect sizes. RESULTS: Our main findings showed a decrease in physical activity since the onset of COVID-19 for minorities and non-minorities. Food security also slightly increased for minorities during the pandemic, but we found no other changes in food security, quality-of-life indicators, or nutritional status of those who responded to this survey. CONCLUSIONS: It is concerning that physical activity declined. Such activity helps maintain physical and mental health, and it is also an important time to socialize for many older adults. In many ways, our data indicate that the older adult population in U.S. cities may be more resilient than expected during the pandemic. However, the pandemic could have negative impacts that we did not detect, either due to the survey instrument or the timing of our survey, so the health and well-being of older adults should continue to be monitored in order to mitigate potential negative impacts.","Harrison, Elgloria; Monroe-Lord, Lillie; Carson, Andrew D.; Jean-Baptiste, Anne Marie; Phoenix, Janet; Jackson, Phronie; Harris, B.

Neurogastroenterology is a subspecialty of gastroenterology focused on motility and functional gastrointestinal disorders, including consultations, and conducting procedures (eg, endoscopies, manometries/pH-monitoring). AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID-19 on Neurogastroenterology in Latin America. METHODS: Members of the Latin American Society of Neurogastroenterology were invited by e-mail and social networks to participate in an online anonymous survey. It included 24 questions on demographics, clinical practice and procedure characteristics, impact of the pandemic, Telemedicine, and involvement in COVID-19 patient care. RESULTS: Sixty-one members mainly from Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil answered the survey. All reported a negative impact on their practice (88.6%: a 61% to 100% decrease), mainly in office consultations and elective endoscopies. Interestingly, emergency endoscopies decreased by 33.3%, while only 4% stopped performing manometries/pH-monitoring. The main reasons were patients’ fear for consulting, country’s lockdown, and physician’s decision to prevent infection spread. Telemedicine was implemented by 83% but only 64.7% were being remunerated. Almost 46% had to reduce salaries and working hours of their personnel. Fifty-nine percent had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19, 24.6% were involved in these patients’ care, and 11.5% were mobilized to COVID-19 wards. There were country differences: Colombia, lockdown (P=0.001); Mexico, COVID-19 patient-care (P=0.053); Mexico/Colombia, working in COVID-19 wards, (P=0.012); Brazil, less common elective procedures’ ban (P=0.012) and Telemedicine/reimbursement (P=0.034).

The role of institutional trust in explaining vaccination gaps has been highlighted in several qualitative reports but so far has only been quantified in a small number of high-income countries. METHODS: We matched information on child vaccination status from the Demographic Health Surveys with information on institutional trust from the Afrobarometer surveys at the subnational level. A total of 166 953 children from 41 surveys administered in 22 African countries covering 216 subnational regions were used. Based on a principal component analysis, we constructed an institutional mistrust index that combined the level of mistrust in the head of state, parliament, electoral system, courts and local government. Associations between institutional mistrust and child vaccination uptake were assessed with multivariable fixed effects logistic regressions that controlled for time-invariant subnational region characteristics and various child, caregiver, household and community characteristics. RESULTS: A 1 SD increase in the institutional mistrust index was associated with a 10% (95% CI of ORs: 1.03 to 1.18) increase in the likelihood that a child had not received any of eight basic vaccines and with a 6% decrease in the likelihood a child had received all of the basic vaccines (95% CI: 0.92 to 0.97). Institutional mistrust was negatively associated with the likelihood that a child had received each of the eight basic vaccinations (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Child vaccination rates in Africa are considerably lower in areas in which the local population displays high levels of mistrust towards local authorities. Institutional mistrust is an important dimension of vaccine hesitancy, considered as one of the most important threats to global health. Empowering local authorities with resources and communication strategies to address institutional mistrust may be needed to close the remaining vaccination gaps in Africa.","Stoop, Nik; Hirvonen, Kalle; Maystadt, Jean-Francois",BMJ Glob Health,327,15

A GRADE rapid review on the N95 respirators effectiveness,20.451097,4.39136,2020-06-03,"PURPOSE: In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the disease COVID-19, caused by a new variant of coronavirus 2019-nCoV as a global pandemic. The government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting movement of people as a preventive measure. This survey was designed and conducted during the lockdown period to assess its effect on ophthalmic practice and patient care in India. METHODS: An online survey was sent across to practicing Indian ophthalmologists across through various social media platforms. All valid responses were tabulated and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1260 ophthalmologists responded to the survey. Most of the respondents (775/1260; 61.5%) were in private practice and 14.8% (187/1260) were affiliated to ophthalmic institutes. At the time of taking the survey, 72.5% of the respondents (913/1260) were not seeing any patients due to the lockdown. Of those who were still examining patients, 82.9% (287/347) were only seeing emergency cases, based on their own clinical judgement. The proportion of ophthalmologists in ophthalmic institutes, government and municipal hospitals (126/253;49.8%) who were still seeing patients was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than those in private practice (174/775;22.4%). Apart from emergencies such as trauma, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis (81.8%), other surgeries that were still being performed included intravitreal injections (9.1%) and cataract surgeries (5.9%). Approximately, 77.5% (976/1260) of the respondents had begun telephonic/e-mail/video consultations or consultations over social media applications since the lockdown began. In addition, 59.1% (745/1260) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other specialties while examining patients. When asked about the resumption of practice upon easing off of the restrictions, 57.8% (728/1260) of the respondents said they were unsure of when to resume elective surgeries; furthermore, 62.8% (791/1260) were unsure about the preferred screening strategy or precautionary approach prior to resuming surgeries and were awaiting guidelines. CONCLUSION: Our survey shows that majority of ophthalmologists in India were not seeing patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, with near-total cessation of elective surgeries. Emergency services were still being attended to by 27.5% of ophthalmologists who responded. A large proportions of ophthalmologists had switched over to telephonic advice or other forms of telemedicine to assist patients. Most of the responding ophthalmologists were unclear about when and how to resume surgeries upon easing off of the COVID-19 related restrictions. Regulatory bodies should take note of this and issue appropriate guidelines regarding the same.","Nair, Akshay Gopinathan; Gandhi, Rashmin A; Natarajan, Sundaram",Indian J Ophthalmol,327,24

Many properties of COVID‐19 infection and transmission were still not yet established. METHODS: We collated and analysed data on 449 of the earliest COVID‐19 cases detected outside Hubei province to make inferences about transmission dynamics and severity of infection. We analysed 64 clusters to make inferences on serial interval and potential role of pre‐symptomatic transmission. RESULTS: We estimated an epidemic doubling time of 5.3 days (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.3, 6.7) and a median incubation period of 4.6 days (95% CI: 4.0, 5.2). We estimated a serial interval distribution with mean 5.7 days (95% CI: 4.7, 6.8) and standard deviation 3.5 days, and effective reproductive number was 1.98 (95% CI: 1.68, 2.35). We estimated that 32/80 (40%) of transmission events were likely to have occurred prior to symptoms onset in primary cases. Secondary cases in clusters had less severe illness on average than cluster primary cases. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transmissions are occurring around illness onset in an infected person, and pre‐symptomatic transmission does play a role. Detection of milder infections among the secondary cases may be more reflective of true disease severity.","Ren, Xiang; Li, Yu; Yang, Xiaokun; Li, Zhili; Cui, Jinzhao; Zhu, Aiqin; Zhao, Hongting; Yu, Jianxing; Nie, Taoran; Ren, Minrui; Dong, Shuaibing; Cheng, Ying; Chen, Qiulan; Chang, Zhaorui; Sun, Junling; Wang, Liping; Feng, Luzhao; Gao, George F.; Feng, Zijian; Li, Zhongjie",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,327,16

Prompt diagnosis is the key to mitigate this situation. As several diagnostic tools for COVID-19 are already available and others are still under development, mandating a comprehensive review of the efficacy of existing tools and evaluate the potential of others. AREAS COVERED: Currently explored platforms for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics and surveillance centered on qRT-PCR, RT-PCR, CRISPR, microarray, LAMP, lateral flow immunoassays, proteomics-based approaches, and radiological scans are overviewed and summarized in this review along with their advantages and downsides. A narrative literature review was carried out by accessing the freely available online databases to encapsulate the developments in medical diagnostics. EXPERT OPINION: An ideal detection method should be sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, and should allow early diagnosis of the infection as near as possible to the point of care that could alter the current situation for the better. Medical diagnostics is a highly dynamic field as no diagnostic method available for SARS-CoV-2 detection offers a perfect solution and requires more attention and continuous R&D to challenge the present-day pandemic situation","Sharma, Bhawna; Shahanshah, Mohd Fardeen Husain; Gupta, Sanjay; Gupta, Vandana",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,327,1

However, to date age and gender have not been considered in assessment of COVID‐19‐related cell count alterations. In this study, the impact of COVID‐19 as well as age and gender on a large variety of lymphocyte subsets was analyzed in 33 COVID‐19 patients and compared with cell counts in 50 healthy humans. We confirm that cell counts of total lymphocytes, B, NK, cytotoxic and helper T cells are reduced in patients with severe COVID‐19, and this tendency was observed in patients with moderate COVID‐19. Decreased cell counts were also found in all subsets of these cell types, except for CD4+ and CD8+ effector memory RA+ (EMRA) and terminal effector CD8+ cells. In multivariate analysis however, we show that in addition to COVID‐19, there is an age‐dependent reduction of total, central memory (CM), and early CD8+ cell subsets, as well as naïve, CM, and regulatory CD4+ cell subsets. Remarkably, reduced naïve CD8+ cell counts could be attributed to age alone, and not to COVID‐19. By contrast, decreases in other subsets could be largely attributed to COVID‐19, and only partly to age. In addition to COVID‐19, male gender was a major factor influencing lower counts of CD3+ and CD4+ lymphocyte numbers. Our study confirms that cell counts of lymphocytes and their subsets are reduced in patients with COVID‐19, but that age and gender must be considered when interpreting the altered cell counts.","Löhr, Phillip; Schiele, Stefan; Arndt, Tim Tobias; Grützner, Stefanie; Claus, Rainer; Römmele, Christoph; Müller, Gernot; Schmid, Christoph; Dennehy, Kevin M.; Rank, Andreas",Cytometry A,327,1

This study aimed to estimate the effects of five restart strategies after the disruption on required screening capacity and cancer burden. METHODS: Microsimulation models simulated five restart strategies for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. The models estimated required screening capacity, cancer incidence, and cancer-specific mortality after a disruption of 6 months. The restart strategies varied in whether screens were caught up or not and, if so, immediately or delayed, and whether the upper age limit was increased. RESULTS: The disruption in screening programmes without catch-up of missed screens led to an increase of 2.0, 0.3, and 2.5 cancer deaths per 100 000 individuals in 10 years in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, respectively. Immediately catching-up missed screens minimised the impact of the disruption but required a surge in screening capacity. Delaying screening, but still offering all screening rounds gave the best balance between required capacity, incidence, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies with the smallest loss in health effects were also the most burdensome for the screening organisations.

This study describes eleven dimensions of the home food environment among a national sample of U.S. adults and identifies which are associated with diet quality and overweight/obesity. METHODS: A national sample of U.S. adults ages 18 to 75 was recruited from an online survey panel. Respondents (n = 4942) reported on foods available in the home, including 1) fruit and vegetables, 2) salty snacks/sweets, 3) less healthy beverages, as well as 4) food placement, 5) shopping practices for fruits and vegetables, 6) food preparation, 7) portion control methods, 8) family meals from restaurants, 9) family household practices around TV and eating, 10) presence of a TV in the dining area, and 11) ownership of a scale. Self-reported height and weight, fruit and vegetable intake, and percent calories from fat were also assessed. RESULTS: Mean household size was 2.6, 32.7% had children in the home, and 23.1% lived alone. The majority were White (67.7%), with 12.3% Black and 14.3% Hispanic. Mean age was 44.4 and 48.3% were men. In multivariable models, seven features of the home food environment were associated with meeting the recommended fruit and vegetable intake guidelines, with food placement, meal preparation, frequency of shopping for fruit, and a greater variety of fruits and vegetables available in the home most strongly associated. Eight of 11 features were associated with percent energy from fat, including restaurant food for family meals, salty snacks and sweets availability, less healthy beverages availability, food placement, meal preparation, frequency of shopping for fruit, family eating with the TV on, and having a TV in the dining area.

The aim was to estimate the impact of androgen deprivation therapy on mortality from COVID-19 in men with prevalent prostate cancer by comparing all-cause mortality in the spring of 2020 to that in previous years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden all men with prostate cancer on March 1 each year in 2015–2020 were followed until June 30 the same year. Exposure to androgen deprivation therapy was ascertained from filled prescriptions for bicalutamide monotherapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH), or bilateral orchidectomy. RESULTS: A total of 9,822 men died in March-June in the years 2015–2020, of whom 5,034 men were on androgen deprivation therapy. There was an excess mortality in 2020 vs previous years in all men. The crude relative mortality rate ratio for 2020 vs 2015–2019 was 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.04) in men on GnRH, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) in men on bicalutamide monotherapy. After multivariable adjustment these ratios were attenuated to 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.12), respectively. When restricting the analysis to the regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19 or to the time period between 2 April to 10 June when mortality in 2020 was increased >30% compared to previous years, the results were similar to the main analysis.

Understanding impacts of self-isolation and self-quarantine on stress, anxiety, and depression will help us to mitigate these issues through appropriate development of mental health services. Methods: The sample was drawn from individuals who self-subscribed to Text4Hope, a service that delivers text messages based on a cognitive behavioral therapy framework. Text4Hope was developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subscribers were asked for demographic information and if they had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the pandemic via a survey link. Mental health was assessed using the validated instruments: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test results were derived using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version-26. Results: 6,041 of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers (18.4%) completed the survey. Of these respondents, 19.2% had self-isolated or self-quarantined in Alberta as of March 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-hoc analysis using adjusted residuals suggested that individuals aged 60 years of age or older, and retirees had a higher likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine, compared to respondents with other age or employment characteristics. One-week prevalence rates for self-reported measures of moderate to high stress, likely Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and likely Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) were 84.9, 46.7, and 41.4%, respectively. Respondents who had to self-isolate or self-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly more likely to present with moderate to high stress, significant anxiety symptomatology, and significant depressive symptomatology. Conclusions: Older age and employment status were significantly associated with the likelihood of self-isolation or self-quarantine. We found elevated self-reported levels of anxiety and depression associated with self-reported COVID-19 pandemic-related self-isolation and self-quarantine activity. These findings have mental health implications both during and after the pandemic and demonstrate the need for greater focus on psychological complications of self-isolation and self-quarantine, and development of optimal ways to manage these pandemic consequences.","Nkire, Nnamdi; Mrklas, Kelly; Hrabok, Marianne; Gusnowski, April; Vuong, Wesley; Surood, Shireen; Abba-Aji, Adam; Urichuk, Liana; Cao, Bo; Greenshaw, Andrew J.; Agyapong, Vincent I.

The aim of this study was to perform a review to describe neurological manifestations in patients with COVID‐19 and possible neuro‐invasive mechanisms of Sars‐CoV‐2. METHODS: Pubmed, WebOfScience and Covid‐dedicated databases were searched for the combination of COVID‐19 terminology and neurology terminology up to May 10(th) 2020. Social media channels were followed‐up between March 15(th) and May 10(th) 2020 for postings with the same scope. Neurological manifestations were extracted from the identified manuscripts and combined to provide a useful summary for the neurologist in clinical practice. RESULTS: Neurological manifestations potentially related to COVID‐19 have been reported in large studies, case series and case reports and include acute cerebrovascular diseases, impaired consciousness, cranial nerve manifestations and auto‐immune disorders such as Guillain‐Barré Syndrome often present in patients with more severe COVID‐19. Cranial nerve symptoms such as olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are highly prevalent in patients with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 even without associated nasal symptoms and often present in an early stage of the disease. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the neurological manifestations in patients with COVID‐19, especially when rapid clinical deterioration occurs. The neurological symptoms in COVID‐19 patients may be due to direct viral neurological injury or indirect neuroinflammatory and autoimmune mechanisms. No antiviral treatments against the virus or vaccines for its prevention are available and the long‐term consequences of the infection on human health remain uncertain especially with regards to the neurological system.","Vonck, Kristl; Garrez, Ieme; De Herdt, Veerle; Hemelsoet, Dimitri; Laureys, Guy; Raedt, Robrecht; Boon, Paul",Eur J Neurol,327,1

Analyses supported construct and predictively validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 social distance attitudes could inform policymakers, researchers, and clinicians who seek to promote protective social distance behaviors.","An, Lawrence; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M.

The identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis. Although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to use a real-time PCR diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries. Feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Salmonella spp. using molecular techniques. RESULTS: In total, 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study. Overall, 71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. In the control group, 13/43 (30.2%) dogs were positive, all with single infections only. The most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were CPA (40/104 dogs, 38.5%), CPV-2 (36/104 dogs, 34.6%), and Giardia spp. (14/104 dogs, 13.5%). CPV-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with CPA, Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp. No statistical difference (P = 0.8374) was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths (P = 0.5722) in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls. Whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections. Therefore, multiple pathogens should be investigated in dogs presenting with diarrhea. The effects of multiple pathogens on the disease outcomes remain unclear because the rate of death and the duration of diarrhea did not seem to be affected by these factors.","Gizzi, Aline Baumann da Rocha; Oliveira, Simone Tostes; Leutenegger, Christian M; Estrada, Marko; Kozemjakin, Denise Adamczyk; Stedile, Rafael; Marcondes, Mary; Biondo, Alexander Welker",BMC Vet Res,327,16

We assume the disease-dynamics is described by a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered-susceptible (SEIRS) epidemic model, where the infected class is divided into the asymptomatic infected, and symptomatic infectious classes. Stochasticity appears in the model due to fluctuations in the disease’s transmission and recovery rates. The disease eradication threshold is derived from the reproduction number. The estimated parameters are used to model the disease outbreak’s possible trajectories. Our analysis reveals that current interventions are having positive effects on the transmission and recovery rates. The analysis is demonstrated using the daily United States COVID-19 infection and recovered cases for the period: 01/22/2020-02/25/2021.","Otunuga, Olusegun M.",Results Phys,327,1

Vaccine manufacturing experts, leaders from local and global public health organizations and multilateral organizations, through diverse presentations, questions and answers, focused on the pandemic and the response of vaccine manufacturers where many are engaged in research and development and production agreements. The pandemic is expanding rapidly which makes the global availability and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines critical. Strategies put in place include the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) within which the COVAX facility aims to distribute 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with procurement mechanisms already being established. At the same time, regulatory authorities have emergency use authorizations aimed at the rapid approval of safe and effective vaccines, with a push for harmonization in regulatory approaches being advocated. The Meeting was also apprised of other innovations being developed for vaccines including multi-array patches for easier vaccine application, increased heat stability for mitigating cold chain and storage challenges, the barcoding of primary packaging for enhancing vaccine traceability, and gathering data for decision-making. Over time, these innovations will facilitate the widespread availability and equitable access of vaccines including those addressing epidemics and pandemics. In addition, a number of manufacturers described technologies they have for accelerating vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. Overall, there was agreement that manufacturers from developing countries play a critical role in the global research, development and supply of vaccines for a healthy future, with increasing collaboration and partnering between them a growing strength.","Pagliusi, Sonia; Hayman, Benoit; Jarrett, Stephen",Vaccine,327,20

Methods: In a single Center, study participants had five SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests done simultaneously; one rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (Superbio Colloidal Gold IgM/IgG), and four laboratory tests (Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG [RE], Abbott Architect i2000SR IgG [AAr], Abbott Alinity IgG [AAl], and Abbott Architect IgM CMIA). To determine seroprevalence, only positive test results on laboratory assay were considered true positives. Results: There were 157 participants, of whom 103 (65.6%) were female with a median age of 50 years (range 19–90). The IgG component of the RDT showed a high number of false positives (n = 18), was inferior to the laboratory assays (p < 0.001 RDT vs. AAl/AAr, p < 0.001 RDT vs. RE), and had reduced specificity (85.5% vs. AAl/AAr, 87.2% vs. RE). Sero-concordance was 97.5% between IgG laboratory assays (RE vs. AAl/AAr). Specificity of the IgM component of the RDT compared to Abbott IgM CMIA was 95.4%. Ten participants had positivity in at least one laboratory assay, seven (9.9%) of which were seen in HCWs. Two (4.1%) hematology/oncology (H/O) patients and a single (2.7%) haemodialysis (HD) were asymptomatically seropositive. Asymptomatic seroprevalence of HCWs compared to patients was not significant (p = 0.105). Conclusion: HCWs (9.9%) had higher, although non-significant asymptomatic seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to high-risk patients (H/O 4.1%, HD 2.7%).

The Mediterranean Diet in Older Adults (MINOA) study collected cross-sectional data from adults ≥65 years old (n = 436) from April 2014 to November 2015 in rural Crete, aiming to understand the interrelations between Mediterranean Diet adherence, Social Capital and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL). Multivariate linear regression, carried out using SPSS 20.0, revealed that both Social Capital and HRQL has a positive impact on Mediterranean Diet adherence after adjustment for confounders and independently of each other. Total Social Capital as well as its Value of Life/Social Agency component (β = 0.04 and β = 0.1, p < 0.05, respectively) had a positive relationship with Mediterranean Diet adherence. As far as HRQL is concerned, only the Physical Health components were found to have a positive association with Mediterranean Diet adherence (β = 0.09, p < 0.001). At the same time Total Social Capital was also seen to have a positive relationship with perceived Physical and Mental Health (β = 0.21 and β = 0.28, p < 0.001, respectively). In a population of older adults Social Capital, HRQL and Mediterranean Diet adherence seem to share intricate interrelations that impact both diet quality and quality of life overall.","Apostolaki, Ioanna; Pepa, Aleks; Vlassopoulos, Antonis; Kapsokefalou, Maria",Nutrients,327,16

In such cases, the ability to rapidly and objectively determine a patient's acuity and predict near-term care needs is a major challenge. At issue is the clinician's ability to correctly identify patients at risk for subsequent rapid clinical deterioration. Data-driven tools that can support such determinations in real-time may be a valuable adjunct to clinician judgement during COVID-19 surges. Objective: To assess the effectiveness of the Rothman Index (RI) predictive model in distinguishing the risk of subsequent deterioration or elevated care needs among hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We evaluated the initial RI score on admission to predict COVID-19 patient risk for 216 COVID-19 patients discharged from March 21st to June 7th, 2020 at Sinai LifeBridge Hospital and 1,453 COVID-19 patients discharged from any of Yale New Haven Health System's Yale New Haven, Bridgeport, and Greenwich hospitals from April 1st to April 28th, 2020. In-hospital mortality as a function of age and RI on admission for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients were compared. AUC values using each COVID-19 patient's initial RI on admission to predict in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, and ICU utilization were computed, as were precision and recall for mortality prediction at specific RI thresholds. Results: The RI computed at the time of admission provides a high degree of objective discrimination to differentiate the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations at the outset of hospitalization. The high risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 20-30% of the COVID-19 positive population with mortality rates from 40-50%. The low risk segment based on initial RI constitutes 40%-55% of the population with mortality rates ranging from 1%-8%. Of note is that COVID-19 patients who present with heightened but generally unremarkable acuity can be identified early as having considerably elevated risk for subsequent physiological deterioration. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients exhibit elevated mortality rates compared to non-COVID-19 medical service patients and may be subject to rapid deterioration following hospital admission. A lack of predictive indicators for identifying patients at high risk of subsequent deterioration or death can pose a challenge to clinicians. The RI has excellent performance characteristics when stratifying risk among COVID-19 patients at the time of admission. The RI can assist clinicians in real-time with a high degree of objective discrimination by segmenting the COVID-19 population into high and low risk populations. This supports rapid and optimal patient bed assignment and resource allocation.","Beals, J.; Barnes, J.; Durand, D.; Rimar, J.; Donohue, T.; Hoq, M.; Belk, K.; Amin, A.; Rothman, M.",,327,10
