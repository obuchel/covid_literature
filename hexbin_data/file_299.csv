1481,1481,1481,Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae Possesses an Antiviral Activity against Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus,8.493657,6.7082977,2014-05-30,"Pigs are often colonized by more than one bacterial and/or viral species during respiratory tract infections. This phenomenon is known as the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are pathogens that are frequently involved in PRDC. The main objective of this project was to study the in vitro interactions between these two pathogens and the host cells in the context of mixed infections. To fulfill this objective, PRRSV permissive cell lines such as MARC-145, SJPL, and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used. A pre-infection with PRRSV was performed at 0.5 multiplicity of infection (MOI) followed by an infection with App at 10 MOI. Bacterial adherence and cell death were compared. Results showed that PRRSV pre-infection did not affect bacterial adherence to the cells. PRRSV and App co-infection produced an additive cytotoxicity effect. Interestingly, a pre-infection of SJPL and PAM cells with App blocked completely PRRSV infection. Incubation of SJPL and PAM cells with an App cell-free culture supernatant is also sufficient to significantly block PRRSV infection. This antiviral activity is not due to LPS but rather by small molecular weight, heat-resistant App metabolites (<1 kDa). The antiviral activity was also observed in SJPL cells infected with swine influenza virus but to a much lower extent compared to PRRSV. More importantly, the PRRSV antiviral activity of App was also seen with PAM, the cells targeted by the virus in vivo during infection in pigs. The antiviral activity might be due, at least in part, to the production of interferon γ. The use of in vitro experimental models to study viral and bacterial co-infections will lead to a better understanding of the interactions between pathogens and their host cells, and could allow the development of novel prophylactic and therapeutic tools.","Lévesque, Cynthia; Provost, Chantale; Labrie, Josée; Hernandez Reyes, Yenney; Burciaga Nava, Jorge A.; Gagnon, Carl A.; Jacques, Mario",PLoS One,299,28
2762,2762,2762,Novel approaches for Spatial and Molecular Surveillance of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSv) in the United States,8.456967,6.6521277,2017-06-28,"The US swine industry has been impaired over the last 25 years by the far-reaching financial losses caused by the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Here, we explored the relations between the spatial risk of PRRS outbreaks and its phylodynamic history in the U.S during 1998–2016 using ORF5 sequences collected from swine farms in the Midwest region. We used maximum entropy and Bayesian phylodynamic models to generate risk maps for PRRS outbreaks and reconstructed the evolutionary history of three selected phylogenetic clades (A, B and C). High-risk areas for PRRS were best-predicted by pig density and climate seasonality and included Minnesota, Iowa and South Dakota. Phylodynamic models demonstrated that the geographical spread of the three clades followed a heterogeneous spatial diffusion process. Furthermore, PRRS viruses were characterized by typical seasonality in their population size. However, endemic strains were characterized by a substantially slower population growth and evolutionary rates, as well as smaller spatial dispersal rates when compared to emerging strains. We demonstrated the prospects of combining inferences derived from two unique analytical methods to inform decisions related to risk-based interventions of an important pathogen affecting one of the largest food animal industries in the world.","Alkhamis, Moh A.; Arruda, Andreia G.; Morrison, Robert B.; Perez, Andres M.",Sci Rep,299,28
3353,3353,3353,Shell-Less Egg Syndrome (SES) Widespread in Western Canadian Layer Operations Is Linked to a Massachusetts (Mass) Type Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) Isolate,8.4333935,6.4898014,2018-08-18,"A disease with a sudden drop in egg production and shell-less eggs called, shell-less egg syndrome (SES) has been observed in Western Canada egg layer flocks since 2010. The etiology of this disease is not known. We hypothesize that SES is caused by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain since it is known that IBV replicates in the shell gland causing various eggshell abnormalities. In this study, we screened egg layer flocks, in the provinces of Alberta (AB) and Saskatchewan (SK), with and without a history of SES for the presence of IBV infection. During 2015–2016, a total of 27 egg layer flocks were screened in AB (n = 7) and SK (n = 20). Eighty-one percent of the screened flocks (n = 22) were positive for IBV infection. Thirty of these isolates were successfully characterized using molecular tools targeting the most variable spike (S) 1 gene. IBV isolates from this study clustered into three genotypes based on partial S1 gene variability. The majority of the IBV isolates (70%) were Massachusetts (Mass) type, and the rest were either Connecticut (Conn) type or an uncharacterized genotype with genetic characteristics of Mass and Conn types. Since the majority of the IBV isolates included within the Mass type, we used a Mass type IBV isolate to reproduce SES in specific pathogen free (SPF) white leghorn chickens in lay. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether other IBV isolates can cause SES, to clarify the pathogenesis of SES and to develop a vaccine in order to prevent SES as observed in Western Canadian layer flocks.","Amarasinghe, Aruna; Popowich, Shelly; De Silva Senapathi, Upasama; Abdul-Cader, Mohamed Sarjoon; Marshall, Frank; van der Meer, Frank; Cork, Susan C.; Gomis, Susantha; Abdul-Careem, Mohamed Faizal",Viruses,299,28
4011,4011,4011,Immuno-modulating properties of Tulathromycin in porcine monocyte-derived macrophages infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,8.5277405,6.592181,2019-08-23,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a positive-stranded RNA virus that grows in macrophages and causes acute pneumonia in pigs. PRRSV causes devastating losses to the porcine industry. However, due to its high antigenic variability and poorly understood immunopathogenesis, there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment to control PRRSV infection. The common occurrence of PRRSV infection with bacterial infections as well as its inflammatory-driven pathobiology raises the question of the value of antibiotics with immunomodulating properties for the treatment of the disease it causes. The macrolide antibiotic Tulathromycin (TUL) has been found to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties in cattle and pigs. The aim of this study was to characterize the anti-viral and immunomodulating properties of TUL in PRRSV-infected porcine macrophages. Our findings indicate that blood monocyte-derived macrophages are readily infected by PRRSV and can be used as an effective cellular model to study PRRSV pathogenesis. TUL did not change intracellular or extracellular viral titers, not did it alter viral receptors (CD163 and CD169) expression on porcine macrophages. In contrast, TUL exhibited potent immunomodulating properties, which therefore occurred in the absence of any direct antiviral effects against PRRSV. TUL had an additive effect with PRRSV on the induction of macrophage apoptosis, and inhibited virus-induced necrosis. TUL significantly attenuated PRRSV-induced macrophage pro-inflammatory signaling (CXCL-8 and mitochondrial ROS production) and prevented PRRSV inhibition of non-opsonized and opsonized phagocytic function. Together, these data demonstrate that TUL inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus. Research in live pigs is warranted to assess the potential clinical benefits of this antibiotic in the context of virally induced inflammation and tissue injury.","Desmonts de Lamache, D.; Moges, R.; Siddiq, A.; Allain, T.; Feener, T.

To analyze the antigenicity and pathogenicity characteristics of the dominant genotype strains (QX-type), S1 gene sequence analysis, virus cross-neutralization tests, and pathogenicity test of eight QX-type IBV isolates were conducted. Sequence analysis showed that the nucleotide homology between the eight strains was high, but distantly related to H120 and 4/91 vaccine strains. Cross-neutralization tests showed that all eight strains isolated from 2015 and 2017 belonged to the same serotype, but exhibited antigenic variations over time. The pathogenicity test of the five QX-type IBV isolates showed that only three strains, CK/CH/SC/DYW/16, CK/CH/SC/MS/17, and CK/CH/SC/GH/15, had a high mortality rate with strong respiratory and renal pathogenicity, whereas CK/CH/SC/PZ/17 and CK/CH/SC/DYYJ/17 caused only mild clinical symptoms and tissue lesions. Our results indicate that the prevalent QX-type IBVs displayed antigenic variations and pathogenicity difference.

A viral infection alone was indicated in 37 (19%), a bacterial infection alone in 30 (15%) and a mixed viral-bacterial infection in 32 (16%) patients. Thus, 46% of the 69 patients with viral infection and 52% of the 62 patients with bacterial infection had a mixed viral and bacterial aetiology. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was identified in 52 patients andStreptococcus pneumoniae in 41 patients. The next common agents in order were non-classifiedHaemophilus influenzae (17 cases), adenoviruses (10 cases) andChlamydia species (8 cases). The diagnosis of an RSV infection was based on detecting viral antigen in nasopharyngeal secretions in 79% of the cases. Pneumococcal infections were in most cases identified by antibody assays; in 39% they were indicated by demonstrating pneumococcal antigen in acute phase serum. An alveolar infiltrate was present in 53 (27%) and an interstitial infiltrate in 108 (55%) of the 195 patients. The remaining 34 patients had probable pneumonia. C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate and total white blood cell count were elevated in 25%, 40% and 36% of the patients, respectively, CRP was more often elevated in patients with bacterial infection alone than in those with viral or mixed viral-bacterial infections. No other correlation was seen between the radiological or laboratory findings and serologically identified viral, bacterial or mixed viralbacterial infections. By using a comprehensive serological panel, the causative agent could be found in over 50% of patients with pneumonia. We conclude that RSV and pneumococcus are the two most common organisms causing pneumonia in children. Our results suggest that mixed viral-bacterial aetiology is common in lower respiratory tract infections affecting children.","Korppi, M.; Heiskanen-Kosma, T.; Jalonen, E.; Saikku, P.; Leinonen, M.; Halonen, P.; Mäkela, P.

Due to its close phylogenetic relationship with Toxoplasma gondii, respective unequivocal differential diagnosis deserves special consideration. In order to evaluate the diagnostic performance of molecular and immunodiagnostic techniques and to provide insights into the epidemiological significance of bovine neosporosis in Switzerland, we conducted a study on 83 cases of bovine abortion: of these, 24 (29%) foetal brains were positive by Neospora-PCR, six of these foetuses were simultaneously seropositive in Neospora-IFAT and/or somatic antigen-ELISA. Conversely, four (5%) foetal brains were considered positive by Toxoplasma-PCR, two of which were also seropositive in the Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA and/or direct agglutination test. The seroprevalence in 1689 cattle sera obtained from 113 dairy farms was 11.5% (95% confidence interval: 9.2–13.8) by Neospora-somatic antigen-ELISA and 10.7% (95% confidence interval: 8.3–12.6) by Toxoplasma-P30-ELISA. From the same samples, 1.1%, less than statistically expected, were positive in both ELISA.

The available algorithms enabling such decompositions present severe efficiency limitations and are an obstacle for the solution of large scale and high dimensional problems. Our main contribution is the improvement of the parallel efficiency of the parareal in time method. The parareal method is based on combining predictions made by a numerically inexpensive solver (with coarse physics and/or coarse resolution) with corrections coming from an expensive solver (with high-fidelity physics and high resolution). At convergence, the algorithm provides a solution that has the fine solver’s high-fidelity physics and high resolution. In the classical version, the fine solver has a fixed high accuracy which is the major obstacle to achieve a competitive parallel efficiency. In this paper, we develop an adaptive variant that overcomes this obstacle by dynamically increasing the accuracy of the fine solver across the parareal iterations. We theoretically show that the parallel efficiency becomes very competitive in the ideal case where the cost of the coarse solver is small, thus proving that the only remaining factors impeding full scalability become the cost of the coarse solver and communication time. The developed theory has also the merit of setting a general framework to understand the success of several extensions of parareal based on iteratively improving the quality of the fine solver and re-using information from previous parareal steps. We illustrate the actual performance of the method in stiff ODEs, which are a challenging family of problems since the only mechanism for adaptivity is time and efficiency is affected by the cost of the coarse solver.","Maday, Y.; Mula, O.",J Comput Appl Math,299,28

Of all potential target organs and systems, the lung appears to be the most vulnerable to damage after brain injury (BI). The pathophysiology of these brain–lung interactions are complex and involve neurogenic pulmonary oedema, inflammation, neurodegeneration, neurotransmitters, immune suppression and dysfunction of the autonomic system. The systemic effects of inflammatory mediators in patients with BI create a systemic inflammatory environment that makes extracranial organs vulnerable to secondary procedures that enhance inflammation, such as mechanical ventilation (MV), surgery and infections. Indeed, previous studies have shown that in the presence of a systemic inflammatory environment, specific neurointensive care interventions—such as MV—may significantly contribute to the development of lung injury, regardless of the underlying mechanisms. Although current knowledge supports protective ventilation in patients with BI, it must be born in mind that ABI-related lung injury has distinct mechanisms that involve complex interactions between the brain and lungs. In this context, the role of extracerebral pathophysiology, especially in the lungs, has often been overlooked, as most physicians focus on intracranial injury and cerebral dysfunction. The present review aims to fill this gap by describing the pathophysiology of complications due to lung injuries in patients with a single ABI, and discusses the possible impact of MV in neurocritical care patients with normal lungs.","Ziaka, Mairi; Exadaktylos, Aristomenis",Crit Care,299,30

Wolbachia infection of mosquitoes is a new and promising complementary tool for the control of arbovirus transmission. The use of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, mass reared using human blood, is currently being tested in several countries. However, the use of human blood for mass rearing mosquitoes, and thus expansion of this strategy, is problematic. With the aim of overcoming this problem, we tested the effect of different types of blood source on the fitness parameters of female Ae. aegypti and the Wolbachia titer over generations to be able to guarantee the suitability of an alternative source to human blood for mass rearing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. METHODS: We investigated and compared essential parameters of the vector capacity of laboratory strains of Ae. aegypti with and without Wolbachia that fed on blood of different types of host (human, guinea pig, and mouse). The parameters analyzed were fecundity, fertility, pupation dynamics, and adult survival. Also, we tested whether it is possible to maintain mosquitoes with Wolbachia on mouse blood over generations without losing the bacterium titer. RESULTS: The average number of eggs per female, egg viability and pupation dynamics in the Wolbachia-infected mosquito (wMelBr) strain were similar, regardless of the blood source. The F1 progenies of females that fed on mouse blood or human blood were analyzed. The longevity of males was lower than that of females. F1 female survival differed depending on the presence of Wolbachia in the mother. In subsequent generations analyzed up until F35, the relative Wolbachia density was even higher when mosquitoes fed on mouse blood in comparison to human blood. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results provide no evidence that the different types of blood influenced the fitness of the Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The presence of the bacterium in the colonies of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti after 35 generations under the conditions evaluated indicates that they can be maintained on mouse blood. Based on these results, we show that it is possible to use mouse blood to feed female mosquitoes when using human blood for this purpose is problematic.

Whilst the underlying genetic mechanisms are increasingly understood, the ecological consequences of introgression are relatively less studied, despite their utility for increasing knowledge on how invasion impacts can manifest. Here, the ecological consequences of genetic introgression from an invasive congener were tested using the endemic barbel populations of central Italy, where the invader was the European barbel Barbus barbus. Four populations of native Barbus species (B. plebejus and B. tyberinus) were studied: two purebred and two completely introgressed with alien B. barbus. Across the four populations, differences in their biological traits (growth, body condition and population demographic structure) and trophic ecology (gut content analysis and stable isotope analysis) were tested. While all populations had similar body condition and were dominated by fish up to 2 years of age, the introgressed fish had substantially greater lengths at the same age, with maximum lengths 410–460 mm in hybrids versus 340–360 mm in native purebred barbel. The population characterized by the highest number of introgressed B. barbus alleles (81 %) had the largest trophic niche and a substantially lower trophic position than the other populations through its exploitation of a wider range of resources (e.g. small fishes and plants). These results attest that the genetic introgression of an invasive congener with native species can result in substantial ecological consequences, including the potential for cascading effects.

In this case, the rankings of alternatives are changed strategically, which is the strategic weight assignment problem in MADM. However, the attribute weights cannot be changed easily and usually need a compensation. Some research denoted the compensation as costs and assumed that they are deterministic. In this paper, we study the strategic weight assignment based on robust optimization theory, which assumes that the uncertain costs reside in the uncertainty sets. With perturbation vector varying in box set, ellipsoid set and polyhedron set, it allows the costs to be considered with several different uncertain levels. A series of mixed 0–1 robust optimization models are constructed to set a strategic weight vector for a desired ranking of a particular alternative. Finally, an example based on the actual anti-epidemic performance data from 14 provinces and cities illustrates the validity of the proposed models. Comparison between the certainty model and the three robust models illustrates that uncertain unit adjustment costs always lead to the higher weight assignment costs.

Data obtained from a stated preference survey were utilized, where the respondents were asked to choose between a conventional mode (private vehicle driver, transit, or private vehicle passenger) and ridesourcing modes (exclusive ride and shared ride). Error component nested logit models were developed for Generation Xers and Millennials, respectively. Latent attitudes derived through factor analysis were incorporated into models. A wide range of attitudinal indicators, including general mobility attitudes, perceived benefits and concerns of shared mobility services, reasons for or against owning a car, reasons for ridings Autonomous Vehicles (AV), and the most desired AV features were considered to extract latent attitudes. Model results indicated distinct mode choice behavior between Millennials and Generation Xers. For Generation Xers, the choice to switch to ridesourcing was highly dependent on the perceived time and cost benefits of shared mobility. On the other hand, Millennials’ choices were more likely to be influenced by their attitudes or desire toward technology, on-demand services, and driving stress relief. Interestingly, the joy of driving showed a negative impact on Millennials' use of shared-ride services only. The findings from this study provide a more in-depth understanding of the distinct behavior of Generation Xers and Millennials toward shared mobility services, which could help develop strategies and policies to focus more effectively on the needs and concerns of individuals based on their characteristics and attitudes and help promote sustainable transportation system.","Azimi, Ghazaleh; Rahimi, Alireza; Jin, Xia",Transportation (Amst),299,0

Thus, we examined these outcomes after a 10-year follow-up period, and compared with conventional conservative method (CCM). PATIENTS AND METHODS Data on 257 patients with stage ≤ IIA breast cancer who underwent CCM (n = 125) or EAPM (n = 132) were analyzed. Cosmetic outcome at 2, 5, and 10 years was evaluated by 5 criteria (breast retraction assessment, nipple deviation, atrophy, skin change, scar). For overall mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and recurrence, the risk by operation method was tested by Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS EAPM performed significantly better than CCM in terms of cosmetic outcomes for location B at 2, 5, and 10 year-follow ups. As for cosmetic outcomes by individual criteria, EAPM had significantly higher proportions of satisfactory results for scar across all follow-up periods, and atrophy at 2-year and 10-year follow-up. There were no significant differences in terms of overall mortality, breast cancer-specific mortality, and recurrence between EAPM and CCM. The rates of patients who experienced local recurrence were similar between CCM and EAPM. CONCLUSION EAPM is better than CCM in terms of long-term cosmetic outcome, especially for location B. As a surgical treatment for breast cancer, EAPM is comparable to CCM in terms of mortality and recurrence.","Takemoto, Nobuyuki; Koyanagi, Ai; Yamamoto, Hiroshi",BMC women's health,299,1

In this post hoc analysis of the ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Proximal Occlusion Ischemic Stroke), we identified acute ischemic stroke patients with rapid infarct growth and investigated their baseline clinical and imaging characteristics. METHODS Control arm patients were included if they had follow-up imaging at 2-8 hours without substantial recanalization, and if their baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score was ≥9. Fast infarct progression was defined as Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score decay ≥3 points from baseline to 2- to 8-hour follow-up imaging. Clinical and imaging baseline characteristics were compared between fast progressors and other patients, and occlusion site and collateral flow patterns were assessed in detail. RESULTS Fast infarct progression occurred in 15 of 43 included patients (34.9%). Fast progressors had worse collaterals (poor in 3/15 [20%] versus 0/28 patients, P=0.021) and more carotid-T or -L occlusions (8/15 [53.4%] versus 3/28[10.7%], P=0.021). In 8 out of 15 (53.3%), occlusion site and circle of Willis configuration prevented collateral flow via the anterior or posterior cerebral artery. CONCLUSIONS Most patients with fast infarct progression had terminal carotid occlusions and impaired collateral flow via the anterior or posterior cerebral artery, indicating that occlusion location and intracranial vascular anatomy are relevant for infarct progression.","Ospel, Johanna M; Hill, Michael D; Kappelhof, Manon; Demchuk, Andrew M; Menon, Bijoy K; Mayank, Arnuv; Dowlatshahi, Dar; Frei, Don; Rempel, Jeremy L; Baxter, Blaise; Goyal, Mayank",Stroke,299,1

BACKGROUND TAD is an increasingly recognized entity associated with poor outcomes in patients with valvular heart disease. METHODS The maximal septolateral diameter of the tricuspid annulus was measured in consecutive patients with 3-dimensional multidetector row computed tomographic datasets undergoing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Receiver-operating curve characteristic analysis was performed to obtain an ideal, body surface area-normalized cutoff for TAD. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional ethics board. RESULTS The study included 1,137 patients, of whom 299 died within a mean follow-up period of 1.8 ± 1.0 years. TAD was identified in 446 patients (39.2%) on the basis of a receiver-operating characteristic cutoff of 23 mm/m2. TAD had no impact on procedural outcomes, including device failure defined according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 criteria. Patients with TAD experienced significantly greater mortality (hazard ratio: 1.99; 95% confidence interval: 1.59 to 2.51; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis including clinical and echocardiographic parameters confirmed the predictive value of TAD (hazard ratio: 1.78; 95% confidence interval: 1.33 to 2.38; p < 0.001), while echocardiographic variables, including estimated pulmonary artery pressure and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, did not reach statistical significance. The predictive value of TAD was incremental to a baseline model of clinical and echocardiographic parameters (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.204; p < 0.01) and incremental to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (continuous net reclassification improvement 0.209; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS TAD is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.","Deseive, Simon; Steffen, Julius; Beckmann, Markus; Jochheim, David; Orban, Mathias; Zadrozny, Magda; Gschwendtner, Sarah; Braun, Daniel; Rizas, Konstantinos; Curta, Adrian; Hagl, Christian; Theiss, Hans D; Mehilli, Julinda; Massberg, Steffen; Hausleiter, Jörg",JACC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design: Our study involves 30 patients, who had undergone different orthodontic therapies in a traditional way, and that the clinician continued to follow by means of tele-orthodontics. Given the obvious limitations of tele-practice, a comparison with patients who did not undergo any follow-up or underwent only in-office follow-ups could not be possible. The communication tools used in our study and proposed in our model of tele-orthodontics are videocalls, dedicated applications, intraoral and extraoral photos taken by the patients and instant messaging. RESULTS Tele-orthodontics allowed to perform some orthodontic follow-ups with less chairside time, reduced time spent by the patients in the dental office from up to 45 min, less risk of infection, fewer to no missed appointments, specific troubleshooting solutions, and more follow-ups with odontophobic patients. Overall, tele-orthodontics balanced the disadvantages of less personal contacts and in-office visits. CONCLUSIONS The need to respect safety distance and the fears patients have about the risk of infection make tele-orthodontics a fundamental tool during a pandemic lockdown and in its immediate post-emergency phase. Tele-orthodontics demonstrated to be a viable tool to continue at least some orthodontic care in times of emergency, but it may be considered an appropriate solution and addition even in normal times to ease therapy demands for both the orthodontist and the patient, while reducing time and money spent, without an excessive decrease in orthodontic quality.","Saccomanno, S; Quinzi, V; Sarhan, S; Laganà, L; Marzo, G",European journal of paediatric dentistry,299,17

Prophylactic chest tube placement or sub-fascial ""blowholes"" are usually recommended to prevent tension pneumothorax and clinical decline. Risk of iatrogenic lung injury and release of virus into the environment is high. Incidence and conservative management data of such barotraumatic complications during the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking. Methods All patients with mediastinal air and SWAP evaluated by the department of Thoracic Surgery at the Mount Sinai Hospital between March 30 and April 10, 2020 were identified. All patients without pneumothorax were treated conservatively with daily chest x-ray and observation. Three patients had prophylactic chest tube placement prior to the study period without thoracic surgery consultation. Results There were 29 cases of mediastinal air with SWAP out of 171 COVID positive intubated patients (17.0%) who were treated conservatively. Patients were intubated for an average of 2.4 days before SWAP was identified. 12 patients (41%) had improvement or resolution without intervention. Two patients progressed to pneumothorax 3 and 8 days following initial presentation. Both had chest tubes placed without incident before there were any changes in oxygenation, hemodynamics, supportive medications, or ventilator settings. There were 3 patients who had percutaneous tubes placed before the study period all of whom had significant worsening of their sub-cutaneous air and air leak. Conclusions Conservative management of massive sub-cutaneous emphysema without pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients is safe and limits viral exposure to healthcare workers. Placement of chest tubes is discouraged unless a definite sizable pneumothorax develops.","Housman, Brian; Jacobi, Adam; Carollo, Andrea; Nobel, Tamar; Eber, Corey; Acquah, Samuel; Powell, Charles; Kaufman, Andrew; Lee, Dong-Seok; Nicastri, Daniel; Hakami, Ardeshir; Song, Kimberly; Kohli-Seth, Roopa; Flores, Raja",Annals of translational medicine,299,31

Based on morphological characteristics, 45 and 32 strains from G. inflate and G. glabra, respectively, were selected for further analyses. According to 16S rRNA sequence analysis, most of the strains belonged to genus Streptomyces and a few strains represented the rare actinobacteria Micromonospora, Rhodococcus and Tsukamurella. A total of 39 strains from G. inflate and 27 strains from G. glabra showed antimicrobial activity against at least one indicator organism. The range of the antimicrobial activity of the strains isolated from G. glabra and G. inflate was similar. A total of 34 strains from G. inflate and 29 strains from G. glabra carried at least one of the genes encoding polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and FADH2-dependent halogenase. In the type II polyketide synthase KSα gene phylogenetic analysis, the strains were divided into two major clades: one included known spore pigment production-linked KSα sequences and other sequences were linked to the production of different types of aromatic polyketide antibiotics. Based on the antimicrobial range, the isolates that carried different KSα types were not separated from each other or from the isolates that did not carry KSα. The incongruent phylogenies of 16S rRNA and KSα genes indicated that the KSα genes were possibly horizontally transferred. In all, the liquorice plants were a rich source of biocontrol agents that may produce novel bioactive compounds.","Zhao, Ke; Zhao, Chong; Liao, Ping; Zhang, Qin; Li, Yanbing; Liu, Maoke; Ao, Xiaoling; Gu, Yunfu; Liao, Decong; Xu, Kaiwei; Yu, Xiumei; Xiang, Quanju; Huang, Chengyi; Chen, Qiang; Zhang, Lili; Zhang, Xiaoping; Penttinen, Petri",Microbiology,299,17

The strength of i) dorsiflexors, ii) plantar flexors and iii) quadriceps was assessed at rest and after exercise using maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and potentiated twitch force (Twpot). Resting MVC and Twpot were significantly lower in patients with COPD when compared with controls respectively for i) dorsiflexors (24.9 ± 8.4 vs. 31.2 ± 8.5 Nm, p < 0.05 and 4.3 ± 1.3 vs. 5.7 ± 1.8 Nm, p < 0.05), ii) plantar flexors (49.5 ± 11.8 vs. 62.1 ± 19.6 Nm, p < 0.05 and 10.8 ± 3.5 vs. 13.4 ± 2.7 Nm, p < 0.05), and iii) quadriceps muscles. There was a greater force loss in the distal leg muscles 15 minutes post-exercise in patients with COPD, while the strength of the quadriceps muscle remained stable in both groups. Patients with COPD had weaker dorsiflexor and plantar flexor muscles when compared to age-matched healthy controls. In addition, when exposed to the same absolute walking task, the fatigability of the distal leg muscles was higher in patients with COPD.","Gagnon, Philippe; Maltais, François; Bouyer, Laurent; Ribeiro, Fernanda; Coats, Valérie; Brouillard, Cynthia; Noël, Martin; Rousseau-Gagnon, Mathieu; Saey, Didier",COPD,299,23

Aim of this study was to evaluate, the time periods from birth and from arrival at the resuscitation table to obtain the first cerebral tissue oxygenation values with two different near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) devices. The present study is an analysis of exploratory parameters of two prospective observational studies. Cerebral tissue oxygen saturation was measured by the NIRO 200NX measuring ""cerebral-tissue-oxygenation-index"" (cTOI) or the INVOS5100C measuring ""cerebral-regional-oxygen-saturation"" (crSO2). Four time periods (T) were defined: T1 birth to arrival at resuscitation table, T2 arrival to application of NIRS sensor, T3 application to first displayed cTOI or crSO2 value, and T4 from arrival at resuscitation table to first displayed values. Additionally, we compared first displayed values of cTOI and crSO2. Thirty neonates were included. Twenty-four were term and six late-preterm neonates. Fifteen neonates measured with NIRO were compared to 15 measured with INVOS. T1 was 49 (6-163) s with NIRO versus 59 (15-87) s with INVOS, T2 14 (4-20) s versus 12 (15-18) s, T3 33 (13-138) s versus 17 (6-290) s and T4 46 (20-153) s and 34 (14-300) s. The first displayed value tended to be higher for cTOI [54% (18-80)] compared to crSO2 [35% (15-87)]. There were no significant differences between devices in time periods and first values displayed.

The results showed that the organic extract is richer in polyphenol and resveratrol than the conventional one. Both extracts prevent lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation generated by CCl4. Moreover, the extracts demonstrated ability to modulate the activity of SOD and CAT, as well as to establish a balance in the ratio of SOD/CAT. We also found that the CCl4 increased the levels of AST and GGT, and that both extracts prevent this.

As a learning theory it has resonated with educators globally, including those in the health professions. Described as a complex metatheory, TL has evolved over time, eliciting divergent interpretations of the construct. This scoping review provides a comprehensive synthesis of how TL is currently represented in the health professions education literature, including how it influences curricular activities, to inform its future application in the field. METHODS Arksey and O'Malley's six-step framework was adopted to review the period from 2006 to May 2018. A total of 10 bibliographic databases were searched, generating 1532 potential studies. After several rounds of review, first of abstracts and then of full texts, 99 studies were mapped by two independent reviewers onto the internally developed data extraction sheet. Descriptive information about included studies was aggregated. Discursive data were subjected to content analysis. RESULTS A mix of conceptual and empirical research papers, which used a range of qualitative methodologies, were included. Studies from the USA, the UK and Australia were most prevalent. Insights relating to how opportunities for TL were created, how it manifests and influences behaviour, as well as how it is experienced, demonstrated much congruency. Conceptions of TL were seen to be clustered around the work of key theorists. CONCLUSIONS The training of health professionals often takes place in unfamiliar settings where students are encouraged to be active participants in providing care.

Although the benefits on short-term outcomes have been proven, data on oncological safety are still lacking. The aim of this study is to assess oncologic results after ultrasound-guided laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) or open liver resection (OLR) for colorectal metastases. 37 consecutive patients undergoing LLR between 01/2004 and 03/2014 were matched at a ratio of 1:1 with 37 OLR. Matching criteria were male sex, number and diameter of liver metastases, segment location, synchronous presentation, site and stage of primary tumor, positive lymph nodes of the primary, and concomitant extrahepatic disease. Demographic characteristics were similar among groups. Parenchymal transection time was longer in the LLR group (68 ± 38.2 SD vs 40 ± 33.7 SD, p = 0.01). Mortality was nil in LLR and OLR. Overall morbidity was significantly lower in LLR (13.5 vs 37.8%, p = 0.02), although severe complications were similar among the two groups. Patients undergoing LLR were discharged earlier (5 ± 2.3 SD vs 8 ± 6.6 SD days, p < 0.001). The median margin width was 5 (0-40) mm in LLR vs 8 (0-25) mm in OLR, p = 0.897. R1 resection was recorded in four LLR and three OLR (p = 1). Overall recurrences were similar among groups. Eight patients with hepatic or extrahepatic recurrence among LLR underwent surgery vs four of OLR (p = 0.03). After a median follow-up of 35.7 months in LLR and 47.9 months in OLR, 3-year overall survival was 91.8% LLR and 74.8% OLR (p = 0.14). 3-year disease-free survival was 69.1% LLR and 65.9% OLR (p = 0.53). Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative complications [HR 3.42 (95% CI 1.32-8.89)] and multiple metastases [HR 3.84 (95% CI 1.34-10.83)] were independent predictors of worse survival (p = 0.01). Ultrasound-LLR for colorectal hepatic metastases is safe, ensuring oncologic outcomes comparable to OLR.","Langella, Serena; Russolillo, Nadia; D'Eletto, Marco; Forchino, Fabio; Lo Tesoriere, Roberto; Ferrero, Alessandro",Updates in surgery,299,33

However, the application of this technology has yet to be established in hepatic surgery. METHODS A retrospective analysis of our prospectively collected liver surgery database was performed. Over a 6-month period, all consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted hepatic resection for a liver neoplasm were included. Demographics, operative time, and morbidity encountered were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 7 robotic-assisted liver resections were performed, including 2 robotic-assisted single-port access liver resections with the da Vinci-Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Sunnyvalle, Calif.) USA. The mean age was 44.6 years (range, 21-68 years); there were 5 male and 2 female patients. The mean operative time (± SD) was 61.4 ± 26.7 minutes; the mean operative console time (± SD) was 38.2 ± 23 minutes. No conversions were required. The mean blood loss was 100.7 mL (range, 10-200 mL). The mean hospital stay (± SD) was 2 ± 0.4 days. No postoperative morbidity related to the procedure or death was encountered. CONCLUSION Our initial experience with robotic liver resection confirms that this technique is both feasible and safe. Robotic-assisted technology appears to improve the precision and ergonomics of single-access surgery while preserving the known benefits of laparoscopic surgery, including cosmesis, minimal morbidity, and faster recovery.","Kandil, Emad; Noureldine, Salem I; Saggi, Bob; Buell, Joseph F",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,299,5

PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort of consecutive patients with renal oncocytoma on active surveillance reviewed at the Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (2012 to 2019). Comparison between groups was tested using the Mann-Whitney U and the Chi-square tests. A mixed-effects model with a random intercept for patient was used to study the longitudinal association between tumour size and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS Longitudinal data from 98 patients with 101 lesions was analysed. Most patients were male (68.3%), median age was 69 years (IQR 13). The median follow-up was 29 months (IQR 26). Most lesions were small renal masses, 24% measured over 4 cm. Over half (64.4%) grew at a median rate of 2 mm per year (IQR 4). No association was observed between tumour size and eGFR over time (p=0.871). Nine lesions (8.9%) were subsequently treated. Two deaths were reported, neither were related to the diagnosis of renal oncocytoma. CONCLUSION Natural history data from the largest active surveillance cohort of renal oncocytomas to date show that renal function does not seem to be negatively impacted by growing oncocytomas, and confirms clinical outcomes are excellent after a median follow up of over 2 years.

Crucially, recent findings suggest that this effect can be detected in bilingual infants before their first birthday indicating that it emerges as a result of early bilingual exposure and the experience of negotiating two linguistic systems in infants' environment. However, these conclusions are based on only two research studies from the last decade (Comishen, Bialystok, & Adler, 2019; Kovács & Mehler, 2009), so to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding their replicability and generalisability. In addition, previous research does not shed light on the precise aspects of bilingual experience and the extent of bilingual exposure underlying the emergence of this early bilingual advantage. The present study addressed these two questions by assessing attentional control abilities in seven-month-old bilingual infants in comparison to same-age monolinguals and in relation to their individual bilingual exposure patterns. Findings did not reveal significant differences between monolingual and bilingual infants in the measure of attentional control and no relation between individual performance and degree of bilingual exposure. Bilinguals showed different patterns of allocating attention to the visual rewards in this task compared to monolinguals. Thus, this study indicates that bilingualism modulates attentional processes early on, possibly as a result of bilinguals' experience of encoding dual-language information from a complex linguistic input, but it does not lead to significant advantages in attentional control in the first year of life.","Kalashnikova, Marina; Pejovic, Jovana; Carreiras, Manuel",Developmental science,299,16

Here we report the regeneration of severely damaged lungs repaired to meet transplantation criteria by utilizing an interventional cross-circulation platform in a clinically relevant swine model of gastric aspiration injury.

An inductive thematic analysis was used to interpret the data. RESULTS Three key themes emerged. First, participants described a shift from addiction frameworks to public health policy responses to EGMs, which was driven by increasing EGM losses and the harms caused by EGMs to communities. Second, there was the role of stakeholder groups in the policy-making process, including the challenges associated with engaging the community. Finally, there were barriers and facilitators to policy development and implementation. Barriers included a lack of financial resources and legislative boundaries imposed by the State Government.

We aimed to identify the ideal timing of bowel preparation to achieve optimal colon cleansing with no increased risk of aspiration. METHODS A total of 892 consecutive patients undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy were prospectively recruited. Residual gastric volume (RGV) and pH of gastric contents were measured at EGD, and patients' characteristics, runway time (duration between completion of the final liter of bowel preparation and colonoscopy commencement), and cleansing quality were recorded. RESULTS A shorter runway time resulted in better colon cleansing (r = -0.124, P < 0.001). No correlation between runway time and RGV or pH was found (r = -0.017, P = 0.62 and r = -0.030, P = 0.47, respectively). RGV and pH did not differ significantly with runway time of 4 or 5 h. RGV with runway time ≤3 h was 35.9 ± 11.8 mL and 17.4 ± 0.6 mL after runway time >3 h (P < 0.001). No aspiration pneumonia occurred. The only factors independently related to higher RGV were younger age and male sex. CONCLUSIONS The consumption of bowel preparation agent within 3-4 h before propofol sedation resulted in a similar RGV and pH as those achieved by more prolonged fasting, with no increased risk of aspiration even in patients perceived to be at high risk.","Alghamry, Alaa; Ponnuswamy, Sureshkumar K; Agarwal, Aditya; Moattar, Hadi; Yerkovich, Stephanie T; Vandeleur, Ann E; Thomas, James; Croese, John; Rahman, Tony; Hodgson, Ruth",Journal of digestive diseases,299,27

Here, we describe the European Union's HFE regulation and highlight the challenges faced by (i) manufacturers implementing this regulation and (ii) regulatory bodies charged with assessing the compliance of usability files. In Europe, 95% of MD manufacturers are small and medium-sized enterprises; compliance with the CE Mark regulations is a real challenge to their competitiveness.

We also present the specific use-related risk management approach required by the HFE regulation. Lastly, we focus on the limitations of the HFE regulation for MDs and on future HFE challenges in further reducing and/or eliminating MD use errors. The main challenge is the need to go beyond technology design and the pre-market assessment and to look at the post-production stage; the coupling between an MD and a sociotechnical system can led to consequences that were not predicted during the design process.

Early detection and identification of high-risk COVID-19 patients will contribute to early intervention and optimize medical resource allocation. Using the clinical data from the Affiliated Yueqing Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Yueqing, China), an evolutionary support vector machine model is designed to recognize and discriminate the severity of the COVID-19 by patients basic information and hematological indexes. The support vector machine is a frequently used pattern classification tool affected by both the kernel parameter setting and feature selection for its classification accuracy. This study recommends an enhanced Slime Mould Algorithm (ESMA), mixing a new movement strategy of white holes, black holes, and wormholes, to perform parameter optimization and feature selection simultaneously for SVM. Therefore, the proposed SVM framework (ESMA-SVM) can also obtain high-quality classification results, and it is less prone to stagnation in the classification process. To verify the capabilities of the proposed methodology, first, the performance of the ESMA is thoroughly verified by using IEEE CEC2017 benchmark functions and the diversity and compared with other similar methods experimentally using these standard benchmark functions. Moreover, the balance between diversification and intensification capability of the enhanced ESMA and the original SMA is also investigated statistically. Finally, the designed model ESMA-SVM and other competitive SVM models based on other optimization algorithms are applied to early recognition and discrimination of COVID-19 severity. Through the analysis of experimental results, the core compensations of ESMA are confirmed, and the ESMA-SVM can obtain strong performance in terms of several performance evaluation indexes on discrimination of COVID-19 severity.

One such method is using encryption and steganography. Encryption is the process of converting ordinary plaintext data into an alternative form that is unreadable by perpetrators without authorization. Furthermore, steganography is the practice of hiding a file, message, video, or image within another such file. In this paper, we introduce a web application that will enable the user to encrypt the data in a file of his choice and then hide it within a picture or GIF. This will provide the layman an application that is easy to use to communicate securely, even without extensive technical knowledge. The encryption algorithm used will be the AES-256 algorithm and the steganographic algorithm will be Syndrome-Trellis Codes (STCs) for their high embedding efficiency. The results display that the system designed offers a significant security level. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Dheeraj Chaitanya, G.; Febin Koshy, P.; Dinesh Kumar, D.; Himanshu, G.; Amarendra, K.; Mandhala, V.

An academic medical centre (AMC) piloted a tele-consultation program for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), a disease with an abnormal mutation in the bone marrow leading to overproduction of any combination of white cells, red cells and platelets. The program aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of the use of telehealth in managing patients with MPN. Methods For this program only patients with Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who met the criteria were recruited and enrolled into the program. Workflows, logistics and education materials were developed and briefed to stakeholders prior to the commencement of the program. The program utilised the Advanced Practice Nurses' (APNs) expertise in the haematology unit to support the service. APNs were provided addition training on both clinical practice knowledge and the appropriate use of the telehealth equipment. Data was collected between January and July 2020. Prospective outcome indicators measured were i) correct treatment prescribed according to guidelines;ii) number of emergency visits due to events related to MPN and its complications, iii) deterioration in cardiovascular health (namely hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidermia) iv) number of patient visits right-sited to the community and v) barriers and facilitators for the uptake of the program. Results A total of 21 patients with 44 tele-consults over 7 months was captured. Average age of the patients were 70.1 years. Thirteen patients were diagnosed with ET and 8 patients have PV. Only 1 patient was on a combination of hydroxyurea and anagrelide, the rest of the patients were on hydroxyurea. A total of 14 dosage adjustments were made based on patients' complete blood count, and all of patients' blood countsremained stable during the following review. Two venesections were prescribed for patients with PV. None of the patients required ED visit or admission due to events related to MPN and its complications. One patient was referred back to physician earlier due to non-compliance to telehealth review. All patients had their blood pressure reviewed within 1 year. Sixteen patients had fasting glucose/HbA1c within 2 years, and 14 patients had fasting lipid within 2 years. None of the patients required cardiovascular medication titration, thus there is no deterioration in their cardiovascular health since recruitment. For 9 of the telehealth review, patients did their blood tests concurrently with other medical appointments they had at an earlier date, hence saving a separate trip to hospital for blood test. We were also able to consolidate blood tests and reduce repetition for these 9 patients. Only 8 telehealth blood tests were done in the community, largely due to the closure of satellite blood test service during COVID pandemic. There were only 6 home medicine deliveries, largely because many of the patients had collected adequate medications lasting half a year to a year during physical consult with physicians. The MPN telehealth service has right sited a total of 67 hospital visits to the community. We determined the barriers and facilitators to the program are due to patient, physician and workflow factors. Some of our older patients do not own a mobile device, or prefer traditional, physical consultations with physicians. Some physicians are unfamiliar with telehealth referral workflow. Potential facilitators include older, immobile patients with multiple comorbiditieswanting to cut down hospital visits, as well as patients whose work schedule did not permit frequent hospital visits. Conclusions Our results show that utilising APN-led telehealth service is a feasible and safe method to deliver care to patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm in the community. Right-siting of patient care could reduce patient visits to hospitals especially during COVID pandemic. Ongoing chal enges include increasing the number of blood test facilities in the community to facilitate blood taking in the community. Other proposed intangible benefits would include improving patients' psychosocial well-being by transiting them to a new normalcy with minimal hospital visits to a haematology centre. There is potential cost- saving as well that will be explored.

185057,185057,185057,A review of evidence for immunosuppression due to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.,8.346212,6.6382318,2000,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated the management of chronic rheumatic diseases (CRD). Patients with CRDs are immunocompromised and generally prone to infection. The fear of COVID-19 and the degree of the self-imposed shielding strategy implemented by many patients introduced new challenges for the patients. Although recommendations have been developed to manage patients with CRDs by, i.e., EULAR, strong evidence is still lacking to guide treatment decisions. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patients with CRDs and healthy controls during the first wave of the pandemic. We further evaluated the effect of the pandemic on patient behavior regarding medication, exercise, pain, and experienced disease activity. Finally, we investigated the self-perceived consequences of the pandemic and lock-down on anxiety and depression in patients with CRDs compared with healthy controls. Methods: More than 900 participants were included in the study: 405 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus and 513 blood donors. All participants had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies measured (Wantai SARS-CoV-2 total antibody ELISA;sensitivity 96.7%, specificity 99.5%) and answered a questionnaire concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). The participants with CRD were further asked about physical activity, adherence to medication, and disease-related symptoms. Results: CRD patients had a sixfold lower seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared to controls (p=0.03) (Figure 1). Almost 60% of patients were unable to exercise as usual, leading to increased pain in 34%, and experience of increased disease activity in 27%. Approximately 10% of patients reduced or discontinued their immunosuppressive treatments at their own initiative. Symptoms of moderate depression were present in 19% of patients compared to 6,8% of controls (p<0.001). Conclusion: Low seroprevalence in patients with CRDs indicates successful mitigation of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. However, this appears to occur at the expense of physical activity and adherence to immunosuppressive treatment. Our results raise an important concern regarding the consequences of isolation for patients with CRDs. The result of physical isolation is a risk of severe mental health issues, physical inactivity, self-medication, increased pain, and increased disease activity. The long-term consequences of recommendations for patients with CRDs should be taken into account when tackling the continuing pandemic.","Ammitzbøll, C.; Andersen, J. B.; Vils, S. R.; Jørgensen, C.

We recently reported that virus entry requires coiled-coil formation of the leucine zipper-like domain of the HIV-1 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp41 (C. Wild, T. Oas, C. McDanal, D. Bolognesi, and T. Matthews, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10537-10541, 1992; C. Wild, J. W. Dubay, T. Greenwell, T. Baird, Jr., T. G. Oas, C. McDanal, E. Hunter, and T. Matthews, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:12676-12680, 1994). To determine the oligomeric state mediated by this region of the envelope, we have expressed the zipper motif as a fusion partner with the monomeric maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli. The biophysical properties of this protein were characterized by velocity and equilibrium sedimentation, size exclusion chromatography, light scattering, and chemical cross-linking analyses. Results indicate that the leucine zipper sequence from HIV-1 is capable of multimerizing much larger and otherwise monomeric proteins into extremely stable tetramers. Recombinant proteins containing an alanine or a serine substitution at a critical isoleucine residue within the zipper region were also generated and similarly analyzed. The alanine- and serine-substituted proteins behaved as tetrameric and monomeric species, respectively, consistent with the influence of these same substitutions on the helical coiled-coil structure of synthetic peptide models. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the fusogenic gp4l structure involves tetramerization of the leucine zipper domain which is situated approximately 30 residues from the N-terminal fusion peptide sequence.","Shugars, D C; Wild, C T; Greenwell, T K; Matthews, T J",Journal of virology,299,7

Nineteen of 29 reptiles had tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with flagellates, and this lesion was considered contributory to death in 15 cases, although concurrent diseases were frequent. Infection was invasive into the renal interstitium in three reptiles due to tubular rupture and in one chameleon also spread to adjacent tissues, coelomic cavity, and blood vessels due to renal rupture. Cytologic or ultrastructural evaluation of trophozoites in two cases was consistent with diplomonad flagellates. Renal disease was often complicated with soft-tissue mineralization and/or gout. Gastrointestinal and cloacal infection with flagellates and inflammation were frequent in reptiles in which the digestive tract was available for histopathologic examination, and this supports the possibility of infections ascending the urinary tract from the cloaca.

The full genome sequence was determined within weeks of the first outbreak by the Canadian group with international collaboration. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), the continual lack of a rapid laboratory test to aid the early diagnosis of suspected cases of SARS makes this area a priority for future research. To prevent deaths in the future, early diagnosis and therapy of this infectious disease is of paramount importance. METHODS This review describes the specific molecular targets for diagnostics and therapeutics of viral infection. RESULTS The three major diagnostic methods available for SARS includes viral RNA detection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), virus induced antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) of nucleocapsid protein (NP). The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein contains multiple conformational epitopes that induces highly potent neutralizing antibodies. The genetically engineered attenuated form of the virus or viral vector vaccine encoding for the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein has been shown to elicit protective immunity in vaccinated animals. CONCLUSION NP is the preferred target for routine detection of SARS-CoV infection by ELISA which is an economical method compared to other methods. The RBD of the spike glycoprotein is both a functional domain for cell receptor binding and also a major neutralizing determinant of SARS-CoV. The progress in evaluating a therapeutic or vaccine would depend on the avail ability of clinically relevant animal model.","Suresh, Mavanur R; Bhatnagar, Pravin K; Das, Dipankar","Journal of pharmacy & pharmaceutical sciences : a publication of the Canadian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Societe canadienne des sciences pharmaceutiques",299,1

However, coronavirus D-RNA expression vectors display an inherent instability following serial passage with helper virus, resulting in the eventual loss of the heterologous genes. The use of the picornavirus encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence to initiate gene translation was investigated as an alternative method to the coronavirus-mediated TAS-controlled heterologous gene expression system. IBV D-RNAs containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, under EMCV IRES control, were assessed for IRES-mediated CAT protein translation. CAT protein was detected from T7-derived IBV D-RNA transcripts in a cell-free protein synthesis system and in situ in avian chick kidney (CK) cells following T7-derived D-RNA synthesis from a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the bacteriophage T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, CAT protein was not detected in CK cells from IRES-containing IBV D-RNAs, in which the IRES-CAT construct was inserted at two different positions within the D-RNA, in the presence of helper IBV. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the IRES-containing D-RNAs were not rescued on serial passage with helper virus, indicating that the EMCV IRES sequence had a detrimental effect on IBV D-RNA rescue.","Dove, Brian; Cavanagh, David; Britton, Paul",Journal of virology,299,19

PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective, comparative single-center study conducted in Emergency Department patients of a paediatric tertiary care center. Comparison of CRP in adenovirus infection and influenza was performed in patient groups stratified according to age and duration of fever. RESULTS In 87 children with adenovirus infection (median age, 1.5 years; interquartile range, 0.9-3.0), CRP levels of <2 mg/L, <10 mg/L, and <100 mg/L were found in 4 (4%), 12 (13%), and 66 (76%) patients, respectively. Median CRP in the children with adenovirus infection and in 130 children with influenza was 49 mg/L (21-96) and 9 mg/L (3-20), respectively (p = 0.001). A statistically significant difference remained when these 2 patient groups were stratified according to age (=2 vs. >2 years) and duration of fever (=3 vs. >3 days) (p <0.001). In adenovirus infection CRP concentrations were unrelated to age, duration of fever and severity of illness, as judged by the extent of mucosal involvement and by the frequency and duration of hospitalisation. CONCLUSION Paediatric adenovirus infection is associated with substantially elevated CRP concentrations in the absence of secondary bacterial infection. CRP levels were independent of the duration of illness, indicating that adenoviruses trigger an immediate inflammatory host response resembling invasive bacterial infection.","Appenzeller, Christina; Ammann, Roland A; Duppenthaler, Andrea; Gorgievski-Hrisoho, Meri; Aebi, Christoph",Swiss medical weekly,299,33

As the disease lowers the body's immune system, the use of medications that suppress the immune system are not recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to review medications other than steroids used for interventional pain management and the emphasis on mitigation of the untoward consequences of steroid injections on the immune system during the COVID-19 pandemic. LITERATURE SEARCH The literature was searched for articles in English with key words COVID-19, immunity, steroid for pain management injections with steroid, local anesthetics, dextrose water, normal saline, pain and genetic medicine, pain, and regenerative medicine. The sources of articles were PubMed, Embase, and open Google search. LITERATURE REVIEW The medications used for interventional pain management include steroids and opioids. The side effects of these medications are well known but have never been looked at as critically as they are now. Many other medications have been used for interventional pain procedures to relieve pain, such as dextrose water, normal saline solution, local anesthetics, and many adjuvants. Regarding regenerative therapy, despite plenty of evidence in literature, we have not yet considered it as a routine therapy for chronic pain injections. It is now time to move on beyond steroids and consider other types of medications and treatment options.The use of these medications in clinical practice is less auspicious, and thus more research is needed on the practical applications. Further areas for research include studies to determine definitive efficacy and safety assessment and determine whether or not the analgesic effects of these drugs are duration or dose-dependent. The optimal identification of candidates, volume, concentration, and intervals of injection are essential for routine application in interventional chronic pain practice. CONCLUSIONS The future of interventional pain practice is trending toward regenerative medicine and genetic research. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted to investigate the genetic basis of phenotypic variability in individuals with different ethnic groups in terms of susceptibility to chronic pain, as well as response to treatment for the personalized medicine model. Despite the preliminary data on genetic variations, there is no evidence for the use of a pharmacogenomics-based approach to personalized medicine for patients with chronic pain. The field of medicine therefore needs further research in pharmacogenetics, including large-scale prospective studies that focus on pain pathways. However, recent research, including larger studies and larger-scale genomic perspectives, may yield more promising findings in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic proved the need for medications with the most impact and least complications.","Gharaei, Helen; Diwan, Sudhir",Pain physician,299,9

This article summarizes the study design and exposures, and reports findings on several general indicators of toxicity and carcinogenic potential. Diesel exhaust was generated from a commonly used 2000 model 5.9-L, 6-cylinder turbo diesel engine operated on a variable-load heavy-duty test cycle burning national average certification fuel. Animals were exposed to clean air (control) or four dilutions of whole emissions based on particulate matter concentration (30, 100, 300, and 1000 microg/m(3)). Male and female F344 rats and A/J mice were exposed by whole-body inhalation 6 h/day, 7 days/wk, for either 1 wk or 6 mo. Exposures were characterized in detail. Effects of exposure on clinical observations, body and organ weights, serum chemistry, hematology, histopathology, bronchoalveolar lavage, and serum clotting factors were mild. Significant exposure-related effects occurring in both male and female rats included decreases in serum cholesterol and clotting Factor VII and slight increases in serum gamma-glutamyl transferase. Several other responses met screening criteria for significant exposure effects but were not consistent between genders or exposure times and were not corroborated by related parameters. Carcinogenic potential as determined by micronucleated reticulocyte counts and proliferation of adenomas in A/J mice were unaffected by 6 mo of exposure. Parallel studies demonstrated effects on cardiac function and resistance to viral infection; however, the results reported here show few and only modest health hazards from subchronic or shorter exposures to realistic concentrations of contemporary diesel emissions.","Reed, M D; Gigliotti, A P; McDonald, J D; Seagrave, J C; Seilkop, S K; Mauderly, J L",Inhalation toxicology,299,16

(i) Binding to porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) is essential for the initiation of infection. (ii) Binding to sialic acid residues on glycoproteins is dispensable for the infection of cultured cells but is required for enteropathogenicity. By comparing parental TGEV with mutant viruses deficient in the sialic acid binding activity, we determined the contributions of both binding activities to the attachment of TGEV to cultured cells. In the presence of a functional sialic acid binding activity, the amount of virus bound to two different porcine cell lines was increased sixfold compared to the binding of the mutant viruses. The attachment of parental virus was reduced to levels observed with the mutants when sialic acid containing inhibitors was present or when the cells were pretreated with neuraminidase. In virus overlay binding assays with immobilized cell surface proteins, the mutant virus only recognized pAPN. In addition, the parental virus bound to a high-molecular-mass sialoglycoprotein. The recognition of pAPN was sensitive to reducing conditions and was not dependent on sialic acid residues. On the other hand, binding to the sialic acid residues of the high-molecular-mass glycoprotein was observed regardless of whether the cellular proteins had been separated under reducing or nonreducing conditions. We propose that binding to a surface sialoglycoprotein is required for TGEV as a primary attachment site to initiate infection of intestinal cells. This concept is discussed in the context of other viruses that use two different receptors to infect cells.","Schwegmann-Wessels, Christel; Zimmer, Gert; Laude, Hubert; Enjuanes, Luis; Herrler, Georg",Journal of virology,299,12

METHODS A total of 58 convalescent SARS patients were evaluated by the scores of impact of event scale (IES), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS), etc. And 44 of them participated in (1)H-MRS study. There were 18 patients (M:F = 6:12) with SARS-related PTSD and 26 convalescent SARS patients without PTSD. And the procedures were repeated in 18 age, gender and education-matched normal control subjects. In all patients and controls, the regions of interest on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) were anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG), left anterior periventricular white matter (LAPWM) and left posterior periventricular white matter (LPPWM). And the correlations between MRS findings and the scores of SAS, SDS and IES were evaluated. RESULTS In comparisons with the control subjects (n = 18) and convalescent SARS patients without PTSD (n = 26), the SARS-related PTSD group (n = 18) had significantly lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) in 4 regions of interest while the NAA/Cr of the convalescent SARS patients was significantly lower than controls in 3 regions of interest (ACG, PCG and LAPWM). The ratios of NAA/Cr showed no close correlation with the scores of IES, SAS and SDS in convalescent SARS patients. CONCLUSION The changes of brain metabolism in PTSD are caused by SARS. But their exact relationship awaits further explorations. SARS may also lead to the changes of brain metabolism.","Jiang, Yi-nan; Zhou, Wei; Zhao, Xiao-hui; Hong, Xia; Wei, Jing",Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,299,1

RESULTS The mRNA of human beta actin gene could be amplified efficiently in all the tissue samples. The mRNA of human ACE2 was expressed efficiently in the normal lung tissue, but not in the cartilage and cancellous bone under the weight-bearing area of the femoral head.

HLA class I molecules may play a critical role as receptor for OC43 because monoclonal antibody (mAb)W6/32 to HLA-A, -B and -C specificities completely blocks infectivity in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. The role of HLA class 1 antigen as the virus receptor was examined using HLA-A3.1 stably transfected human plasma cells and untransfected HMY.C1R cells which do not express HLA-A and -B molecules. When the cells (5 x 10(6)) were infected at a multiplicity of one, the HLA.A3 transfected cells produced 10(8) PFU of virus whereas no replication occurred in the HMY.C1R cells mAb W6/32 reduced the virus yield by 99.9%. Cell membranes from HMY.C1R, HMY.A3 cells and chicken erythrocytes were biotinylated as live cells. Immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antiviral antibody to detect binding of biotinylated cell membranes to virus revealed that biotinylated HMY.A3 membranes coprecipitated with virus-antibody complexes when the immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gel, electroblotted and stained with Avidin-horseradish peroxidase.

DESIGN A mailed survey sent after the H1N1 outbreak compared with the results of similar survey completed after the SARS outbreak. SETTING Greater Toronto area in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS A total of 183 randomly selected GPs and FPs who provided office-based care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The perceptions of GPs and FPs on how serious infectious disease outbreaks affected their clinical work and personal lives; their preparedness for a serious infectious disease outbreak; and the types of information they want to receive and the sources they wanted to receive information from during a serious infectious disease outbreak. The responses from this survey were compared with the responses of GPs and FPs in the greater Toronto area who completed a similar survey in 2003 after the SARS outbreak. RESULTS After the H1N1 outbreak, GPs and FPs still had substantial concerns about the effects of serious infectious disease outbreaks on the health of their family members. Physicians made changes to various office practices in order to manage and deal with patients with serious infectious diseases. They expressed concerns about the effects of an infectious disease on the provision of health care services. Also, physicians wanted to quickly receive accurate information from the provincial government and their medical associations. CONCLUSION Serious community-based infectious diseases are a personal concern for GPs and FPs, and have considerable effects on their clinical practice.

DESIGN Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective phase III study. SETTING Unifactorial and multifactorial reanalysis of prospectively defined populations from the KyberSept trial. PATIENTS We studied 1,008 patients (43.6% of the overall intention-to-treat population, n = 2,314) with a predicted mortality rate of 30-60% at study entry as defined by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive either high-dose antithrombin III (30,000 IU intravenously over the period of 4 days) or placebo. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS In a Kaplan-Meier analysis of patients with a predicted mortality of 30-60%, the survival time when followed up for 90 days after admission was increased in the high-dose antithrombin III group compared with placebo (p = .04). If heparin was avoided during the 4-day treatment phase with high-dose antithrombin III (n = 140) or placebo (n = 162), the treatment effect appeared to be even more pronounced: 28-day mortality rate, 35.7% vs. 44.4% (risk ratio, 0.804; 95% confidence interval, 0.607-1.064); 56-day mortality rate, 39.9% vs. 52.2% (risk ratio, 0.764; 95% confidence interval, 0.593-0.984); 90-day mortality rate, 42.8% vs. 55.1% (risk ratio, 0.776; 95% confidence interval, 0.614-0.986). Like in the overall population, the percentage with any bleeding was increased in patients receiving high-dose antithrombin III compared with placebo. Survival rates were in favor of high-dose antithrombin III in patients both with and without bleeding complications. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with high-dose antithrombin III may increase survival time up to 90 days in patients with severe sepsis and high risk of death. This benefit may even be stronger when concomitant heparin is avoided.","Wiedermann, Christian J; Hoffmann, Johannes N; Juers, Mathias; Ostermann, Helmut; Kienast, Joachim; Briegel, Josef; Strauss, Richard; Keinecke, Heinz-Otto; Warren, Brian L; Opal, Steven M",Critical care medicine,299,28

In the current study, we examined the regulation of MHC1 in the brain after facial axotomy. The normal facial motor nucleus showed no immunoreactivity for MHC1 (MHC1-IR). Transection of the facial nerve led to a strong and selective up-regulation of MHC1-IR on the microglia in the affected nucleus, beginning at day 2 and reaching a maximum 14 days after axotomy, coinciding with a peak influx of the T lymphocytes that express CD8, the lymphocyte coreceptor for MHC1. Specificity of the MHC1 staining was confirmed in beta2-microglobulin-deficient mice, which lack normal cell surface MHC1-IR. MHC1-IR was particularly strong on phagocytic microglia, induced by delayed neuronal cell death, and correlated with the induction of mRNA for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and interferon-gamma and the influx of T lymphocytes. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (scid), lacking T and B cells, showed an increase in the number of MHC1-positive nodules but no significant effect on overall MHC1-IR. Transgenic deletion of the IL1 receptor type I, or the interferon-gamma receptor type 1 subunit, did not affect the microglial MHC1-IR. However, a combined deletion of TNF receptors 1 and 2 (TNFR1&2-KO) led to a decrease in microglial MHC1-IR and to a striking absence of the phagocytic microglial nodules. Deletion of TNFR2 (p75) did not have an effect; deletion of TNFR1 (p55) reduced the diffuse microglial staining for MHC1-IR but did not abolish the MHC1(+) microglial nodules. In summary, neural injury leads to the induction of MHC1-IR on the activated, phagocytic microglia. This induction of MHC1 precedes the interaction with the immune system, at least in the facial motor nucleus model. Finally, the impaired induction of these molecules, up to now, only in the TNFR-deficient mice underscores the central role of TNF in the immune activation of the injured nervous system.","Bohatschek, M; Kloss, C U A; Hristova, M; Pfeffer, K; Raivich, G",The Journal of comparative neurology,299,1

Sensitivity in burn patients' care and prevalence of COVID-19 have a major impact on this group's healthcare system and infection control strategies. The purpose of this study is to review burn care strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study is a narrative review study. In writing this paper, to access information, the keywords of Coronavirus, COVID-19, burn, strategy, care, and SARS were used. Due to the emergence of COVID disease, searches in Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SID, Magiran, Springer, and Elsevier databases were performed without time limit. Research articles were purposefully selected and approved to be investigated based on the criteria for entering the research. A total of 14 articles had a full text related to the research scope. The researchers used qualitative content analysis to analyze the data. Data analysis was conducted as a comprehensive review of articles, qualitative conclusions, and results. RESULTS In this study, 14 articles related to burn care strategies in the COVID-19 epidemic were selected. Their results were reviewed in two areas of staff care strategies and burn patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings indicate that appropriate prevention and protection strategies and measures should be followed to prevent the transmission of the COVID-19 virus to burn care professionals. In addition, burn patient care strategies were proposed in two levels of minor and moderate to severe burns, so that patients with burns receive adequate burn care during the COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSION Implementation of staff and burn patient care strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to treat burn patients and prevent the spread of the COVID virus.","Delfani, Fatemeh; Shoghi, Mahnaz",International journal of burns and trauma,299,19

We constructed a Protein Signature Pipeline to guide the selection of short peptide sequences to serve as targets for detection and therapeutics. In silico identification of good target peptides that are conserved among strains and unique compared to other species generates a list of peptides. These peptides may be developed in the laboratory as targets of antibody, peptide, and ligand binding for detection assays and therapeutics or as targets for vaccine development. In this paper, we assess how the amount of sequence data affects our ability to identify conserved, unique protein signature candidates. To determine the amount of sequence data required to select good protein signature candidates, we have built a computationally intensive system called the Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP). The SAP performs thousands of Monte Carlo simulations, each calling the Protein Signature Pipeline, to assess how the amount of sequence data for a target organism affects the ability to predict peptide signature candidates. Viral species differ substantially in the number of genomes required to predict protein signature targets. Patterns do not appear based on genome structure. There are more protein than DNA signatures due to greater intraspecific conservation at the protein than at the nucleotide level. We conclude that it is necessary to use the SAP as a dynamic system to assess the need for continued sequencing for each species individually and to update predictions with each additional genome that is sequenced.","Gardner, Shea N; Kuczmarski, Thomas A; Zhou, Carol E; Lam, Marisa W; Slezak, Tom R",Journal of clinical microbiology,299,33

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic upended the traditional paradigm of face-to-face provision of healthcare in the Australian context; as such, a telehealth model of active case management was implemented in our public health system, even though there was little supporting data for the safety of delivering patient care remotely to home-isolation patients in the setting of a highly infectious and potentially fatal illness. METHODS: A retrospective, single-centre, observational cohort study was performed over 6 weeks commencing 12 March 2020, including patients with coronavirus disease 2019 undergoing home isolation and being actively monitored by a coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic. Outcomes assessed comprised: duration of active case follow-up, average number of telephone calls per patient, average number of hours managing each patient, treatment required including presentation to the emergency department or admission to hospital, patient characteristics and utilisation of other health services. RESULTS: Of 5223 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 tests performed, 170 individuals (3.25%) tested positive. A total of 158 were included: 76 (47.5%) male and median age 31 years (range 18-94). Median symptom duration was 13 days (interquartile range 6, range 2-34). Median length of coronavirus disease 2019 telephone assessment clinic admission was 10 days (interquartile range 7, range 3-32). A total of 1151 telephone patient encounters were undertaken, with a median of six phone calls made to each patient (interquartile range 5, range 1-20). Ten patients required repeat clinic review; all but one returned home. Six presented to emergency department, with three of these being admitted. In total, there were six admissions: one from the clinic, three from the emergency department and two direct from home (bypassing emergency department). Only four of the six admissions (or 2.5% of all patients) required low-flow oxygen therapy; none required high-flow oxygen or assisted ventilation. The remaining 140 patients (88.6%) were safely managed at home without complications. DISCUSSION: A telehealth model of care is safe, efficient and cost-effective for the management of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease-19 and facilitates home isolation, especially of a low-risk population, thus providing reassurance that this model is sound and suitable for ongoing use.","Micallef, Milton; Hurley, Siobhan; Brell, Nadiya; Cook, Rebekah; Post, Jeffrey; Overton, Kristen",J Telemed Telecare,299,16

The present study aimed to explore the kinetics of IL-6 levels, validate this association in COVID-19 patients, and report preliminary data on the efficacy of IL-6 receptor blockade. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institutional study of 901 consecutive confirmed cases. Serum IL-6 concentrations were tested on admission and/or during hospital stay. Tocilizumab was given to 16 patients with elevated IL-6 concentration. RESULTS: 366 patients were defined as common cases, 411 patients as severe, and 124 patients as critical according to the Chinese guideline on diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. The median concentration of IL-6 was < 1.5 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-2.15), 1.85 pg/ml (IQR < 1.50-5.21), and 21.55 pg/ml (IQR 6.47-94.66) for the common, severe, and critical groups respectively (P < 0.001). The follow-up kinetics revealed serum IL-6 remained high in critical patients even when cured. An IL-6 concentration higher than 37.65 pg/ml was predictive of in-hospital death (AUC 0.97 [95% CI 0.95-0.99], P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 95.7%. In the 16 patients who received tocilizumab, IL-6 concentrations were significantly increased after administration, and survival outcome was not significantly different from that of propensity-score matched counterparts (n = 53, P = 0.12). CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 should be included in diagnostic work-up to stratify disease severity, but the benefit of tocilizumab needs further confirmation.

This report presents fifteen patients who had COVID-19 respiratory illness followed by cerebrovascular events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A call by the Iranian Neurological Association gathered cases across the country who developed neurological symptoms attributed to hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke after a definite or probable Covid-19 respiratory illness. Definite cases were those with a typical respiratory illness, positive nasopharyngeal Covid-19 PCR test, and chest CT consistent with Covid-19 infection. Probable cases were defined by a typical respiratory illness, history of contacts with a Covid-19 case, and chest CT characteristic for Covid-19 infection. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (12 men and 3 women) with an age range of 38 to 93 years old (median: 65 years old) were included. Fourteen patients had a first-ever acute ischemic stroke and one patient had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Eleven patients (73%) had previous cardiovascular comorbidities. The median time between respiratory symptoms and neurological symptoms was seven days (range 1-16 days). Stroke severity in two patients was mild (NIHSS &#8804; 6), in six patients moderate (NIHSS: 7-12), and in seven patients severe (NIHSS &#8805;13). One patient received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator ( IV-tPA) with improved neurological symptoms. Six out of 15 patients (40%) died. All but one of those who survived had significant disability assessed by a modified ranking scale >2. The majority of patients in this case series had vascular risk factors and their stroke was associated with severe disability and death. CONCLUSION: This report highlights the need for further investigation of the links between Covid-19 and cerebrovascular events.","Sabayan, Behnam; Moghadami, Mohsen; Assarzadegan, Farhad; Komachali, Sahar Hojjat-Anasri; Poorsaadat, Leila; Babaeepour, Zabihollah; Ebrahimzadeh, Seyed Amir; Hamidi, Ava; Hasheminejad, Zeinab Sadat; Mohammadi-Vosough, Elahe; Mirkarimi, Hamid Reza; Paybast, Sepideh; Rahimian, Nasrin; Safari, Anahid; Sepehrnia, Mersedeh; Nematollahi, Reza; Shahripour, Reza Bavarsad; Batra, Ayush; Sorond, Farzaneh; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,299,14

Abundant scientific evidence the wild animals are believed to be the primary hosts of the virus. Majority of such cases are considered to be human-to-human transmission, while a few are due to wild animals-to-human transmission and substantial burdens on healthcare system following this spread. To understand the dynamical behavior such diseases, we fitted a susceptible-infectious-quarantined model for human cases with constant proportions. We proposed a model that provide better constraints on understanding the climaxes of such unseen disastrous spread, relevant consequences, and suggesting future imperative strategies need to be adopted. The main features of the work include the positivity, boundedness, existence and uniqueness of solution of the model. The conditions were derived under which the COVID-19 may extinct or persist in the population. Sensitivity and estimation of those important parameters have been carried out that plays key role in the transmission mechanism. To optimize the spread of such disease, we present a control problem for further analysis using two control measures. The necessary conditions have been derived using the Pontryagin's maximum principle. Parameter values have been estimated from the real data and experimental numerical simulations are presented for comparison as well as verification of theoretical results. The obtained numerical results also present the verification, accuracy, validation, and robustness of the proposed scheme.","Din, Anwarud; Li, Yongjin; Khan, Tahir; Zaman, Gul",Chaos Solitons Fractals,299,30

METHODS: We compared the number/visits of cancer outpatients receiving oncological therapies at the oncologic day clinic (DC) and admissions at the emergency department (ED) of our institution in time periods before (pre‐lockdown period: 1 January – 15 March 2020) and after (post‐lockdown period: 16 March– 31 May 2020) lockdown implementation with the respective reference periods of 2018 and 2019. Additionally, we analysed Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score of unplanned cancer patient presentations to the ED in the same post‐lockdown time periods. Patient outcome was described as 3‐month mortality rate (3‐MM). RESULTS: In total, 16 703 visits at the DC and 2664 patient visits for the respective time periods were recorded at the ED. No decrease in patient visits was observed at the DC after lockdown implementation (P = .351), whereas a substantial decrease in patient visits at the ED was seen (P < .001). This translates into a 26%‐31% reduction of cancer‐related patient visits per half month after the lockdown at the ED (P < .001 vs. 2018 + 2019). There was no difference in the distribution of ESI scores at ED presentation (P = .805), admission rates or 3‐MM in association with lockdown implementation (P = .086).

This study examines the effect of quarantine on young adults by assessing depression, anxiety, stress and the experience of positive and negative affect. The role of potential risk factors such as disruption of normal life, perceived threat of the disease, acquaintance with someone infected and gender; and protective factors, such as adherence to a daily routine and altruism was evaluated. An online questionnaire entailing demographics, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS‐21), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), measures of life disruption, perceived threat and adherence to a daily routine and an altruism scale was completed by 1018 undergraduates. Increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress and negative affect were found. Life disruption and perceived threat of the disease were risk factors in all psychological distress measures, while a stable, satisfying daily routine and altruism mitigated the negative consequences. Gender was a moderator. Acknowledging the psychological effect of quarantine on young adults should be the starting point for interventions. Helping people build a new routine and assign an altruistic meaning to the confinement can protect psychological health.","Kornilaki, Ekaterina N.",Int J Psychol,299,32

These putative replication complexes are composed of intimately associated but biochemically distinct membrane populations, each of which contains proteins processed from the replicase (gene 1) polyprotein. Specifically, one membrane population contains the gene 1 proteins p65 and p1a-22, while the other contains the gene 1 proteins p28 and helicase, as well as the structural nucleocapsid (N) protein and newly synthesized viral RNA. In this study, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to define the relationship of the membrane populations comprising the putative replication complexes at different times of infection in MHV-A59-infected delayed brain tumor cells. At 5.5 h postinfection (p.i.) the membranes containing N and helicase colocalized with the membranes containing p1a-22/p65 at foci distinct from sites of M accumulation. By 8 to 12 h p.i., however, the membranes containing helicase and N had a predominantly perinuclear distribution and colocalized with M. In contrast, the p1a-22/p65-containing membranes retained a peripheral, punctate distribution at all times of infection and did not colocalize with M. By late times of infection, helicase, N, and M each also colocalized with ERGIC p53, a specific marker for the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi–intermediate compartment. These data demonstrated that the putative replication complexes separated into component membranes that relocalized during the course of infection. These results suggest that the membrane populations within the MHV replication complex serve distinct functions both in RNA synthesis and in delivery of replication products to sites of virus assembly.","Bost, Anne G.; Prentice, Erik; Denison, Mark R.",Virology,299,27

This study aimed to explore the effect of COVID‐19 nationwide quarantine on accelerometer‐assessed physical activity of heart failure patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the daily number of steps in 26 heart failure patients during a 6‐week period that included 3 weeks immediately preceding the onset of the quarantine and the first 3 weeks of the quarantine. The daily number of steps was assessed using a wrist‐worn accelerometer worn by the patients as part of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. Multilevel modelling was used to explore the effect of the quarantine on the daily step count adjusted for weather conditions. As compared with the 3 weeks before the onset of the quarantine, the step count was significantly lower during each of the first 3 weeks of the quarantine (P < 0.05). When the daily step count was averaged across the 3 weeks before and during the quarantine, the decrease amounted to 1134 (SE 189) steps per day (P < 0.001), which translated to a 16.2% decrease. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the nationwide quarantine due to COVID‐19 had a detrimental effect on the level of habitual physical activity in heart failure patients, leading to an abrupt decrease of daily step count that lasted for at least the 3‐week study period. Staying active and maintaining sufficient levels of physical activity during the COVID‐19 pandemic are essential despite the unfavourable circumstances of quarantine.","Vetrovsky, Tomas; Frybova, Tereza; Gant, Iulian; Semerad, Miroslav; Cimler, Richard; Bunc, Vaclav; Siranec, Michal; Miklikova, Marie; Vesely, Jiri; Griva, Martin; Precek, Jan; Pelouch, Radek; Parenica, Jiri; Belohlavek, Jan",ESC Heart Fail,299,16

The novel parameter known as the electrokinetic equilibrium condition ([Formula: see text]) was presented in recent studies, providing an approach to analyze microparticles in microchannels employing unique electrokinetic (EK) signatures. While the [Formula: see text] shows great promise, current estimation approaches can be time-consuming or heavily user-dependent for accurate values. The present contribution aims to analyze existing approaches for estimating this parameter and modify the process into an accurate yet simple technique for estimating the EK behavior of microorganisms in insulator-based microfluidic devices. The technique presented here yields the parameter called the empirical electrokinetic equilibrium condition ([Formula: see text]) which works well as a value for initial approximations of trapping conditions in insulator-based EK (iEK) microfluidic systems. A total of six types of microorganisms were analyzed in this study (three bacteria and three bacteriophages). The proposed approach estimated [Formula: see text] values employing images of trapped microorganisms, yielding high reproducibility (SD 5.0–8.8%). Furthermore, stable trapping voltages (sTVs) were estimated from [Formula: see text] values for distinct channel designs to test that this parameter is system-independent and good agreement was obtained when comparing estimated sTVs vs. experimental values (SD 0.3–19.6%). The encouraging results from this work were used to generate an EK library of data, available on our laboratory website. The data in this library can be used to design tailored iEK microfluidic devices for the analysis of microorganisms.","Coll De Peña, Adriana; Hill, Nicole; Lapizco-Encinas, Blanca H.",Biosensors (Basel),299,24

METHOD: International cohort study including adult patients undergoing elective surgery for cancer in areas affected by SARS-CoV-2 up to 19 April 2020 (NCT04384926). Patients suspected preoperatively of SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pulmonary complications at 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Of 8784 patients (432 hospitals, 53 countries), 2303 patients (26.2%) underwent preoperative testing: 1458 (16.6%) had a swab test, 521 (5.9%) CT only, and 324 (3.7%) swab and CT. The overall pulmonary complication rate was 3.9% and SARS-CoV-2 infection rate was 2.6%. After risk adjustment, only a nasopharyngeal swab test (adjusted odds ratio 0.68, 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.98, p = 0.040) was associated with lower rates of pulmonary complications. Swab testing remained beneficial before major surgery and in high SARS-CoV-2 population risk areas but not before minor surgery in low incidence areas.

Intellectual input from various aspects is needed to fight against COVID-19, including understanding of the public’s emotion and behaviour and their antecedents from the psychological perspectives. Drawing upon the cognitive appraisal theory, this study examined three cognitive appraisals (i.e., perceived severity, perceived controllability, and knowledge of COVID-19) and their associations with a wide range of emotional and behavioural outcomes among the Chinese public. METHODS: Participants were 4607 citizens (age range: 17–90 years, Mage = 23.71 years) from 31 provinces in China and they took part in a cross-sectional survey online. RESULTS: The results showed that the public’s emotional and behavioural reactions were slightly affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. Moreover, the public had limited participation in the events regarding COVID-19 but actively engaged in precautionary behaviour. In addition, results of structural equation model with latent variables revealed that the three appraisals were differentially related to the outcome variables (i.e., negative emotion, positive emotion, sleep problems, aggression, substance use, mobile phone use, social participation, and precautionary behaviour). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the utility of cognitive appraisal, as a core process of coping stress, in explaining the public’s emotion and behaviour in the encounter of public health concern.

HCoVs are globally distributed and the predominant species may vary by region or year. Prior studies have shown seasonal patterns of HCoV species and annual variation in species prevalence but national circulation patterns in the US have not yet been described. OBJECTIVES: To describe circulation patterns of HCoVs -OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 in the US. STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test results for HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1 reported to The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) by U.S. laboratories from July 2014–June 2017. We calculated the total number of tests and percent positive by week. For a subset of HCoV positive submissions with age and sex of the patient available, we tested for differences in age and sex across the four HCoV species using Chi Square and Kruskal Wallace tests. RESULTS: 117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests; 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1. The percentage of positive tests peaked during December – March each year. No significant differences in sex were seen across species, although a significant difference in age distribution was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in winter months in the US, and individual HCoVs may show variable circulation from year to year. Different HCoV species may be detected more frequently in different age groups. Further years of data are needed to better understand patterns of activity for HCoVs.","Killerby, Marie E.; Biggs, Holly M.; Haynes, Amber; Dahl, Rebecca M.; Mustaquim, Desiree; Gerber, Susan I.; Watson, John T.",J Clin Virol,299,26

These masks are normally intended for single use, but their sterilization and subsequent reuse could substantially mitigate a world-wide shortage. DESIGN: Quality assurance. SETTING: A sealed environment chamber installed in the animal facility of an academic medical center. INTERVENTIONS: One to five sterilization cycles using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist® equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal protective equipment, including five N95 mask models from three manufacturers, were evaluated for efficacy of sterilization following iHP treatment (measured with bacterial spores in standard biological indicator assemblies). Additionally, N95 masks were assessed for their ability to efficiently filter particles down to 0.3μm and for their ability to form an airtight seal using a quantitative fit test. Filtration efficiency was measured using ambient particulate matter at a university lab and an aerosolized NaCl challenge at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain function up to five cycles, the maximum number tested to date. Some but not all PPE could also be sterilized using an iHP environmental chamber, but pre-treatment with a handheld iHP generator was required for semi-enclosed surfaces such as respirator hoses. CONCLUSIONS: A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~80 m(3) can treat ~7000 masks per day, as well as other items of PPE, making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","Cramer, Avilash K.; Plana, Deborah; Yang, Helen; Carmack, Mary M.; Tian, Enze; Sinha, Michael S.; Krikorian, David; Turner, David; Mo, Jinhan; Li, Ju; Gupta, Rajiv; Manning, Heather; Bourgeois, Florence T.; Yu, Sherry H.; Sorger, Peter K.; LeBoeuf, Nicole R.",medRxiv,299,11

In the country, there are an estimated 49,000-52,000 homeless people. People experiencing homelessness are among the potentially most vulnerable groups to the CoViD-19. Despite this, in Italy there is a worrying delay in implementation of a national coordinated strategy to protect homeless people from the potentially devastating effects caused by CoViD-19. In order to contain the epidemic among the most vulnerable people, we propose a short operational agenda based on the field experience of the medical-humanitarian organization Medici per i Diritti Umani (Doctors for Human Rights, Italy - MEDU) as well as on the example of initiatives taken by other countries.","Barbieri, Alberto",Recenti progressi in medicina,299,3

The immaturity of the developing immune system, and particularly the distinct functionality of T lymphocytes in early life, has been implicated in increased susceptibility to infection. Previous work has demonstrated that immune responses in early life are skewed toward limited inflammation and atopy; however, there is mounting evidence that such responses are context- and tissue-dependent. The regulation, differentiation, and maintenance of infant T cell responses, particularly as it relates to tissue compartmentalization, remains poorly understood. How the tissue environment impacts early-life immune responses and whether the development of localized protective immune memory cell subsets are established is an emerging area of research. As infectious diseases affecting the respiratory and digestive tracts are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide in infants and young children, a deeper understanding of site-specific immunity is essential to addressing these challenges. Here, we review the current paradigms of T cell responses during infancy as they relate to tissue localization and discuss implications for the development of vaccines and therapeutics.","Zens, Kyra D.; Connors, Thomas; Farber, Donna L.",Semin Immunopathol,299,23

To this end, nanoparticles are increasingly used to improve diagnosis, monitoring, and therapy. Huge research is being carried out to improve the design, efficiency, and performance of these nanoparticles. Nanoparticles are also considered as a major area of research and development to meet the essential requirements for use in nanomedicine where safety, compatibility, biodegradability, biodistribution, stability, and effectiveness are requirements towards the desired application. In this regard, lipids have been used in pharmaceuticals and medical formulations for a long time. The present work focuses on the use of lipid nanostructures to combat brain tumors. In addition, this review summarizes the literature pertaining to solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (LNC), methods of preparation and characterization, developments achieved to overcome blood brain barrier (BBB), and modifications used to increase their effectiveness.","Nsairat, Hamdi; Khater, Dima; Odeh, Fadwa; Al-Adaileh, Fedaa; Al-Taher, Suma; Jaber, Areej M.; Alshaer, Walhan; Al Bawab, Abeer; Mubarak, Mohammad S.",Heliyon,299,20

The presence of air or gas in the mediastinum is pneumomediastinum. We present a rare case of vaping-induced spontaneous pneumomediastinum. A young 20-year-old female patient with a history of vaping and no past medical history presented with acute chest pain to an emergency room. The urine drug screen was positive for cannabinoids. Imaging studies - chest x-ray and computed tomography of the chest - showed pneumomediastinum. The patient was discharged after a day of observation and counseling to quit vaping.","Adhikari, Ramesh; Manduva, Deepika; Malayala, Srikrishna V; Singh, Romil; Jain, Nitesh K; Deepika, Keerti; Koritala, Thoyaja",Cureus,299,10

To proceed, panel regression models are first applied with a time-lag effect to estimate the general effects of COVID-19 on daily tourist arrivals. In turn, the data set is decomposed into two nation groups and fixed effects models are employed for addressing the comparison of the pandemic-tourism relationship between economies with and without experiences of the SARS epidemic. Specifically, Taiwan and Hong Kong are grouped as economies with SARS experiences, while Thailand and New Zealand are grouped as countries without experiences of SARS. The estimation result indicates that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has a significant negative impact on tourism demand, in which a 1% COVID-19 case increase causes a 0.075% decline in tourist arrivals, which is a decline of approximately 110 arrivals for every additional person infected by the coronavirus. The negative impact of COVID-19 on tourist arrivals for Thailand and New Zealand is found much stronger than for Taiwan and Hong Kong. In particular, the number of tourist arrivals to Taiwan and Hong Kong decreased by 0.034% in response to a 1% increase in COVID-19 confirmed cases, while in Thailand and New Zealand, a 1% national confirmed cases increase caused a 0.103% reduction in tourism demand. Moreover, the effect of the number of domestic cases on international tourism is found lower than the effect caused by global COVID-19 mortality for the economies with SARS experiences. In contrast, tourist arrivals are majorly affected by the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Thailand and New Zealand. Finally, travel restriction in all cases is found to be the most influencing factor for the number of tourist arrivals. Besides contributing to the existing literature focusing on the knowledge regarding the nexus between tourism and COVID-19, the paper’s findings also highlight the importance of risk perception and the need of transmission prevention and control of the epidemic for the tourism sector.","Tran, Bao-Linh; Chen, Chi-Chung; Tseng, Wei-Chun; Liao, Shu-Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,299,16

Mucor can invade the brain parenchyma by either contiguous spread from the paranasal sinuses or through vascular invasion. We report a case of fatal rhino-cerebral mucormycosis in whom cytotoxic edema at magnetic resonance diffusion-weighted imaging was symmetrically restricted to both neocortical and paleocortical primary areas of olfactory projection at earliest phase of the disease process. Shortly later tissue damage extended into the whole brain. This undescribed observation raised the hypothesis of preferential way of brain invasion by Mucor through the olfactory tract.","Sandron, J.; Hantson, Ph.; Duprez, T.",Acta Radiol Open,299,28

Therefore, this study was designed to understand the changes in dietary and lifestyle behaviours that are major determinants of health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a convenience sample of 415 adults living in Kuwait (age range 18–73 years). RESULTS: The rate of skipping breakfast remained consistent, with a slight increase during the pandemic. Lunch remained the main reported meal before and during COVID-19. Compared to before COVID-19, people were much more likely have a late-night snack or meal during COVID-19 (OR = 3.57 (95% CI 1.79–7.26), p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a drastic decrease in the frequency of fast-food consumption during COVID-19, up to 82% reported not consuming fast food (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in the percentage of participants who had their main meal freshly made (OR = 59.18 (95% CI 6.55–1400.76), p = 0.001). Regarding food group patterns, no significant differences were found before and during the pandemic in terms of the weekly frequency of consumption, except in the case of fish and seafood. There were no remarkable changes in beverage consumption habits among participants before and during the pandemic, except for Americano coffee and fresh juice. Furthermore, there was a great reduction in physical activity and an increase in the amount of screen time and sedentary behaviours. A notable increase was detected in day-time sleep and a decrease in night-time sleep among participants. CONCLUSION: In general, this study indicates some changes in daily life, including changes in some eating practices, physical activity and sleeping habits during the pandemic. It is important that the government considers the need for nutrition education programmes and campaigns, particularly during this critical period of the pandemic in Kuwait.","Husain, Wafaa; Ashkanani, Fatemah",Environ Health Prev Med,299,1
