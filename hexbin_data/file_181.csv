423,423,423,Serodiagnosis of Echinococcus spp. Infection: Explorative Selection of Diagnostic Antigens by Peptide Microarray,7.6727066,8.441727,2010-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Production of native antigens for serodiagnosis of helminthic infections is laborious and hampered by batch-to-batch variation. For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. Our strategy could prove useful for diagnostic developments in other pathogens.","List, Claudia; Qi, Weihong; Maag, Eva; Gottstein, Bruno; Müller, Norbert; Felger, Ingrid",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
853,853,853,The Sigma Class Glutathione Transferase from the Liver Fluke Fasciola hepatica,7.7439075,8.426511,2012-05-29,"BACKGROUND: Liver fluke infection of livestock causes economic losses of over US$ 3 billion worldwide per annum. The disease is increasing in livestock worldwide and is a re-emerging human disease. There are currently no commercial vaccines, and only one drug with significant efficacy against adult worms and juveniles. A liver fluke vaccine is deemed essential as short-lived chemotherapy, which is prone to resistance, is an unsustainable option in both developed and developing countries. Protein superfamilies have provided a number of leading liver fluke vaccine candidates. A new form of glutathione transferase (GST) family, Sigma class GST, closely related to a leading Schistosome vaccine candidate (Sm28), has previously been revealed by proteomics in the liver fluke but not functionally characterised. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this manuscript we show that a purified recombinant form of the F. hepatica Sigma class GST possesses prostaglandin synthase activity and influences activity of host immune cells. Immunocytochemistry and western blotting have shown the protein is present near the surface of the fluke and expressed in eggs and newly excysted juveniles, and present in the excretory/secretory fraction of adults. We have assessed the potential to use F. hepatica Sigma class GST as a vaccine in a goat-based vaccine trial. No significant reduction of worm burden was found but we show significant reduction in the pathology normally associated with liver fluke infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that F. hepatica Sigma class GST has likely multi-functional roles in the host-parasite interaction from general detoxification and bile acid sequestration to PGD synthase activity.","LaCourse, E.

858,858,858,Clinical Relevance and Discriminatory Value of Elevated Liver Aminotransferase Levels for Dengue Severity,7.8958855,8.4744425,2012-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is prominent in acute dengue illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) 2009 dengue guidelines defined AST or ALT≥1000 units/liter (U/L) as a criterion for severe dengue. We aimed to assess the clinical relevance and discriminatory value of AST or ALT for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and severe dengue. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We retrospectively studied and classified polymerase chain reaction positive dengue patients from 2006 to 2008 treated at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore according to WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria for dengue severity. Of 690 dengue patients, 31% had DHF and 24% severe dengue. Elevated AST and ALT occurred in 86% and 46%, respectively. Seven had AST or ALT≥1000 U/L. None had acute liver failure but one patient died. Median AST and ALT values were significantly higher with increasing dengue severity by both WHO 1997 and 2009 criteria. However, they were poorly discriminatory between non-severe and severe dengue (e.g., AST area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve = 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.57–0.67) and between dengue fever (DF) and DHF (AST area under the ROC curve = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.52–0.61). There was significant overlap in AST and ALT values among patients with dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue, and between those with DF and DHF. CONCLUSIONS: Although aminotransferase levels increased in conjunction with dengue severity, AST or ALT values did not discriminate between DF and DHF or non-severe and severe dengue.","Lee, Linda K.; Gan, Victor C.; Lee, Vernon J.; Tan, Adriana S.; Leo, Yee Sin; Lye, David C.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
872,872,872,Oligonucleotide Based Magnetic Bead Capture of Onchocerca volvulus DNA for PCR Pool Screening of Vector Black Flies,7.8580604,8.259599,2012-06-19,"BACKGROUND: Entomological surveys of Simulium vectors are an important component in the criteria used to determine if Onchocerca volvulus transmission has been interrupted and if focal elimination of the parasite has been achieved. However, because infection in the vector population is quite rare in areas where control has succeeded, large numbers of flies need to be examined to certify transmission interruption. Currently, this is accomplished through PCR pool screening of large numbers of flies. The efficiency of this process is limited by the size of the pools that may be screened, which is in turn determined by the constraints imposed by the biochemistry of the assay. The current method of DNA purification from pools of vector black flies relies upon silica adsorption. This method can be applied to screen pools containing a maximum of 50 individuals (from the Latin American vectors) or 100 individuals (from the African vectors). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have evaluated an alternative method of DNA purification for pool screening of black flies which relies upon oligonucleotide capture of Onchocerca volvulus genomic DNA from homogenates prepared from pools of Latin American and African vectors. The oligonucleotide capture assay was shown to reliably detect one O. volvulus infective larva in pools containing 200 African or Latin American flies, representing a two-four fold improvement over the conventional assay. The capture assay requires an equivalent amount of technical time to conduct as the conventional assay, resulting in a two-four fold reduction in labor costs per insect assayed and reduces reagent costs to $3.81 per pool of 200 flies, or less than $0.02 per insect assayed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The oligonucleotide capture assay represents a substantial improvement in the procedure used to detect parasite prevalence in the vector population, a major metric employed in the process of certifying the elimination of onchocerciasis.","Gopal, Hemavathi; Hassan, Hassan K.; Rodríguez-Pérez, Mario A.; Toé, Laurent D.; Lustigman, Sara; Unnasch, Thomas R.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
1479,1479,1479,A Novel Universal Neutralizing Monoclonal Antibody against Enterovirus 71 That Targets the Highly Conserved “Knob” Region of VP3 Protein,8.016013,8.375847,2014-05-29,"Hand, foot and mouth disease caused by enterovirus 71(EV71) leads to the majority of neurological complications and death in young children. While putative inactivated vaccines are only now undergoing clinical trials, no specific treatment options exist yet. Ideally, EV71 specific intravenous immunoglobulins could be developed for targeted treatment of severe cases. To date, only a single universally neutralizing monoclonal antibody against a conserved linear epitope of VP1 has been identified. Other enteroviruses have been shown to possess major conformational neutralizing epitopes on both the VP2 and VP3 capsid proteins. Hence, we attempted to isolate such neutralizing antibodies against conformational epitopes for their potential in the treatment of infection as well as differential diagnosis and vaccine optimization. Here we describe a universal neutralizing monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved conformational epitope of EV71 which was mapped using escape mutants. Eight escape mutants from different subgenogroups (A, B2, B4, C2, C4) were rescued; they harbored three essential mutations either at amino acid positions 59, 62 or 67 of the VP3 protein which are all situated in the “knob” region. The escape mutant phenotype could be mimicked by incorporating these mutations into reverse genetically engineered viruses showing that P59L, A62D, A62P and E67D abolish both monoclonal antibody binding and neutralization activity. This is the first conformational neutralization epitope mapped on VP3 for EV71.","Kiener, Tanja K.; Jia, Qiang; Meng, Tao; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Kwang, Jimmy",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

The renal response to persistent leptospiral colonization, as measured by urinary protein biosignatures, has not been systematically studied. Urinary exosomes--bioactive membrane-bound nanovesicles--contain cell-state specific cargo that additively reflect formation all along the nephron. We hypothesized that Leptospira-infection will alter the content of urine exosomes, and further, that these Leptospira-induced alterations will hold clues to unravel novel pathways related to bacterial-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Exosome protein content from 24 hour urine samples of Leptospira-infected rats was compared with that of uninfected rats using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical models were used to identify significantly dysregulated proteins in Leptospira-infected and uninfected rat urine exosomes. In all, 842 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS proteomics of total rat urine and 204 proteins associated specifically with exosomes. Multivariate analysis showed that 25 proteins significantly discriminated between uninfected control and infected rats. Alanyl (membrane) aminopeptidase, also known as CD13 topped this list with the highest score, a finding we validated by Western immunoblotting. Whole urine analysis showed Tamm-Horsfall protein level reduction in the infected rat urine. Total urine and exosome proteins were significantly different in male vs. female infected rats. CONCLUSIONS: We identified exosome-associated renal tubule-specific responses to Leptospira infection in a rat chronic colonization model. Quantitative differences in infected male and female rat urine exosome proteins vs. uninfected controls suggest that urine exosome analysis identifies important differences in kidney function that may be of clinical and pathological significance.","RamachandraRao, Satish P.; Matthias, Michael A.; Mondrogon, Chanthel-Kokoy; Aghania, Eamon; Park, Cathleen; Kong, Casey; Ishaya, Michelle; Madrigal, Assael; Horng, Jennifer; Khoshaba, Roni; Bounkhoun, Anousone; Basilico, Fabrizio; De Palma, Antonella; Agresta, Anna Maria; Awdishu, Linda; Naviaux, Robert K.; Vinetz, Joseph M.; Mauri, Pierluigi",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
1772,1772,1772,Sensitivity and Specificity of a Novel Classifier for the Early Diagnosis of Dengue,7.7686815,8.418713,2015-04-02,"BACKGROUND: Dengue is the commonest arboviral disease of humans. An early and accurate diagnosis of dengue can support clinical management, surveillance and disease control and is central to achieving the World Health Organisation target of a 50% reduction in dengue case mortality by 2020. METHODS: 5729 children with fever of <72hrs duration were enrolled into this multicenter prospective study in southern Vietnam between 2010-2012. A composite of gold standard diagnostic tests identified 1692 dengue cases. Using statistical methods, a novel Early Dengue Classifier (EDC) was developed that used patient age, white blood cell count and platelet count to discriminate dengue cases from non-dengue cases. RESULTS: The EDC had a sensitivity of 74.8% (95%CI: 73.0-76.8%) and specificity of 76.3% (95%CI: 75.2-77.6%) for the diagnosis of dengue. As an adjunctive test alongside NS1 rapid testing, sensitivity of the composite test was 91.6% (95%CI: 90.4-92.9%). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the early diagnosis of dengue can be enhanced beyond the current standard of care using a simple evidence-based algorithm. The results should support patient management and clinical trials of specific therapies.","Tuan, Nguyen Minh; Nhan, Ho Thi; Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Hung, Nguyen Thanh; Tuan, Ha Manh; Tram, Ta Van; Ha, Nguyen Le Da; Loi, Phan; Quang, Han Khoi; Kien, Duong Thi Hue; Hubbard, Sonya; Chau, Tran Nguyen Bich; Wills, Bridget; Wolbers, Marcel; Simmons, Cameron P.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

We previously showed that Fibrinogen-like-protein 2 (FGL2), a novel CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg effector molecule, was over-expressed in the liver of mice experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. However, little is known about its contribution to the control of this chronic helminth infection. METHODS/FINDINGS: Key parameters for infection outcome in E. multilocularis-infected fgl2(-/-) (AE-fgl2(-/-)) and wild type (AE-WT) mice at 1 and 4 month(s) post-infection were (i) parasite load (i. e. wet weight of parasitic metacestode tissue), and (ii) parasite cell proliferation as assessed by determining E. multilocularis 14-3-3 gene expression levels. Serum FGL2 levels were measured by ELISA. Spleen cells cultured with ConA for 48h or with E. multilocularis Vesicle Fluid (VF) for 96h were analyzed ex-vivo and in-vitro. In addition, spleen cells from non-infected WT mice were cultured with rFGL2/anti-FGL2 or rIL-17A/anti-IL-17A for further functional studies. For Treg-immune-suppression-assays, purified CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg suspensions were incubated with CD4(+) effector T cells in the presence of ConA and irradiated spleen cells as APCs. Flow cytometry and qRT-PCR were used to assess Treg, Th17-, Th1-, Th2-type immune responses and maturation of dendritic cells. We showed that AE-fgl2(-/-) mice exhibited (as compared to AE-WT-animals) (a) a significantly lower parasite load with reduced proliferation activity, (b) an increased T cell proliferative response to ConA, (c) reduced Treg numbers and function, and (d) a persistent capacity of Th1 polarization and DC maturation. CONCLUSIONS: FGL2 appears as one of the key players in immune regulatory processes favoring metacestode survival by promoting Treg cell activity and IL-17A production that contributes to FGL2-regulation. Prospectively, targeting FGL2 could be an option to develop an immunotherapy against AE and other chronic parasitic diseases.","Wang, Junhua; Vuitton, Dominique A.; Müller, Norbert; Hemphill, Andrew; Spiliotis, Markus; Blagosklonov, Oleg; Grandgirard, Denis; Leib, Stephen L.; Shalev, Itay; Levy, Gary; Lu, Xiaomei; Lin, Renyong; Wen, Hao; Gottstein, Bruno",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
1868,1868,1868,BoHV-4-Based Vector Single Heterologous Antigen Delivery Protects STAT1((-/-)) Mice from Monkeypoxvirus Lethal Challenge,7.9966784,8.382847,2015-06-18,"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX). It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)ΔTK, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD(106)ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD(106)ΔTK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD(106)ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD(106)ΔTK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity.

Schistosoma japonicum, a zoonotic parasite with a wide range of mammalian hosts, is one of the major pathogens of this disease. Although numerous studies on schistosomiasis japonica have been performed using laboratory animal models, systematic comparative analysis of whole-genome expression profiles in parasites from different laboratory animals and nature mammalian hosts is lacking to date. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adult schistosomes were obtained from laboratory animals BALB/c mice, C57BL/6 mice, New Zealand white rabbits and the natural host, water buffaloes. The gene expression profiles of schistosomes from these animals were obtained and compared by genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The results revealed that the gene expression profiles of schistosomes from different laboratory animals and buffaloes were highly consistent (r>0.98) genome-wide. Meanwhile, a total of 450 genes were identified to be differentially expressed in schistosomes which can be clustered into six groups. Pathway analysis revealed that these genes were mainly involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, amino acid, energy, nucleotide and lipid metabolism. We also identified a group of 1,540 abundantly and stably expressed gene products in adult worms, including a panel of 179 Schistosoma- or Platyhelminthes-specific genes that may be essential for parasitism and may be regarded as novel potential anti-parasite intervention targets for future research. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a comprehensive database of gene expression profiles of schistosomes derived from different laboratory animals and water buffaloes. An expanded number of genes potentially affecting the development of schistosomes in different animals were identified. These findings lay the foundation for schistosomiasis research in different laboratory animals and natural hosts at the transcriptional level and provide a valuable resource for screening anti-schistosomal intervention targets.","Liu, Shuai; Zhou, Xiaosu; Piao, Xianyu; Wu, Chuang; Hou, Nan; Chen, Qijun",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

The virus is endemic in over 120 countries, causing over 350 million infections per year. Dengue vaccine development is challenging because of the need to induce simultaneous protection against four antigenically distinct DENV serotypes and evidence that, under some conditions, vaccination can enhance disease due to specific immunity to the virus. While several live-attenuated tetravalent dengue virus vaccines display partial efficacy, it has been challenging to induce balanced protective immunity to all 4 serotypes. Instead of using whole-virus formulations, we are exploring the potentials for a particulate subunit vaccine, based on DENV E-protein displayed on nanoparticles that have been precisely molded using Particle Replication in Non-wetting Template (PRINT) technology. Here we describe immunization studies with a DENV2-nanoparticle vaccine candidate. The ectodomain of DENV2-E protein was expressed as a secreted recombinant protein (sRecE), purified and adsorbed to poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles of different sizes and shape. We show that PRINT nanoparticle adsorbed sRecE without any adjuvant induces higher IgG titers and a more potent DENV2-specific neutralizing antibody response compared to the soluble sRecE protein alone. Antigen trafficking indicate that PRINT nanoparticle display of sRecE prolongs the bio-availability of the antigen in the draining lymph nodes by creating an antigen depot. Our results demonstrate that PRINT nanoparticles are a promising platform for delivering subunit vaccines against flaviviruses such as dengue and Zika.","Metz, Stefan W.; Tian, Shaomin; Hoekstra, Gabriel; Yi, Xianwen; Stone, Michelle; Horvath, Katie; Miley, Michael J.; DeSimone, Joseph; Luft, Chris J.; de Silva, Aravinda M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC(50), 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug’s observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections.","Nelson, Elizabeth A.; Dyall, Julie; Hoenen, Thomas; Barnes, Alyson B.; Zhou, Huanying; Liang, Janie Y.; Michelotti, Julia; Dewey, William H.; DeWald, Lisa Evans; Bennett, Richard S.; Morris, Patrick J.; Guha, Rajarshi; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; McKnight, Crystal; Chen, Yu-Chi; Xu, Xin; Wang, Amy; Hughes, Emma; Martin, Scott; Thomas, Craig; Jahrling, Peter B.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Olinger, Gene G.; White, Judith M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

The evolution of drug-resistant phenotypes has been linked to the parasites’ intrinsic genome instability, with frequent gene and chromosome amplifications causing fitness gains that are directly selected by environmental factors, including the presence of antileishmanial drugs. Thus, even though the unique eukaryotic biology of Leishmania and its dependence on parasite-specific virulence factors provide valid opportunities for chemotherapeutical intervention, all strategies that target the parasite in a direct fashion are likely prone to select for resistance. Here, we review the current state of antileishmanial chemotherapy and discuss the limitations of ongoing drug discovery efforts. We finally propose new strategies that target Leishmania viability indirectly via mechanisms of host–parasite interaction, including parasite-released ectokinases and host epigenetic regulation, which modulate host cell signaling and transcriptional regulation, respectively, to establish permissive conditions for intracellular Leishmania survival.","Lamotte, Suzanne; Späth, Gerald F.; Rachidi, Najma; Prina, Eric",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of VEE complex alphaviruses by sequencing the genomes of 94 strains and performing phylogenetic analyses of 130 isolates using complete open reading frames for the nonstructural and structural polyproteins. Our analyses confirmed purifying selection as a major mechanism influencing the evolution of these viruses as well as a confounding factor in molecular clock dating of ancestors. Times to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) could be robustly estimated only for the more recently diverged subtypes; the tMRCA of the ID/IAB/IC/II and IE clades of VEE virus (VEEV) were estimated at ca. 149–973 years ago. Evolution of the IE subtype has been characterized by a significant evolutionary shift from the rest of the VEEV complex, with an increase in structural protein substitutions that are unique to this group, possibly reflecting adaptation to its unique enzootic mosquito vector Culex (Melanoconion) taeniopus. Our inferred tree topologies suggest that VEEV is maintained primarily in situ, with only occasional spread to neighboring countries, probably reflecting the limited mobility of rodent hosts and mosquito vectors.","Forrester, Naomi L.; Wertheim, Joel O.; Dugan, Vivian G.; Auguste, Albert J.; Lin, David; Adams, A.

However, vaccine-derived herd immunity may be short-lived due to interactions between human mobility and imperfect or waning vaccine efficacy. As the supply and utilization of oral cholera vaccines grows, critical questions related to herd immunity are emerging, including: who should be targeted; when should revaccination be performed; and why have cholera outbreaks occurred in recently vaccinated populations? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use mathematical models to simulate routine and mass oral cholera vaccination in populations with varying degrees of migration, transmission intensity, and vaccine coverage. We show that migration and waning vaccine efficacy strongly influence the duration of herd immunity while birth and death rates have relatively minimal impacts. As compared to either periodic mass vaccination or routine vaccination alone, a community could be protected longer by a blended “Mass and Maintain” strategy. We show that vaccination may be best targeted at populations with intermediate degrees of mobility as compared to communities with very high or very low population turnover. Using a case study of an internally displaced person camp in South Sudan which underwent high-coverage mass vaccination in 2014 and 2015, we show that waning vaccine direct effects and high population turnover rendered the camp over 80% susceptible at the time of the cholera outbreak beginning in October 2016. CONCLUSIONS: Oral cholera vaccines can be powerful tools for quickly protecting a population for a period of time that depends critically on vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy over time, and the rate of population turnover through human mobility. Due to waning herd immunity, epidemics in vaccinated communities are possible but become less likely through complementary interventions or data-driven revaccination strategies.","Peak, Corey M.; Reilly, Amanda L.; Azman, Andrew S.; Buckee, Caroline O.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,11

The subsequent humanitarian effort spurred extensive research, significantly enhancing our understanding of ebolavirus replication and pathogenicity. The main functions of each ebolavirus protein have been studied extensively since the discovery of the virus in 1976; however, the recent expansion of ebolavirus research has led to the discovery of new protein functions. These newly discovered roles are revealing new mechanisms of virus replication and pathogenicity, whilst enhancing our understanding of the broad functions of each ebolavirus viral protein (VP). Many of these new functions appear to be unrelated to the protein’s primary function during virus replication. Such new functions range from bystander T-lymphocyte death caused by VP40-secreted exosomes to new roles for VP24 in viral particle formation. This review highlights the newly discovered roles of ebolavirus proteins in order to provide a more encompassing view of ebolavirus replication and pathogenicity.","Cantoni, Diego; Rossman, Jeremy S.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

To evaluate the efficacy of these interventions, it will be critical to determine Wolbachia infection frequencies in Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. However, current diagnostic tools are not well-suited to fit this need. Morphological methods cannot identify Wolbachia, immunoassays often suffer from low sensitivity and poor throughput, while PCR and spectroscopy require complex instruments and technical expertise, which restrict their use to centralized laboratories. To address this unmet need, we have used loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes to create a one-pot sample-to-answer nucleic acid diagnostic platform for vector and symbiont surveillance. LAMP-OSD assays can directly amplify target nucleic acids from macerated mosquitoes without requiring nucleic acid purification and yield specific single endpoint yes/no fluorescence signals that are observable to eye or by cellphone camera. We demonstrate cellphone-imaged LAMP-OSD tests for two targets, the Aedes aegypti cytochrome oxidase I (coi) gene and the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) gene, and show a limit of detection of 4 and 40 target DNA copies, respectively. In a blinded test of 90 field-caught mosquitoes, the coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated 98% specificity and 97% sensitivity in identifying Ae. aegypti mosquitoes even after 3 weeks of storage without desiccant at 37°C. Similarly, the wsp LAMP-OSD assay readily identified the wAlbB Wolbachia strain in field-collected Aedes albopictus mosquitoes without generating any false positive signals. Modest technology requirements, minimal execution steps, simple binary readout, and robust accuracy make the LAMP-OSD-to-cellphone assay platform well suited for field vector surveillance in austere or resource-limited conditions.","Bhadra, Sanchita; Riedel, Timothy E.; Saldaña, Miguel A.; Hegde, Shivanand; Pederson, Nicole; Hughes, Grant L.; Ellington, Andrew D.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1
3417,3417,3417,Quantifying the value of surveillance data for improving model predictions of lymphatic filariasis elimination,7.995183,8.607124,2018-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Mathematical models are increasingly being used to evaluate strategies aiming to achieve the control or elimination of parasitic diseases. Recently, owing to growing realization that process-oriented models are useful for ecological forecasts only if the biological processes are well defined, attention has focused on data assimilation as a means to improve the predictive performance of these models. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We report on the development of an analytical framework to quantify the relative values of various longitudinal infection surveillance data collected in field sites undergoing mass drug administrations (MDAs) for calibrating three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and for improving their predictions of the required durations of drug interventions to achieve parasite elimination in endemic populations. The relative information contribution of site-specific data collected at the time points proposed by the WHO monitoring framework was evaluated using model-data updating procedures, and via calculations of the Shannon information index and weighted variances from the probability distributions of the estimated timelines to parasite extinction made by each model. Results show that data-informed models provided more precise forecasts of elimination timelines in each site compared to model-only simulations. Data streams that included year 5 post-MDA microfilariae (mf) survey data, however, reduced each model’s uncertainty most compared to data streams containing only baseline and/or post-MDA 3 or longer-term mf survey data irrespective of MDA coverage, suggesting that data up to this monitoring point may be optimal for informing the present LF models. We show that the improvements observed in the predictive performance of the best data-informed models may be a function of temporal changes in inter-parameter interactions. Such best data-informed models may also produce more accurate predictions of the durations of drug interventions required to achieve parasite elimination. SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge of relative information contributions of model only versus data-informed models is valuable for improving the usefulness of LF model predictions in management decision making, learning system dynamics, and for supporting the design of parasite monitoring programmes. The present results further pinpoint the crucial need for longitudinal infection surveillance data for enhancing the precision and accuracy of model predictions of the intervention durations required to achieve parasite elimination in an endemic location.","Michael, Edwin; Sharma, Swarnali; Smith, Morgan E.; Touloupou, Panayiota; Giardina, Federica; Prada, Joaquin M.; Stolk, Wilma A.; Hollingsworth, Deirdre; de Vlas, Sake J.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

During blood-feeding, sand fly females salivate into the skin of the host. Sand fly saliva contains a large variety of proteins, some of which elicit specific antibody responses in the bitten hosts. To evaluate the exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from disease endemic areas, we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers' sera against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins, were produced using either bacterial (five proteins) or mammalian (four proteins) expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Using these recombinant proteins, human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries endemic for visceral leishmaniasis, were screened by ELISA and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins; mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. Combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1 and mAG5 proved to be valid antigens for screening human sera from both Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The utilization of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P. orientalis antibody responses.","Sumova, Petra; Sima, Michal; Spitzova, Tatiana; Osman, Maha E.; Guimaraes-Costa, Anderson B.; Oliveira, Fabiano; Elnaiem, Dia-Eldin A.; Hailu, Asrat; Warburg, Alon; Valenzuela, Jesus G.; Volf, Petr",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,11

Small animal models that support the development of adult parasites have not been identified. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We hypothesized that highly immunodeficient NSG mice would support the survival and maturation of O. volvulus and alteration of the host microenvironment through the addition of various human cells and tissues would further enhance the level of parasite maturation. NSG mice were humanized with: (1) umbilical cord derived CD34(+) stem cells, (2) fetal derived liver, thymus and CD34(+) stem cells or (3) primary human skeletal muscle cells. NSG and humanized NSG mice were infected with 100 O. volvulus infective larvae (L3) for 4 to 12 weeks. When necropsies of infected animals were performed, it was observed that parasites survived and developed throughout the infection time course. In each of the different humanized mouse models, worms matured from L3 to advanced fourth stage larvae, with both male and female organ development. In addition, worms increased in length by up to 4-fold. Serum and urine, collected from humanized mice for identification of potential biomarkers of infection, allowed for the identification of 10 O. volvulus-derived proteins found specifically in either the urine or the serum of the humanized O. volvulus-infected NSG mice.

Recognizing the outbreak, concerted efforts were made to control viral spread, which included mosquito control, public announcement of the outbreak, and a total ban on entering the park. We sought to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics. Using dates of exposure and illness onset, we categorized cases into three groups according to the availability of these datasets. The infection process was parametrically modeled by generation, and convolution of the infection process and the incubation period was fitted to the data. By estimating the effective reproduction number, we determined that the effect of dengue risk communication together with mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was insufficiently large to lower the reproduction number to below 1. However, once Yoyogi Park was closed on 4 September, the value of the effective reproduction number began to fall below 1, and the associated relative reduction in the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 20%–60%. The mean incubation period was an estimated 5.8 days. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Regardless of the assumed number of generations of cases, the combined effect of mosquito control, risk communication, and park closure appeared to be successful in interrupting the chain of dengue transmission in Tokyo.","Yuan, Baoyin; Lee, Hyojung; Nishiura, Hiroshi",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,181,1

The differential metabolic pathways in calves with diarrhea were screened by metabolomics. There were nine biomarkers in the serum of healthy calves and calves with diarrhea. On the basis of these biomarkers, their associated mineral absorption, protein digestion and absorption, and other metabolic pathways, the targeted regulation of the metabolic differences of calves with diarrhea may contribute to the diagnosis, treatment, and discussion of the mechanism of calf diarrhea. ABSTRACT: The complex etiology, higher morbidity and mortality, poor prognosis, and expensive cost of calf diarrhea have made it a catastrophic disease in the dairy industry. This study aims to assess the biomarkers in calves with diarrhea and to predict the biomarkers related to the pathway. As subjects, nine calves with diarrhea and nine healthy calves were enrolled, according to strict enrollment criteria. The serum metabolites were detected by a liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and then analyzed by online multivariate statistical analysis software to further screen the biomarkers. In addition, the biomarkers involved in the metabolic pathways of calves with diarrhea and healthy calves were analyzed. In the serum of calves with diarrhea, nine biomarkers were found to which several biomarkers exhibited a certain relation. Moreover, these biomarkers were involved in important metabolic pathways, including protein digestion and absorption, ABC transporters, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, mineral absorption, and fatty acid biosynthesis. All these findings suggested that the imbalance of these markers was closely related to the occurrence and development of calf diarrhea. The targeted regulation of metabolic pathways involved in these biomarkers may facilitate the diagnosis, treatment, and discussion of the mechanism of calf diarrhea.","Huang, Mei-Zhou; Cui, Dong-An; Wu, Xiao-Hu; Hui, Wang; Yan, Zuo-Ting; Ding, Xue-Zhi; Wang, Sheng-Yi",Animals (Basel),181,1

Using whole-exome sequencing in a family with three cases of POI, we identified the candidate missense variant S167L in HSF2BP, an essential meiotic gene. Functional analysis of the HSF2BP-S167L variant in mouse showed that it behaves as a hypomorphic allele compared to a new loss-of-function (knock-out) mouse model. Hsf2bp(S167L/S167L) females show reduced fertility with smaller litter sizes. To obtain mechanistic insights, we identified C19ORF57/BRME1 as a strong interactor and stabilizer of HSF2BP and showed that the BRME1/HSF2BP protein complex co-immunoprecipitates with BRCA2, RAD51, RPA and PALB2. Meiocytes bearing the HSF2BP-S167L variant showed a strongly decreased staining of both HSF2BP and BRME1 at the recombination nodules and a reduced number of the foci formed by the recombinases RAD51/DMC1, thus leading to a lower frequency of crossovers.

Here, we geocoded the first peer-reviewed reports of 223 human RNA viruses. Using a boosted regression tree model, we matched these virus data with 33 explanatory factors related to natural virus distribution and research effort to predict the probability of virus discovery across the globe in 2010–2019. Stratified analyses by virus transmissibility and transmission mode were also performed. The historical discovery of human RNA viruses has been concentrated in eastern North America, Europe, central Africa, eastern Australia, and north-eastern South America. The virus discovery can be predicted by a combination of socio-economic, land use, climate, and biodiversity variables. Remarkably, vector-borne viruses and strictly zoonotic viruses are more associated with climate and biodiversity whereas non-vector-borne viruses and human transmissible viruses are more associated with GDP and urbanization. The areas with the highest predicted probability for 2010–2019 include three new regions including East and Southeast Asia, India, and Central America, which likely reflect both increasing surveillance and diversity of their virome.

Here, we demonstrated that the innate immune responses generated to three distinct ZIKV strains (all isolated from human serum) were significantly different and dependent on their passage history (in mosquito, monkey, or human cells). In addition, some of these phenotypic differences were reduced by a single additional cell culture passage, suggesting that viruses that have been passaged more than 3 times from the patient sample will no longer reflect natural phenotypes. Two of the ZIKV strains analyzed induced high levels of the IP-10 chemokine and IFNγ in human prostate epithelial and stromal mesenchymal stem cells. To further understand the importance of these innate responses on ZIKV replication, we measured the effects of IP-10 and its downstream receptor, CXCR3, on RNA and virus production in prostate cells. Treatment with IP-10, CXCR3 agonist, or CXCR3 antagonist significantly altered ZIKV viral gene expression, depending on their passage in cells of relevant hosts (mosquito or human). We detected differences in gene expression of two primary CXCR3 isoforms (CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B) on the two cell types, possibly explaining differences in viral output. Lastly, we examined the effects of IP-10, agonist, or antagonist on cell death and proliferation under physiologically relevant infection rates, and detected no significant differences. Although we did not measure protein expression directly, our results indicate that CXCR3 signaling may be a target for therapeutics, to ultimately stop sexual transmission of this virus.","Spencer Clinton, Jennifer L.; Tran, Linda L.; Vogt, Megan B.; Rowley, David R.; Kimata, Jason T.; Rico-Hesse, Rebecca",PLoS One,181,13

At the apical tip of the Drosophila testis, 8 to 10 germline stem cells (GSCs) surround the hub, a cluster of somatic cells that organize the stem-cell niche. We have previously shown that GSCs form microtubule-based nanotubes (MT-nanotubes) that project into the hub cells, serving as the platform for niche signal reception; this spatial arrangement ensures the reception of the niche signal specifically by stem cells but not by differentiating cells. The receptor Thickveins (Tkv) is expressed by GSCs and localizes to the surface of MT-nanotubes, where it receives the hub-derived ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp). The fate of Tkv receptor after engaging in signaling on the MT-nanotubes has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that the Tkv receptor is internalized into hub cells from the MT-nanotube surface and subsequently degraded in the hub cell lysosomes. Perturbation of MT-nanotube formation and Tkv internalization from MT-nanotubes into hub cells both resulted in an overabundance of Tkv protein in GSCs and hyperactivation of a downstream signal, suggesting that the MT-nanotubes also serve a second purpose to dampen the niche signaling. Together, our results demonstrate that MT-nanotubes play dual roles to ensure the short-range nature of niche signaling by (1) providing an exclusive interface for the niche ligand-receptor interaction; and (2) limiting the amount of stem cell receptors available for niche signal reception.","Ladyzhets, Sophia; Antel, Matthew; Simao, Taylor; Gasek, Nathan; Cowan, Ann E.; Inaba, Mayu",PLoS Biol,181,1

In adults, secondary HLH is mostly observed. HLH is often triggered by infections, malignancies or autoimmune disorders. However, HLH cases in association with immunotherapies have been described recently. HLH in critically ill patients is often difficult to differentiate from sepsis. Both conditions can also be present at the same time. Early diagnosis and timely initiation of an adequate immunosuppressive therapy are essential for the further course and the prognosis of HLH. Therefore, HLH should represent a differential diagnosis in critically ill patients with persistent fever and additional symptoms (e.g. enlarged spleen, neurologic symptoms) or laboratory parameters (e.g. hyperferritinemia, cytopenia, increased transaminases) compatible with HLH. The diagnosis of HLH is made using the HLH-2004 criteria. The probability of the presence of HLH can be calculated using the HScore. High-dose corticosteroids represent the cornerstone of HLH treatment. Etoposide, immunoglobulins, anakinra or other drugs are added depending on the trigger.

Recent research has increased our understanding of the role of substrate utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of sepsis-related organ dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to present this evidence as a coherent whole and to highlight future research directions. MAIN TEXT: Sepsis is characterized by systemic and organ-specific changes in metabolism. Alterations of oxygen consumption, increased levels of circulating substrates, impaired glucose and lipid oxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction are all associated with organ dysfunction and poor outcomes in both animal models and patients. The pathophysiological relevance of bioenergetics and metabolism in the specific examples of sepsis-related immunodeficiency, cerebral dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, acute kidney injury and diaphragmatic failure is also described. CONCLUSIONS: Recent understandings in substrate utilization and mitochondrial dysfunction may pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. These findings could help physicians to identify distinct subgroups of sepsis and to develop personalized treatment strategies. Implications for their use as bioenergetic targets to identify metabolism- and mitochondria-targeted treatments need to be evaluated in future studies.

The African nurse diaspora is a strategic stakeholder, contributor, and liaison to public health interventions, given their roots in the continent, their professional connections in the west, and their ability to build an extensive network of global partners. Using a descriptive qualitative approach that amplifies the voices of the Africa nurse diaspora, this study provides an insider view of the continent’s public health priorities and what roles the diaspora can play to improve health and population outcomes. Findings show that Africa’s high disease burden is generally preventable but compounded by enduring socioeconomic challenges.

19994,19994,19994,The impact of dengue illness on social distancing and caregiving behavior,7.805968,8.415543,2021-07-19,"BACKGROUND: The argasid tick Ornithodoros moubata is the main vector in mainland Africa of African swine fever virus and the spirochete Borrelia duttoni, which causes human relapsing fever. The elimination of populations of O. moubata would contribute to the prevention and control of these two serious diseases. Anti-tick vaccines are an eco-friendly and sustainable means of eliminating tick populations. Tick saliva forms part of the tick-host interface, and knowledge of its composition is key to the identification and selection of vaccine candidate antigens. The aim of the present work is to increase the body of data on the composition of the saliva proteome of adult O. moubata ticks, particularly of females, since in-depth knowledge of the O. moubata sialome will allow the identification and selection of novel salivary antigens as targets for tick vaccines. METHODS: We analysed samples of female and male saliva using two different mass spectrometry (MS) approaches: data-dependent acquisition liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC–MS/MS) and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra–MS (SWATH-MS). To maximise the number of proteins identified, a proteomics informed by transcriptomics analysis was applied using the O. moubata salivary transcriptomic dataset previously obtained by RNA-Seq. RESULTS: SWATH-MS proved to be superior to LC–MS/MS for the study of female saliva, since it identified 61.2% more proteins than the latter, the reproducibility of results was enhanced with its use, and it provided a quantitative picture of salivary components. In total, we identified 299 non-redundant proteins in the saliva of O. moubata, and quantified the expression of 165 of these in both male and female saliva, among which 13 were significantly overexpressed in females and 40 in males. These results indicate important quantitative differences in the saliva proteome between the sexes. CONCLUSIONS: This work expands our knowledge of the O. moubata sialome, particularly that of females, by increasing the number of identified novel salivary proteins, which have different functions at the tick–host feeding interface. This new knowledge taken together with information on the O. moubata sialotranscriptome will allow a more rational selection of salivary candidates as antigen targets for tick vaccine development.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is associated with reduced food insecurity, but benefit levels may be insufficient for beneficiaries to afford healthy foods. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether participation in SuperSNAP, a program that provides an additional $40 per month for the purchase of fruits and vegetables with no added sugar, sodium, or fat to SNAP beneficiaries, is associated with changes in food purchasing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal cohort study used data from transaction records of a large supermarket chain with approximately 500 stores located across North Carolina from October 2019 to April 2020. Participants were SNAP beneficiaries. EXPOSURE: SuperSNAP participation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly spending on all fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts (primary outcome); spending on less healthy food categories; and spending on sugar-sweetened beverages as 1 category of less healthy foods. Monthly data on purchases by SNAP beneficiaries before and during SuperSNAP participation were compared with data from SNAP beneficiaries not enrolled in the program who shopped at the same stores. Overlap weighting (a propensity score–based method) was used to account for confounding, and linear mixed-effects models were fitted with random effects to account for repeated measures and clustering by store. RESULTS: The study included 667 SuperSNAP participants and 33 246 SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP but shopped in the same stores; 436 SuperSNAP participants had preintervention data and were included in the main analysis. SuperSNAP participation was associated with increased monthly purchases of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes ($31.84; 95% CI, $31.27-$32.42; P < .001; 294.52 oz; 95% CI, 288.84-300.20 oz; P < .001). Only a small increase in spending on less healthy food categories compared with the SNAP beneficiaries who did not use SuperSNAP ($1.60; 95% CI, $0.67-$2.53; P < .001) was observed. As total spending increased, the proportion of total food and beverage spending on less healthy foods significantly decreased (difference, 4.51%; 95% CI, 4.27%-4.74%; P < .001). Monthly spending on sugar-sweetened beverages decreased (difference, $1.83; 95% CI, $1.30-$2.36; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, participation in SuperSNAP was associated with meaningful increases in healthy food purchasing. Subsequent studies should investigate whether healthy food incentive programs improve health outcomes.","Berkowitz, Seth A.; Curran, Neal; Hoeffler, Sam; Henderson, Richard; Price, Ashley; Ng, Shu Wen",JAMA Netw Open,181,17

There is no confirmed evidence about the mortality comparison between COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. We performed a systematic review and pooled analysis to provide precise estimates of the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer and other tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study systemically included and reviewed 13 studies on the characteristics of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer published up to November 1, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. We also compared the all-cause mortality rates in China and other regions as a secondary endpoint. The mortality rate was assessed with a fixed-effects model, which was used to derive the pooled mortality and 95 % conï¬dence interval (CI). RESULTS: Thirteen studies from different countries, involving 1,229 patients with both COVID-19 and cancer, were selected for the pooled analysis. A total of 343 deaths were recorded in this population: 86 for lung cancers and 257 for other tumors. The mortality rate varies from 18 % to 60 % for patients with lung cancer and COVID-19 and 10%-41% for other tumor patients with COVID-19. The overall meta-analysis did not show a significant mortality difference for the lung cancer and other tumor subgroups (OR = 1.47, 95 %CI = 0.98-2.20, p = 0.06, I2 = 23 %). Nevertheless, in regions other than China, the pooled mortality of lung cancer patients with COVID-19 was 42 %, which was significantly higher than that of other tumors (24 %) (OR = 2.73, 95 % CI = 1.54-4.86, p = 0.0006, I2 = 16 %). CONCLUSION: Appropriate and aggressive preventive measures should be implemented to reduce the risk of COVID-19 in patients with cancer and optimally manage those who contract the infection.","Lei, Haike; Yang, Yue; Zhou, Wei; Zhang, Mengyang; Shen, Yang; Tao, Dan; Wang, Lulu; Lei, Qianqian; Wang, Ying; Wu, Yongzhong",Lung cancer,181,17

However, little is known about the regulatory role of FTO in the expression of FASN and de novo lipogenesis through m6 A modification. In this study, we used FTO siRNA to explore the effects of FTO knockdown on hepatic lipogenesis and its underlying epigenetic mechanism in HepG2 cells. We found that knockdown of FTO increased m6 A levels in total RNA and enhanced the expression of YTH domain family member 2 (YTHDF2) which serves as the m6 A-binding protein. The de novo lipogenic enzymes and intracellular lipid content were significantly decreased under FTO knockdown. Mechanistically, knockdown of FTO dramatically enhanced m6 A levels in FASN mRNA, leading to the reduced expression of FASN mRNA through m6 A-mediated mRNA decay. The protein expressions of FASN along with acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) were further decreased, which inhibited de novo lipogenesis, thereby resulting in the deficiency of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells and the induction of cellular apoptosis. The results reveal that FTO regulates hepatic lipogenesis via FTO-dependent m6 A demethylation in FASN mRNA and indicate the critical role of FTO-mediated lipid metabolism in the survival of HepG2 cells. This study provides novel insights into a unique RNA epigenetic mechanism by which FTO mediates hepatic lipid accumulation through m6 A modification and indicates that FTO could be a potential target for obesity-related diseases and cancer.

We evaluated asthma-related emergency department (ED) and inpatient health care utilization by a county-specific Medicaid population, ages 2-18, during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared it to utilization from a 3-year average including 2017-2019. All-cause ED utilization and asthma medication fill rates were evaluated during the same timeframes. Relative to the 2017-2019 3-year average, cumulative asthma-related ED visits from January through June decreased by 45.8% (p = .03) and inpatient admission rates decreased by 50.5% (p = .03). The decline in asthma-related ED utilization was greater than the reduction of overall ED use during the same time period, suggesting that the decline involved factors specific to asthma and was not due solely to avoidance of health care facilities. Fill rates for asthma controller medications decreased during this time (p = .03) and quick relief medication fill rates had no significant change (p = .31). Multiple factors may have contributed to the decrease in acute asthma health care visits. Locally, decreased air pollution and viral exposures coincided with the ""Stay-at-home"" order in Ohio, and increased utilization of telehealth for assessment during exacerbations may have impacted outcomes. Identification of the cause of the decline in visit rates could spur new interventions to limit the need for ED and inpatient visits for asthma patients, leading to both economic and health-associated benefits.","Ulrich, Lisa; Macias, Charlie; George, Ashish; Bai, Shasha; Allen, Elizabeth",Pediatr. pulmonol,181,33

In response, the Canadian Association of Radiologists Resident & Fellow Section (CAR RFS) and Medical Student Network (MSN) developed and evaluated an online series for medical students to learn about Canadian radiology residency programs. METHODS: Medical students from any year of training were recruited through the MSN, local radiology interest groups, and social media to attend a 2-week online series of interactive sessions via Zoom with program representatives from Canadian radiology residency programs. A survey evaluating the online series, in particular its impact on residency and career planning, was administered to program representatives and students. RESULTS: Fifteen of Canada's 16 radiology residency programs participated in the online series. A total of 212 students attended at least one session and nearly half were participating in the Canadian Resident Matching Service (CaRMS) this year. The postsurvey revealed that 77% of students agreed that the online series helped prepare them for CaRMS and ranking programs. The online series also benefited pre-CaRMS students as significantly more students were considering radiology as a specialty on the postsurvey compared to the presurvey. Students and program representatives agreed that this series should be held in future years, regardless of whether health and travel restrictions are lifted. CONCLUSION: The CAR RFS and MSN hosted an online series for medical students to learn about radiology residency programs outside their home institution. Feedback was highly positive with important implications for the future CaRMS iterations for any specialty.","Linehan, Victoria; Katlariwala, Prayash; Chahal, Baljot S; Khatchikian, Aline D; Supersad, Alanna; Dobson, Jessica L",Acad. radiol,181,16

These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: We evaluated a previously published risk model (Novant model) to identify patients at risk for healthcare facility-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HCFO-CDI) at 2 hospitals within a large health system and compared its predictive value to that of a new model developed based on local findings. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study including adult patients admitted from July 1, 2016, to July 1, 2018. Patients with HCFO-CDI who received systemic antibiotics were included as cases and were matched 1 to 1 with controls (who received systemic antibiotics without developing HCFO-CDI). We extracted chart data on patient risk factors for CDI, including those identified in prior studies and those included in the Novant model. We applied the Novant model to our patient population to assess the model's utility and generated a local model using logistic regression-based prediction scores. A receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) score was determined for each model. RESULTS: We included 362 patients, with 161 controls and 161 cases. The Novant model had a ROC-AUC of 0.62 in our population. Our local model using risk factors identifiable at hospital admission included hospitalization within 90 days of admission (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-6.04), hematologic malignancy (adjusted OR, 12.87; 95% CI, 3.70-44.80), and solid tumor malignancy (adjusted OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 1.27-17.80) as HCFO-CDI predictors and had a ROC-AUC score of 0.74. CONCLUSION: The Novant model evaluating risk factors identifiable at admission poorly predicted HCFO-CDI in our population, while our local model was a fair predictor. These findings highlight the need for institutions to review local risk factors to adjust modeling for their patient population.","Tilton, Carrie S; Sexton, Marybeth; Johnson, Steven W; Gu, Chunhui; Chen, Zhengjia; Robichaux, Chad; Metzger, Nicole L",Am. j. health system pharm,181,16

Many reports indicated that inflammatory mediators might suppress the biological functions of some drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and therefore result in a transient mismatch between their genotype and phenotype expressions, a phenomenon which is called phenoconversion. The incidence might be clinically relevant to the COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. The patients are treated with multiple drugs that are prone to be altered pharmacokinetically by inflammation-mediated phenoconversion, leading to the modification of their effectiveness and safety. In this review, we discuss the regulation of inflammatory responses during COVID-19 infection and the evidence as well as potential mechanisms of inflammation- mediated phenoconversion.

Adipose tissue is generally linked to excessive body fat, and it is well known that the female breast is rich in adipose tissue. Hence, one can wonder: what is the role of adipose tissue in the breast and why is it required? Adipose tissue as an organ consists of adipocytes, an extracellular matrix (ECM) and immune cells, with a significant role in the dynamics of breast changes throughout the life span of a female breast from puberty, pregnancy, lactation and involution. In this review, we will discuss the importance of breast adipose tissue in breast development and its involvement in breast changes happening during pregnancy, lactation and involution. We will focus on understanding the biology of breast adipose tissue, with an overview on its involvement in the various steps of breast cancer development and progression. The interaction between the breast adipose tissue surrounding cancer cells and vice-versa modifies the tumor microenvironment in favor of cancer. Understanding this mutual interaction and the role of breast adipose tissue in the tumor microenvironment could potentially raise the possibility of overcoming breast adipose tissue mediated resistance to therapies and finding novel candidates to target breast cancer.","Kothari, Charu; Diorio, Caroline; Durocher, Francine",,181,24

To understand the impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.","Garcia-Beltran, Wilfredo F; Lam, Evan C; St Denis, Kerri; Nitido, Adam D; Garcia, Zeidy H; Hauser, Blake M; Feldman, Jared; Pavlovic, Maia N; Gregory, David J; Poznansky, Mark C; Sigal, Alex; Schmidt, Aaron G; Iafrate, A John; Naranbhai, Vivek; Balazs, Alejandro B",Cell,181,19

Based on a case study of skeleton-based human interactions, we propose a novel adversarial attack on interactions, and demonstrate how DNN-based interaction models can be tricked to predict the participants' reactions in unexpected ways.

Till date, no completely effective drug or vaccine is available to cure COVID-19. Therefore, an effective vaccine against SARS-COV-2 is crucially needed. This study was conducted to design an effective multiepitope based vaccine (MEV) against SARS-COV-2. Seven highly antigenic proteins of SARS-COV-2 were selected as targets and different epitopes (B-cell and T-cell) were predicted. Highly antigenic and overlapping epitopes were shortlisted. Selected epitopes indicated significant interactions with the HLA-binding alleles and 99.93% coverage of the world's population. Hence, 505 amino acids long MEV was designed by connecting 16 MHC class I and eleven MHC class II epitopes with suitable linkers and adjuvant. MEV construct was non-allergenic, antigenic, stable and flexible. Furthermore, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analyses, demonstrated a stable and strong binding affinity of MEV with human pathogenic toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR3 and TLR8. Finally, MEV codons were optimized for its in silico cloning into Escherichia coli K-12 system, to ensure its increased expression. Designed MEV in present study could be a potential candidate for further vaccine production process against COVID-19. However, to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile, the proposed MEV needs to be experimentally validated.","Tahir Ul Qamar, Muhammad; Rehman, Abdur; Tusleem, Kishver; Ashfaq, Usman Ali; Qasim, Muhammad; Zhu, Xitong; Fatima, Israr; Shahid, Farah; Chen, Ling-Ling",PLoS One,181,29

RESULTS: The VMSCC was established in March 2013 in Kaiser Permanente Northern California with consistent participation of the Departments of Musculoskeletal Oncology (orthopedic oncology), Musculoskeletal Radiology, Pathology, Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Nuclear Medicine, Surgical Oncology, and Genetics. Pediatric Oncology participated ad hoc when pediatric sarcoma cases were presented. Referrals were from multiple specialties and regions, including the Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic and Hawaii regions. From March 2013 to December 2019, 1,585 cases were reviewed encompassing 36 histologic types. More than 300 cases were reviewed per year from 2017 to 2019.

It has affected dermatology practice to a great extent. Since most of the consultations (except emergencies) in dermatology are deferred as a precautionary measure, dermatologists have taken the route of virtual appointments in order to continue treating patients in the present lockdown state. However, the concept of telemedicine is quite new for doctors as well as for patients in India. Material and Methods: An online questionnaire was circulated among Indian dermatologists which included participant demographics, changes in their practice and teaching during COVID-19, use of virtual or e-health technologies, and attitudes/opinions on their experiences. We also wanted to understand doctor perspectives on their own roles, wellness, and hospital responses to the pandemic. Results: A total of 260 responses from qualified dermatologists of different parts of India were received between 1st and 8th April 2020 and were analyzed. Two-thirds of the respondents were within 10 years of starting practice. Virtual consultations have increased by almost three-fold during the pandemic, which is a major change noticed in the practice when we compare before and during the pandemic. Earlier the focus of teledermatology (TD) was mainly for follow-up care (85%), whereas during the pandemic, both new and follow-up patients were provided virtual consultations. The number of patients coming to them for a consultation has drastically reduced. Only 2% of the responders are still performing minor procedures with proper care. Almost two-thirds do not have systems in place to train their residents and fellows due to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. The rest of them have started to take the virtual route of teaching through webinars, virtual rounds, and providing access to online journals to continue their teaching. Only 18.6% of dermatologists at work were provided with personal protective equipment. TD has opened new doors to virtual consultation and it was evident that 54.4% of doctors are willing to continue it in the future even after the pandemic is over. Conclusion: TD platforms hold great promise to improve access to high-quality dermatologic care in the future. Results from this survey of Indian dermatologists suggest that TD is the future of dermatology as it will be accessed by patients in remote areas and it is a cost-effective move for the patients.","Bhargava, Shashank; Sarkar, Rashmi",Indian Dermatol Online J,181,1

One side recognizes the microbial antigen, and the other gives a call to arms to fight infection by recruiting immune cells and triggering inflammation. A balanced immune response must combine a potent neutralizing antibody and a swift disposal of the invading agent by innate immune cells with the least tissue damage possible. The longer the immune system takes to control the infection, the higher the possibility for a self-sustaining inflammatory process with potentially fatal consequences for the host. In addition to quantity, the quality of antibodies also matters, because posttranslational modifications altering the N-glycan composition in Fc fractions may help tilt the balance to the effector side, by modifying their affinity for Fc receptors in immune cells. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a wealth of data bolstering our understanding of the rules governing the production of protective and nonprotective antibodies. Also, it has broadened our understanding of the role of viruses in triggering autoimmunity and inflammation, and widened our knowledge of the different mechanisms that can be activated by viral infection and lead to autoantibody production, inflammation, and progressive tissue damage. In addition, the COVID-19 infection has contributed a great deal to our comprehension of the role of antibodies in the causation of cytokine storms and systemic inflammatory response syndrome, also seen in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.","Rodriguez, Martin A; Fuentes-Silva, Yurilis J; Vásquez, Gloria",J. clin. rheumatol,181,26

Reducing the proportion of young adults who get sunburned may reduce the incidence of melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer. Advances in technology have enabled the delivery of real-time UV light exposure and content-relevant health interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the feasibility of young adults performing the following tasks daily: wearing a UV dosimeter, receiving text messages and real-time UV-B doses on their smartphone, and responding to daily web-based surveys about sunburn and sun protection. METHODS: Young adults aged 18-39 years (n=42) were recruited in the United States in June 2020 via social media. Participants received the UV Guard sun protection system, which consisted of a UV dosimeter and a smartphone app. During 3 consecutive periods, intervention intensity increased as follows: real-time UV-B dose; UV-B dose and daily behavioral facilitation text messages; and UV-B dose, goal setting, and daily text messages to support self-efficacy and self-regulation. Data were self-reported through daily web-based surveys for 28 days, and UV-B doses were transmitted to cloud-based storage. RESULTS: Patients' median age was 22 years (IQR 20, 29), and all patients had sun-sensitive skin. Sunburns were experienced during the study by fewer subjects (n=18) than those in the preceding 28 days (n=30). In July and August, the face was the most commonly sunburned area among 13 body locations; 52% (22/42) of sunburns occurred before the study and 45% (19/42) occurred during the study. The mean daily UV-B dose decreased during the 3 periods; however, this was not statistically significant. Young adults were most often exercising outdoors from 2 to 6 PM, walking from 10 AM to 6 PM, and relaxing from noon to 2 PM. Sunburn was most often experienced during exercise (odds ratio [OR] 5.65, 95% CI 1.60-6.10) and relaxation (OR 3.69, 95% CI 1.03-4.67) relative to those that did not exercise or relax in each category. The self-reported exit survey indicated that participants felt that they spent less time outdoors this summer compared to the last summer because of the COVID-19 pandemic and work. In addition, 38% (16/42) of the participants changed their use of sun protection based on their app-reported UV exposure, and 48% (20/42) shifted the time they went outside to periods with less-intense UV exposure. A total of 79% (33/42) of the participants were willing to continue using the UV Guard system outside of a research setting. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept research, young adults demonstrated that they used the UV Guard system; however, optimization was needed. Although some sun protection behaviors changed, sunburn was not prevented in all participants, especially during outdoor exercise.

Existing research has indicated that these steep drops in accrual rates to cancer clinical trials may be disproportionately affecting women. We sought to determine if there were gender differences in a dataset collected to examine participants' concerns about taking part in cancer research during the pandemic. METHODS: Between 5-19 June 2020, we distributed a fully anonymized survey via social media. We contacted 85 UK cancer patient organizations/charities and asked them to share our questionnaire on their platforms, of which 26 obliged. Patients aged 18 with a cancer diagnosis were eligible to participate and asked about their clinical and demographic characteristics, concerns about research participation given the COVID-19 pandemic, anxiety levels measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, amongst other questions. Anxiety levels and concerns about participating were compared between men and women using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: 93 individuals, comprising n = 37 women and n = 56 men of various cancer types, provided survey responses. Independent t-tests showed that women reported higher anxiety scores, and concerns about participating in cancer research during COVID-19, than men. Linear regression analyses showed that anxiety scores predicted concerns about research participation in women but not men (pinteraction = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients have concerns about participating in research during the COVID-19 pandemic that range from mild to serious. Furthermore, the relationship between general anxiety and concerns about research participation may be both more relevant and more pronounced in women than in men. Future work should examine the reasons why women are less likely to enrol in cancer trials during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Fox, Louis; Wylie, Harriet; Cahill, Fee; Haire, Anna; Green, Saran; Kibaru, Joyce; Hartley, Catherine; Sullivan, Richard; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",Cancer Control,181,1

Findings show a reduced level of emotional well-being in the German population during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, those individuals who stopped or considerably reduced their sport and exercise activities during the pandemic report a significant decline of well-being compared to the time before the pandemic. Individuals, who reduced sport and exercise due to external constraints, reported the largest decline in well-being. In contrast, the small group of individuals who intensified their sporting activities during the pandemic stands out with the most positive well-being levels.

Multiple organ damage can occur rapidly in patients infected with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers were not within the normal ranges in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to summarize laboratory parameters and the tumor markers in COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 53 women between the ages of 19-85 years infected with COVID-19 at a training and research hospital between May 2020 and August 2020. RESULTS: Of the 53 women, 16 (30.2%) had leukopenia. The mean C-reactive protein level was 18.42±59.33 mg/L. The mean procalcitonin level was 0.1±0.21 µg/L. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The mean creatinine level was 0.58±0.37 mg/dl.

Prenatal care (PNC) providing institutes should identify the needs and demands of pregnant women by optimizing the means of PNC services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to: a) explain prenatal care experiences; b) assess the factors affecting self-care, and c) present a prenatal care guideline and Strategies to improve the PNC. METHODS: This mixed-methods study with a sequential explanatory design consists of three phases. The first phase is a qualitative study exploring the prenatal care experiences among pregnant women. In this phase, the subjects will be selected through purposive sampling; moreover, in-depth individual interviewing will be used for data collection. Finally, the conventional content analysis approach will be employed for data analysis. The second phase is quantitative and will be used as a cross-sectional approach for assessing the association between psychological factors of self-care. In this regard, a multistage cluster sampling method will be used to select 215 subjects who will be visited in health care centers of Tabriz, Iran. The third phase will be focusing on developing a prenatal care guideline and Strategies, using the qualitative and quantitative results of the previous phases, a review of the related literature, and the nominal group technique will be performed among experts. DISCUSSION: The present research is the first study to investigate the prenatal care experiences and factors influencing self-care among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic. For the purposes of the study, a mixed-methods approach will be used which aims to develop strategies for improving health care services. It is hoped that the strategy proposed in the current study could lead to improvements in this regard.

These range from mild and self-limiting disease to progressive, life-threatening illness. Acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses are classified into malaria and non-malarial illnesses on the basis of microscopy or malaria-diagnostic tests. Various challenges, such as comorbidities, geriatrics, pregnancy, and immune-compromised profile of the patient, impede the treatment regimen. Identifying the root cause of undifferentiated fever becomes critical and involves correct diagnostic tests along with empirical treatment initiation. Doxycycline, being a broad-spectrum antibiotic, confers activity against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and “atypical” bacteria. Apart from antimicrobial activity, Doxycycline demonstrates the potential to inhibit dengue virus replication and exhibits anti-inflammatory activity by down-regulating proinflammatory cytokine levels. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, the clinical management of associated cytokine storm remains unanswered.

This has in-turn led to understaffed hospitals unable to handle new patient influx. To help alleviate these problems, we design and develop a contactless patient positioning system that can enable scanning patients in a completely remote and contactless fashion. Our key design objective is to reduce the physical contact time with a patient as much as possible, which we achieve with our contactless workflow. Our system comprises automated calibration, positioning, and multi-view synthesis components that enable patient scan without physical proximity. Our calibration routine ensures system calibration at all times and can be executed without any manual intervention. Our patient positioning routine comprises a novel robust dynamic fusion (RDF) algorithm for accurate 3D patient body modeling. With its multi-modal inference capability, RDF can be trained once and used across different applications (without re-training) having various sensor choices, a key feature to enable system deployment at scale. Our multi-view synthesizer ensures multi-view positioning visualization for the technician to verify positioning accuracy prior to initiating the patient scan. We conduct extensive experiments with publicly available and proprietary datasets to demonstrate efficacy. Our system has already been used, and had a positive impact on, hospitals and technicians on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to see its use increase substantially globally.","Karanam, Srikrishna; Li, Ren; Yang, Fan; Hu, Wei; Chen, Terrence; Wu, Ziyan",IEEE. trans. med. imaging,181,20

These treatments also involve Early Childhood Caries (ECC) due to the fact that this disease affects preschool children (a vulnerable population) and, in addition, shows a propensity to evolve into more serious complications (dental pain, infections). A narrative review was carried out to support a protocol for treating ECC with efficacious and safe (in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission) procedures. Protocol involves criteria for patients' selection remotely (telemedicine), and well-detailed criteria/equipment and hygiene procedures to combat against SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Moreover, the protocol proposes innovative caries treatments, named Minimally Invasive Treatments (MITs), well known in pedodontics for their high level of children's acceptance during dental care. MITs allow for caries removal (particularly in primary teeth) without any high-speed rotating instrument cooled with nebulized air-water spray (with high risk of virus environmental diffusion), usually adopted during traditional treatments. For evaluating MITs effectiveness in caries management, only Systematic Review and Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were included in our study, without any risk of bias assessment. The indications proposed in this protocol could support clinicians for the temporary management of ECC until the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ends.","Cianetti, Stefano; Pagano, Stefano; Nardone, Michele; Lombardo, Guido",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),181,24

In addition, to assess the impact of smell loss on psychological well-being and distress, and to assess coping strategies used by COVID-19 patients with smell loss. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study. A total of 487 COVID-19 positive patients with anosmia were recruited. All participants filled in the validated Multi-Clinic Smell and Taste Questionnaire, and the validated General Well-being Schedule. RESULTS: Negative impacts of smell loss, associated risks, interference with daily activities, and deterioration in well-being were common. The importance of the sense of smell was evaluated (In relation to other senses) as higher in the period after the loss than before the loss (p < 0.001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The qualitative study was undertaken in a tertiary referral intensive care unit in Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom. Drawing upon patient case studies of decisions about non escalation and/or withdrawal of life support, we undertook indepth interviews with senior and junior physicians. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and narratively analysed. RESULTS: Eighteen senior and junior physicians involved in 21 patient case studies were interviewed. Analysis determined two predominant themes: key moral distress triggers; and strategies and consequences. Junior residents reported most instances of moral distress, triggered by perceived futility, lack of continuity, protracted decisions and failure to ensure 'good death'. Senior physicians' triggers included constraint of clinical autonomy. Moral distress was far reaching, affecting personal life, working relationships and career choice. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to explore physicians' moral distress in end-of-life decisions in intensive care via a narrative inquiry approach using case studies. Results have implications for the education, recruitment and retention of physicians, relevant in the Covid 19 pandemic.","St Ledger, Una; Reid, Joanne; Begley, Ann; Dodek, Peter; McAuley, Daniel F; Prior, Lindsay; Blackwood, Bronagh",J Crit Care,181,1

Due to unavailability of specific drugs, early detection of (COVID-19) patients is essential for disease cure and control. There is a vital need to detect the disease at early stage and instantly quarantine the infected people. Many research have been going on, however, none of them introduces satisfactory results yet. In spite of its simplicity, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has proven high flexibility in complex classification problems. However, it can be easily trapped. In this paper, a new COVID-19 diagnose strategy is introduced, which is called COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS). The novelty of CPDS is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new hybrid feature selection Methodology (HFSM), which elects the most informative features from those extracted from chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 peoples. HFSM is a hybrid methodology as it combines evidence from both wrapper and filter feature selection methods. It consists of two stages, namely; Fast Selection Stage (FS(2)) and Accurate Selection Stage (AS(2)). FS(2)relies on filter, while AS(2) uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a wrapper method. As a hybrid methodology, HFSM elects the significant features for the next detection phase. The second contribution is an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN) classifier, which avoids the trapping problem of the traditional KNN by adding solid heuristics in choosing the neighbors of the tested item. EKNN depends on measuring the degree of both closeness and strength of each neighbor of the tested item, then elects only the qualified neighbors for classification. Accordingly, EKNN can accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on those significant features selected by HFSM technique. Extensive experiments have been done considering the proposed detection strategy as well as recent competitive techniques on the chest CT images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed detection strategy outperforms recent techniques as it introduces the maximum accuracy rate.","Shaban, Warda M.; Rabie, Asmaa H.; Saleh, Ahmed I.; Abo-Elsoud, M.A.",Knowl Based Syst,181,3

Recently, mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, made severe chaos in India during the second wave (between April and June 2021) of the tragical COVID-19 epidemic by its sudden and devastating surge with up to 50% mortality rate. While the exact cause of its sharp rise suddenly and specifically during the second wave still remains debatable, it has been noted that the people who are diabetic and have recovered from COVID-19 infection are more predisposed to mucormycosis. Nevertheless, the precise reason and mechanism(s) underlying the surge of this deadly infection needs to be investigated to comprehend its pathogenesis and pathological elements and discover rationale preventative/ therapeutic solutions. It is speculated that the indiscriminate use of steroids, antibiotics and zinc as a self-medication practice that increased during the COVID-19 epidemic may have promoted the dysbiosis of gut microbiota thereby inducing immune-suppression and making the risk group highly susceptible to this mycotic disease. In these contexts, this timely article attempts to contemplate and discuss some of the possible factors and potential mechanisms that can help to understand and explain the conundrum of sudden, steep and deadly upsurge of mucormycosis infections during the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic.","Kumar, Manoj; Sarma, Devojit Kumar; Shubham, Swasti; Kumawat, Manoj; Verma, Vinod; Singh, Birbal; Nagpal, Ravinder; Tiwari, RR",Curr Res Microb Sci,181,14

The damage it causes to the nervous system is manifold. The main neurological manifestation is anosmia. Olfactory damage is often transient, but there are no data reflecting an observational period of several months. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the trend of anosmia in patients affected by coronavirus disease 2019 in the eight months following diagnosis. METHODS: Fifty-five subjects who presented with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 and who developed anosmia, between the end of February and the beginning of March 2020, were investigated. The patients were interviewed after eight months to determine functional recovery and assess the degree of recovery. RESULTS: Ninety-one per cent of the population reported olfactory recovery and, of these, 53 per cent had total recovery after eight months. Females and younger age groups seem slightly advantaged in functional recovery. The elderly population appears to have excellent prospects for full functional recovery. CONCLUSION: Anosmia represents a frequent neurological manifestation during coronavirus disease 2019. Fortunately, it is transient in most cases, and only a small percentage of patients affected by it report long-term functional deficits.","Capelli, M; Gatti, P",The Journal of laryngology and otology,181,1

Real-time technology and the ability to perform multiplex testing have facilitated this emergence. Commercial platforms for nucleic acid amplification testing of respiratory viruses include real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Multiplex PCR with fluidic microarrays or DNA chips are the most recent diagnostic advance. These assays offer significant advantages in sensitivity over antigen detection methods and in most cases also over traditional culture methods.

A significant number of elderly patients require hospitalization and develop serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the preliminary impact (8 weeks) of CoVID-19, focusing on proximal femur fractures, analyzing data and results compared to the same period of 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 22(nd) to April 18(th), 2020 we surgically treated 121 proximal femur fractures (61 in Piacenza; 60 in Parma, 16 male, 44 female, mean age 81.1). In the same period of 2019, we treated 169 proximal femur fractures (90 in Piacenza, 33 male, 57 female, mean age 81.9; 79 in Parma, 29 males, 50 female, mean age 80.2). We had 21/61 (34.4%) patients resulted positive for COVID-19 and 11/61 in Parma (18.3%), based on nasal-pharyngeal swab, chest CT scan and/or lung US findings. RESULTS: The incidence of proximal femur fractures had a significant reduction during CoVID-19 spread in Piacenza and Parma. Authors have noticed an elevated number of deaths within 21 days after surgery. Piacenza: 4 cases in 2019 (4.4%) and 11 in 2020 (18.0%), of which 9 cases CoVID positive. In Parma in 2019 two deaths were encountered; in 2020 6 patients died and 5 cases were CoVID positive. CONCLUSION: In the first two months of the Italian epidemic, in the cities of Piacenza and Parma over 80% of deaths have occurred in patients over 70 years old.

We found that Johnson cumulative density functions (CDFs) were extremely well fitted to the data (R(2) > 0.99) and that Johnson CDFs were much better fitted to the tails of the data than either the commonly used normal or lognormal CDFs. Fitted Johnson CDFs can be used to obtain basic parameters of the infection wave, such as the percentage of the population infected during an infection wave, the days of the start, peak and end of the infection wave, and the duration of the wave’s increase and decrease. These parameters can be easily interpreted biologically and used both for describing infection wave dynamics and in further statistical analysis. The usefulness of the parameters obtained was analysed with respect to the relation between the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the population density, the percentage of the population infected during an infection wave, the starting day and the duration of the infection wave in the 80 countries. We found that all the above parameters were significantly associated with GDP per capita, but only the percentage of the population infected was significantly associated with population density. If used with caution, this method has a limited ability to predict the future trajectory and parameters of an ongoing infection wave.","Ćmiel, Adam M.; Ćmiel, Bogdan",Sci Rep,181,29

Chronic inflammation allows the host to recover or adapt through cellular and humoral responses, whereas acute inflammation leads to cytokine storms resulting in tissue damage. In this review, we present the overlapping outcomes of cancer inflammation with virus-induced inflammation. The study emphasises how anti-inflammatory drugs that work against cancer inflammation may work against the inflammation caused by the viral infection. It is established that the cytokine storm induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to disease-associated mortality. While cancer remains the second among the diseases associated with mortality worldwide, cancer patients' mortality rates are often observed upon extended periods after illness, usually ranging from months to years. However, the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 disease are robust. The cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be responsible for the multi-organ failure and increased mortality rates. Since both cancer and COVID-19 disease share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, repurposing some anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 may lower mortality rates. Here, we review some of these inflammatory mechanisms and propose some potential chemotherapeutic agents to intervene in them. We also discuss the repercussions of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine with zinc or antiviral drugs such as ivermectin and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm. In this review, we emphasise on various possibilities to reduce SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm.","Amere Subbarao, Sreedhar",Inflammopharmacology,181,2

Thus, there is always a risk of antimicrobial agent accumulation in food sources that originate from agricultural production. METHODS: In the present study, we collected data from published articles between January, 2013 and December, 2019 on antimicrobial residues in human food sources such as meat, milk, eggs, and fishes. RESULTS: Liver contained the highest percentage of antimicrobial residues (74%; 95% CI: 59.66–85.37) against the invitro enteric pathogen Escherichia coli in layer chickens. Similar results were demonstrated in liver (68%; 95% CI: 53.30–80.48) and kidney (66%, 95% CI: 51.23–78.79) of layer chickens against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis. Amongst all antibiotics, the highest concentrations of ciprofloxacin were detected in kidney (48.57%; 95% CI: 31.38–66.01), followed by liver (47.56; 95% CI: 40.88–54.30) of broiler chickens. Ciprofloxacin was also present in liver (46.15%; 95% CI: 33.70–58.96) of layer chickens. The percentage of ciprofloxacin in thigh and breast meat in broiler bird were 41.54% (95% CI: 34.54–48.79) and 37.95% (95% CI: 31.11–45.15) respectively. Enrofloxacin was the second most dominant antimicrobial agent and was present in the liver of both types of poultry (Broiler and Layer chickens: 41.54%; 95% CI: 29.44–54.4 and 437.33%; 95% CI: 30.99–44.01). The prevalence rates of enrofloxacin in thigh and breast meat of broiler chickens were 24.10% (95% CI: 18.28–30.73) and 20.51% (95% CI: 15.08–26.87), respectively. Tetracycline, a commonly used antibiotic in livestock, was present in the liver (49.23%; 95% CI: 36.60–61.93) of layer chickens. In case of aquaculture food products, the highest amount of amoxicillin (683.2 mg/kg) was detected in Tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus), followed by 584.4 mg/kg in climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) and 555.6 mg/kg in Rui fish (Labeo rohita). Among the five types of fishes, Rui fish (0.000515 mg/kg) contained the highest concentrations of chloramphenicol antibiotic residues. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of antimicrobial residues in meat, milk, egg, and fish is a serious public health threat due to the potential induction of antimicrobial resistance. It can negatively impact the food supply chain, especially with the current strain that it is already facing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of the present study highlight the ongoing risk of residual antimicrobial agents in food of animal origin in Bangladesh and countries with similar practices. This can draw the attention of public health officials to propose plans to mitigate or stop this practice.","Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; El Zowalaty, Mohamed E.; Lundkvist, Åke; Järhult, Josef D.; Khan Nayem, Md Raihan; Tanzin, Abu Zubayer; Badsha, Md Rahim; Khan, Shahneaz Ali; Ashour, Hossam M.",Trends Food Sci Technol,181,16

Addressing the complex web of interrelated factors leading to zoonotic disease emergence and spread requires a transdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach, One Health. The One Health approach, which considers the linkages between the health of people, animals, and their shared environment, presents opportunities to reduce these impacts through a more holistic coordinated strategy to understanding and mitigating disease risks. Understanding the linkages between animal, human, and environmental health risks and outcomes is critical for developing early detection systems and risk reduction strategies to address known and novel zoonotic disease threats. Nearly 70 countries across the world, including Ghana, have signed on to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which is facilitating multisectoral approaches to strengthen country capacities in the prevention and early detection of and respond to infectious disease threats. Currently, Ghana has not yet formalized a national One Health policy. The lack of a clearly defined multisectoral platform and limited collaboration among key Ghanaian Ministries, Departments, and Agencies has impacted the country's ability to effectively mitigate and respond to emerging and reemerging zoonoses. Many of these emerging zoonoses are caused by viruses, which, because of their diversity and evolutionary properties, are perceived to pose the greatest threat to global health security. Here, we review viral zoonoses of national importance and priority in Ghana, highlight recent advancements in One Health capacities, and discuss opportunities for implementing One Health approaches to mitigate zoonotic disease threats.","Suu-Ire, Richard D.; Obodai, Evangeline; Bonney, J.

Since SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences show similarity with those of SARS, we sought to analyze all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes based on the insights obtained from SARS genome specifically focusing on non-coding RNAs. Here, results are presented from the dual approach i.e identifying host encoded miRNAs that might regulate viral pathogenesis as well as identifying viral encoded miRNAs that might regulate host cell signaling pathways and aid in viral pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing first approach resulted in the identification of 10 host encoded miRNAs that could target the genome of both the viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome). Interestingly our analysis revealed that there is significantly higher number of host miRNAs that could target SARS-CoV-2 genome as compared to the SARS reference genome. Results from second approach involving SARS-CoV-2 and SARS reference genome identified a set of virus encoded miRNAs which might regulate host signaling pathways. Our analysis further identified a similar “GA” rich motif in SARS-CoV-2 genome that was shown to play a vital role in lung pathogenesis during severe SARS infections. Hence, we successfully identified human and virus encoded miRNAs that might regulate pathogenesis of both these coronaviruses and the fact that more number of host miRNAs could target SARS-CoV-2 genomes possibly reveal as to why this virus follows mild pathogenesis in healthy individuals. We identified non-coding sequences in SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were earlier reported to contribute towards SARS pathology. The study provides insights into the overlapping sequences among these viruses for their effective inhibition as well as identifying new drug targets that could be used for development of new antivirals.","Periwal, Neha; Sarma, Sankritya; Arora, Pooja; Sood, Vikas",bioRxiv,181,10

This cross-sectional study investigated whether people’s willingness and motivation to get vaccinated relate to their psychological needs (autonomy, competence and relatedness), and how vaccine passports might affect these needs. Across two countries and 1358 participants, we found that need frustration—particularly autonomy frustration—was associated with lower willingness to get vaccinated and with a shift from self-determined to external motivation. In Israel (a country with vaccine passports), people reported greater autonomy frustration than in the UK (a country without vaccine passports). Our findings suggest that control measures, such as domestic vaccine passports, may have detrimental effects on people’s autonomy, motivation, and willingness to get vaccinated. Policies should strive to achieve a highly vaccinated population by supporting individuals’ autonomous motivation to get vaccinated and using messages of autonomy and relatedness, rather than applying pressure and external controls.","Porat, Talya; Burnell, Ryan; Calvo, Rafael A.; Ford, Elizabeth; Paudyal, Priya; Baxter, Weston L.; Parush, Avi",Vaccines (Basel),181,1

The crystal structures of ADP-Ribose or AMP and NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus were also released, recently. This study compared their binding sites and suggests the crystal structure of NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus as an alternative binding site of AMP or ADP-ribose to treat COVID-19. We virtually screened 682 FDA-approved compounds, and the top 10 compounds were selected by analysis of docking scores, (G-score, D-score, and Chemscore) and visual analysis using a structure-based docking approach of NSP3 of SARS CoV-2 virus. All immunization approaches are based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. A recent study reported that the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein reduces S1 shedding and increases infectivity of SARS COV-2 virus. Therefore, if there is a severe change in the spike protein of a modified Coronavirus, all developed vaccines can lose their efficacy, necessitating the need for an alternative treatment method. The top 10 compounds (FDA-approved) in this study are selected based on NSP 3 binding site, and therefore are a potential viable treatment because they will show potential activity for all mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein.","Jung, Lindsey S; Gund, Tamara M; Narayan, Mahesh",Protein J,181,33

While many factors affect disease incidence at a local level, making it more or less homogeneous with respect to other areas, the importance of multi-seeding has often been overlooked. Multi-seeding occurs when several independent (non-clustered) infected individuals arrive at a susceptible population. This can lead to independent outbreaks that spark from distinct areas of the local contact (social) network. Such mechanism has the potential to boost incidence, making control efforts and contact tracing less effective. Here, through a modeling approach we show that the effect produced by the number of initial infections is non-linear on the incidence peak and peak time. When case importations are carried by mobility from an already infected area, this effect is further enhanced by the local demography and underlying mixing patterns: the impact of every seed is larger in smaller populations. Finally, both in the model simulations and the analysis, we show that a multi-seeding effect combined with mobility restrictions can explain the observed spatial heterogeneities in the first wave of COVID-19 incidence and mortality in five European countries. Our results allow us for identifying what we have called epidemic epicenter: an area that shapes incidence and mortality peaks in the entire country. The present work further clarifies the nonlinear effects that mobility can have on the evolution of an epidemic and highlight their relevance for epidemic control.","Mazzoli, Mattia; Pepe, Emanuele; Mateo, David; Cattuto, Ciro; Gauvin, Laetitia; Bajardi, Paolo; Tizzoni, Michele; Hernando, Alberto; Meloni, Sandro; Ramasco, José J.",PLoS Comput Biol,181,8

IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which carries the novel receptor binding domain (RBD), is absent or at low levels in unexposed individuals. To better understand the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we asked whether virus-reactive memory B cells (MBCs) were present in unexposed subjects and whether MBC generation accompanied virus-specific IgG production in infected subjects. We analyzed sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthy donors and COVID-19 convalescent subjects. Serum IgG levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (S, including the RBD and S2 subunit, and nucleocapsid [N]) and non-SARS-CoV-2 proteins were related to measurements of circulating IgG MBC levels. Anti-RBD IgG was absent in unexposed subjects. Most unexposed subjects had anti-S2 IgG, and a minority had anti-N IgG, but IgG MBCs with these specificities were not detected, perhaps reflecting low frequencies. Convalescent subjects had high levels of IgG against the RBD, S2, and N, together with large populations of RBD- and S2-reactive IgG MBCs. Notably, IgG titers against the S protein of the human coronavirus OC43 were higher in convalescent subjects than in unexposed subjects and correlated strongly with anti-S2 titers. Our findings indicate cross-reactive B cell responses against the S2 subunit that might enhance broad coronavirus protection. Importantly, our demonstration of MBC induction by SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that a durable form of B cell immunity is maintained even if circulating antibody levels wane.","Nguyen-Contant, Phuong; Embong, A.

Importantly, COVID-19 infection resembles SARS-like complications. However, the lack of knowledge about the underlying genetic mechanisms of COVID-19 warrants the development of prospective control measures. In this study, we employed whole-genome alignment and digital DNA–DNA hybridization analyses to assess genomic linkage between 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. To understand the pathogenetic behavior of 2019-nCoV, we compared gene expression datasets of viral infections closest to 2019-nCoV with four COVID-19 clinical presentations followed by functional enrichment of shared dysregulated genes. Potential chemical antagonists were also identified using protein–chemical interaction analysis. Based on phylogram analysis, the 2019-nCoV was found genetically closest to SARS-CoVs. In addition, we identified 562 upregulated and 738 downregulated genes (adj. P ≤ 0.05) with SARS-CoV infection. Among the dysregulated genes, SARS-CoV shared ≤19 upregulated and ≤22 downregulated genes with each of different COVID-19 complications. Notably, upregulation of BCL6 and PFKFB3 genes was common to SARS-CoV, pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome, while they shared CRIP2, NSG1 and TNFRSF21 genes in downregulation. Besides, 14 genes were common to different SARS-CoV comorbidities that might influence COVID-19 disease. We also observed similarities in pathways that can lead to COVID-19 and SARS-CoV diseases. Finally, protein–chemical interactions suggest cyclosporine, resveratrol and quercetin as promising drug candidates against COVID-19 as well as other SARS-like viral infections. The pathogenetic analyses, along with identified biomarkers, signaling pathways and chemical antagonists, could prove useful for novel drug development in the fight against the current global 2019-nCoV pandemic.","Nain, Zulkar; Rana, Humayan Kabir; Liò, Pietro; Islam, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful; Summers, Matthew A; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Brief Bioinform,181,12

METHODS Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional study on intensive care unit and emergency nurses in Belgium using 2 self-administered online questionnaires distributed just before the pandemic (January 2020, n = 422) and during the first peak of the pandemic (April 2020, n = 1616). Burnout was assessed with the Maslach Burnout Inventory scale. RESULTS The overall prevalence of burnout risk was higher among emergency nurses than intensive care unit nurses but was not significantly different after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (from 69.8% to 70.7%, χ² = 0.15, P = .68), whereas it increased significantly among intensive care unit nurses (from 51.2% to 66.7%, χ² = 23.64, P < .01). During the pandemic, changes in workload and the lack of personal protective equipment were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of burnout risk, whereas social support from colleagues and from superiors and management were associated with a lower likelihood of burnout risk. Several determinants of burnout risk were different between intensive care unit and emergency nurses.

However, despite these challenges, nursing faculty at a small private university demonstrated resilience and innovation at the height of the acute phase of the crisis, transforming a traditional 2-day in-person Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) practicum to an abbreviated, interactive virtual format. METHOD A qualitative study was conducted to explore DNP student perceptions of the virtual practicum. An anonymous survey was created to gather participant feedback; the link was embedded in an email invitation to practicum participants. RESULTS The majority of respondents were English speaking, middle-aged, Black, non-Hispanic nurse practitioners. Content analysis revealed three themes: valuable interactions, supportive faculty, and enlightening feedback. CONCLUSION Despite the crisis and ensuing consequences of the pandemic, DNP students who participated in the virtual practicum described a meaningful and valuable experience.

We implemented an innovative teaching proposal based on high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients. The purposes of our study were to describe this innovative teaching proposal and compare nursing competence acquisition in final year nursing students through virtual and in-person OSCE modalities. The study included 234 undergraduate students: 123 students were assessed through high-fidelity virtual OSCEs during May 2020, whereas 111 students were assessed through in-person OSCEs during May 2019. The structure of OSCEs, including its stations, clinical simulated scenarios, and checklists, was the same in both OSCE modalities. The effect size of the differences among the competence categories of checklists, including their total scores, was small. Regarding our virtual OSCEs was similarly successful to in-person OSCEs, this online format was found to be useful, feasible, and cost-saving when in-person OSCE was not possible. Therefore, high-fidelity virtual OSCEs with standardized patients could be considered as another choice of OSCE not only in the current COVID-19 pandemic but could also be extended to normal situations, even post-pandemic.","Arrogante, Oscar; López-Torre, Eva María; Carrión-García, Laura; Polo, Alberto; Jiménez-Rodríguez, Diana",Healthcare (Basel),181,28

The primary focus has been on reducing the viral spread and treating respiratory symptoms; as time goes on, the impact of COVID-19 on neurological and haemostatic systems becomes more evident. The clinical data suggest that platelet hyperactivity plays a role in the pathology of COVID-19 from its onset and that platelets may serve critical functions during COVID‐19 progression. Hyperactivation of blood platelets and the coagulation system are emerging as important drivers of inflammation and may be linked to the severity of the ‘cytokine storm’ induced in severe cases of COVID-19, in which disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet hyperactivity are associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of mortality. We propose that targeting platelet hyperactivity in the early stages of COVID-19 infection may reduce the immunothrombotic complications of COVID-19 and subdue the systemic inflammatory response. Lowering baseline platelet activity may be of particular importance for higher-risk groups. As an alternative to antiplatelet drugs, an inappropriate intervention in public health, we propose that the dietary antiplatelet agent Fruitflow®, derived from tomatoes, may be considered a suitable therapy. Fruitflow® contains antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory compounds that target the mechanisms of platelet activation specific to COVID-19 and can be considered a safe and natural antiplatelet regime.","O'Kennedy, Niamh; Duttaroy, Asim K.",Med Hypotheses,181,16

METHODS: We provided remdesivir on a compassionate-use basis to patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2. Patients were those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who had an oxygen saturation of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or who were receiving oxygen support. Patients received a 10-day course of remdesivir, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. This report is based on data from patients who received remdesivir during the period from January 25, 2020, through March 7, 2020, and have clinical data for at least 1 subsequent day. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients who received at least one dose of remdesivir, data from 8 could not be analyzed (including 7 patients with no post-treatment data and 1 with a dosing error). Of the 53 patients whose data were analyzed, 22 were in the United States, 22 in Europe or Canada, and 9 in Japan. At baseline, 30 patients (57%) were receiving mechanical ventilation and 4 (8%) were receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) had an improvement in oxygen-support class, including 17 of 30 patients (57%) receiving mechanical ventilation who were extubated. A total of 25 patients (47%) were discharged, and 7 patients (13%) died; mortality was 18% (6 of 34) among patients receiving invasive ventilation and 5% (1 of 19) among those not receiving invasive ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients hospitalized for severe Covid-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%). Measurement of efficacy will require ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials of remdesivir therapy.

Lesson 2: While resistance to change was the norm, the COVID-19 crisis motivated improvements to four major internal operational workflows (scheduling, appointment conversions, patient support and Virtual Rooming Assistants) for video visits, which were met with acceptance by both clinical and non-clinical staff. Lesson 3: Leveraging prior intraorganizational relationships and active collaboration between different stakeholders, helped drive rapid operational change. An ongoing centralized communication and support strategy, ensured all stakeholders were informed and engaged during these uncertain times. Lesson 4: Regular electronic health record (EHR) training and educational material increased end-user knowledge of video visits and helped ensure the visit was safe, medically effective and maintained patient-provider relationships. Lesson 5: A clearly defined intake and evaluation process to filter out technologies that do not integrate with the patient portal or the EHR, ensures operational consistency and long-term sustainability.

Such a narrow molecular focus raises the specter of viral immune evasion as a potential failure mode for these biomedical interventions. With the emergence of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 with altered transmissibility and immune evasion potential, a critical question is this: how easily can the virus escape neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) targeting the spike RBD? To answer this question, we combined an analysis of the RBD structure-function with an evolutionary modeling framework. Our structure-function analysis revealed that epitopes for RBD-targeting nAbs overlap one another substantially and can be evaded by escape mutants with ACE2 affinities comparable to the wild type, that are observed in sequence surveillance data and infect cells in vitro. This suggests that the fitness cost of nAb-evading mutations is low. We then used evolutionary modeling to predict the frequency of immune escape before and after the widespread presence of nAbs due to vaccines, passive immunization or natural immunity. Our modeling suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutants with one or two mildly deleterious mutations are expected to exist in high numbers due to neutral genetic variation, and consequently resistance to vaccines or other prophylactics that rely on one or two antibodies for protection can develop quickly -and repeatedly- under positive selection. Predicted resistance timelines are comparable to those of the decay kinetics of nAbs raised against vaccinal or natural antigens, raising a second potential mechanism for loss of immunity in the population. Strategies for viral elimination should therefore be diversified across molecular targets and therapeutic modalities.","Van Egeren, Debra; Novokhodko, Alexander; Stoddard, Madison; Tran, Uyen; Zetter, Bruce; Rogers, Michael; Pentelute, Bradley L.; Carlson, Jonathan M.; Hixon, Mark; Joseph-McCarthy, Diane; Chakravarty, Arijit",PLoS One,181,30

Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully understand the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we comprehensively define the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human RNAs. NSP16 binds to the mRNA recognition domains of the U1 and U2 splicing RNAs and acts to suppress global mRNA splicing upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. NSP1 binds to 18S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA entry channel of the ribosome and leads to global inhibition of mRNA translation upon infection. Finally, NSP8 and NSP9 bind to the 7SL RNA in the Signal Recognition Particle and interfere with protein trafficking to the cell membrane upon infection. Disruption of each of these essential cellular functions acts to suppress the interferon response to viral infection. Our results uncover a multipronged strategy utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize essential cellular processes to suppress host defenses.","Banerjee, Abhik K.; Blanco, Mario R.; Bruce, Emily A.; Honson, Drew D.; Chen, Linlin M.; Chow, Amy; Bhat, Prashant; Ollikainen, Noah; Quinodoz, Sofia A.; Loney, Colin; Thai, Jasmine; Miller, Zachary D.; Lin, Aaron E.; Schmidt, Madaline M.; Stewart, Douglas G.; Goldfarb, Daniel; De Lorenzo, Giuditta; Rihn, Suzannah J.; Voorhees, Rebecca; Botten, Jason W.; Majumdar, Devdoot; Guttman, Mitchell",Cell,181,20

However, the impact of ATAC-seq on cancer biology has not been objectively analyzed. We categorized 440 ATAC-seq publications according to the publication date, type, field, and country. R 3.6.2 was used to analyze the distribution of research fields. VOSviewer was used for country co-authorship and author co-authorship analyses, and GraphPad Prism 8 was used for correlation analyses of the factors that may affect the number of articles published in different countries. We found that ATAC-seq plays roles in carcinogenesis, anticancer immunity, targeted therapy, and metastasis risk predictions and is most frequently used in studies of leukemia among all types of cancer. We found a significantly strong correlation between the top 10 countries in terms of the number of publications and the gross expenditure on research and development (R&D), the number of universities, and the number of researchers. At present, ATAC-seq technology is undergoing a period of rapid development, making it inseparable from the emphasis and investment in scientific research by many countries. Collectively, ATAC-seq has advantages in the study of the cancer mechanisms because it can detect nucleic acids and thus has good application prospects in the field of cancer, especially in leukemia studies. As a country's economic strength increases and the emphasis on scientific research deepens, ATAC-seq will definitely play a more significant role in the field of cancer biology.","Zhao, Yu; Zhang, Xianwen; Song, Zhenhua; Wei, Danian; Wang, Hong; Chen, Wei; Sun, Guodong; Ma, Weiying; Chen, Kebing",Front Med (Lausanne),181,24

AIM: To (1) describe and compare Egyptian nursing students' and educators' experiences with e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) elicit participants' preferences for responding to online versus paper questionnaires. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional online survey of nursing students (undergraduate and postgraduate; n =580) and nursing educators (n = 95) in one faculty of nursing in Egypt. The survey assessed participants'characteristics, preferences for online versus paper surveys, and 11 dimensionsrelated to the e-learning experience, such as perceived competency, satisfaction, cognitive presence, and the preferred platforms for e-learning. RESULTS: About 91% of students and 80% of educators received either no or inadequate training on e-learning before the pandemic.

Multiplex real time RT-PCR helps in simultaneous detection of multiple viruses saving cost, time and labour. Commercially available multiplex real time RT-PCR kits are very expensive. Therefore the aim of the present study was to develop a cost effective multiplex real time RT-PCR for the detection of 18 respiratory viruses and compare it with an in-vitro diagnostics approved Fast Track Diagnostic Respiratory Pathogens 21 Kit (FTD). METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat swabs were collected and processed for extraction of nucleic acid using an automated extraction system and multiplex real time RT-PCR was performed using the FTD kit and a custom assay on 356 samples. RESULTS: Custom and FTD assays detected one or more respiratory viruses in 268 (75.29 %) and 262 (73.60 %) samples respectively. The concordance between the custom assay and the FTD assay was 100 % for HCoV OC43, HCoV 229E, HPIV-1, HPIV-2, HBoV, HPeV, Flu A, and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 94.66 – 99.71 % for the remaining viruses; Flu B (99.71 %), HRV (99.71 %), HPIV-3 (98.87 %), HPIV-4 (99.43 %), HCoV NL63 (99.71 %), HMPV A/B (99.71 %), RSV A/B (94.66 %), EV (98.31 %), HCoV HKU1 (99.71 %), HAdV (99.71 %). Major discrepancy was observed for RSV A/B, which was over detected in 18 samples by the custom assay as compared to the FTD assay. The custom assay was much cheaper than the FTD assay and the time taken was only 29 min more. CONCLUSION: The custom primer and probe mix was found to be comparable to the FTD assay with good concordance but was much cheaper and the time taken for reporting was only 29 min more. The low cost custom multiplex RT-PCR can be a useful alternative to the costly FTD kit for rapid identification of viral aetiology in resource limited settings.","Malhotra, Bharti; Swamy, M.

The nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core and results in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein (N-NTD) (residues 58 to 195) to a resolution of 2.0Å. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD is a single domain protein composed of a five-stranded β-sheet core and a long extended loop, similar to that observed in the structures of N-NTDs from other coronaviruses. The positively charged loop of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contains a structurally well-conserved positively charged residue, R106. To assess the role of R106 in RNA binding, we undertook a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and docking simulations to characterize the interaction between R106 and RNA. The results show that R106 plays an important role in the interaction between the N protein and RNA. In addition, we showed that, in cells transfected with plasmids that encoded the mutant (R106A) N protein and infected with virus, the level of the matrix protein gene was decreased by 7-fold compared to cells that were transfected with the wild-type N protein. This finding suggests that R106, by enhancing binding of the N protein to viral RNA plays a critical role in the viral replication. The results also indicate that the strength of N protein/RNA interactions is critical for HCoV-OC43 replication.","Chen, I-Jung; Yuann, Jeu-Ming P.; Chang, Yu-Ming; Lin, Shing-Yen; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley; Shen, Yo-Yu; Huang, Tai-Huang; Hou, Ming-Hon",Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics,181,21

While they help in preventing infection, there are concerns related to the possible impact of facemasks on social communication. The present study investigates how emotion recognition, trust attribution and re-identification of faces differ when faces are seen without mask, with a standard medical facemask, and with a transparent facemask restoring visual access to the mouth region. Our results show that, in contrast to standard medical facemasks, transparent masks significantly spare the capability to recognize emotional expressions. Moreover, transparent masks spare the capability to infer trustworthiness from faces with respect to standard medical facemasks which, in turn, dampen the perceived untrustworthiness of faces. Remarkably, while transparent masks (unlike standard masks) do not impair emotion recognition and trust attribution, they seemingly do impair the subsequent re-identification of the same, unmasked, face (like standard masks). Taken together, this evidence supports a dissociation between mechanisms sustaining emotion and identity processing. This study represents a pivotal step in the much-needed analysis of face reading when the lower portion of the face is occluded by a facemask.","Marini, Marco; Ansani, Alessandro; Paglieri, Fabio; Caruana, Fausto; Viola, Marco",Sci Rep,181,16

METHODS: We aimed to explore the characteristics and evolution of COVID-19 cancer patients admitted to hospital in a multicenter international registry (HOPE COVID-19). Our primary objective is to define those characteristics that allow us to identify cancer patients with a worse prognosis (mortality within 30 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19). RESULTS: 5838 patients have been collected in this registry, of whom 770 had cancer among their antecedents. In hospital mortality reached 258 patients (33.51%). The median was 75 years (65–82). Regarding the distribution by sex, 34.55% of the patients (266/770) were women. The distribution by type of cancer: genitourinary 238/745 (31.95%), digestive 124/745 (16.54%), hematologic 95/745 (12.75%).

Heightened fear of bioterrorism agents has caused health officials to re-examine the potential of these agents to be spread by air travel. The severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak of 2002 showed how air travel can have an important role in the rapid spread of newly emerging infections and could potentially even start pandemics. In addition to the flight crew, public health officials and health care professionals have an important role in the management of infectious diseases transmitted on airlines and should be familiar with guidelines provided by local and international authorities.","Mangili, Alexandra; Gendreau, Mark A",Lancet,181,16
