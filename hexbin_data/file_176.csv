411,Effects of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields on Human Osteoblastlike Cells (MG-63): A Pilot Study,2010-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Although pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are used to treat delayed unions and nonunions, their mechanisms of action are not completely clear. However, PEMFs are known to affect the expression of certain genes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked (1) whether PEMFs affect gene expression in human osteoblastlike cells (MG63) in vitro, and (2) whether and to what extent stimulation by PEMFs induce cell proliferation and differentiation in MG-63 cultures. METHODS: We cultured two groups of MG63 cells. One group was treated with PEMFs for 18 hours whereas the second was maintained in the same culture condition without PEMFs (control). Gene expression was evaluated throughout cDNA microarray analysis containing 19,000 genes spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome. RESULTS: PEMFs induced the upregulation of important genes related to bone formation (HOXA10, AKT1), genes at the transductional level (CALM1, P2RX7), genes for cytoskeletal components (FN1, VCL), and collagenous (COL1A2) and noncollagenous (SPARC) matrix components. However, PEMF induced downregulation of genes related to the degradation of extracellular matrix (MMP-11, DUSP4). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PEMFs appear to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, PEMFs promote extracellular matrix production and mineralization while decreasing matrix degradation and absorption. Our data suggest specific mechanisms of the observed clinical effect of PEMFs, and thus specific approaches for use in regenerative medicine.","Sollazzo, Vincenzo; Palmieri, Annalisa; Pezzetti, Furio; Massari, Leo; Carinci, Francesco",Clin Orthop Relat Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2895828/,176
7189,Food Restriction Differentially Affects Pituitary Hormone mRNAs throughout the Adult Life Span of Male F344 Rats,2001-06-11,"BACKGROUND: A number of serious human adenovirus (HAdV) outbreaks have been recently reported: HAdV-B7 (Israel, Singapore, and USA), HAdV-B7d (USA and China), HAdV-D8, -D54, and -C2 (Japan), HAdV-B14p1 (USA, Europe, and China), and HAdV-B55 (China, Singapore, and France). METHODS: To understand the epidemiology of HAdV infections in Singapore, we studied 533 HAdV-positive clinical samples collected from 396 pediatric and 137 adult patients in Singapore from 2012 to 2018. Genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify HAdV genotypes, clonal clusters, and recombinant or novel HAdVs. RESULTS: The most prevalent genotypes identified were HAdV-B3 (35.6%), HAdV-B7 (15.4%), and HAdV-E4 (15.2%). We detected 4 new HAdV-C strains and detected incursions with HAdV-B7 (odds ratio [OR], 14.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1–52.0) and HAdV-E4 (OR, 13.6; 95% CI, 3.9–46.7) among pediatric patients over time. In addition, immunocompromised patients (adjusted OR [aOR], 11.4; 95% CI, 3.8–34.8) and patients infected with HAdV-C2 (aOR, 8.5; 95% CI, 1.5–48.0), HAdV-B7 (aOR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2–10.9), or HAdV-E4 (aOR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.1–8.9) were at increased risk for severe disease. CONCLUSIONS: Singapore would benefit from more frequent studies of clinical HAdV genotypes to identify patients at risk for severe disease and help guide the use of new antiviral therapies, such as brincidofovir, and potential administration of HAdV 4 and 7 vaccine.","Coleman, Kristen K; Wong, Chui Ching; Jayakumar, Jayanthi; Nguyen, Tham T; Wong, Abigail W L; Yadana, Su; Thoon, Koh C; Chan, Kwai Peng; Low, Jenny G; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Dehghan, Shoaleh; Kang, June; Shamsaddini, Amirhossein; Seto, Donald; Su, Yvonne C F; Gray, Gregory C",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107482/,176

10646,Pediatric Clinician Comfort Discussing Diagnostic Errors for Improving Patient Safety: A Survey,2020-02-27,"INTRODUCTION: Pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) identify hospitalized children at risk for deterioration. Manual calculation is prone to human error. Electronic health records (EHRs) enable automated calculation, removing human error. This study’s objective was to compare the accuracy of automated EHR-based PEWS calculation (AutoPEWS) to manual calculation and evaluate the non-inferiority of AutoPEWS in predicting deterioration. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study inclusive of non-intensive care unit inpatients at a freestanding children’s hospital over 4.5 months in Fall 2018. AutoPEWS mapped the historical manual PEWS scoring rubric to frequently used EHR documentation. We determined accuracy by comparing the expected respiratory subset score based on the current respiratory rate to the actual respiratory score of AutoPEWS and the manual PEWS. The agreement was determined using kappa statistics. We used predicted probabilities from a generalized linear mixed model to calculate areas under the curve for each combination of scores (AutoPEWS, manual) and deterioration outcome (rapid response team activation, unplanned intensive care unit transfer, critical deterioration event). We compared the adjusted difference in areas under the curves between the scores. Non-inferiority was defined as a difference of <0.05. RESULTS: There were 23,514 total PEWS representative of 5,384 patients. AutoPEWS respiratory scores were 99.97% accurate, while the manual PEWS respiratory scores were 86% accurate. AutoPEWS were higher overall than the manual PEWS (mean 0.65 versus 0.34). They showed a fair-to-good agreement (weighted kappa 0.42). Non-inferiority of AutoPEWS compared with the manual PEWS was demonstrated for all deterioration outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Automation of PEWS calculation improved accuracy without sacrificing predictive ability.","Lockwood, Justin M; Thomas, Jacob; Martin, Sara; Wathen, Beth; Juarez-Colunga, Elizabeth; Peters, Lisa; Dempsey, Amanda; Reese, Jennifer",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190249/,176
13186,Microsuffering: Lessons From a Pinky Finger,2020-09-30,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has increased over the past half century and has now become the second most frequent autoimmune disease in childhood and one of major public health concern worldwide. Evidence suggests that modern lifestyles and rapid environmental changes are driving factors that underlie this increase. The integration of these two factors brings about changes in food intake. This, in turn, alters epigenetic regulations of the genome and intestinal microbiota composition, which may ultimately play a role in pathogenesis of T1D. Recent evidence shows that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is closely associated with T1D and that a dietary intervention can influence epigenetic changes associated with this disease and may modify gene expression patterns through epigenetic mechanisms. In this review focus on how a diet can shape the gut microbiome, its effect on the epigenome in T1D, and the future of T1D management by microbiome therapy.","Al Theyab, Ahmad; Almutairi, Turki; Al-Suwaidi, Abdulla M.; Bendriss, Ghizlane; McVeigh, Clare; Chaari, Ali",Front Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7541812/,176
15385,Family veto in organ donation: the experiences of Organ and Tissue Donation Coordinators in Ontario,2021-02-11,"BACKGROUND: A lack of follow-up of violence incidents and assaulted staff has been associated with high levels of workplace violence. There is a paucity of literature on the barriers, enablers and opportunities for organisational follow-up of workplace violence. The aim of this study was to explore the barriers, enablers and opportunities for organisational follow-up of workplace violence from the perspective of Emergency Department nurses. METHODS: This qualitative study comprised two focus groups with Emergency Department nurses. Data were analysed thematically. COREQ guidelines were followed for the design and reporting of the study. RESULTS: The barriers to follow-up in this study relate to the type of perpetrator, the initial incident response, the incident reporting process and organisational action. The enablers included hospital initiatives to manage violence and support staff wellbeing. The opportunities included strategies to improve follow-up and ideas for new follow-up strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Organisational follow-up is important for the emotional and professional wellbeing of staff who experience workplace violence. Opportunities for follow-up include exploring different approaches to patients with mental health issues and focussing on reoffenders by providing appropriate support and consequences. Managers should advocate for efficient and standardised reporting processes and ensure assaulted staff have a clear perception of follow-up and are included in the follow-up process. Including the perpetrators in the follow-up process may reduce workplace violence.

15452,Inadvertent subcutaneous injection of COVID-19 vaccine,2021-02-15,"Organ transplantation from living related donors in Bangladesh first began in October 1982, and became commonplace in 1988. Cornea transplantation from posthumous donors began in 1984 and living related liver and bone marrow donor transplantation began in 2010 and 2014 respectively. The Human Organ Transplantation Act officially came into effect in Bangladesh on 13th April 1999, allowing organ donation from both brain-dead and related living donors for transplantation. Before the legislation, religious leaders issued fatwa, or religious rulings, in favor of organ transplantation. The Act was amended by the Parliament on 8th January, 2018 with the changes coming into effect shortly afterwards on 28th January. However, aside from a few posthumous corneal donations, transplantation of vital organs, such as the kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, and other body parts or organs from deceased donors, has remained absent in Bangladesh. The major question addressed in this article is why the transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is absent in Bangladesh. In addition to the collection of secondary documents, interviews were conducted with senior transplant physicians, patients and their relatives, and the public, to learn about posthumous organ donation for transplantation. Interviews were also conducted with a medical student and two grief counselors to understand the process of counseling the families and obtaining consent to obtain posthumous cornea donations from brain-dead patients. An interview was conducted with a professional anatomist to understand the processes behind body donation for the purposes of medical study and research. Their narrative reveals that transplant physicians may be reticent to declare brain death as the stipulations of the 1999 act were unclear and vague. This study finds that Bangladeshis have strong family ties and experience anxiety around permitting separating body parts of dead relatives for organ donation for transplantation, or donating the dead body for medical study and research purposes. Posthumous organ donation for transplantation is commonly viewed as a wrong deed from a religious point of view. Religious scholars who have been consulted by the government have approved posthumous organ donation for transplantation on the grounds of necessity to save lives even though violating the human body is generally forbidden in Islam. An assessment of the dynamics of biomedicine, religion and culture leads to the conclusion that barriers to posthumous organ donation for transplantation that are perceived to be religious may actually stem from cultural attitudes. The interplay of faith, belief, religion, social norms, rituals and wider cultural attitudes with biomedicine and posthumous organ donation and transplantation is very complex. Although overcoming the barriers to organ donation for transplantation is challenging, initiation of transplantation of vital organs from deceased donors is necessary within Bangladesh. This will ensure improved healthcare outcomes, prevent poor people from being coerced into selling their organs to rich recipients, and protect the solidarity and progeny of Bangladeshi families.","Siraj, Md.

15889,COVID-19 at 1 Year: American Heart Association Presidents Reflect on the Pandemic,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public. However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield. METHODS: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users. RESULTS: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.","Hassan, Lamiece; Nenadic, Goran; Tully, Mary Patricia",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7925154/,176
16927,Listerial meningitis: A diagnostic dilemma,2019,"To evaluate the prevalence of cardiac injury and its association with mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A total of 133 hospitals in 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of mainland China that admitted influenza A (H7N9) virus–infected patients between January 22, 2015, and June 16, 2017. PATIENTS: A total of 321 patients with influenza A (H7N9) virus infection were included in the final analysis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from medical records. Cardiac injury was defined according to cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, or echocardiography. Among the 321 patients, 203 (63.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Compared with the uninjured group, the cardiac injury group had lower Pao(2)/Fio(2) (median, 102.0 vs 148.4 mm Hg; p < 0.001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (median, 17.0 vs 11.0; p < 0.001), longer stay in the ICU (10.0 vs 9.0 d; p = 0.029), and higher proportion of in-hospital death (64.0% vs 20.3%; p < 0.001). The proportion of virus clearance until discharge or death was lower in the cardiac injury group than in the uninjured group (58.6% vs 86.4%; p < 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (hazards ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.31–3.24) during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac injury is a frequent condition among hospitalized patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus, and it is associated with higher risk of mortality.","Gao, Chang; Wang, Yeming; Gu, Xiaoying; Shen, Xinghua; Zhou, Daming; Zhou, Shujun; Huang, Jian-an; Cao, Bin; Guo, Qiang",Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7098447/,176
18244,"Patient Perspectives of the Social, Emotional and Functional Impact of Alopecia Areata: A Systematic Literature Review",2021-03-26,"BACKGROUND: Most of the deaths among neonates in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be prevented through universal access to basic high-quality health services including essential facility-based inpatient care. However, poor routine data undermines data-informed efforts to monitor and promote improvements in the quality of newborn care across hospitals. METHODS: Continuously collected routine patients’ data from structured paper record forms for all admissions to newborn units (NBUs) from 16 purposively selected Kenyan public hospitals that are part of a clinical information network were analysed together with data from all paediatric admissions ages 0–13 years from 14 of these hospitals. Data are used to show the proportion of all admissions and deaths in the neonatal age group and examine morbidity and mortality patterns, stratified by birth weight, and their variation across hospitals. FINDINGS: During the 354 hospital months study period, 90 222 patients were admitted to the 14 hospitals contributing NBU and general paediatric ward data. 46% of all the admissions were neonates (aged 0–28 days), but they accounted for 66% of the deaths in the age group 0–13 years. 41 657 inborn neonates were admitted in the NBUs across the 16 hospitals during the study period. 4266/41 657 died giving a crude mortality rate of 10.2% (95% CI 9.97% to 10.55%), with 60% of these deaths occurring on the first-day of admission. Intrapartum-related complications was the single most common diagnosis among the neonates with birth weight of 2000 g or more who died. A threefold variation in mortality across hospitals was observed for birth weight categories 1000–1499 g and 1500–1999 g. INTERPRETATION: The high proportion of neonatal deaths in hospitals may reflect changing patterns of childhood mortality. Majority of newborns died of preventable causes (>95%). Despite availability of high-impact low-cost interventions, hospitals have high and very variable mortality proportions after stratification by birth weight.","Irimu, Grace; Aluvaala, Jalemba; Malla, Lucas; Omoke, Sylvia; Ogero, Morris; Mbevi, George; Waiyego, Mary; Mwangi, Caroline; Were, Fred; Gathara, David; Agweyu, Ambrose; Akech, Samuel; English, Mike",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169483/,176

The Oman Cancer Association in the Sultanate of Oman, in collaboration with the Middle Eastern Cancer Consortium and the Oncology Nursing Society, led a palliative care initiative over the past decade to better integrate palliative care into the health care system. Components of this initiative include integrating palliative care into the health care curricula and providing palliative care education to over 400 nurses and other health care professionals within Oman. The four-part education series includes the following courses: (1) Foundations of Palliative Care, (2) Advanced Concepts in Palliative Care, (3) Palliative Care Leadership, and (4) Palliative Care Research. Additional participants from 17 different countries in the Middle East and northern Africa also attended the training. Twenty of the trainees who were considered palliative care leaders in their countries then participated in a Train the Trainer course. This group trained the last cohort of health care professionals in Oman and then took learned concepts and strategies back to their respective countries in order to provide country-wide education and build palliative care capacity in the region. Outcomes include the development of palliative care units, quality improvement projects that improved care, and advocacy projects to increase opioid availability within some countries. The collaborative continues its work and connections through social medial, email, and virtual collaboration. Other countries can use this model to permeate palliative care within their regions.","Brant, Jeannine M.; Al-Zadjali, Manal; Al-Sinawi, Faiqa; Mushani, Tayreez; Maloney-Newton, Susan; Berger, Ann M.; Fink, Regina",J Cancer Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8204607/,176
19659,Drug Information Services in Low-Resource Setting: A Responsibility of Pharmacists or Pharmacologists or Both the Professions Conjointly,2021-05-26,"Accurate segmentation of the jaw (i.e., mandible and maxilla) and the teeth in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans is essential for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Although various (semi)automated methods have been proposed to segment the jaw or the teeth, there is still a lack of fully automated segmentation methods that can simultaneously segment both anatomic structures in CBCT scans (i.e., multiclass segmentation). In this study, we aimed to train and validate a mixed-scale dense (MS-D) convolutional neural network for multiclass segmentation of the jaw, the teeth, and the background in CBCT scans. Thirty CBCT scans were obtained from patients who had undergone orthodontic treatment. Gold standard segmentation labels were manually created by 4 dentists. As a benchmark, we also evaluated MS-D networks that segmented the jaw or the teeth (i.e., binary segmentation). All segmented CBCT scans were converted to virtual 3-dimensional (3D) models. The segmentation performance of all trained MS-D networks was assessed by the Dice similarity coefficient and surface deviation. The CBCT scans segmented by the MS-D network demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentations (Dice similarity coefficient: 0.934 ± 0.019, jaw; 0.945 ± 0.021, teeth). The MS-D network–based 3D models of the jaw and the teeth showed minor surface deviations when compared with the corresponding gold standard 3D models (0.390 ± 0.093 mm, jaw; 0.204 ± 0.061 mm, teeth). The MS-D network took approximately 25 s to segment 1 CBCT scan, whereas manual segmentation took about 5 h. This study showed that multiclass segmentation of jaw and teeth was accurate and its performance was comparable to binary segmentation. The MS-D network trained for multiclass segmentation would therefore make patient-specific orthodontic treatment more feasible by strongly reducing the time required to segment multiple anatomic structures in CBCT scans.","Wang, H.; Minnema, J.; Batenburg, K.J.; Forouzanfar, T.; Hu, F.J.; Wu, G.",J Dent Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293763/,176
20240,Do it yourself non-contact eyelid eversion: I-Verter,2021-07-11,"PURPOSE: The United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) sequence and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) milestones represent 2 major components along the continuum of assessment from undergraduate through graduate medical education. This study examines associations between USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) scores and ACGME emergency medicine (EM) milestone ratings. METHOD: In February 2019, subject matter experts (SMEs) provided judgments of expected associations for each combination of Step examination and EM subcompetency. The resulting sets of subcompetencies with expected strong and weak associations were selected for convergent and discriminant validity analysis, respectively. National-level data for 2013–2018 were provided; the final sample included 6,618 EM residents from 158 training programs. Empirical bivariate correlations between milestone ratings and Step scores were calculated, then those correlations were compared with the SMEs’ judgments. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted on the selected subcompetencies, in which milestone ratings were the dependent variable, and Step 1 score, Step 2 CK score, and cohort year were independent variables. RESULTS: Regression results showed small but statistically significant positive relationships between Step 2 CK score and the subcompetencies (regression coefficients ranged from 0.02 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.01–0.03] to 0.12 [95% CI, 0.11–0.13]; all P < .05), with the degree of association matching the SMEs’ judgments for 7 of the 9 selected subcompetencies. For example, a 1 standard deviation increase in Step 2 CK score predicted a 0.12 increase in MK-01 milestone rating, when controlling for Step 1. Step 1 score showed a small statistically significant effect with only the MK-01 subcompetency (regression coefficient = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.05–0.07], P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide incremental validity evidence in support of Step 1 and Step 2 CK score and EM milestone rating uses.","Hamstra, Stanley J.; Cuddy, Monica M.; Jurich, Daniel; Yamazaki, Kenji; Burkhardt, John; Holmboe, Eric S.; Barone, Michael A.; Santen, Sally A.",Acad Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378430/,176

It is important to understand the information that youth are exposed to about perfectionism on the internet and what may be required to make this more helpful in terms of accessing empirically supported descriptions and advice. METHODS: This research used novel methodology to investigate content about perfectionism on websites by conducting a realist synthesis of the definitions of perfectionism, and the degree to which websites contain empirically supported strategies and recognise the advantages and disadvantages of perfectionism. The results were presented to people aged 18 to 24 (N = 18) with a lived experience of anxiety/depression for feedback. RESULTS: The search yielded 992 websites, 266 of which were included in the synthesis; only one met the criteria for excellent quality with most (56%) judged as moderate. The feelings, thoughts, and behaviours that accompany perfectionism were commonly described, and strategies included identifying cognitions and developing alternatives, moving from self-criticism to self-compassion, normalising mistakes, adjusting goals, receiving practical support, and strategies for procrastination. The young people wanted further emphasis on depression and anxiety as consequences of perfectionism that contributed to a vicious cycle. They identified interventions were difficult, with greater levels of support needed. CONCLUSIONS: While most websites contained empirically supported information, the quality needs to improve, and further information needs to be provided on the links with anxiety and depression. Interventions for perfectionism need to have more focus on helping young people develop support networks.","Wade, Tracey D.; Egan, Sarah J.; Wleklinski, Maggie; O’Brien, Amy; Fitzallen, Grace; Shafran, Roz",BMC Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8384458/,176

To date, the status of a considerable proportion of HIV/AIDS patients has changed from a near-fatal disorder secondary to opportunistic infections to a chronic disease in which a variety of co-morbid conditions have become prevalent and relevant. Arthralgia and myalgias are the most common symptoms. The rate of spondyloarthritis varies according to the geographic area, genetic and mode of transmission. Most RA and SLE patients might go into remission after the development of AIDS, but also there are patients that continue with active disease. Prevalence of DILS is highest among African Americans in less advanced stages. PAN is clinically less aggressive and peripheral neuropathy is the most common clinical manifestation. Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), systemic sclerosis and poly-dermatomyositis are uncommon. After the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), a decline of spondyloarthritis disorders and of DILS and development of new syndromes such as IRIS, osteoporosis and avascular bone necrosis have occurred.

34007,Fighting the Moral Distress of Idleness,2020-06-08,"TF-IDF is one of the most commonly used weighting metrics for measuring the relationship of words to documents. It is widely used for word feature extraction. In many research and applications, the thresholds of TF-IDF for selecting relevant words are only based on trial or experiences. Some cut-off strategies have been proposed in which the thresholds are selected based on Zipf’s law or feedbacks from model performances. However, the existing approaches are restricted in specific domains or tasks, and they ignore the imbalance of the number of representative words in different categories of documents. To address these issues, we apply game-theoretic shadowed set model to select the word features given TF-IDF information. Game-theoretic shadowed sets determine the thresholds of TF-IDF using game theory and repetition learning mechanism. Experimental results on real world news category dataset show that our model not only outperforms all baseline cut-off approaches, but also speeds up the classification algorithms.","Zhang, Yan; Zhou, Yue; Yao, JingTao",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274338/,176

Clostridium perfringens type A and Clostridium septicum produce alpha (plc) and alpha toxins respectively. C. perfringens can cause gas gangrene and gastrointestinal diseases. C. septicum can cause traumatic and non-traumatic gas gangrene. The aim of current research was in silico analysis of a chimeric fusion protein against C. perfringens type A and C. septicum alpha toxins. Firstly, the chimeric fusion gene was designed according to nucleotide sequences of C. perfringens type A alpha (KY584046.1) and C. septicum alpha (JN793989.2) toxin genes and then its fusion protein is constructed by amino acid sequences of C. perfringens type A and C. septicum alpha toxins. Secondly, online software was used to determine prediction of secondary and tertiary structures and physicochemical characteristics of the fusion protein. Finally, the validation of the fusion protein was confirmed by Rampage and proSA program. The designed fusion protein has 777 amino acids in length. TASSER server and physicochemical parameters are showed: C-score = − 2.68 and molecular weight = 87.9 KD respectively. Rampage and proSA software revealed the fusion protein is valid.

38440,IP and the supply of COVID-19-related drugs,2020-08-07,"PURPOSE: Pediatric genitalia injury represents 0.6% of all pediatric trauma. It is crucial for providers to understand whether pediatric patients are at risk for violent mechanisms, such as rape, assault, or other abuse. Therefore, we sought to perform a large database analysis of pediatric and adolescent female genitalia trauma, comparing mechanisms of injury (i.e., sexual abuse) and need for operative intervention between adolescent and pediatric cohorts. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was queried (years 2007–2015) for female patients ≤ 16 years old with external genitalia (vaginal or vulvar) trauma. Two groups were compared: pediatrics (< 12 years old) and adolescents (12–16 years old). RESULTS: Out of 303,992 female patients, 3206 (1.1%) were identified to have genitalia trauma with the majority being pediatric patients (92.1%) and with injury to the vagina (62.6%). Pediatric patients with vaginal injury were less likely to be victims of rape (4.1% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001) and assault (2.1% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001) but more likely to be victims of other abuse (9.5% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.003). More of the adolescent patients with vaginal trauma required repair (58.7% vs. 43.2%, p < 0.001). Pediatric patients with injury to the vulva were less likely to be victims of rape (0.7% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.01) and motor vehicle accidents (4.2% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Genitalia trauma occurs in 1.1% of pediatric and adolescent trauma cases with the vagina being more commonly injured compared to the vulva. Adolescent patients with vaginal injuries were more likely to be victims of rape and assault and required repair more often, while those with vulvar injuries were more likely due to motor vehicle accidents. Health care providers must be aware of these at-risk populations and the differences between them to identify female victims of violence and provide resources to assist with recovery.

Isothermal DNA amplification with bioluminescent detection is a fast, low-cost, highly specific molecular diagnostic technique that is triggerable by temperature. Combining loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification (LAMP) and bioluminescent assay in real time (BART), with droplet microfluidics, should enable high-throughput, low copy, sequence-specific DNA detection by simple light emission. Stable, uniform LAMP–BART droplets are generated with low cost equipment. The composition and scale of these droplets are controllable and the bioluminescent output during DNA amplification can be imaged and quantified. Furthermore these droplets are readily incorporated into encapsulated droplet interface bilayers (eDIBs), or artificial cells, and the bioluminescence tracked in real time for accurate quantification off chip. Microfluidic LAMP–BART droplets with high stability and uniformity of scale coupled with high throughput and low cost generation are suited to digital DNA quantification at low template concentrations and volumes, where multiple measurement partitions are required. The triggerable reaction in the core of eDIBs can be used to study the interrelationship of the droplets with the environment and also used for more complex chemical processing via a self-contained network of droplets, paving the way for smart soft-matter diagnostics.","Hardinge, Patrick; Baxani, Divesh K.; McCloy, Thomas; Murray, James A.

Materials & methods: We assayed 185 nasopharyngeal samples stored in viral transport media. The indirect method was done with RNA extraction step, and the direct RT-PCR was done without an extraction step, both assays were evaluated on a commercially validated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) kit targeting E gene. Results: Our assay showed a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 100% and the agreement between methods was 72%. Conclusion: Overall, this simple direct RT-PCR approach can be utilized as a qualitative diagnostic tool for emergency SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in countries with limited resources and may help laboratories to continue testing and at greater frequency despite supply shortages, although with delay in cycle threshold value in comparison with indirect RT-PCR.","Alaifan, Taghreed; Altamimi, Asmaa; Obeid, Dalia; Alshehri, Turki; Almatrrouk, Shaihana; Albarrag, Ahmed",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7856914/,176

48700,Geriatric Patients and COVID-19,2020-10-06,"Multifractal analysis is a beneficial way to systematically characterize the heterogeneous nature of both theoretical and experimental patterns of fractal. Multifractal analysis tackles the singularity structure of functions or signals locally and globally. While Hölder exponent at each point provides the local information, the global information is attained by characterization of the statistical or geometrical distribution of Hölder exponents occurring, referred to as multifractal spectrum. This analysis is time-saving while dealing with irregular signals; hence, such analysis is used extensively. Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is an auto-immune disease that is chronic and characterized by the damage to the Central Nervous System (CNS), is a neurological disorder exhibiting dissimilar and irregular attributes varying among patients. In our study, the MS dataset consists of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (taken in different years) of patients diagnosed with MS subgroups (relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS)) while healthy individuals constitute the control group. This study aims to identify similar attributes in homogeneous MS clusters and dissimilar attributes in different MS subgroup clusters. Thus, it has been aimed to demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method based on such cluster formation. Within this framework, the approach we propose follows these steps for the classification of the MS dataset. Firstly, Multifractal denoising with Gaussian process is employed for identifying the critical and significant self-similar attributes through the removal of MS dataset noise, by which, mFd_MS dataset is generated. As another step, Fuzzy C-means algorithm is applied to the MS dataset for the classification purposes of both datasets. Based on the experimental results derived within the scheme of the applicable and efficient proposed method, it is shown that mFd_MS dataset yielded a higher accuracy rate since the critical and significant self-similar attributes were identified in the process. This study can provide future direction in different fields such as medicine, natural sciences and engineering as a result of the model proposed and the application of alternative mathematical models. As obtained based on the model, the experimental results of the study confirm the efficiency, reliability and applicability of the proposed method. Thus, it is hoped that the derived results based on the thorough analyses and algorithmic applications will be assisting in terms of guidance for the related studies in the future.","Karaca, Yeliz; Baleanu, Dumitru",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978584/,176
51012,Medico-Legal Issues Related to Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: A Literature Review Including the Indian Scenario,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for healthcare service reform in order to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection between patients, healthcare providers and medical trainees. Gastroenterologists have been challenged to adopt to virtual consultations and accommodate medical trainees in their virtual clinics. AIMS: To assess the impact of virtual care on medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODS: A REDCap survey was disseminated among gastroenterology providers via email. The subsection of the survey on medical education consisted of 4 questions pertaining to inclusion of trainees in virtual clinics, type of virtual clinic, observation method and an open-ended question for additional comments. Quantitative data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 and qualitative theme analysis was applied for short answer responses. RESULTS: Of the 24 respondents that completed the survey, only 6 (25%) had trainees involved in their clinics (Table 1). The type of clinic consultations conducted were telephone only (50%), a combination of telephone, video and hospital-base telehealth (33.3%) and hospital-based telehealth only (16.7%). There was an equal split between direct and indirect observations. Preceptors that had previous experience with virtual consultation prior to the pandemic, were more likely to include trainees in their virtual clinics (66.6% vs 33.4%; Fisher’s exact test, p=0.033). For preceptors who included trainees in their virtual clinics, their overall satisfaction averaged 0.51 points lower (95% CI: 0.19–0.84, p=0.004). Concerns identified were lack of trainee engagement, adequate remuneration for healthcare providers, and lack of training for trainee and preceptors on how to navigate virtual platforms. CONCLUSIONS: This survey demonstrates that gastroenterologists with previous experience with virtual clinics are more likely to accommodate trainees in their virtual clinics. However, involving trainees seem to reduce preceptor’s satisfaction with virtual clinic. Our findings suggest that there is a need to provide telemedicine training for both educators and trainees, in order to alleviate concerns and promote its adoption as organizations seek to continue to provide high-quality medical education while providing virtual care.

The challenge is to transform the built environment through the inclusion of NBS. Taking advantage of the existing space in the top of the buildings, the integration of green roofs will support the cities’ transition towards circularity and resilience. They provide several ecosystem services and can act as multifunctional and decentralized units. In order to boost these services, green roofs need to be effectively incorporated and replicated in the urban landscape. Different configuration of systems may be considered depending on the challenges that the city foresees. To fully implement green roofs, it is important that (i) barriers are identified and overcome, (ii) standardization is set to grant liability, (iii) policies, incentives, and strategies are properly established, (iv) organizations delivering NBS services are leveraged, and (v) awareness and dissemination promotion, as investment in education, are considered. This paper intends to give an overview of the importance of green roof integration in the urban environment considering the dimensions of the building and the city, having underlined their contribution to circularity and cities’ resilience.","Calheiros, Cristina S.

52245,Assessing the impact on pharmacists’ time by introducing a technician screening process for clinical trial prescriptions,2021-03-26,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent among veterans. Although there are effective treatment approaches for PTSD, such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy, many providers trained in these approaches do not use them, or use them without sufficient fidelity, and veterans drop out of these treatments at very high rates. The time intensive nature of these treatments is frequently cited as a barrier to receiving the treatment among veterans and delivering the treatment among providers. According, there is an urgent need to establish more efficient and effective PTSD treatment approaches in order to meet the needs of veterans seeking care. Written exposure therapy (WET) is an efficient, exposure-based treatment, and may represent a plausible alternative treatment option to address PTSD in veterans. Although WET has been found to be effective and non-inferior to more time intensive trauma-focused treatment, it has not yet been investigated with a veteran sample. In an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) we are investigating whether WET is non-inferior in treating PTSD compared with the more time intensive PE. The study sample will include 150 men and women veterans diagnosed with PTSD who are randomly assigned to either WET (n = 75) or PE (n = 75). Participants are assessed prior to treatment and 10-, 20-, and 30-weeks after the first treatment session. The primary outcome is PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5. Establishing that PTSD can be treated effectively with fewer treatment sessions would represent a significant advance in improving access to evidence-based care for veterans with PTSD.","Sloan, Denise M.; Marx, Brian P.; Acierno, Ronald; Messina, Michael; Cole, Travis A.",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8079278/,176

Considering the major differences of focus and approach among these observers, this article aims to review systematically such Middle Eastern perspectives, both globally and regionally, on the emerging Sino-US rivalry. Certain Middle East analysts regard Beijing and Washington as largely “homogeneous” extra-regional powers competing in international politics, economy, and technology. Many others emphasise their “heterogeneity,” arguing that the essence of Sino-US confrontation lies in the clash of two models. Most Middle East scholars note that, in contrast to Washington’s waning influence, Beijing’s growing presence in the region during the past decade has rendered the Middle East a “new battleground” for the two great powers. Although China and the United States still have shared interests in certain regional affairs, most intellectuals focus on and collectively identify five domains across the Middle East wherein Beijing and Washington are locked in asymmetric competition. In light of both the opportunities and challenges that the emerging Sino-US rivalry engenders, Middle Eastern observers raise various policy suggestions, and debate on whether regional players should proactively take advantage of this great power competition, cautiously hedge against strategic uncertainty and risk, or constructively help reduce hostility between the United States and the People’s Republic of China.","She, Gangzheng",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083616/,176

We assessed patient satisfaction by conducting a feedback survey. Our aim was to obtain a patient perspective on remote consultations and on preferred future follow up options including video or face-to-face consultations. Methods The cohort included 160 rheumatology patients who had a telephone consultation between May and mid-June 2020. All patients consented to receive a further phone call by a different member of the team. Patients had to answer a questionnaire about recent consultation and to rate this on a scale of 1-5. Other questions included whether all their queries were answered; clear action plan made; perceived benefits or disadvantages of telephone consultation; and views about future follow up and any additional comments. Results 71.9% of 160 patients were females while 28.1 % males. Mean age 58.6 yrs. More than half of the patients (60.6%) had a diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis, followed by connective tissue disease (19.3%), other diagnosis (8.1% ) & vasculitis (5.6%). 94.4 % of the patients in this study were return appointments-the remainder new. Feedback results revealed 92.5% patients were satisfied with their consultation with mean score of 4.3/5 (5=best,1= worst). More than 80% agreed that all their queries were answered and a clear action plan was formed during consultation. However ,71.2% would want a face to face consultation if given choice while 54 % happy to have further follow up over the phone. 65% of patients preferred not to have video consultation. Subgroup analysis showed that majority of patients who would accept video consultation were aged between 30-39. Most common benefits described were noted to be convenience; reduced time of work; travel time and safety during pandemic, whilst difficulty in describing symptoms; hearing problems; and severity of disease were disadvantages raised, but numbers were small in our cohort. Conclusion Telephone clinics were the mainstay during the COVID-19 pandemic.The large majority of the rheumatology patients in our cohort were highly satisfied with this form of consultation. However, interestingly the majority (71% ) would still prefer face-to-face consultation as follow up in the future. Regular follow up in carefully selected patient groups can successfully be performed by telephone clinics with good patient satisfaction. This would help increase capacity within the clinic setting.

Methods REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by HTR of the University of Seville, together with a multidisciplinary team of rheumatologists and patient organisations from 7 European countries (in the UK: NASS, NRAS and Arthritis Action). The study consists of an online survey, including the following instruments: Self-Perceived Health, WHO-5 Well-Being Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data are collected in two phases: the first wave of the pandemic (from May 14(th) to July 18(th) 2020) and the second wave (to be conducted in winter 2020). Results 558 patients with rheumatic diseases participated in REUMAVID UK. The most frequently reported diagnoses were axial spondyloarthritis (44.6%), rheumatoid arthritis (44.1%) and osteoarthritis (25.6%). The mean age was 58.5±13.4 years, 78.7% women, 70.8% married or in a relationship and 54.1% having university studies. 45.8% perceived their health status being ""fair to very poor"" with 38.4% reporting a worsening during lockdown. 48.8% had their rheumatology appointment cancelled. Of these, 46.9% were offered either online or telephone follow-up, while the remaining 50.6% were not given any alternative. 15.6% changed their medication, of which 66.3% were indicated to do so by the medical team and 21.7% did so out of concern with COVID-19 with the major fear being that their treatment would lead to serious illness if they contracted SARS-CoV-2, while the greater hope was to be able to continue with their treatment as usual. 10.3% smoked more than before, 59.4% quit smoking and 36.3% drank more alcohol than before. 20.7% were unable to physically exercise at home and 39.2% reported weight gain. According to the WHO-5 scale, 52.5% declared poor well-being (≤50). A total of 43.6% were at risk of anxiety and 33.6% at risk of depression according to the HADS scale. During the lockdown, 54.3% were able to continue their psychological therapy. The main source of COVID-19 information was the patient organisations (reaching 63.6% of members), compared to 45.3% of non-members who did not receive any information. Conclusion The REUMAVID study has allowed us to measure and quantify the experience of British patients with rheumatic disease during an unprecedented public health crisis. A reduction in healthcare access, concern about treatment, changes in daily life habits and worsening of well-being and mental health were reported during the first wave.

BACKGROUND: severe and numerous restrictions were taken in Spain during lockdown. Significant consequences from the physical and emotional point of view were described. Pathophysiology of Takotsubo syndrome (TKS) is complex but the ocurrence of acute emotional or physical triggers is found in almost 50% of cases. METHODS AND PURPOSE: Retrospective study to compare patients treated by urgent coronary angiography during the period of lockdown in Spain (03/15/2020 to 05/31/2020) and patients in the same period of the previous year (2019). The aim is to present our experience comparing the two periods and to evaluate the incidence of TKS during lockdown. RESULTS: We included 73 patients from the pre-COVID period (2019) and 67 patients from the lockdown period. We found 4 cases of TKS during lockdown (6%) versus 0 cases in pre-COVID period. Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1. All cases of TKS were female. The median age was 66 years +/- 12. In 2 cases there was an emotional trigger (stress or anxiety) but in the other 2 cases the trigger was unknown. All patients with TKS presented left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Three cases showed typical wall motion abnormalities (apical and mid wall segments) and one case had circumferential hypokinesia of basal segments (consistent with reversed TKS). 3 cases were negative for COVID-19 PCR test and 1 unsuspected case was not tested for COVID-19. One patient with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest died while receiving mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, during COVID-19 lockdow, we observed an increase in incidence of TKS compared to the same period of the previous year. An emotional trigger was only found in half of the cases.","Jimenez Melo, O; Meseguer Gonzalez, D; Revilla Marti, P; Linares Vicente, JA; Lukic Otanovic, A; Simo Sanchez, B; Saornil Minguez, L; Jimenez Agesta, Y; Ruiz Arroyo, JR",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135463/,176
53298,548 “The New Normal”? How We Adapted Simulation Training in The Midst of the Coronavirus Pandemic,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Sarcoidosis is a rare multisystem disease characterised by the presence of noncaseating granulomas. It most commonly affects the lungs though can affect any other organ system. Rarely, it can manifest as an acute myopathy. We describe a case of a patient presenting with muscle weakness and constitutional symptoms who was eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Methods A 48-year-old male with a background of lumbar spondylosis and BPH, presented with a 6-week history of progressive upper and lower limb weakness, myalgia and reduced mobility. He also described an 18-month history of progressive fatigue, drenching night sweats and 10-kilogram weight loss. His symptoms meant he was unable to work as a firefighter. Examination demonstrated profound muscle wasting and reduced power in the proximal muscles of his upper and lower limbs. There was no evidence of rash, synovitis or lymphadenopathy. Blood tests showed a normocytic anaemia (Hb 100 g/L) and raised C-reactive peptide (180 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (100 mm/hour). The creatine kinase ranged between 20-42 units/litre. He had a weakly positive anti-nuclear antibody (1:80). The remaining autoantibody screen was negative including ENA, DSDNA, ANCA, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP. Complement proteins were unremarkable. Furthermore, an extended myositis panel revealed no myositis-specific or myositis-associated antibodies. Serum calcium and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels were normal. Blood cultures and virology screen including for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, CMV, EBV, COVID-19 and respiratory viruses were all negative. A chest radiograph was also unremarkable. Results He subsequently underwent electromyography which revealed generalised myopathy. An MRI of the lower limb proximal musculature showed evidence of muscle oedema worse on the right-side but no definitive evidence of myositis. A PET-CT followed revealing FDG-avid generalised lymphadenopathy and polyarticular uptake, but little uptake in the skeletal muscles. He underwent an external iliac lymph node core biopsy which demonstrated multiple noncaseating granulomas and lymphadenitis. Cultures for Tuberculosis were negative and there was no evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder. A muscle biopsy was desired but not possible due to lack of availability because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient was diagnosed with sarcoidosis and commenced on three pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone followed by a weaning regimen of high-dose oral prednisolone and subcutaneous methotrexate. This resulted in a sustained improvement in his symptoms and normalisation of inflammatory markers. Conclusion Symptomatic myopathy is present in only 0.5-2.5% of sarcoidosis patients. This unique case highlights the heterogeneity of this disease and the vital role different diagnostic modalities play in achieving the correct diagnosis. It is also pertinent that the lymphadenopathy, found incidentally via imaging, led to the diagnosis. Although notoriously a diagnosis of exclusion, this case emphasises the importance of considering sarcoidosis even in the absence of respiratory symptoms, a raised ACE or hypercalcaemia.

Main funding source(s): Instituto de Salud Carlos III in Spain (Co-funded by European Social Fund ""Investing in your future""). INTRODUCTION The Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted clinical practice with important changes in the most affected areas, resulting in increased mortality from heart disease (myocardial infarction). The feasibility of continuing a temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) program is unknown. PURPOSE Our objective was to analyze the survival of patients requiring short-term MCS with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) or Impella CP® during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Retrospective study including all VA-ECMO and Impella CP® implants in a referral hospital since March 2020 compared to previous implants results. RESULTS Out of 167 short-term MCS implanted from 2013, 25 (15%) were conducted during the time of COVID-19 pandemic: 19 VA-ECMO and 6 Impella CP® (Table). Compared to preCOVID-19 implants, patients requiring MCS in the COVID era presented more frequently right ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.005) and showed a trend towards older age (p = 0.069) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p = 0.063), without other significant differences regarding the baseline situation and implant technique (Table). Encephalopathy was more frequent in the COVID-19 era, with no differences in other complications (Table). Survival at discharge was 43.7% in the pre-COVID era vs 36% during COVID-19 pandemic, without finding statistically significant differences (p = 0.313). CONCLUSION: Survival after temporary MCS did not get worse significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The possibility of short-term MCS should be maintained for cardiogenic shock and other cases of hemodynamic instability.","Alonso Fernandez De Gatta, M; Diego Nieto, A; Merchan Gomez, S; Gonzalez Cebrian, M; Toranzo Nieto, I; Martin Herrero, F; Barrio, A; Rodriguez Estevez, L; Sanchez, PL",Eur Heart J Acute Cardiovasc Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135503/,176
53306,983 Patient’s Satisfaction of Virtual Clinics for Post-Cardiothoracic Surgery Follow Up During COVID,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel vasculitis characterised by IgA deposition. Adrenal haemorrhage has been reported previously in HSP, but is rare. Methods A 33-year-old lady was admitted with myalgia, pyrexia, a faint petechial rash on her legs, a CRP of 92mg/L (<5). No signs of meningism were found. A throat swab for viral pathogens (taken prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) returned negative, and blood culture showed no growth. Within a few days she returned to the Accident & Emergency Department with worsening of the rash but was again discharged. The following week she was admitted with abdominal pain and a prominent purpuric rash on her legs. Results Full blood count, Rheumatoid Factor, Anti-Nuclear Antibodies, ANCA and Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Antibodies, serum Tryptase & C1 esterase inhibitor were all within normal limits. Urine culture grew E.coli. Complement C3 was raised at 2.24 g/L (0.75-1.65) and C4 was within normal range. Her blood pressure was raised at 173/104 mmHg. Antistreptolysin O serology was also normal. Urine analysis revealed haematuria and mild proteinuria. Urine Protein:Creatinine ratio of 22mg/mmol (normal <50). Her purpuric rash had progressed, and she had further abdominal pain. She had taken co-codamol which led to nausea & constipation. She had avoided NSAIDs. Her CRP by this stage was 131mg/L. Clinically the rash on the legs, abdominal pain and haematuria was consistent with HSP. She was started on Prednisolone 10mg od, tapering in 2.5mg per week decrements. The patient was discharged home but returned the following weekend with cramping abdominal pain radiating to the back. Abdominal Xray showed dilated colon at the splenic flexure. After review by the Surgical on call team, a CT Abdomen & Pelvis showed a right adrenal haemorrhage, and inflammatory change in both adrenals. Although she did not display clinical signs of Addisonian crisis or sepsis, she was transferred to HDU for monitoring. Her blood pressure was 151/86 mmHg and her serum urea & electrolytes were normal. The Prednisolone dose was changed to Hydrocortisone, and the dose increased to cover stress of acute illness. MRI of the adrenal glands confirmed right adrenal haemorrhage but showed no evidence of aneurysms or tumours. Antiphospholipid & Cryoglobulins screens were negative. Further blood cultures, pneumococcal and legionella antigens returned negative. Viral Hepatitis screen (A, B & E) was negative. Synacthen test revealed a suboptimal response (Cortisol t0=181nmol/L, t30=260nmol/L, normal response >420nmol/L). Adrenal Autoantibodies returned negative. She was discharged home on oral hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone and remained well at Rheumatology and Endocrine follow up. Conclusion Adrenal haemorrhage is a rare complication of HSP and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in such patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and vasculitic rash.

However, antigens in tumor vaccines can be easily cleared by the reticuloendothelium system in advance, which leads to poor therapeutic effect of tumor vaccines. Moreover, it was still hard to monitor the fate and distribution of antigens. To address these limitations, we synthesized a traceable nanovaccine based on gold nanocluster-labeled antigens and upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for the treatment of melanoma in this study.

54761,Live-attenuated oral polio vaccine as a potential source of protection against COVID-19 – Review of literature,2021-05-29,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and first reported in December 2019 at Wuhan, China, has since then progressed into an ongoing global pandemic. The primary organ targeted by the virus is the pulmonary system, leading to interstitial pneumonia and subsequent oxygen dependency and morbidity. Computed tomography (CT) has been used by various centers as an imaging modality for the assessment of severity of lung involvement in individuals. Two popular systems of scoring lung involvement on CT are CT semiquantitative score (SQ) and CT severity score (CT-SS), both of which assess extent of pulmonary involvement by interstitial pneumonia and are partly based upon subjective evaluation. Our cross-sectional observational study aims to assess the interobserver reliability of these scores, as well as to assess the statistical correlation between the respective CT scores to severity of clinical outcome. RESULTS: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores showed an excellent interobserver reliability (ICC 0.91 and 0.93, respectively, p < 0.05). The CT-SS was marginally more sensitive (99.2%) in detecting severe COVID pneumonia than SQ (86.5%). The positive predictive value of SQ (98.3%) is more than CT-SS (78%) for detecting severe disease. The similarity of interobserver reliability obtained for both scores reiterates the respective cutoff CT scores proposed by the above systems, as 18 for SQ and 19.5 for CT-SS. CONCLUSION: Both the SQ and CT-SS scores display excellent interobserver reliability. The CT-SS was more sensitive in detecting severe COVID pneumonia and may thus be preferred over the SQ as an initial radiological tool in predicting severity of infection.","Andrew, Dhilip; Shyam, Karthik; Cicilet, Soumya; Johny, Jovis",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211928/,176
55160,COVID‐19 Disproportionately Impacts Students in High‐Risk Populations,2021-05-14,"Nanoscale zero-valent iron particles were investigated as an antibacterial agent against two Gram-positive bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus NRRL B-313 (S. aureus), Bacillus subtilus NRC (B. subtilus), and two Gram-negative bacteria; Escherichia coli NRC B-3703 (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa NRC B-32 (Ps. aeruginosa). The characterization of synthesized nZVI particles was obtained by XRD, SEM, EDX, and TG analyses. The results demonstrated that the nZVI particles have a spherical shape, mean crystalline size of 44.43 nm, and exhibited a good chemical and thermal stability performance under different physical conditions. The bacterial suspensions were subjected to the treatment using nZVI particle suspensions with a concentration of 10 mg/mL. The minimum inhibitory concentration of nZVI particles was determined using the well diffusion assay method and found to be 15, 10, 10, and 5 mg for the following four strains; S. aureus, B. subtilus, E. coli, and Ps. aeruginosa, respectively. The biological treatment results of municipal wastewater using nZVI particles revealed that the counts of total bacteria, total coliform, fecal coliform, S. aureus, fecal Streptococcus, and E. coli were decreased to 44.29%, 51.76%, 90.95%, 46.67%, 33.33%, and 93.89%, respectively, while the Ps. aeruginosa not detected in the wastewater sample. The enhanced inactivation performance of nZVI nanoparticles was mainly attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, releasing of iron corrosion products like Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) ions, and direct friction of nZVI particles with bacterial cells membranes. In addition, the nZVI particles presented a striking disinfection behavior in comparison with other widespread disinfection technologies such as chlorination. Accordingly, the obtained results introduce the nZVI particles as a promising disinfection technology.

56559,"Co-design of cardiac rehabilitation delivery in the aftermath of COVID-19, putting the patient view back in the picture",2021-07-29,"INTRODUCTION: The present article describes two interrelated studies that examine gender typicality in young adulthood using a new dual-identity approach. METHODS: Participants were recruited online from March 2020 to February 2021 and reported their perceived similarity to own- and other-gender peers as a way to assess their gender typicality. In study 1, the authors conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test and validate the Perceived Similarity to Gender Groups Scale in a sample of Italian young adults (n = 571; M(age) = 23.9; SD = 3.60). The authors documented the configural, metric, scalar measurement invariance, and validity. In study 2, the Perceived Similarity to Gender Groups Scale adopted in study 1 was used to assess the distribution of different typologies of gender typicality in another sample of Italian young adults who vary in gender and sexual orientation (n = 1126; M(age) = 24.3; SD = 3.51). RESULTS: Results confirmed the structural validity of the Perceived Similarity to Gender Groups Scale, revealing the two-factor structure of the scale. Moreover, results of cluster analysis found different typologies of self-perceptions of gender typicality. CONCLUSION: Both studies emphasize the relevance of studying gender typicality in young adulthood through a dual-identity approach, highlighting the relevance of gender and sexual orientations. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The use of the dual-identity approach has significant social and clinical implications as it represents a more flexible and representative model of the complexity of gender typicality.

METHODS: Transcriptome data of 81 NSCLC patients and the GEO database were used to download matching clinical data (access number: GSE120622). Form the expression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TICS values were calculated and grouped according to TICS values, and we used mRNA expression profile data to perform GSEA in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Biological process (GO) analysis and DAVID and KOBAS were used to undertake pathway enrichment (KEGG) analysis of differential genes. Use protein interaction (PPI) to analyze the database STRING, and construct a PPI network model of target interaction. RESULTS: We obtained 6 significantly related immune cells including activated B cells through the above analysis (Figure 1(b), p < 0.001). Based on the TICS values of significantly correlated immune cells, 41 high-risk and 40 low-risk samples were obtained. TICS values and immune score values were subjected to Pearson correlation coefficient calculation, and TICS and IMS values were found to be significantly correlated (Cor = 0.7952). Based on non-small-cell lung cancer mRNA expression profile data, a substantial change in mRNA was found between both the high TICS group as well as the low TICS group (FDR 0.01, FC > 2). The researchers discovered 730 mRNAs that were considerably upregulated in the high TICS group and 121 mRNAs that were considerably downregulated in the low TICS group. High confidence edges (combined score >0.7) were selected using STRING data; then, 191 mRNAs were matched to the reciprocal edges; finally, an undirected network including 164 points and 777 edges was constructed. Important members of cellular chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, such as CCL19, affect patient survival time. CONCLUSION: (1) The longevity of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer was substantially connected with the presence of immature B cells, activated B cells, MDSC, effector memory CD4 T cells, eosinophils, and regulatory T cells. (2) Immune-related genes such as CX3CR1, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR7, which are associated with the survival of NSCLC, affect the prognosis of NSCLC patients by regulating the immune process.","Sun, Heng; Sui, Bowen; Li, Yu; Yan, Jun; Cao, Mingming; Zhang, Lijia; Liu, Songjiang",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481062/,176

It inflames air sacs in lungs which fill with fluid which further leads to problems in respiration. Pneumonia is interpreted by radiologists by observing abnormality in lungs in case of fluid in Chest X-Rays. Computer Aided Detection Diagnosis (CAD) tools can assist radiologists by improving their diagnostic accuracy. Such CAD tools use neural networks which are trained on Chest X-Ray dataset to classify a Chest X-Ray into normal or infected with Pneumonia. Convolution neural networks have shown remarkable performance in object detection in an image. Quaternion Convolution neural network (QCNN) is a generalization of conventional convolution neural networks. QCNN treats all three channels (R, G, B) of color image as a single unit and it extracts better representative features and which further improves classification. In this paper, we have trained Quaternion residual network on a publicly available large Chest X-Ray dataset on Kaggle repository and obtained classification accuracy of 93.75% and F-score of .94.

In other contexts, however, generating an error can foster valuable learning opportunities. For instance, generating errors can improve memory for correct answers. In two surveys conducted at three large public universities in North America, we investigated undergraduate students' and instructors' awareness of the pedagogical benefits of generating errors, as well as related practices, attitudes, and beliefs. Surveyed topics included the incorporation of errors into learning activities, opinions about the consequences of studying errors, and approaches to feedback. Many students had an aversion towards making errors during learning and did not use opportunities to engage in errorful generation, yet studied or analysed errors when they occurred. Many instructors had a welcoming attitude towards errors that occur during learning, yet varied in providing students with resources that facilitate errorful generation. Overall, these findings reveal the prevalence of an ambivalent approach to errors: Students and instructors avoid generating errors but prioritise learning from them when they occur. These results have important implications for the implementation of pretesting, productive failure, and other error-focused learning techniques in educational contexts.","Pan, Steven C; Sana, Faria; Samani, Joshua; Cooke, James; Kim, Joseph A",Memory,https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2020.1815790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928077/,176

This is why disagreements about the justifiability of forced caesareans tend to be pervasive and intractable. To sidestep this deadlock, we will focus on conditions that give rise to the 'caesarean dilemma' in the first place, namely the conflict between inherent norms and values medical professionals are committed to by virtue of being a medical professional. Using the reflective equilibrium, we will test the opponents' and proponents' considered judgments about forced caesareans against the norms and values they-as medical professionals-are committed to and determine whether they are coherent. Subsequently we will identify the proponents' incoherencies between the considered judgments and norms and values they are committed to and conclude that as long as these incoherencies are in place, forced caesareans are morally impermissible.","Ismaili M'hamdi, Hafez; de Beaufort, Inez",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2018-104828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30181162/,176

We sought to study the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer patients in our center. METHODS We initiated a retrospectively study to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer patients in our center, who were accepted for routine anticancer treatment before the epidemic and planned to return to hospital in January and February of 2020. RESULTS A total of 161 cases of lung cancer were included in the final analysis. As of April 15, 95 patients had delayed their return visit, and 47 cases were finally designated as having delayed admission during the epidemic and having to discontinue or delay their regular anticancer treatments. Of these 47 delayed patients, 33 were evaluated for tumor status using a computed tomography scan, 6 of these 33 cases (18.18%) were diagnosed as progressive disease (PD), and 5 cases did not return for visit. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study investigating impact of COVID-19 on non-COVID-19 lung cancer patients during the pandemic. The study demonstrates the significant impact of the COVID-19 crisis on oncological care, indicating the need for appropriate change of treatment decisions and continued follow-up and psycho-oncological support during this pandemic.","Sha, Zhou; Chang, Kejie; Mi, Jiaoping; Liang, Zibin; Hu, Liyang; Long, Fengjiao; Shi, Haiyan; Lin, Zhong; Wang, Xiaojin; Pei, Xiaofeng",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33065788/,176

64437,"Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Emergency Restructuring in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic-Henry Ford Hospital, Michigan.",2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND Contrast-enhanced diagnostic imaging techniques are considered useful in veterinary and human medicine to evaluate liver perfusion and focal hepatic lesions. Although hepatic diseases are a common occurrence in reptile medicine, there is no reference to the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) to evaluate the liver in lizards. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of change in echogenicity and attenuation of the liver in green iguanas (Iguana iguana) after administration of specific contrast media. RESULTS An increase in liver echogenicity and density was evident during CEUS and CECT, respectively. In CEUS, the mean ± SD (median; range) peak enhancement was 19.9% ± 7.5 (18.3; 11.7-34.6). Time to peak enhancement was 134.0 ± 125.1 (68.4; 59.6-364.5) seconds. During CECT, first visualization of the contrast medium was at 3.6 ± 0.5 (4; 3-4) seconds in the aorta, 10.7 ± 2.2 (10.5; 7-14) seconds in the hepatic arteries, and 15 ± 4.5 (14.5; 10-24) seconds in the liver parenchyma. Time to peak was 14.1 ± 3.4 (13; 11-21) and 31 ± 9.6 (29; 23-45) seconds in the aorta and the liver parenchyma, respectively. CONCLUSION CEUS and dynamic CECT are practical means to determine liver hemodynamics in green iguanas. Distribution of contrast medium in iguana differed from mammals. Specific reference ranges of hepatic perfusion for diagnostic evaluation of the liver in iguanas are necessary since the use of mammalian references may lead the clinician to formulate incorrect diagnostic suspicions.","Nardini, Giordano; Di Girolamo, Nicola; Leopardi, Stefania; Paganelli, Irene; Zaghini, Anna; Origgi, Francesco C; Vignoli, Massimo",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/1746-6148-10-112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24885935/,176

Little has been published about the prevention of lens obstruction specifically due to a contaminated camera port used for laparoscopic surgery. The aim of our study is to develop a new device, the Endowiper, for cleaning the laparoscopic port. MATERIALS The new cleaner for the port's valve is made from rolled gauze. To simulate a surgical environment in the laboratory, we have used pseudo-blood to smudge the port's valve. METHOD In order to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the Endowiper, we compared our method using this device with three previously reported port cleaning methods. These methods included use of gauze tightly wrapped around an endoscopic dissecting cramp, a small piece of gauze grasped by an endoscopic dissecting cramp, and a swab. We repeated the performance tests 280 times, 240 using a 12-mm trocar port and 40 with a 5-mm port. RESULTS With the 12-mm port, the complete port clearance rate achieved was 83.3% by Endowiper, 56.7% by wrapped gauze, 36.7% by small gauze, and 40.0% by swab. Trouble rate encountered during the procedure was 0% by Endowiper, 1.7% by wrapped gauze, 15% by small gauze, and 90% by swab. For the 5-mm port, the complete port clearance rate was 85% by Endowiper and 20% by sterile swab. The trouble rate was 0% by Endowiper and 30% by swab. Endowiper had a significantly superior result related to clearance rate than the other three methods in both the 12- (p < 0.001) and 5-mm (p < 0.001) ports. For trouble rate, Endowiper had a significantly superior result in both the 12- (p < 0.001) and 5-mm (p < 0.01) ports. CONCLUSION This Endowiper will be an inexpensive device with a benefit to laparoscopic surgeons.","Kobayashi, Eiji; Kakuda, Mamoru; Tanaka, Yusuke; Morimoto, Akiko; Egawa-Takata, Tomomi; Matsuzaki, Shinya; Kimura, Toshihiro; Ueda, Yutaka; Yoshino, Kiyoshi; Nakajima, Kiyokazu; Kimura, Tadashi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4229-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091981/,176

With a focus on the meat processing sector, this paper considers the short, medium, and potential long-term implications of the pandemic for food supply chains. A series of short-run demand and supply shocks affected the food system. The pandemic has generated a lively discourse around the adaptability and resilience of food supply chains in the medium to longer term. Scale and scope economies in meat processing offer significant cost and efficiency advantages, while a more dispersed industry structure can be more flexible. The pandemic is likely to accelerate the adoption of automation and digitalization within food supply chains. The Covid-19 pandemic also focused consumer attention on the food system and the nature of food supply chains. Consumers' underlying food values may shape their response to uncertainty during a pandemic. The pandemic offers lessons for the food industry in proactively identifying and addressing points of vulnerability within supply chains.","Hobbs, Jill E",Meat science,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2021.108459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602591/,176

69552,The dermatology and aesthetic practices in the era of COVID-19.,2020-07-29,"Alexithymia is defined as the lack of words to describe emotions and is associated with different psychopathologies. Various tools have been developed for measuring alexithymia; each has its limitations. A new questionnaire, Perth Alexithymia Questionnaire (PAQ), was developed to simultaneously assess positive and negative dimensions. Validation of such a tool in different cultures allows cross-cultural health psychology studies and facilitates knowledge transfer in the field. We aimed to examine the psychometric features of the PAQ in the Farsi-speaking population in Iran. Four-hundred-twenty-nine university students were asked to complete the PAQ, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and emotion regulation questionnaire (ERQ). Concurrent validity, discriminant validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability and factor structure were investigated. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a five-factor model identical to the original questionnaire. The questionnaire indicated good internal consistency (0.82 < α < 0.94). Test-retest reliability was acceptable for all subscales. The correlations between PAQ and its subscales with BDI-II, BAI, and TAS, and expression suppression subscale of ERQ were strong for concurrent validity. Concerning the discriminant validity, PAQ and its subscales were not correlated with reappraisal subscales of ERQ. The present findings suggest that the Farsi version of PAQ has strong psychometric properties and is appropriate for use in the Farsi-speaking population.","Lashkari, Arezou; Dehghani, Mohsen; Sadeghi-Firoozabadi, Vahid; Heidari, Mahmood; Khatibi, Ali",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.657660; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935916/,176
69599,COVID-19 Testing as a Contributory Cause of Delayed Treatment of a Pyogenic Liver Abscess.,2020-12-30,"BACKGROUND Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and delirium are the most common perioperative cognitive complications in older adults undergoing surgery. A recent study of cardiac surgery patients suggests that physical frailty is a risk factor for both complications. We sought to examine the relationship between preoperative frailty and postoperative delirium and preoperative frailty and POCD after major noncardiac surgery. METHODS We performed a prospective cohort study of patients >65 years old having major elective noncardiac surgery with general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were preexisting dementia, inability to consent, cardiac, intracranial, or emergency surgery. Preoperative frailty was determined using the FRAIL scale, a simple questionnaire that categorizes patients as robust, prefrail, or frail. Delirium was assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) twice daily, starting in the recovery room until hospital discharge. All patients were assessed with neuropsychological tests (California Verbal Learning Test II, Trail Making Test, subtests from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Logical Memory Story A, Immediate and Delayed Recall, Animal and Vegetable verbal fluency, Boston Naming Test, and the Mini-Mental Status Examination) before surgery and at 3 months afterward. RESULTS A total of 178 patients met inclusion criteria; 167 underwent major surgery and 150 were available for follow-up 3 months after surgery. The median age was 70 years old. Thirty-one patients (18.6%) tested as frail, and 72 (43.1%) prefrail before surgery. After adjustment for baseline cognitive score, age, education, surgery duration, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status, type of surgery, and sex, patients who tested frail or prefrail had an estimated 2.7 times the odds of delirium (97.5% confidence interval, 1.0-7.3) when compared to patients who were robust. There was no significant difference between the proportion of POCD between patients who tested as frail, prefrail, or robust. CONCLUSIONS After adjustment for baseline cognition, testing as frail or prefrail with the FRAIL scale is associated with increased odds of postoperative delirium, but not POCD after noncardiac surgery.","Mahanna-Gabrielli, Elizabeth; Zhang, Kathy; Sieber, Frederick E; Lin, Hung Mo; Liu, Xiaoyu; Sewell, Margaret; Deiner, Stacie G; Boockvar, Kenneth S",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32384341/,176

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of proximal aspiration thrombectomy (PAT) using a balloon-tipped guide catheter for clot-burden reduction in such cases with period-to-period analysis (period 1 : standard MT without PAT; period 2 : PAT first, then standard MT for the remaining occlusion). METHODS Eighty-six patients who underwent MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion were included in this analysis from the prospectively maintained stroke registry (33 patients in period 1 and 53 in period 2). In period 2, 'responder' was defined as a case where some amount of clot was retrieved by PAT and the following angiography showed partial or full recanalization. RESULTS Fifteen of fifty-three patients in period 2 (28.3%) were 'responders' to PAT. There was a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation in the 'responder' subgroup. Period 2 showed a significantly shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time (94.5 minutes vs. 56.0 minutes; p=0.002), a significantly higher Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction of 2b-3 reperfusion (45.5% vs. 73.6%; p=0.009), but only a trend for better 3-month favorable outcome (mRS 0-2; 36.4% vs. 54.7%; p=0.097). There was no increase in the incidence of procedure-related complications or intracranial hemorrhage in period 2. CONCLUSION A strategy of PAT before standard MT may result in shorter puncture-to-reperfusion time and better angiographic outcome than a strategy of standard MT for acute intracranial ICA occlusion.","Kim, Yong-Won; Kang, Dong-Hun; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Park, Jaechan; Kim, Yong-Sun",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2016.59.4.379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27446520/,176

A review of the literature.,2020-09-24,"Although flow-diverting devices are promising treatment options for intracranial aneurysms, jailed side branches might occlude leading to insufficient blood supply. Especially differences in the local stent strut compression may have a drastic influence on subsequent endothelialization. To investigate the outcome of different treatment scenarios, over- and undersized stent deployments were realized experimentally and computationally. Two Pipeline Embolization Devices were placed in the right common carotid artery of large white swine, crossing the right ascending pharyngeal artery. DSA and PC-MRI measurements were acquired pre- and post-stenting and after three months. To evaluate the stent strut endothelialization and the corresponding ostium patency, the swine were sacrificed and scanning electron microscopy measurements were carried out. A more detailed analysis of the near-stent hemodynamics was enabled by a realistic virtual stenting in combination with highly resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations using case-specific boundary conditions. The oversizing resulted in an elongated stent deployment with more open stent pores, while for the undersized case a shorter deployment with more condensed pores was present. In consequence, the side branch of the first case remained patent after three months and the latter almost fully occluded. The virtual investigation confirmed the experimental findings by identifying differences between the individual velocities as well as stent shear stresses at the distal part of the ostia. The choice of flow-diverting device and the subsequent deployment strategy strongly influences the patency of jailed side branches. Therefore, careful treatment planning is required, to guarantee sufficient blood supply in the brain territories supplied those branches.","Berg, Philipp; Iosif, Christina; Ponsonnard, Sebastien; Yardin, Catherine; Janiga, Gábor; Mounayer, Charbel",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2015.10.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26607220/,176

The objective of this review was to summarize current evidence regarding the use of cloth masks to prevent respiratory viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), among health care clinicians. METHODS We searched 5 databases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, and the reference lists of identified articles on April 3, 2020. All identified publications were independently screened by 2 reviewers. Two authors independently extracted data and graded the studies. Randomized control trials (RCTs) were graded using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist, and observational and nonhuman subject studies were graded using 11 domains common across frequently used critical appraisal tools. All discrepancies were resolved by consensus. RESULTS Our search identified 136 original publications. Nine studies met inclusion criteria. We performed a qualitative synthesis of the data from these studies. Four nonrandomized trials, 3 laboratory studies, 1 single-case experiment, and 1 RCT were identified. The laboratory studies found that cloth materials provided measurable levels of particle filtration but were less efficacious at blocking biologic material than medical masks. The RCT found that cloth masks were associated with significantly more viral infections than medical masks. CONCLUSIONS The current literature suggests that cloth materials are somewhat efficacious in filtering particulate matter and aerosols but provide a worse fit and inferior protection compared to medical masks in clinical environments. The quality and quantity of literature addressing this question are lacking. Cloth masks lack evidence for adequate protection of health care clinicians against respiratory viral infections.","Daoud, Ariel Kiyomi; Hall, Jessica Kole; Petrick, Haylie; Strong, Anne; Piggott, Cleveland",Annals of family medicine,https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431393/,176

The modified Langmuir model gives us access to the maximum amount of adsorbed protein, the apparent binding constant, and Gibbs free energy. Furthermore, we employ the method to investigate the influence of the nanoparticle size on the adsorption of human serum albumin and find that the amount of adsorbed protein increases more than the surface area per nanoparticle for larger diameters.","Bernhard, Christoph; van Zadel, Marc-Jan; Bunn, Alexander; Bonn, Mischa; Gonella, Grazia",The journal of physical chemistry.

We hypothesized that an electronic nose (eNose) could fulfill this need. An eNose can discriminate various lung diseases through the analysis of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs). An eNose is cheap and noninvasive and yields results within minutes. In a single-center prospective cohort study, we included patients who were treated with chemotherapy expected to result in PCIN. Based on standardized indications, a full diagnostic workup was performed to confirm invasive aspergillosis or to rule it out. Patients with no aspergillosis were considered controls, and patients with probable or proven aspergillosis were considered index cases. Exhaled breath was examined with a Cyranose 320 (Smith Detections, Pasadena, CA). The resulting data were analyzed using principal component reduction. The primary endpoint was cross-validated diagnostic accuracy, defined as the percentage of patients correctly classified using the leave-one-out method. Accuracy was validated by 100,000 random classifications. We included 46 subjects who underwent 16 diagnostic workups, resulting in 6 cases and 5 controls. The cross-validated accuracy of the eNose in diagnosing IA was 90.9% (P = 0.022; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 83.3%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.93. These preliminary data indicate that PCIN patients with IA have a distinct exhaled VOC profile that can be detected with eNose technology. The diagnostic accuracy of the eNose for invasive aspergillosis warrants validation.","de Heer, Koen; van der Schee, Marc P; Zwinderman, Koos; van den Berk, Inge A H; Visser, Caroline Elisabeth; van Oers, Rien; Sterk, Peter J",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.02838-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23467602/,176

A systematic literature review of Coronavirus related diseases in Pakistan.,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Barrett's esophagus (BE) with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) can progress to high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for LGD in clinical trials, but its effectiveness in clinical practice is unclear. We compared the rate of progression of LGD after RFA with endoscopic surveillance alone in routine clinical practice. METHODS We performed a retrospective study of patients who either underwent RFA (n = 45) or surveillance endoscopy (n = 125) for LGD, confirmed by at least 1 expert pathologist, from October 1992 through December 2013 at 3 medical centers in the United States. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the association between progression and RFA. RESULTS Data were collected over median follow-up periods of 889 days (interquartile range, 264-1623 days) after RFA and 848 days (interquartile range, 322-2355 days) after surveillance endoscopy (P = .32). The annual rates of progression to HGD or EAC were 6.6% in the surveillance group and 0.77% in the RFA group. The risk of progression to HGD or EAC was significantly lower among patients who underwent RFA than those who underwent surveillance (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.06; 95% confidence interval: 0.008-0.48).

The patient presented to our medical centre with a hepatic mass. She underwent extensive diagnostic workup. The consistent findings of an abdominal CT scan, coupled with her clinical history, insinuated a preoperative diagnosis of atypical hepatic haemangioma. After a detailed discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting, a standard right hemihepatectomy was performed. She had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged in stable condition after 1 week. Surprisingly, pathological examination and immunohistochemistry of the resected specimen divulged the diagnosis of a grade II primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumour.

In robotic procedures, we employed a ""top down technique"" to allow early identification of the gastrocolic trunk and middle colic vessels. The aim of our study was to illustrate the details of this technique in a series of 12 patients. METHODS The top down technique consists of two steps. First, the omental bursa was entered to identify the right gastroepiploic vein. Tracing down this vein as a landmark, the gastrocolic trunk was exposed, branches of this trunk and the middle colic vessels were divided. Second, dissection was directed to the ileocolic region and proceeded in an inferior-to-superior direction along the superior mesenteric vein to divide the ileocolic and right colic vessels consecutively. The ileotranverse anastomosis was created intracorporeally. RESULTS There were 8 males and 4 females with a mean age of 64.8 ± 16.9 years and a mean body mass index of 25.6 ± 3.7 kg/m2. All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversions occurred. The mean operative time and blood loss were 312.1 ± 93.9 min and 110.0 ± 89.9 ml, respectively. The mean number of harvested lymph nodes was 45.2 ± 11.1. The mean length of hospital stay was 7.6 ± 4.7 days. Two patients had intraoperative complications and two had postoperative complications. There was no disease recurrence at a mean follow-up period of 10.4 ± 7.1 months. CONCLUSIONS The top down technique appears to be useful in robotic CME for an extended right hemicolectomy. Early identification of the gastrocolic trunk and middle colic vessels via this technique may prevent inadvertent vascular injury at the mesenteric root of the transverse colon.","Hamzaoglu, I; Ozben, V; Sapci, I; Aytac, E; Aghayeva, A; Bilgin, I A; Bayraktar, I E; Baca, B; Karahasanoglu, T",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-018-1831-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30083781/,176

Cultural and biological inheritance are two separate so-called channels of inheritance, two sub-systems of the sum total of developmental resources travelling in distinct ways between individual agents. This paper asks: what justifies this assumption? In reply, a philosophical account is offered that points at three related but distinct criteria that (taken together) make the distinction between cultural and biological inheritance not only precise but also justify it as real, i.e. as ontologically adequate. These three criteria are (i) the autonomy of cultural change, (ii) the near-decomposability of culture and (iii) differences in temporal order between cultural and biological inheritance.

However, poor conductivity, severe volume change, and harmful aggregation of the material during charge/discharge lead to unsatisfying electrochemical performance. Herein, a facile and green strategy for yolk-shell structure based on the principle of metal evaporation is proposed. SnS2 nanoparticle is encapsulated in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanobox (SnS2 @C). The carbon nanoboxes accommodate the volume change and aggregation of SnS2 during cycling, and form 3D continuous conductive carbon matrix by close contact. The well-designed structure benefits greatly in conductivity and structural stability of the material. As expected, SnS2 @C exhibits considerable capacity, superior cycling stability, and excellent rate capability in both SIBs and PIBs. Additionally, in situ Raman technology is unprecedentedly conducted to investigate the phase evolution of polysulfides. This work provides an avenue for facilely constructing stable and high-capacity metal dichalcogenide based anodes materials with optimized structure engineering. The proposed in-depth electrochemical measurements coupled with in situ and ex situ characterizations will provide fundamental understandings for the storage mechanism of metal dichalcogenides.","Sun, Qing; Li, Deping; Dai, Linna; Liang, Zhen; Ci, Lijie",Small,https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202005023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079488/,176

It leads to significant respiratory disease and among patients with co-morbidities is associated with high mortality. This research studied the mortality rate of MERS-CoV among intensive care unit (ICU) patients and the correlation of mortality with different co-morbidities. METHODS This was a retrospective observational study conducted at the Intensive Care Unit of the King Fahad Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Data was obtained through patient chart review. RESULTS The total sample consisted of 52 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection patients. 39 patients died, with a 75% case-fatality rate. Many patients had underlying co-morbidities, including diabetes mellitus (51.9%), hypertension (46.2%), and chronic renal disease (21.2%).

81429,COVID-19 salivary signature: diagnostic and research opportunities.,2020-08-07,"OBJECTIVES Severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are characterized by an excessive production of inflammatory cytokines. Activated monocytes secrete high levels of cytokines. Human monocytes are divided into three major populations: conventional (CD14posCD16neg), non-classical (CD14dimCD16pos), and intermediate (CD14posCD16pos) monocytes. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the distribution of conventional (CD16neg) and CD16pos monocytes is different in patients with COVID-19 and whether the variations could be predictive of the outcome of the disease. METHODS We performed a prospective study on 390 consecutive patients referred to the Emergency Unit, with a proven diagnosis of SARS-CoV 2 infection by RT-PCR. Using the CytoDiff™ reagent, an automated routine leukocyte differential, we quantified CD16neg and CD16pos monocytes. RESULTS In the entire population, median CD16neg and CD16pos monocyte levels (0.398 and 0.054 × 109/L, respectively) were in the normal range [(0.3-0.7 × 109/L) and (0.015-0.065 × 109/L), respectively], but the 35 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) had a significantly (p<0.001) lower CD16pos monocyte count (0.018 × 109/L) in comparison to the 70 patients who were discharged (0.064 × 109/L) or were hospitalized in conventional units (0.058 × 109/L). By ROC curve analysis, the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] was highly discriminant to identify patients requiring ICU hospitalization: with a cut-off 193.1, the sensitivity and the specificity were 74.3 and 81.8%, respectively (area under the curve=0.817). CONCLUSIONS Quantification of CD16pos monocytes and the ratio [absolute neutrophil count/CD16pos monocyte count] could constitute a marker of the severity of disease in COVID-19 patients.","Vasse, Marc; Zuber, Benjamin; Goubeau, Laurie; Ballester, Marie-Christine; Roumier, Mathilde; Delcominette, Frédérique; Habarou, Florence; Jolly, Emilie; Ackermann, Felix; Cerf, Charles; Farfour, Eric; Pascreau, Tiffany",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-1801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606928/,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS A young surgeon opened a division of general thoracic surgery at a medical institution. The surgeon had performed about 100 lobectomies via conventional thoracotomy during his training period, but had never performed a VATS lobectomy unassisted while under the supervision of an expert. After opening the division of general thoracic surgery, the surgeon performed a total of 38 pulmonary lobectomies for various pulmonary diseases from March 2009 to February 2010. All data were collected retrospectively. RESULTS There were 14 lobectomies via thoracotomy, 14 VATS lobectomies, and 10 cases of attempted VATS lobectomies that were converted to open thoracotomies. The number of VATS lobectomies increased from the second quarter (n=0) to the third quarter (n=5). The lobectomies that were converted from VATS into thoracotomies decreased from the second quarter (n=5) to the third quarter (n=1) (p=0.002). CONCLUSION It can take 6 months for young surgeons without experience in VATS lobectomy in their training period to be able to reliably perform a VATS lobectomy.","Ra, Yong Joon; Ahn, Hyo Yeong; Kim, Min Su",The Korean journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.5090/kjtcs.2012.45.3.166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22708084/,176

Based on a case series with unusual and massive early recurrences, we analyse the issue of tumour cell reimplantation. METHODS This hypothesis was developed on the basis of two out of seven patients treated by circumferential (n=6) or nearly circumferential (n=1) en bloc and R0 endoscopic resection of T1 neoplastic BE. Subsequently, a prospective histocytological analysis of endoscope channels and accessories was performed in 2 phases (cytohistological analysis; test for cell viability) in 22 different oesophageal carcinoma patients undergoing endoscopy. Finally, cultures from two oesophageal adenocarcinoma cell lines were incubated with different triamcinolone concentrations (0.625-10 mg/mL); cell growth was determined on a Multiwell plate reader. RESULTS Cancer regrowth in the two suspicious cases (male, 78/71 years) occurred 7 and 1 months, respectively, after curative tumour resection. Subsequent surgery showed advanced tumours (T2) with lymph node metastases; one patient died. On cytohistological examinations of channels and accessories, suspicious/neoplastic cells were found in 4/10 superficial and in all 5 advanced cancers. Further analyses in seven further advanced adenocarcinoma cases showed viable cells in two channel washing specimens. Finally, cell culture experiments demonstrated enhanced tumour cell growth by triamcinolone after 24 hours compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS Tumour cell reimplanation from contaminated endoscopes and accessories is a possible cause of local recurrence after curative endoscopic therapy for superficial Barrett carcinoma; also, corticosteroid injection could have promoted tumour regrowth in these cases.","Ehlken, Hanno; Schmitz, Rüdiger; Riethdorf, Sabine; Riethdorf, Lutz; Krause, Jenny; Karstens, Karl-Frederick; Schrader, Jörg; Viol, Fabrice; Giannou, Anastasios; Sterlacci, William; Vieth, Michael; Clauditz, Till; Kähler, Christian; Mann, Oliver; Izbicki, Jakob R; Huber, Samuel; Pantel, Klaus; Rösch, Thomas",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2020-322723; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33441377/,176

To examine this association and to establish a suitable cut-off value for AUC24/MIC, a multicentre prospective observational study was conducted in patients with MRSA bacteraemia. Data were collected on all patients aged ≥18 years with MRSA bacteraemia treated with vancomycin for ≥72 h without dialysis. The MIC was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and Etest. Treatment failure was defined as (i) 30-day mortality, (ii) persistent bacteraemia (≥7 days) and (iii) recurrence (≤30 days after completion of therapy). AUC24 was estimated by a Bayesian approach based on individual vancomycin concentrations. The AUC24/MIC cut-off value for differentiating treatment success and failure was calculated by Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis. In total, 117 patients were enrolled, among which vancomycin treatment failure occurred in 38 (32.5%). In univariate analysis, high vancomycin MIC and low trough levels were unrelated to treatment outcomes. In the CART analysis, low vancomycin AUC24/MIC [<392.7 (BMD) and <397.2 (Etest)] was associated with treatment failure. In multivariate analysis, low AUC24/MIC was a risk factor for treatment failure [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=3.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-8.82 by BMD; aOR=5.61, 95% CI 2.07-15.24 by Etest]. AUC24/MIC is associated with vancomycin treatment outcomes in MRSA bacteraemia, and seeking individualised AUC24/MIC ratios above target (>400) may improve treatment outcomes.","Song, Kyoung-Ho; Kim, Hong Bin; Kim, Hyung-sook; Lee, Myung Jin; Jung, Younghee; Kim, Gayeon; Hwang, Jeong-Hwan; Kim, Nak-Hyun; Kim, Moonsuk; Kim, Chung-Jong; Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Chung, Jae-Yong; Park, Wan Beom; Kim, Eu Suk; Park, Kyoung Un; Kim, Nam Joong; Kim, Eui-Chong; Oh, Myoung-don",International journal of antimicrobial agents,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2015.09.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26555059/,176

Screening titles and abstracts (T&Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T&Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research. METHODS We identified software tools using three search methods: a web-based search; a search of the online ""systematic review toolbox""; and screening of references in existing literature. We included tools that were accessible and available for testing at the time of the study (December 2018), do not require specific computing infrastructure and provide basic screening functionality for systematic reviews. Key properties of each software tool were identified using a feature analysis adapted for this purpose. This analysis included a weighting developed by a group of medical researchers, therefore prioritising the most relevant features. The highest scoring tools from the feature analysis were then included in a user survey, in which we further investigated the suitability of the tools for supporting T&Ab screening amongst systematic reviewers working in medical research. RESULTS Fifteen tools met our inclusion criteria. They vary significantly in relation to cost, scope and intended user community. Six of the identified tools (Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, DRAGON, EPPI-Reviewer and Rayyan) scored higher than 75% in the feature analysis and were included in the user survey. Of these, Covidence and Rayyan were the most popular with the survey respondents. Their usability scored highly across a range of metrics, with all surveyed researchers (n = 6) stating that they would be likely (or very likely) to use these tools in the future. CONCLUSIONS Based on this study, we would recommend Covidence and Rayyan to systematic reviewers looking for suitable and easy to use tools to support T&Ab screening within healthcare research. These two tools consistently demonstrated good alignment with user requirements.

85942,The Emergence of Pediatric Telehealth as a Result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-01,"Mitochondrial inner membrane protein (Mitofilin or Mic60) is a mitochondria-shaping protein that plays a key role in maintaining mitochondrial cristae structure and remodeling. We recently showed that Mitofilin knockdown in H9c2 myoblasts induces mitochondrial structural damage resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction that is responsible for cell death via apoptosis. Here, we investigated the role of Mitofilin regulation in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and studied the relationship between Mitofilin and Cyclophilin (CypD), a key regulator of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening. C57Bl6 male mice hearts were subjected to different ischemia times (15, 30, or 45 min) followed by a 2h reperfusion period, or 45 min ischemia followed by 0, 15, 30, 60, or 120 min reperfusion to determine the impact of ischemia or reperfusion times on Mitofilin levels and its interaction with CypD. We found that the increase in myocardial infarct size and the reduction of mitochondrial calcium retention capacity were concomitant with Mitofilin reduction as a function of ischemic duration. We also found that 15 min reperfusion after 45 min ischemia was sufficient to cause a reduction of Mitofilin levels compared to sham, while 45 min ischemia alone was not enough to cause a significant decrease of Mitofilin. We revealed that the c-terminus coiled-coiled domain of Mitofilin is important for its interaction with CypD and the deletion of this identified sequence resulted in a loss of Mitofilin-CypD link, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in cell death. A decrease of the levels of Mitofilin was also associated with mitochondrial structural integrity damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and calpain activity. Our results indicate that Mitofilin physically binds to CypD in the inner mitochondrial membrane and the disruption of this interaction may play a critical role in the increase of mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of myocytes' death after I/R injury.","Tombo, Nathalie; Imam Aliagan, Abdulhafiz D; Feng, Yansheng; Singh, Harpreet; Bopassa, Jean C",Free radical biology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.06.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726689/,176

Pipeline™ Embolization Device (PED) has been described in several series showing high rates of occlusion and being relatively safe. OBJECTIVE Shows the experience in four different neurointerventional centres in Barcelona with the PED (Covidien) between February 2010 and October 2013. METHODS We reviewed retrospectively patients treated with PED in four neurointerventional centres in Barcelona between February 2010 and October 2013. RESULTS Forty-two patients (89.4%) with non-ruptured aneurysms and five (10.6%) post-SAH were treated, with a mean age of 51 years (range 26-76). We treated 67 aneurysms with a mean of 1.4 1-3 PED per patient. We have no mortality and three post-procedural complications with clinical consequences, two of them severe with intracranial haemorrhage and the other with anterior choroidal artery thrombosis. Follow-up was in 45 patients (65 aneurysm) achieving complete occlusion in 90.8% at 12 months of follow-up. Two aneurysms which remained without any changes were distal and fusiform including main bifurcations (3.1%). CONCLUSION Treatment by PED of fusiform or wide-neck saccular aneurysms is associated with high rates of occlusion after six and 12 months. Correct selection of the patients, aneurysms and also specific characteristics of the Pipeline device should be known in order to select the best therapeutic option. Our findings suggest that the indication must be judged case by case in the selection of suitable patients for PED therapy.","Tomasello, Alejandro; Romero, Nicolas; Aixut, Sonia; Miquel, Maria A; Macho, Juan M; Castaño, Carlos; Coscojuela, Pilar; Lemus, Miguel; Aja, Lucia; San Roman, Luis; Blasco, Jordi; Rovira, Alex",Neurological research,https://doi.org/10.1080/01616412.2016.1155335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27078708/,176
88495,Lung ultrasound in the monitoring of COVID-19 infection.,2020-05-12,"AIM The purpose of this study was to determine treatment characteristics and clinical outcome for patients with perineal hernia after abdominoperineal excision (APE). METHOD A systematic search of the literature revealed 40 individually documented patients, published between 1944 and 2010. Three additional patients treated at our centre were added. Patient characteristics, type of repair and outcome were entered into a database and a pooled analysis of these 43 patients was performed. RESULTS The pooled analysis revealed a median time interval of 8 months between APE and surgical repair of perineal hernia. The surgical approaches were perineal in 22 patients, open abdominal in 11, open abdominoperineal in three, laparoscopic in five and laparoscopic-perineal in two patients. A primary recurrence was documented in 13 patients and a second recurrence in three. The recurrence rate was 5/25 for synthetic or biological mesh, 6/12 for primary closure and 2/6 for the remaining techniques. Recurrent perineal hernia was repaired using a synthetic or biological mesh (n = 6), primary closure (n = 5) or a muscle flap (gluteus or gracilis; n = 4). CONCLUSION From these limited and biased data based on published case descriptions, it appears that the recurrence rate of primary perineal hernia repair after APE is lower with the use of a mesh or other assisted closure than with primary suture repair.","Mjoli, M; Sloothaak, D A M; Buskens, C J; Bemelman, W A; Tanis, P J",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2012.02970.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22308975/,176

The diuresis from IV rehydration may be circumvented through the concomitant use of oral glycerol. We aimed to examine the effects of rehydrating with four different regimens of IV fluid and oral glycerol on subsequent 40-km cycling time trial performance. METHODS Nine endurance-trained men were dehydrated by 4% bodyweight via exercise in the heat. They then rehydrated with 150% of the fluid lost via four protocols using a randomized crossover design: 1) oral = sports drink and water; 2) oral glycerol = sports drink, water, and glycerol; 3) IV = half as normal saline, half of sports drink, and water; and 4) IV with oral glycerol = half as normal saline, half as sports drink, water, and glycerol. After this, they completed a 40-km cycling performance test in the heat. RESULTS Compared with oral rehydration, there were significant performance benefits (P < 0.05) when rehydrating with oral glycerol (improved time to complete 40 km by 3.7%), IV (3.5%), and IV with oral glycerol (4.1%). Plasma volume restoration was highest in IV with oral glycerol, then IV, then oral glycerol, then oral (P < 0.01 for all of these comparisons). There were no differences in HR, tympanic/skin temperatures, sweat rate, blood lactate concentration, thermal stress, or RPE between groups. CONCLUSIONS Combining IV fluid with oral glycerol resulted in the greatest fluid retention; however, it did not improve exercise performance compared with either modality alone.","Van Rosendal, Simon P; Strobel, Natalie A; Osborne, Mark A; Fassett, Robert G; Coombes, Jeff S",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,https://doi.org/10.1249/mss.0b013e31825420f4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453248/,176
89566,Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on an Italian cohort of systemic sclerosis patients.,2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND Recent studies have validated the use of endovascular thrombectomy in large vessel ischemic stroke provided patients are selected appropriately. However, to our knowledge, there have been no previously reported cases of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with aortic dissection. We report three such cases, two with chronic aortic dissections (including one with a history of Marfan syndrome) and another with an acute type B dissection. METHODS Case studies and review of relevant literature. RESULTS Three patients with a history of aortic dissection presented with acute onset right middle cerebral artery syndromes, two of whom had chronic aortic dissections that were status-post graft repair, while a third had an acute type B aortic dissection that had been managed with a femoral-to-femoral bypass. None of the three were candidates for intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. All three were found to have proximal right M1 occlusions on non-invasive imaging and were taken for endovascular thrombectomy via transfemoral, transradial, and transbrachial approaches, respectively. All three had successful recanalization (with Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) 2b, TICI 3, and TICI 2b flow, respectively) along with clinical improvement, and none had procedure-related complications. CONCLUSIONS These three cases suggest that endovascular thrombectomy is feasible and can be done safely and efficaciously in patients with aortic dissections and those with Marfan syndrome, although the risks and benefits should be considered as part of any decision-making process. Given that endovascular therapy for acute stroke is now in many situations part of standard care, further studies will be necessary to delineate more precise inclusion and exclusion criteria.","Reznik, Michael E; Espinosa-Morales, Aixa Damaris; Jumaa, Mouhammad A; Zaidi, Syed; Ducruet, Andrew F; Jadhav, Ashutosh P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012397; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27199384/,176

92209,Rethinking Clinical Trials Reform During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND Patients with obstructive jaundice have various pathophysiological changes that affect the liver, kidney, heart, and the immune system. There is considerable controversy as to whether temporary relief of biliary obstruction prior to major definitive surgery (pre-operative biliary drainage) is of any benefit to the patient. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of pre-operative biliary drainage versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (direct surgery) in patients with obstructive jaundice (irrespective of a benign or malignant cause). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until February 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised clinical trials comparing biliary drainage followed by surgery versus direct surgery, performed for obstructive jaundice, irrespective of the sample size, language, and publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR), rate ratio (RaR), or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on the available patient analyses. We assessed the risk of bias (systematic overestimation of benefit or systematic underestimation of harm) with components of the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We assessed the risk of play of chance (random errors) with trial sequential analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included six trials with 520 patients comparing pre-operative biliary drainage (265 patients) versus no pre-operative biliary drainage (255 patients). Four trials used percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and two trials used endoscopic sphincterotomy and stenting as the method of pre-operative biliary drainage. The risk of bias was high in all trials. The proportion of patients with malignant obstruction varied between 60% and 100%. There was no significant difference in mortality (40/265, weighted proportion 14.9%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (34/255, 13.3%) (RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.71; P = 0.60). The overall serious morbidity was higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (60 per 100 patients in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus 26 per 100 patients in the direct surgery group) (RaR 1.66; 95% CI 1.28 to 2.16; P = 0.0002). The proportion of patients who developed serious morbidity was significantly higher in the pre-operative biliary drainage group (75/102, 73.5%) in the pre-operative biliary drainage group versus the direct surgery group (37/94, 37.4%) (P < 0.001). Quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay (2 trials, 271 patients; MD 4.87 days; 95% CI -1.28 to 11.02; P = 0.12) between the two groups. Trial sequential analysis showed that for mortality only a small proportion of the required information size had been obtained. There seemed to be no significant differences in the subgroup of trials assessing percutaneous compared to endoscopic drainage. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is currently not sufficient evidence to support or refute routine pre-operative biliary drainage for patients with obstructive jaundice. Pre-operative biliary drainage may increase the rate of serious adverse events. So, the safety of routine pre-operative biliary drainage has not been established. Pre-operative biliary drainage should not be used in patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice outside randomised clinical trials.","Fang, Yuan; Gurusamy, Kurinchi Selvan; Wang, Qin; Davidson, Brian R; Lin, He; Xie, Xiaodong; Wang, Chaohua",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005444.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22972086/,176

Here, we identify a small organic molecule, which we named Mito-C. Mito-C is targeted to mitochondria and rapidly provokes mitochondrial network fragmentation. Biochemical analyses reveal that Mito-C is a member of a new class of heterocyclic compounds that target the NEET protein family, previously reported to regulate mitochondrial iron and ROS homeostasis. One of the NEET proteins, NAF-1, is identified as an important regulator of mitochondria morphodynamics that facilitates recruitment of DRP1 to the ER-mitochondria interface. Consistent with the observation that certain viruses modulate mitochondrial morphogenesis as a necessary part of their replication cycle, Mito-C counteracts dengue virus-induced mitochondrial network hyperfusion and represses viral replication. The newly identified chemical class including Mito-C is of therapeutic relevance for pathologies where altered mitochondria dynamics is part of disease etiology and NEET proteins are highlighted as important therapeutic targets in anti-viral research.","Molino, Diana; Pila-Castellanos, Irene; Marjault, Henri-Baptiste; Dias Amoedo, Nivea; Kopp, Katja; Rochin, Leila; Karmi, Ola; Sohn, Yang-Sung; Lines, Laetitia; Hamaï, Ahmed; Joly, Stéphane; Radreau, Pauline; Vonderscher, Jacky; Codogno, Patrice; Giordano, Francesca; Machin, Peter; Rossignol, Rodrigue; Meldrum, Eric; Arnoult, Damien; Ruggieri, Alessia; Nechushtai, Rachel; de Chassey, Benoit; Morel, Etienne",EMBO reports,https://doi.org/10.15252/embr.201949019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33180995/,176

We set out to evaluate tricuspid valve anterior leaflet deformations in ovine FTR. Eleven animals (FTR group) underwent implantation of a pacemaker with high rate pacing to induce biventricular dysfunction and at least moderate TR. Subsequently, both FTR (n=11) and Control (n=12) animals underwent implantation of 6 sonomicrometry crystals around the tricuspid annulus, 4 on the anterior leaflet, and 14 on RV epicardium. Tricuspid valve geometry and anterior leaflet strains were calculated from crystal coordinates. Left ventricular ejection fraction and RV fractional area change were significantly lower in FTR animals versus Control. Tricuspid annular area, septo-lateral diameter, RV pressures were all significantly greater in the FTR group. Mean TR grade (+0-3) was 0.7±0.5 in Control and 2.4±0.5 in FTR (p=<0.001). The anterior leaflet area and length increased significantly. Global radial leaflet strain was significantly lower in FTR mostly driven by decreased free edge leaflet strain. Global circumferential anterior leaflet strain was also significantly lower in FTR with more remarkable reduction in the belly region. Rapid ventricular pacing in sheep resulted in a clinically pertinent model of RV and annular dilation with FTR and leaflet enlargement. Both circumferential and radial anterior leaflet strains were significantly reduced with FTR. Functional TR may be associated with alteration of leaflet mechanical properties.","Jazwiec, Tomasz; Malinowski, Marcin J; Ferguson, Haley; Parker, Jessica; Mrudang, Mathur; Rausch, Manuel K; Timek, Tomasz A",Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.semtcvs.2020.09.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32977016/,176

This study assessed smoking cessation and relapse rates among individuals undergoing follow-up low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) in a clinical CT lung screening program and assessed the influence of initial screening results on smoking behavior. METHODS Self-reported smoking status for individuals enrolled in a clinical CT lung screening program undergoing a follow-up CT lung screening exam between 1st February, 2014 and 31st March, 2015 was retrospectively reviewed and compared to self-reported smoking status using a standardized questionnaire at program entry. Point prevalence smoking cessation and relapse rates were calculated across the entire population and compared with exam results. All individuals undergoing screening fulfilled the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Lung Cancer Screening v1.2012(®) high-risk criteria and had an order for CT lung screening. RESULTS A total of 1,483 individuals underwent a follow-up CT lung screening exam during the study interval. Smoking status at time of follow-up exam was available for 1,461/1,483 (98.5%). A total of 46% (678/1,461) were active smokers at program entry. The overall point prevalence smoking cessation and relapse rates were 20.8% and 9.3%, respectively. Prior positive screening exam results were not predictive of smoking cessation (OR 1.092; 95% CI, 0.715-1.693) but were predictive of reduced relapse among former smokers who had stopped smoking for 2 years or less (OR 0.330; 95% CI, 0.143-0.710). Duration of program enrollment was predictive of smoking cessation (OR 0.647; 95% CI, 0.477-0.877). CONCLUSIONS Smoking cessation and relapse rates in a clinical CT lung screening program rates are more favorable than those observed in the general population. Duration of participation in the screening program correlated with increased smoking cessation rates. A positive exam result correlated with reduced relapse rates among smokers recently quit smoking.","Borondy Kitts, Andrea K; McKee, Andrea B; Regis, Shawn M; Wald, Christoph; Flacke, Sebastian; McKee, Brady J",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2016.03.11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27606076/,176

Clinically, its initial manifestation may mimic oral lichen planus or lichen sclerosus. If the habit is not halted, the mucosa gets leathery and thickened, and fibrous bands form causing significant morbidity. Microscopically, it is characterized by atrophic epithelium, loss of rete ridges, and hyalinization of lamina propria. Of note, these hallmark histological features may be overlooked in the unusual presence of lichenoid interface changes, which may lead to the wrong diagnosis. We present herein 5 cases in which the rare joint appearance of OSF and lichenoid reaction features posed a diagnostic challenge. Because of its progressive nature and malignant potential, the presence of oral lichenoid changes overlying submucous hyalinization, in the right clinical and demographic setting, should raise suspicion of OSF and prompt actions directed at quid-chewing discontinuation.

Studying mice, he made the seminal observation decades ago that epitope dominance is so unpredictable with mixed MHC haplotypes that he coined it aleatory, for dice-like. Accordingly, for every individual there is a unique potential epitope space that is defined by the polymorphic and polygenic MHC molecules (restriction elements) expressed. Of this potential epitope space, some peptides will elicit stronger T cell responses than others, bringing about the actually realized epitope space. The selection of the actually recognized peptides from the potential epitope space is random, however, resulting in unique epitope dominance and hierarchy patterns in individuals. Engaging in brute-force epitope scans, which permit the assessment of the entire potential epitope space at the highest possible resolution, we observe aleatory epitope recognition in human CD8 cell responses to viruses. Because the selection of peptide has fundamental implications for successful T cell immune monitoring, we dedicate this article to Eli Sercarz in a special issue of Critical Reviews™ in Immunology in his honor.","Lehmann, Paul V; Lehmann, Alexander A",Critical reviews in immunology,https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevimmunol.2020034838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389886/,176

STUDY DESIGN We prospectively followed all patients undergoing LESS cholecystectomy, and compared operations undertaken at our institutions in cohorts of 25 patients with respect to operative times, conversion rates, and complications. RESULTS One-hundred fifty patients of mean age 46 years underwent LESS cholecystectomy. No significant differences in operative times were demonstrable between any of the 25-patient cohorts operated on at our institution. A significant reduction in operative times (p < 0.001) after completion of 75 LESS procedures was, however, identified with the experience of a single surgeon. No significant reduction in the number of procedures requiring an additional trocar(s) or conversion to open operations was observed after completion of 25 LESS cholecystectomies. Complication rates were low, and not significantly different between any 25-patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS For surgeons proficient with multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the learning curve for LESS cholecystectomy begins near proficiency. Operative complications and conversions were infrequent and unchanged across successive 25-patient cohorts, and were similar to those reported for multi-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy after the learning curve.","Hernandez, Jonathan; Ross, Sharona; Morton, Connor; McFarlin, Kellie; Dahal, Sujat; Golkar, Farhaad; Albrink, Michael; Rosemurgy, Alexander",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2010.07.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20851645/,176

Notably, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and large amount of people have been infected. There is imminent need to investigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective therapeutic strategies to contain the epidemic. The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry into target cells, with S1 subunit binding to a cellular receptor and S2 subunit fusing viral and host membranes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), previously known as a cell receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is putatively responsible for mediating COVID-19. In this review, we detail our current understanding of the interaction between S protein and ACE2 in the process of virus infection and the potential pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, which has critical implications for exploring the potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.","Wu, Tong; Zhang, Hanqi; Hu, Erya; Ma, Jian",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

100366,[Role of the cardiac surgeon in the COVID-19 hospital].,2020-07-01,"Compared to less invasive measures, surgical repair is the most effective modality for managing benign acquired tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Traditionally, this involves dismantling of the fistula and suture repair of tracheal and esophageal defects using a lateral or direct approach. However, the best approach remains a subject of debate. We describe a novel and simple technique for dismantling a benign acquired TEF with the use of an endo-stapler and interposition with sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle flap. Eleven TEF patients underwent repair using this stapled repair technique. Retrospectively, the perioperative and long-term outcomes were assessed in these patients. There were no cases of procedure-related mortality or airway-related complications. Two patients developed transient vocal cord palsy and one developed esophageal leak. At a mean follow-up of 21.4 months, no fistula recurrence, dysphagia, or tracheal stenosis was observed. Hence stapled dismantling and SCM muscle interposition is a simple and safe technique for repair of benign acquired TEF.","Gurram, Ram Prakash; Gnanasekaran, Senthil; Kalayarasan, Raja; Biju, Pottakkat; Sandip, Chandrasekar",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9854; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963896/,176
100552,Stroke and Neurointervention in the COVID-19 pandemic: A narrative review.,2021-05-08,"Over the past few years, aquatic cycling has become a trending fitness activity. However, the literature has not been reviewed exhaustively. Therefore, using scoping review methodology, the aim of this review was to explore the current state of the literature concerning aquatic cycling. This study specifically focused on study designs, populations and outcomes. A comprehensive search of seven databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Cinahl, Embase, PEDro,Web of Science, WorldCat) was conducted up to 30th September 2016. GoogleScholar, World Cat, ResearchGate, specific aquatic therapy websites and aquatic therapy journals were searched to identify additional literature. Full-text publications in English, German or Dutch were included. Studies were included when the intervention involved head-out cycling carried out in 10° to 35° Celsius water. Exclusion criteria were the use of wet suits or confounding interventions that would affect participants' homeostasis. 63 articles were included and the study parameters of these studies were summarized. Using three grouping themes, included studies were categorised as 1) single session tests comparing aquatic versus land cycling, or 2) aquatic cycling only sessions investigating different exercise conditions and 3) aquatic cycling intervention programmes. Although the experimental conditions differed noticeably across the studies, shared characteristics were identified. Cardiovascular parameters were investigated by many of the studies with the results suggesting that the cardiac demand of aquatic cycling seems similar to land-based cycling. Only six studies evaluated the effect of aquatic cycling interventions. Therefore, future research should investigate the effects of aquatic cycling interventions, preferably in individuals that are expected to gain health benefits from aquatic cycling. Moreover, this comprehensive outline of available literature could serve as a starting point for systematic reviews or clinical studies on the effects of aquatic cycling on the cardiovascular responses.","Rewald, Stefanie; Mesters, Ilse; Lenssen, Antoine F; Bansi, Jens; Lambeck, Johan; de Bie, Rob A; Waller, Benjamin",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0177704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28520802/,176

We previously reported several structural states of the poliovirus RdRP nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) that revealed a unique palm domain-based active site closure mechanism and proposed a six-state NAC model including a hypothetical state representing translocation intermediates. Using the RdRP from another human enterovirus, enterovirus 71, here we report seven RdRP elongation complex structures derived from a crystal lattice that allows three NAC events. These structures suggested a key order of events in initial NTP binding and NTP-induced active site closure and revealed a bona fide translocation intermediate featuring asymmetric movement of the template-product duplex. Our work provides essential missing links in understanding NTP recognition and translocation mechanisms in viral RdRPs and emphasizes the uniqueness of the viral RdRPs compared with other processive polymerases.","Shu, Bo; Gong, Peng",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1602591113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27339134/,176

METHOD Participants (N = 474 employed U.S. individuals) completed an online survey from April 6-12, 2020. Linear regressions were used to examine factors associated with mental health. RESULTS After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Jenna M; Lee, Jerin; Fitzgerald, Holly N; Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Sevi, Barış; Shook, Natalie J",Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/jom.0000000000001962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658054/,176

A standard extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit consists of a mechanical blood pump, gas-exchange device, and a heat exchanger all connected together with circuit tubing. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits can vary from simple to complex and may include a variety of blood flow and pressure monitors, continuous oxyhemoglobin saturation monitors, circuit access sites, and a bridge connecting the venous access and arterial infusion limbs of the circuit. Significant technical advancements have been made in the equipment available for short- and long-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation applications. Contemporary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuits have greater biocompatibility and allow for more prolonged cardiopulmonary support time while minimizing the procedure-related complications of bleeding, thrombosis, and other physiologic derangements, which were so common with the early application of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Modern era extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuitry and components are simpler, safer, more compact, and can be used across a wide variety of patient sizes from neonates to adults.","Lequier, Laurance; Horton, Stephen B; McMullan, D Michael; Bartlett, Robert H",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e318292dd10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23735989/,176

We analyzed the correlation between UCa/Cr in various spot samples and 24hUCa among healthy children. A 24-h urine specimen and three spot urine samples (evening, first, and second morning) were collected in a convenience sample of children aged 6 to 16 years (n = 101). Measured 24hUCa was compared with UCa/Cr in each of the three spot samples. The ability of UCa/Cr to discriminate between children with and without hypercalciuria (calciuria > 4 mg/kg/24 h, 1 mmol/kg/24 h) and optimal timing of the spot sample were determined. Eighty-five children completed an adequate 24-h urine collection. Pearson correlation coefficients between the UCa/Cr on the spot sample and 24hUCa were 0.64, 0.71, and 0.52 for the evening, first, and second morning spot samples, respectively. Areas under the ROC curve were 0.90, 0.82, and 0.75, respectively, for the corresponding spot samples.Conclusion: The relatively strong correlation between 24hUCa and UCa/Cr in evening and first morning spot urine samples suggests that these spots could be preferred in clinical practice.Trial registration:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02900261, date of trial registration 14 September 2016.What is Known:•Urinary calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample is frequently used as a proxy for 24-h urinary calcium excretion.•Correlation of these indicators, including the best timing for spot urine sampling, has not been properly assessed.What is New:•Relatively strong correlations were found between the calcium/creatinine ratio on a single spot urine sample and 24-h urinary calcium excretion in healthy children.•Evening and first morning spot samples had the highest correlation.","Paccaud, Yan; Rios-Leyvraz, Magali; Bochud, Murielle; Tabin, René; Genin, Bernard; Russo, Michel; Rossier, Michel F; Bovet, Pascal; Chiolero, Arnaud; Parvex, Paloma",European journal of pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-020-03662-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388721/,176

We present our experience using these stents to treat aneurysms distal to the circle of Willis with parent arteries smaller than 2.5 mm. METHODS Aneurysms treated with a Pipeline Embolization Device in vessels less than 2.5 mm between June 2012 and August 2014 were included. We evaluated risk factors, family history of aneurysms, aneurysm characteristics, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS) on admission and angiography and clinical outcome at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year. RESULTS We included seven patients with a mean age of 65 years. The parent vessel size ranged from 1.5 to 2.3 mm; mean 1.9 mm. Location of the aneurysms was as follows: two aneurysms centered along the pericallosal artery (one left, one right), one on the right angular artery, one aneurysm at the anterior communicating artery (ACom), one at the ACom-right A2 anterior cerebral artery (ACA), one at the lenticulostriate artery, and one at the A1-A2 ACA artery. Aneurysms ranged from 1 to 12 mm in diameter. All aneurysms were treated with a single Pipeline Embolization Device (PED). No peri- or post-procedural complications or mortality occurred. The patients were discharged with no change in NIHSS or mRS score. Angiographic follow-up was available in six patients. Angiography showed complete aneurysm occlusion in all. NIHSS and mRS remained unchanged at follow-up. CONCLUSION Our preliminary results show that flow diversion technology is an effective and safe therapy for aneurysms located on small cerebral arteries.

METHODS Using the clinical and epidemiological database of Yangtze River Shipping General Hospital in Wuhan, the clinical and epidemiological data of 105 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 from January to March in 2020 were collected. Multivariate unconditional Logistic regression method was used to analyze the death risk factors of patients during hospitalization. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn according to the multivariate analysis results to construct a death prediction model; the prediction value of the model was analyzed. RESULTS The 105 patients with severe and critical COVID-19 were enrolled with 66 males (62.9%) and 39 females (37.1%). The age was (58.2±14.4) years old. Forty-two patients died in hospital and 63 survived. Among the dead patients, 69.0% (29/42) were male, and 78.6% (33/42) were over 60 years old. Compared with survival patients, the non-survival patients were older (years old: 59.2±12.5 vs. 51.2±11.4), and had more comorbidities, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, myocardial damage and thrombocytopenia (coronary heart disease: 33.3% vs. 11.1%, hypertension: 28.6% vs. 9.5%, myocardial damage: 73.8% vs. 11.1%, thrombocytopenia: 61.9% vs. 14.3%), and received more mechanical ventilation (92.9% vs. 44.4%), with significant differences (all P < 0.01). The variables of gender, age, basic diseases, mechanical ventilation and complications were included in the unconditional Logistic regression analysis, which showed that gender [odds ratio (OR) = 2.852, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.122-66.694], age (OR = 3.257, 95%CI was 0.466-18.584), coronary heart disease (OR = 7.337, 95%CI was 0.227-87.021), hypertension (OR = 5.517, 95%CI was 0.258-65.024) and concurrent myocardial damage (OR = 7.322, 95%CI was 0.278-95.020) and thrombocytopenia (OR = 3.968, 95%CI was 0.325-35.549) were independent risk factors for death in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during hospitalization. According to the risk factors, the death prediction model was constructed and ROC curve was analyzed, which showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of death prediction model for predicting the mortality of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 during hospitalization was 0.804, the sensitivity was 83.8%, and the specificity was 82.3%. CONCLUSIONS Various risk factors are associated with the death of severe or critical COVID-19 patients, such as gender, age, basic diseases and complications. The death prediction model is constructed by gender, age, basic diseases with coronary heart disease and hypertension, concurrent myocardial damage and thrombocytopenia, which has certain predictive value for the death of patients with severe or critical COVID-19.","Hu, Kai; Li, Bojun",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200507-00364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32576344/,176

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of lung computed tomography (CT) of four integrated Chinese and Western medicines in the treatment of COVID-19 using network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS Multiple databases were consulted to find randomized controlled trials of four different types of integrated Chinese and Western medicines for the treatment of COVID-19. NMA was conducted on the data using Stata (13.0) software. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated. The studies included in this paper were divided into a control group (Western medicine) and an observation group (one of four integrated Chinese and Western medicines). RESULTS 5 eligible publications were identified. A total of 598 cases were included in the study, and the results showed that the four types of integrated Chinese and Western medicines (symptomatic and supportive care with Qingfei Touxie Fuzheng, Lianhua Qingke, and Xuebijing) were significantly superior (P < 0.05) to symptomatic and supportive care alone, except for symptomatic and supportive care with Lianhua Qingwen. The combination of symptomatic and supportive care with Lianhua Qingke had the highest probability of being the most clinically efficacious intervention, with a surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve of 85.7. CONCLUSIONS A combination of symptomatic and supportive care with Lianhua Qingke is the best option among the four integrated Chinese and Western medicines considered for the treatment of COVID-19.","Jin, Lairun; Xu, Yan; Yuan, Hui",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.6.771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696884/,176

111894,Managing multiple myeloma during COVID-19: an ongoing saga.,2021-02-05,"Transmission events are the fundamental building blocks of the dynamics of any infectious disease. Much about the epidemiology of a disease can be learned when these individual transmission events are known or can be estimated. Such estimations are difficult and generally feasible only when detailed epidemiological data are available. The genealogy estimated from genetic sequences of sampled pathogens is another rich source of information on transmission history. Optimal inference of transmission events calls for the combination of genetic data and epidemiological data into one joint analysis. A key difficulty is that the transmission tree, which describes the transmission events between infected hosts, differs from the phylogenetic tree, which describes the ancestral relationships between pathogens sampled from these hosts. The trees differ both in timing of the internal nodes and in topology. These differences become more pronounced when a higher fraction of infected hosts is sampled. We show how the phylogenetic tree of sampled pathogens is related to the transmission tree of an outbreak of an infectious disease, by the within-host dynamics of pathogens. We provide a statistical framework to infer key epidemiological and mutational parameters by simultaneously estimating the phylogenetic tree and the transmission tree. We test the approach using simulations and illustrate its use on an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. The approach unifies existing methods in the emerging field of phylodynamics with transmission tree reconstruction methods that are used in infectious disease epidemiology.","Ypma, Rolf J F; van Ballegooijen, W Marijn; Wallinga, Jacco",Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.113.154856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24037268/,176
112185,New patient access via telehealth in neuromuscular medicine during COVID-19.,2021-06-24,"In this study, we used an integrative computational approach to examine molecular mechanisms underlying functional effects of the D614G mutation by exploring atomistic modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins as allosteric regulatory machines. We combined coarse-grained simulations, protein stability and dynamic fluctuation communication analysis with network-based community analysis to examine structures of the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in different functional states. Through distance fluctuations communication analysis, we probed stability and allosteric communication propensities of protein residues in the native and mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, providing evidence that the D614G mutation can enhance long-range signaling of the allosteric spike engine. By combining functional dynamics analysis and ensemble-based alanine scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins we found that the D614G mutation can improve stability of the spike protein in both closed and open forms, but shifting thermodynamic preferences towards the open mutant form. Our results revealed that the D614G mutation can promote the increased number of stable communities and allosteric hub centers in the open form by reorganizing and enhancing the stability of the S1-S2 inter-domain interactions and restricting mobility of the S1 regions. This study provides atomistic-based view of allosteric communications in the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, suggesting that the D614G mutation can exert its primary effect through allosterically induced changes on stability and communications in the residue interaction networks.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

ANIMALS 20 horses of various breeds and ages (10 horses heterozygous for the G57C polymorphism and 10 age-, breed-, and sex-matched horses that did not have the G57C polymorphism). PROCEDURES The number of steps each horse took was counted over consecutive 2-minute periods for 20 minutes to determine a baseline value. The horse then received a bolus of fentanyl (20 μg/kg, IV), and the number of steps was again counted during consecutive 2-minute periods for 60 minutes. The mean baseline value was subtracted from each 2-minute period after fentanyl administration; step counts with negative values were assigned a value of 0. Data were analyzed by use of a repeated-measures ANOVA. RESULTS Data for 19 of 20 horses (10 horses with the G57C polymorphism and 9 control horses without the G57C polymorphism) were included in the analysis. Horses with the G57C polymorphism had a significant increase in locomotor activity, compared with results for horses without the polymorphism. There was a significant group-by-time interaction.

Despite the various impacts, the pandemic has improved the quality of the environment and thereby creating an opportunity to restore the degraded ecosystems. This study presents the imprints of COVID-19 lockdown on the surface water quality and chemical characteristics of the urban-based Bagmati River Basin (BRB), Nepal. A total of 50 water samples were collected from 25 sites of BRB during the monsoon season, in 2019 and 2020. The water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen (DO), and turbidity were measured in-situ, while the major ions, total hardness, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed in the laboratory. The results revealed neutral to mildly alkaline waters with relatively moderate mineralization and dissolved chemical constituents in the BRB. The average ionic abundance followed the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > K+ > NH4+ for cations and HCO3-> Cl- > SO42- > NO3- > PO43- for anions. Comparing to the pre-lockdown, the level of DO was increased by 1.5 times, whereas the BOD and COD were decreased by 1.5 and 1.9 times, respectively during the post-lockdown indicating the improvement of the quality water which was also supported by the results of multivariate statistical analyses.

Most cases will be from an anterior source and can be treated with pressure, anterior nasal packing, or cautery. Intractable epistaxis is generally posterior in origin and may require endoscopic cautery, posterior packing, surgical ligation, or embolization. Embolization has been used to treat epistaxis for more than 30 years and success can be achieved in approximately 90% of patients, with major complications occurring in approximately 2%. These excellent results require thorough knowledge of the regional anatomy, familiarity with the equipment and various agents used to achieve this type of embolization, as well as attention to detail and meticulous technique. There remains debate on several aspects of embolization, including the agent of choice, preferred size of the embolic, and the number of vessels to embolize. Advances in endoscopic surgery have evolved to the point that similar success rates for embolization and modern surgical techniques in treating epistaxis may be expected. This detailed review of pertinent vascular anatomy, embolization technique, and surgical alternatives should allow practitioners to formulate treatment algorithms that result in optimal outcomes at their institutions.","Dubel, Gregory J; Ahn, Sun Ho; Soares, Gregory M",Seminars in interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0033-1353478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24436547/,176

114815,"COVID-19 in Children: Looking Forward, Not Back.",2020-10-08,"OBJECTIVES Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a lifesaving therapy for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation. It is frequently complicated by both thrombosis and hemorrhage. A markedly prothrombotic state associated with high rates of venous thromboembolism has been described in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019) infection. These rates have currently not been described during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in comparison to other viral pneumonias. DESIGN Retrospective observational study. SETTING Single high-volume tertiary critical care department at a university hospital. PATIENTS Patients 16 years old or greater receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, with coronavirus disease 2019 were compared with a cohort of patients with influenza pneumonia between June 1, 2012, and May 31, 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The rates of venous thromboembolism and hemorrhage were compared in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 against a historic population of patients with influenza pneumonia who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There were 51 patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation due to coronavirus disease 2019 and 80 patients with influenza. At cannulation for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 37% of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with 8% of patients with influenza had filling defects on CT pulmonary angiography (p = 0.0001). Catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis shown on ultrasound Doppler after decannulation was present in 53% with coronavirus disease 2019 versus 25% with influenza (p = 0.01). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage at the time of cannulation were 16% with coronavirus disease 2019 and 14% with influenza (p = 0.8). Elevated D-dimer levels were seen in both conditions and were significantly higher in those with pulmonary thromboembolism than those without in coronavirus disease 2019 (p = 0.02). Fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in those with coronavirus disease 2019 than influenza (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Significant rates of pulmonary thromboembolism and of catheter-associated deep vein thrombosis were seen in both viral infections but were greater in those requiring the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019 than for influenza.","Doyle, Andrew J; Hunt, Beverley J; Sanderson, Barnaby; Zhang, Joseph; Mak, Sze M; Benedetti, Guilia; Breen, Karen A; Camporota, Luigi; Barrett, Nicholas A; Retter, Andrew",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000004971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861545/,176

115090,"[Delirium in the ""young"" covid-19 patient (<65 years): preliminary clinical indications].",2021,"INTRODUCTION Associations between cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and inflammation have been largely examined using peripheral blood markers of inflammation, with few studies measuring inflammation within the brain. We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between SVD and in vivo neuroinflammation using [11C]PK11195 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. METHODS Forty-two participants were recruited (according to NIA-AA guidelines, 14 healthy controls, 14 mild Alzheimer's disease, 14 amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment). Neuroinflammation was assessed using [11C]PK11195 PET imaging, a marker of microglial activation. To quantify SVD, we assessed white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds and lacunes. Composite scores were calculated for global SVD burden, and SVD subtypes of hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). General linear models examined associations between SVD and [11C]PK11195, adjusting for sex, age, education, cognition, scan interval, and corrected for multiple comparisons via false discovery rate (FDR). Dominance analysis directly compared the relative importance of hypertensive arteriopathy and CAA scores as predictors of [11C]PK11195. RESULTS Global [11C]PK11195 binding was associated with SVD markers, particularly in regions typical of hypertensive arteriopathy: deep microbleeds (β=0.63, F(1,35)=35.24, p<0.001), deep WMH (β=0.59, t=4.91, p<0.001). In dominance analysis, hypertensive arteriopathy score outperformed CAA in predicting [11C]PK11195 binding globally and in 28 out of 37 regions of interest, especially the medial temporal lobe (β=0.66-0.76, t=3.90-5.58, FDR-corrected p (pFDR)=<0.001-0.002) and orbitofrontal cortex (β=0.51-0.57, t=3.53-4.30, pFDR=0.001-0.004). CONCLUSION Microglial activation is associated with SVD, particularly with the hypertensive arteriopathy subtype of SVD. Although further research is needed to determine causality, our study suggests that targeting neuroinflammation might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for SVD.","Low, Audrey; Mak, Elijah; Malpetti, Maura; Passamonti, Luca; Nicastro, Nicolas; Stefaniak, James D; Savulich, George; Chouliaras, Leonidas; Su, Li; Rowe, James B; Markus, Hugh S; O'Brien, John T","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2020-323894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917821/,176

Right and left nephrectomies were performed in 87 and 64 patients, respectively. We compared these two groups with respect to donors' intraoperative parameters, postoperative outcomes, and recipients' outcomes. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding donor blood loss, warm ischemia time, donor postoperative creatinine levels, donor postoperative length of hospital stay, recipient creatinine levels at 1 year after transplantation, and 1-year graft survival rate after transplantation. The time required for graft extraction and overall operative time were significantly shorter in the right RDN group than in the left RDN group (152 vs. 168 min, P = 0.016; 175 vs. 195 min, P = 0.0059). Only one case in the right nephrectomy group required open conversion because of uncontrollable bleeding from the inferior vena cava.

At least 30 genes related to 46,XY DSD have been found. However, the clinical phenotypes of patients with different gene mutations overlap, and accurate diagnosis relies on gene sequencing technology. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in a Chinese cohort with 46,XY DSD by the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Eighty-seven 46,XY DSD patients were enrolled from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing, China). A total of fifty-four rare variants were identified in 60 patients with 46,XY DSD. The incidence of these rare variants was approximately 69.0% (60/87). Twenty-five novel variants and 29 reported variants were identified. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, thirty-three variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and 21 variants were assessed as variants of uncertain significance. The overall diagnostic rate was about 42.5% based on the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. Androgen receptor (AR), steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 (SRD5A2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 5 Group A member 1 (NR5A1) gene variants were identified in 21, 13 and 13 patients, respectively. The incidence of these three gene variants was about 78.3% (47/60) in patients with rare variants. It is concluded that targeted NGS is an effective method to detect pathogenic mutations in 46,XY DSD patients and AR, SRD5A2, and NR5A1 genes were the most common pathogenic genes in our cohort.s.","Yu, Bing-Qing; Liu, Zhao-Xiang; Gao, Yin-Jie; Wang, Xi; Mao, Jiang-Feng; Nie, Min; Wu, Xue-Yan",Asian journal of andrology,https://doi.org/10.4103/aja.aja_36_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985417/,176

117758,The psychological impact of COVID19 on a shielding high-risk cohort.,2020-08-24,"OBJECTIVES Although epidemiological studies have shown that obesity is associated with increased incidence of hypertension during pregnancy, the mechanisms linking these two comorbidities are not as well studied. Previous investigations detected lower levels of the anti-hypertensive and pregnancy-related factor, placental growth factor (PlGF), in obese hypertensive pregnancies. Therefore, we examined whether obese hypertensive pregnant rats have reduced PlGF and whether increasing its levels by administering recombinant human (rh)PlGF reduces their blood pressure. METHODS We utilized a genetic model of obesity characterized to be heavier, hypertensive and fertile, namely rats having heterozygous deficiency of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R-def). RESULTS MC4R-def obese rats had lower circulating levels of PlGF than wild-type lean controls at gestational day 19. Also, assessment of the PlGF receptor, Flt-1, in the vasculature showed that its levels were reduced in aorta and kidney glomeruli but increased in small mesenteric arteries. Chronic intraperitoneal administration of rhPlGF from gestational day 13-19 significantly increased circulating PlGF levels in both obese and lean rats, but reduced blood pressure only in the obese pregnant group. The rhPlGF treatment did not alter maternal body and fat masses or circulating levels of the adipokines, leptin and adiponectin.

118142,The role of fear of COVID-19 in motivation to quit smoking and reductions in cigarette smoking: a preliminary investigation of at-risk cigarette smokers.,2021-02-19,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of exercising over a 5-day period while fasting, in those with and without type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).Eight individuals, ages 29--62 years, two with T1DM, walked/ran around 20 miles per day for five consecutive days while only consuming water. All eight individuals completed the project with no physical injuries or problems with diabetes control. The blood glucose levels ranged from less than 3 mmol/l to 7 mmol/l in those without T1D, and less than 3 mmol/l to 9 mmol/l in those with T1D. The continuous glucose traces in those with T1D showed little variability in glucose levels. The participants without T1D had no symptoms from blood glucose under 3 mmol/l. Ketone levels ranged from 0.3 to 7.5 and the ketones for those with T1D were no different to ketones in those without T1D. The respiratory quotient was overwhelmingly in the fat-burning range. There was very little subjective hunger, nor did it negatively affect mood. In keto-adapted individuals, with or without T1DM, prolonged exercise for 5 days while in nutritional ketosis was feasible, and well tolerated. RECENT FINDINGS Eight adults, ages 28-62 years, trained for and completed a 5-day zero calorie fast covering 100 miles over 5 days. Training involved each individual preparing for the event according to their own programme. Typically, it involved both cardiovascular and strength training with the addition of practice water only fasts over 24-72 h or more based upon the individual's assessment of what was needed to complete the event. There was no formal protocol provided for this. The recommendation was that the participants would be keto adapted and trained to a level sufficient to complete the 5-day event. Keto adaptation was measured by ketone blood testing of betahydroxybutyrate. Two people had type 1 diabetes. All but one person was keto-adapted ahead of the event. All eight individuals completed the project with no physical injuries or problems with diabetes control. Prolonged fasting did neither lead to hunger nor did it negatively affect mood, which, if anything, was enhanced in most individuals. All keto-adapted people were shown to be burning fat stores throughout the 5 days, and everyone was measured to be in a state of nutritional ketosis. In type 1 diabetes, and ketones were in the same range as those without diabetes, insulin volumes were considerably reduced, and glucose control was close to physiological: nutritional ketosis is not a risk factor for diabetic ketoacidosis; consumption of sugar for energy is not required for distances of up to 100 miles in keto-adapted people; people who inject insulin do not necessarily need to consume carbohydrates unless rescuing a hypoglycaemic attack. There is a video summary available, http://links.lww.com/COE/A24. SUMMARY The findings from this project should provide reassurance to those clinicians who want to provide the option of a ketogenic lifestyle to their patients with type 1 diabetes. They also confirm that the fat stores are available for aerobic respiration without apparent negative consequences on physical or mental function.","Lake, Ian","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",https://doi.org/10.1097/med.0000000000000666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334612/,176

In our cross-sectional study with 136 general practices, 26.4% of 550 practice assistants showed high chronic stress. As machine learning strategies offer the opportunity to improve understanding of chronic stress by exploiting complex interactions between variables, we used data from our previous study to derive the best analytic model for chronic stress: four common machine learning (ML) approaches are compared to a classical statistical procedure. METHODS We applied four machine learning classifiers (random forest, support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors', and artificial neural network) and logistic regression as standard approach to analyze factors contributing to chronic stress in practice assistants. Chronic stress had been measured by the standardized, self-administered TICS-SSCS questionnaire. The performance of these models was compared in terms of predictive accuracy based on the 'operating area under the curve' (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. FINDINGS Compared to the standard logistic regression model (AUC 0.636, 95% CI 0.490-0.674), all machine learning models improved prediction: random forest +20.8% (AUC 0.844, 95% CI 0.684-0.843), artificial neural network +12.4% (AUC 0.760, 95% CI 0.605-0.777), support vector machine +15.1% (AUC 0.787, 95% CI 0.634-0.802), and K-nearest neighbours +7.1% (AUC 0.707, 95% CI 0.556-0.735). As best prediction model, random forest showed a sensitivity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 79%. Using the variable frequencies at the decision nodes of the random forest model, the following five work characteristics influence chronic stress: too much work, high demand to concentrate, time pressure, complicated tasks, and insufficient support by practice leaders. CONCLUSIONS Regarding chronic stress prediction, machine learning classifiers, especially random forest, provided more accurate prediction compared to classical logistic regression. Interventions to reduce chronic stress in practice personnel should primarily address the identified workplace characteristics.","Bozorgmehr, Arezoo; Thielmann, Anika; Weltermann, Birgitta",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250842; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945572/,176

While the economic consequences of shutting down national economies were immediately evident, the sociopsychiatric implications of the social confinement of the entire population remain hidden and not fully understood. Italy has been the first European country to be severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, to which it responded through strict lockdown measurements. The results of a timely survey on mental and social health, carried out by students and teachers of a middle school in Rome, might help identify the most vulnerable groups of the population. This evidence could be crucial in conceiving and enacting targeted public health policies to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic on mental health and to prevent intolerance to containment measures in some population segments, which could hamper worldwide efforts in the fight against COVID-19.","Caroppo, Emanuele; De Lellis, Pietro; Lega, Ilaria; Candelori, Antonella; Pedacchia, Daniela; Pellegrini, Alida; Sonnino, Rossella; Venturiello, Virginia; Ruiz Marìn, Manuel; Porfiri, Maurizio",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,https://doi.org/10.4415/ann_20_04_13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346177/,176

Thirteen male and seven female patients with a median age of 68 (range 57-84) years and a median of four (range 0-9) relevant comorbid conditions presented with five right-sided and 15 left-sided tumours, with a median diameter of 2.3 (range 1.0-5.2) cm. Thirteen segmentectomies, three bisegmentectomies and four trisegmentectomies with lymphadenectomy of the N1 stations and the mediastinum were performed, with a median duration of 212 (range 91-397) min, a conversion rate to open surgery of 20% and conversion to lobectomy of 10%. In five patients, we noted 10 postoperative adverse events but no transfusions, no readmissions and zero mortality. Median drainage time was six days, with a median hospital stay of 8.5 days. According to the pTNM classification, 10, three, one, and six patients were staged as Ia, Ib, IIb and IIIa, respectively. The distance between the tumour and the parenchymal stapling line exceeded the tumour diameter in 56%, 0% and 0% of T1a, T1b and T2 tumours, respectively. To conclude, cVATS anatomical sublobar resections are technically feasible. We observed a favourable postoperative course in 20 multimorbid or aged patients.

121792,Altered mental status in 71 deaths due to COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND The seminal vesicles synthesise bioactive factors that support gamete function, modulate the female reproductive tract to promote implantation, and influence developmental programming of offspring phenotype. Despite the significance of the seminal vesicles in reproduction, their biology remains poorly defined. Here, to advance understanding of seminal vesicle biology, we analyse the mouse seminal vesicle transcriptome under normal physiological conditions and in response to acute exposure to the reproductive toxicant acrylamide. Mice were administered acrylamide (25 mg/kg bw/day) or vehicle control daily for five consecutive days prior to collecting seminal vesicle tissue 72 h following the final injection. RESULTS A total of 15,304 genes were identified in the seminal vesicles with those encoding secreted proteins amongst the most abundant. In addition to reproductive hormone pathways, functional annotation of the seminal vesicle transcriptome identified cell proliferation, protein synthesis, and cellular death and survival pathways as prominent biological processes. Administration of acrylamide elicited 70 differentially regulated (fold-change ≥1.5 or ≤ 0.67) genes, several of which were orthogonally validated using quantitative PCR. Pathways that initiate gene and protein synthesis to promote cellular survival were prominent amongst the dysregulated pathways. Inflammation was also a key transcriptomic response to acrylamide, with the cytokine, Colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) identified as a top-ranked upstream driver and inflammatory mediator associated with recovery of homeostasis. Early growth response (Egr1), C-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (Ccl8), and Collagen, type V, alpha 1 (Col5a1) were also identified amongst the dysregulated genes. Additionally, acrylamide treatment led to subtle changes in the expression of genes that encode proteins secreted by the seminal vesicle, including the complement regulator, Complement factor b (Cfb). CONCLUSIONS These data add to emerging evidence demonstrating that the seminal vesicles, like other male reproductive tract tissues, are sensitive to environmental insults, and respond in a manner with potential to exert impact on fetal development and later offspring health.","Skerrett-Byrne, David A; Nixon, Brett; Bromfield, Elizabeth G; Breen, James; Trigg, Natalie A; Stanger, Simone J; Bernstein, Ilana R; Anderson, Amanda L; Lord, Tessa; Aitken, R John; Roman, Shaun D; Robertson, Sarah A; Schjenken, John E",BMC genomics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07951-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625024/,176

Nuclear localization of N is non-essential for PRRSV replication in cultured cells but has been shown to modulate the pathogenesis of virus in pigs, suggesting that N plays an accessory role in the nucleus during infection. We identified by yeast two-hybrid screening the inhibitor of MyoD family-a (I-mfa) domain-containing protein (HIC) as a cellular partner for PRRS virus (PRRSV) N protein. This protein is a homolog of human HIC, a recently identified cellular transcription factor. The specific interaction of PRRSV N with HIC was confirmed in cells by mammalian two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro by GST pull-down assay. HIC is a zinc-binding protein and confocal microscopy demonstrated co-localization of N with the HIC-p40 isomer in the nucleus and nucleolus, and in the cytoplasm with HIC-p32, which is the N-terminal truncation of HIC-p40. The porcine homolog of HIC is universally expressed in pig tissues including alveolar macrophages. The interaction of viral capsid with the cellular transcription factor implicates a possible regulation of host cell gene expression by the N protein during PRRSV infection.","Song, Cheng; Lu, Ray; Bienzle, Dorothee; Liu, Hsiao-Ching; Yoo, Dongwan",Biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1515/bc.2009.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19090724/,176
123472,[Anti-COVID-19 vaccination: implications for Cardiology].,2021-05-01,"AIMS Chronic kidney dysfunction (CKD) and persistent congestion influence heart failure prognosis, but little is known about the role of inflammation in this association. We assessed the relationship between inflammatory biomarkers, persistent congestion and CKD and their prognostic implications in patients with acute heart failure. METHODS We enrolled 97 hospitalised patients (mean age: 66 ± 12 years, ejection fraction: 30 ± 8%) with acute heart failure. Before discharge, congestion was assessed using a heart failure scoring system on the basis of Framingham criteria. Circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, TGF-β-1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 and 2 were measured. Patients were divided into four groups according to the presence of CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m) and congestion (Framingham heart failure score ≥2). The primary end point was the combination of death and rehospitalisation for acute heart failure. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 32 months, 37 patients died and 14 were rehospitalised for acute heart failure. Patients with CKD and congestion had significantly higher TNF-α (P = 0.037), soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1 (P = 0.0042) and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor type 2 (P = 0.001), lower TGF-β-1 (P = 0.02) levels, and the worst outcome (P < 0.0001). Congestion (P = 0.01) and CKD (P = 0.02) were independent predictors of the end-point together with N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (P = 0.002) and TNF-α (P = 0.004). TNF-α attenuated the direct relation between CKD, congestion and outcome, explaining 40% of the difference in the outcome. CONCLUSION In patients hospitalised with acute heart failure, the prognostic impact of persistent congestion and CKD is associated with increased cytokine levels, which may also interfere with the outcome.","Pugliese, Nicola R; Fabiani, Iacopo; Conte, Lorenzo; Nesti, Lorenzo; Masi, Stefano; Natali, Andrea; Colombo, Paolo C; Pedrinelli, Roberto; Dini, Frank L",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0000000000000974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487865/,176

METHODS A literature search was performed to identify studies published from the earliest record to January 2019 using EMBASE (Ovid), MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. All articles assessing clinical outcomes of acute proximal fifth metatarsal fractures were included. Bone healing and clinical outcomes were thereafter calculated using a simplified pooling method. RESULTS Thirty-two articles comprising of a total of 1,239 fractures were included, of which one was a randomized controlled trial, seven were prospective studies, and 24 were retrospective studies. 627 zone 1 fractures demonstrated union rates of 93.2% following conservative treatment and 95.1% following surgical treatment. Conservatively managed zone 1 fractures were displaced 49.5% of the time, compared to a rate of 92.8% for the surgically treated cases. For Jones' (zone 2) fractures, bone healing outcomes of conservative versus surgical treatment showed union rates of 77.4% versus 96.3%, refracture rates of 2.4% versus 2.1%, and mean time to union of 11.0 weeks versus 9.4 weeks, respectively. Only ten proximal diaphyseal (zone 3) fractures were reported, with a mean return to work of 8.2 weeks. CONCLUSION Acute zone 1 fractures are preferably treated conservatively as similar union rates were found after both conservative and surgical management. In contradistinction, acute zone 2 fractures demonstrate higher union rates and faster time to union when treated surgically. The outcomes of acute zone 3 fractures are rarely reported in the literature, so treatment recommendations remain unclear. Further research of proximal fifth metatarsal fractures is warranted to provide more definitive conclusions, but current findings can aid surgeons during the shared clinical decision making process.

The goal of this update is to discuss current practices concerning antithrombosis prophylaxis and the management of recently developed anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents. The duration of prophylaxis is 1 month for oncological surgery. The recommended doses in bariatric surgery are twice daily injections of low-molecular weight heparin without exceeding a total dose of 10,000 IU/day. Dual antiplatelet therapy is necessary for 6 weeks after placement of bare-metal stents, from 6-12 months for drug-eluting stents, and 12 months after an acute coronary artery syndrome. Abrupt discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy exposes the patient to an increased risk of thrombosis. Data are insufficient to make specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in gastrointestinal surgery. For major digestive surgery, prescription of daily aspirin should be discussed case by case. If discontinuation of treatment is absolutely necessary, this should be as short as possible (aspirin: 3 days, ticagrelor and clopidogrel: 5 days, prasugrel: 7 days). The modalities for elective management of new oral anticoagulants are similar to those for classical vitamin K antagonists (VKA) therapy, except that any overlapping with heparin administration must be avoided. In the emergency setting, an algorithm can be proposed depending on the drug, the available coagulation tests and the interval before performing surgery.","Degirmenci, S-E; Steib, A",Journal of visceral surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2014.01.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24631468/,176

This study aimed to investigate the impact of heparin use during endovascular therapy of anterior circulation tandem occlusions on the functional and safety outcomes. METHODS A retrospective analysis of the multicenter observational TITAN registry was performed. Patients with anterior circulation tandem occlusion and treated with endovascular therapy (EVT) were included, with or without extracranial carotid intervention. We divided patients into two groups based on periprocedural heparin use (heparin vs. non-heparin). The dose of intravenous unfractionated heparin ranged from 1500 to 2500 I.U. Primary study endpoint was 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary study endpoint included angiographic and safety endpoints such as hemorrhagic complications. A propensity-score-matched analysis was performed. RESULTS Among 369 patients, heparin was used in 68 patients (18.4%). In the propensity-score-matched cohort, favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) occurred in 51.3% in heparin group and 58.0% in non-heparin group (matched OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.32-1.78; P = 0.52). Similar result was found in propensity-score-adjusted cohort (adjusted OR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.39-1.32; P = 0.28). Likewise, there was no difference in the rate of successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b-3) (propensity-score-adjusted OR, 1.03; 95%CI, 0.50-2.09; P = 0.93) neither in safety endpoints between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Periprocedural heparin use during EVT of anterior circulation tandem occlusions was not associated with better functional, angiographic or safety outcomes. These findings are applicable for low doses of heparin, and further studies are warranted.","Zhu, François; Piotin, Michel; Steglich-Arnholm, Henrik; Labreuche, Julien; Holtmannspötter, Markus; Taschner, Christian; Eiden, Sebastian; Haussen, Diogo C; Nogueira, Raul G; Papanagiotou, Panagiotis; Boutchakova, Maria; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Lapergue, Bertrand; Dorn, Franziska; Cognard, Christophe; Killer-Oberpfalzer, Monika; Mangiafico, Salvatore; Ribo, Marc; Psychogios, Marios N; Spiotta, Alejandro; Anadani, Mohammad; Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Mazighi, Mikael; Biondi, Alessandra; Richard, Sébastien; Anxionnat, René; Bracard, Serge; Turjman, Francis; Gory, Benjamin",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-019-02251-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152229/,176

METHODS Ancillary analysis of the OPIOIDS real-world, non-interventional, retrospective, 4-year longitudinal study including patients aged at least 18 years with moderate-to-severe chronic OA pain refractory to standard-of-care with sequential NSAIDs plus opioids. Burden assessment included measurement of analgesia, cognitive functioning, basic activities of daily living, severity and frequency of comorbidities, and all-cause mortality. Costs accounted for healthcare resource utilization and related costs (year 2018). RESULTS Records of 13,317 patients were analyzed; 68.9 (14.7) years old, 71.3% (70.5-72.1%) women, 58.1% refractory to NSAID plus weak opioid and 41.9% to NSAID plus strong opioid, accounting for 10.7% (10.5-10.8%) of patients with chronic OA pain. Mean number of comorbidities was 2.9 (1.8) and its severity was 1.8 (1.7). Pain decreased by 0.9 points (12.2%) and cognitive declined by 2.3 points (9.1%, with 4.3% more patients with cognitive deficit) and dependency worsened by 0.4 points (0.5%, with 2.3% more patients with severe-to-total dependence) over a mean treatment period of 188.6 (185.4-191.8) days on NSAIDs followed by 400.6 (393.7-407.5) days on opioids. The adjusted mortality rate was higher in patients with OA taking NSAID plus strong opioids; hazard ratio 1.44 (1.26-1.65; p < 0.001). The 4-year healthcare cost was €7350/patient (€7193-7507 or €1838/year) and was higher in those taking strong versus weak opioids; €9886 (€9608-10,164, €2472/year) vs. €5519 (€5349-5689, €1380/year), p < 0.001. Analgesia cost (16.0% of total cost, 70.2% opioids) was higher with strong versus weak opioids, 19.6% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS In routine clinical practice in Spain, patients with moderate-to-severe chronic OA pain refractory to standard analgesic treatment with NSAIDs plus opioids reported modest reductions in pain, while presenting a considerable burden of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and dependency. Healthcare costs significantly increased for the NHS particularly with NSAIDs plus strong opioids.","Sicras-Mainar, Antoni; Rejas-Gutierrez, Javier; Vargas-Negrín, Francisco; Tornero-Tornero, Juan Carlos; Sicras-Navarro, Aram; Lizarraga, Isabel",Rheumatology and therapy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40744-020-00271-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411324/,176

Also the variability of glucose may have an impact on morbidity. An accurate and feasible on-line/continuous measurement is therefore desired. In this study a central vein catheter with a microdialysis membrane in combination with an on-line analyzer for continuous monitoring of circulating glucose and lactate by the central route was tested. METHODS A total of 10 patients scheduled for major upper abdominal surgery were included in this observational prospective study at a university hospital. The patients received an extra central venous catheter with a microdialysis membrane placed in the right jugular vein. Continuous microdialysis measurement proceeded for 20 hours and on-line values were recorded every minute. Reference arterial plasma glucose and blood lactate samples were collected every hour. RESULTS Mean microdialysis-glucose during measurements was 9.8 ± 2.4 mmol/l.No statistical difference in the readings was seen using a single calibration compared to eighth hour calibration (P =0.09; t-test). There was a close agreement between the continuous reading and the reference plasma glucose values with an absolute difference of 0.6+0.8 mmol, or 6.8+9.3% and measurements showed high correlation to plasma readings (r = 0.92). The limit of agreement was 23.0%(1.94 mmol/l) compared to arterial plasma values with a line of equality close to zero.However, in a Clarke-Error Grid 93.3% of the values are in the A-area,and the remaining part in the B-area.Mean microdialysis-lactate was 1.3 ± 1.1 mmol/l.

CONCLUSION Continuous on-line microdialysis glucose measurement in a central vein is a potential useful technique for continuous glucose monitoring in critically ill patients, but more improvements and testing are needed.","Blixt, Christina; Rooyackers, Olav; Isaksson, Bengt; Wernerman, Jan",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/cc12713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663747/,176
126284,Prevention and practice during the COVID-19 emergency declaration period in Japanese obstetrical/gynecological facilities.,2020-09-09,"We present a case of a 73-year-old woman who developed recurrent hypoglycaemia during a prolonged hospital stay following a mechanical fall. She had a complex history of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, diffuse systemic cutaneous sclerosis, Raynaud's disease, previous breast cancer, Barrett's oesophagus and previous partial gastrectomy for a benign mass. Hypoglycaemia persisted despite weaning of insulin. She had no clinical features of adrenal or pituitary insufficiency with an acceptable cortisol on stopping prednisolone and had an optimal thyroid replacement. A 72-hour fast elicited hypoglycaemia with corresponding low insulin level. Although the C-peptide was detectable, there were no clinical, biochemical or radiological features suggestive of insulinoma. Reactive hypoglycaemia post partial gastrectomy was ruled out based on limited relation of the hypoglycaemia to meals and the low insulin levels. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)-induced hypoglycaemia was considered based on previous case reports and the recent literature, with a successful resolution of hypoglycaemia on discontinuation of HCQ.","Parmar, Viraj; Sritharan, Vasanth; Lawrence, Christopher; Dhere, Archana",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-241439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301693/,176
126460,Teleneuropsychology clinic development and patient satisfaction.,2021-01-27,"BACKGROUND Coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic, global influenza virus circulation decreased, possibly due to widespread community mitigation measures. Cambodia eased some COVID-19 mitigation measures in June and July 2020. On Aug 20th a cluster of respiratory illnesses among residents of a pagoda included persons that had tested positive for influenza A, and none that were positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS On Aug 25, a response team deployed. Persons with influenza-like illness (ILI) were asked questions on demographics, illness, personal prevention measures, and residential arrangements. Respiratory swabs were tested for influenza and SARS-Cov-2 by RT-PCR; viruses were sequenced. Sentinel surveillance data were analyzed to assess recent trends in influenza circulation in the community. RESULTS Influenza A(H3N2) viruses were identified in sentinel surveillance in Cambodia in July 2020, prior to the reported pagoda outbreak. Among the 362 pagoda residents, 73(20.2%) ILI cases were identified; 40 were tested with 33/40 (82.5%) confirmed positive for influenza A(H3N2). All 40 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Among 73 residents with ILI, none were vaccinated against influenza, 47 (64%) clustered in 3 of 8 sleeping quarters; 20 (27%) reported often wearing a mask; 27 (36%) reported often washing hands; and 11 (15%) reported practicing social distancing. All viruses clustered within clade 3c2.A1 close to strains circulating in Australia in 2020. CONCLUSIONS Circulation of influenza viruses began in the community following a relaxing of national COVID-19 mitigation measures, and prior to this outbreak in a pagoda with limited social distancing. Continued surveillance and influenza vaccination remain needed to limit the impact of influenza globally.","Sovann, Ly; Sar, B; Kab, V; Yann, S; Kinzer, M; Raftery, P; Albalak, R; Patel, S; Long Hay, P; Seng, H; Um, S; Chin, S; Chau, D; Khalakdina, A; Karlsson, E; Olsen, S J; Mott, J A",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.11.178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33249287/,176

Here, we examined longitudinal antibody response against ZIKV during natural infection in 2 convalescent individuals. By decomposing the antibody recognition into DI/DII and DIII of the E glycoprotein, we showed their development in humans followed a spatiotemporal hierarchy. Plasma binding to DI/DII appeared to peak and wane during early infection with extensive cross-reactivity with DI/DII of DENV. Binding to DIII, however, peaked early but persisted months into the infection without detectable cross-reactivity with DIII of DENV. A clear trend of increase in DIII-specific neutralizing activity was observed over the course of infection. mAbs isolated during early infection are largely DI/DII specific, weakly neutralizing, and highly cross-reactive with DENV, while those from later infection are more diverse in recognition, potently neutralizing, and ZIKV specific. The most potent neutralizing mAb targeting the DIII provided 100% protection in mice from lethal ZIKV infection and could therefore serve as a promising candidate for antibody-based therapy and prevention. The dynamic features unveiled here will assist us to better understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection and inform rational design of vaccines.","Yu, Lei; Wang, Ruoke; Gao, Fei; Li, Min; Liu, Jianying; Wang, Jian; Hong, Wenxin; Zhao, Lingzhai; Wen, Yingfen; Yin, Chibiao; Wang, Hua; Zhang, Qi; Li, Yangyang; Zhou, Panpan; Zhang, Rudian; Liu, Yang; Tang, Xiaoping; Guan, Yongjun; Qin, Cheng-Feng; Chen, Ling; Shi, Xuanling; Jin, Xia; Cheng, Gong; Zhang, Fuchun; Zhang, Linqi",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.93042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28614803/,176

There have been many advances in hernia repair techniques over the past 50 years, but new strategies must be considered to enhance the success of herniorrhaphy. DISCUSSION At the 30th International Congress of the European Hernia Society, nine experts in hernia repair and experimental mesh evaluation participated in a roundtable discussion about today's unmet needs in hernia repair, including what constitutes an ""ideal"" hernia repair and the portfolio of ""ideal"" mesh prostheses. Defining characteristics of lightweight mesh, mesh alternatives, the surgeon's role in hernia repair, adverse events, the unmet requirements for today's hernia repair, and optimized animal models were among the topics discussed. CONCLUSION The ideal mesh's construction is still in progress, but greater understanding of its critical characteristics was explored. It is hoped that these suggestions will lead to the development of improved hernia treatments and a maximally effective portfolio of hernia mesh prostheses.","Bringman, S; Conze, J; Cuccurullo, D; Deprest, J; Junge, K; Klosterhalfen, B; Parra-Davila, E; Ramshaw, B; Schumpelick, V",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-009-0587-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20012333/,176
128818,Heterogeneity of clinical and radiological findings of COVID-19.,2020-07-29,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have become essential in the management of upper gastrointestinal disorders, yet they are prescribed without an indication in up to 89% of cases and the number of prescribed PPIs is on the rise. A working group developed several multifaceted strategies in our multihospital trust to curb inappropriate PPI use. We describe herein these strategies and assess their impact on PPI consumption in a hospital belonging to this trust. METHODS From 2012 to 2019, our actions included the publication and presentation of a review of emergent PPI side effects, the development of an appropriate use leaflet, medication audits, journal club meetings, and prescription analysis. We considered that a decrease in PPI consumption could be a relevant surrogate criterion for the appropriation and acceptance of these interventions; this was assessed from 2012 to 2019 and expressed as defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 patient-days. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION There was a clear downward trend in the consumption of PPIs, both in medical and surgical wards. The overall PPI use decreased by 17.1% (from 566 to 468 DDD/1000 patient-days). IV PPI consumption dropped by 37.7% (from 146 to 91 DDD/1000 patient-days), while oral PPIs consumption decreased by 10% (from 420 to 378 DDD/1000 patient-days). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION Sustained strategies aimed at curbing PPI overprescribing led to a sustained decrease in PPI consumption in our hospital. This decrease encourages us to pursue this strategy and to diversify our actions.","Veremme, Léo; Janoly-Dumenil, Audrey; Charpiat, Bruno",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13395; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629438/,176

This perspective is of broad clinical and public health importance because the US has the highest population of long-term users of prescription opioids, a sequel of a decade-long practice of opioid overprescribing in the US. For long-term opioid users who are hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians face clinical challenges arising from the suppressive effects of opioids on the respiratory and immune functions, as well as the potential for adverse drug-drug interaction when opioids have to be continued in long-term users.

However, the majority of studies only accounted for frontline healthcare workers with direct patient exposure. AIM This study aims to look at the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a specific, vulnerable and yet hidden group of healthcare workers, namely laboratory healthcare workers who are at high risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus from handling infected patients' blood samples, in addition to a marked increase in workload. METHOD A multicentre study was conducted in Singapore via online questionnaire looking at psychological and physical impact of COVID-19 on laboratory healthcare workers. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Numeric rating scale on fear (NRS) were validated scores used in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 23 (IBM Corp). RESULTS A total of 122 staffs participated and more than half of the cohort experienced mild to severe fear, anxiety and depression. Increase in depression score was also found to be associated with increased physical exhaustion (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-29.1, p = .02), loss of appetite (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.0, p = .02), poor sleep quality (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 2.9-19.4, p = .005), and the use of sedative (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.5, p = .03).

Yet it is under-researched and a challenge to manage. Women who suffer from chronic pelvic pain frequently describe their healthcare journey as long, via a variety of specialists and frustrating, with their pain often dismissed. Aetiological factors and associations are best conceptualised using the 'three P's' model of predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors. This integrates the numerous biological, psychological and social contributors to the complex, multifactorial nature of chronic pelvic pain.

The highest value (1555 fg m(-3)) was measured in a reference sample taken in the SW Black Sea. No consistent trend regarding the diel cycle of PCDD/Fs was observed. PCDD/Fs transported to the open sea waters from continental areas and across the Atlantic as well as ship emissions may be significant sources to the open Mediterranean. Seawater concentrations in the Mediterranean ranged from 42 to 64 fg L(-1). The sigma2,3,7,8-PCDD/F dry deposition fluxes in the Marmara and Black Seas (210 kg year(-1)) are from 2 to 55 times higher than dry fluxes in the Mediterranean Sea (4-156 kg year(-1)). Analysis of estimated diffusive air-water fluxes and air/water fugacity ratios show that a net volatilization of some PCDD congeners is feasible. However, evidence of a net absorption flux for the rest of PCDD/F is found. When both atmospheric deposition processes are considered together the open Mediterranean Sea is a net sink of PCDD/F, due to the importance of dry deposition fluxes of aerosol-bound PCDDFs.","Castro-Jiménez, J; Eisenreich, S J; Ghiani, M; Mariani, G; Skejo, H; Umlauf, G; Wollgast, J; Zaldívar, J M; Berrojalbiz, N; Reuter, H I; Dachs, J",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/es100718n; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20560640/,176

The nursing profession continues to face nursing shortages. One of the solutions recognized to alleviate the shortage is increasing the number of students graduating from nursing schools. It lacks a literature review synthesizing the current research about the impacts of faculty caring on nursing students' intent to graduate and indicate areas for future research. Methods This is a systematic literature review. The search of the literature was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Databases searched included MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Search. Search terms included 'attrition,' 'dropouts,' 'graduation rate,' 'faculty,' 'instructor,' 'professor,' 'nursing,' and 'caring.' Results Ten articles met the inclusion criteria. The articles were conducted in the Associate Degree of Nursing and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. Nursing faculties played a significant role in students' intent to graduate by building students' confidence, creating a compassionate learning environment, and promoting students' competence. Faculties' caring behaviors, including respecting students, showing empathy, and using caring communication skills, were essential characteristics to affect students' learning environments. Conclusions The findings indicate that students' perceptions of faculty caring can affect their perceptions of the learning environment and sense of belonging, and therefore, impact their intent to graduate. Students' perceptions of their instructors' caring behaviors are instrumental in motivating them to continue learning. The capacity of faculty caring plays a significant role in students' success.","Henderson, Dalton; Sewell, Kerry A; Wei, Holly",International journal of nursing sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnss.2019.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32099867/,176

However, the initial data were reported from single-center or 2-center studies in Chinese populations. Compared with these patients, European and US patients are older, with more comorbidities and higher mortality rates. Objective To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, in a large population of White Italian patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolling consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 13 Italian cardiology units from March 1 to April 9, 2020. Patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome were excluded. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values greater than the 99th percentile of normal values. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical characteristics and outcomes stratified as elevated or normal cardiac troponin levels at admission, defined as troponin T or troponin I at a level greater than the 99th percentile of normal values. Results A total of 614 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study (mean age [SD], 67 [13] years; 70.8% male), of whom 148 patients (24.1%) died during the hospitalization. Elevated troponin levels were found in 278 patients (45.3%). These patients were older (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.6] years vs 71.3 [12.0] years; P < .001) and had higher prevalence of hypertension (168 patients [50.5%] vs 182 patients [65.9%]; P < .001), heart failure (24 [7.2%]; 63 [22.8%]; P < .001), coronary artery disease (50 [15.0%] vs 87 [31.5%]; P < .001), and atrial fibrillation (33 [9.9%] vs 67 [24.3%]; P < .001). Elevated troponin levels were associated with an increased in-hospital mortality (37% vs 13%; HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.13-2.59]; P = .01 via multivariable Cox regression analysis), and this was independent from concomitant cardiac disease. Elevated troponin levels were also associated with a higher risk of in-hospital complications: heart failure (44 patients [19.2%] vs 7 patients [2.9%]; P < .001), sepsis (31 [11.7%] vs 21 [6.4%]; P = .03), acute kidney failure (41 [20.8%] vs 13 [6.2%]; P < .001), multiorgan failure (21 [10.9%] vs 6 [2.9%]; P = .003), pulmonary embolism (27 [9.9%] vs 17 [5.2%]; P = .04), delirium (13 [6.8%] vs 3 [1.5%]; P = .02), and major bleeding (16 [7.0%] vs 4 [1.6%]; P = .008).

Transitional care interventions primarily focus on care coordination and medication management and may miss key components. The objective of this study is to examine the current scope of hospital-to-home transitional care interventions that impact health-related outcomes and to examine other key components including engagement by older adults and their caregivers. DESIGN Scoping review. METHODS Eligible articles focused on hospital transition to home intervention, measured primary outcomes posthospitalization, used randomized controlled trial designs, and included primarily adults aged 60 years and older. Articles included in this review were reviewed in full and all data were extracted that related to study objective, setting, population, sample, intervention, primary and secondary outcomes, and main results. RESULTS Five hundred sixty-seven records were identified by title. Forty-four articles were deemed eligible and included. Most common transitional care intervention components were care continuity and coordination, medication management, symptom recognition, and self-management. Few studies reported a focus on caregiver needs or goals. Common modes of intervention delivery included by phone, in person while the patient was hospitalized, and in person in the community following hospital discharge. The most common outcomes were readmission and mortality. CONCLUSION To improve outcomes beyond healthcare utilization, a paradigm shift is required in the design and study of care transition interventions. Future interventions should explore methods or novel interventions for caregiver engagement; leverage an interdisciplinary team or care coordination hub with engagement from underrepresented specialties such as social work and occupational therapy; and examine opportunities for interventions designed specifically to address older adult and caregiver-reported needs and their well-being.","Liebzeit, Daniel; Rutkowski, Rachel; Arbaje, Alicia I; Fields, Beth; Werner, Nicole E",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17323; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34145906/,176

BACKGROUND Guidelines in regard to preventing pressure ulcers recommend that patients lying on a standard bed should change their positions every 2 hr and that patients on a supporting surface should change their positions every 4 hr. But there is no strong evidence that justifies this practice. DESIGN Quasi-experimental. METHODS Data for the research were collected over the period October 2014-March 2015 at Anesthesiology and Reanimation and Neurosurgery Clinic Intensive Care Units. A total of 46 patients matching the research criteria were left in the supine position for 4 hr without having a position change, during which time sacral tissue oxygen saturation was measured every hour on the hour. Sacral tissue oxygen saturation was measured with the InSpectra Tissue Oxygenation Monitor. RESULTS Mean sacral tissue oxygen saturation was 73.4% at baseline and was then measured as 74.9% at the first hour, 72.3% at the second hour, 71.9% at the third hour and 71.9% at the fourth hour. The changes observed between measuring times were not found to be statistically significant (p = .09). CONCLUSIONS No statistically significant differences were found between sacral tissue oxygen saturation values recorded over a period of 4 hr in immobile patients lying on a supporting surface in the supine position. However, it was observed that sacral tissue oxygen saturation values did not change significantly depending upon the type of supporting surface that was being used.

There is a variation in the underlying cause in different demographic settings. The initial clue to the presence of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes is through thoracic imaging modalities. Malignancy (Lung cancer, lymphoma, and extrathoracic cancer) and granulomatous conditions (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis) are the commonest causes. For a confident diagnosis, the clinician must choose from several available options and integrate the clinical, radiological, and pathology findings. An accurate diagnosis is necessary for optimal management.Areas covered: We performed a search of the PUBMED database to identify relevant articles on the causes, imaging modalities, and interventional modalities to diagnose these conditions. We discuss a practical approach towards the evaluation of a patient with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.Expert opinion: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Treating physicians need to be aware of the clinico-radiological manifestations of the common diagnostic entities.

From October 2015 until November 2018, nine patients with CMI underwent laparoscopic revascularization. In addition to demographic data and perioperative results of the treatment, graft patency was assessed with Duplex ultrasound at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months, and annually thereafter. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed. Results All bypasses were constructed with an 8 mm ring enforced expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft in a retrograde fashion (from infrarenal aorta or iliac artery) to either superior mesenteric artery or splenic artery (2 cases). Median operation time was 356 mins (range 247-492 mins). Five patients had a history of unsuccessful endovascular treatment. Laparoscopic technical success was 78%, and the primary open conversion rate was 22%. All laparoscopic revascularization procedures remained patent after discharge during a median follow-up time of 26 months (range 18-49 months). The primary graft patency at 30 days was 78%. Primary assisted, and secondary graft patency was 78% and 100%, respectively. Median weight gain was 2 kg (range 2-18 kg), and all patients achieved relief from postprandial pain and nausea. No mortality was observed during the follow-up period. Conclusion Laparoscopic aortomesenteric revascularization procedures for chronic mesenteric ischemia are feasible but require careful patient selection. These procedures should only be performed at referral centers by vascular surgeons with prior experience in laparoscopic vascular surgery.","Kazmi, Syed Sajid Hussain; Berge, Simen Tveten; Sahba, Mehdi; Medhus, Asle Wilhelm; Sundhagen, Jon Otto",Vascular health and risk management,https://doi.org/10.2147/vhrm.s243264; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32256075/,176
134942,Analyzing Outcomes Among Older Adults With Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections in the United States.,2020-08-17,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was divided into North American and European genotypes. NSP1 was an important non-structural protein of PRRSV, which was auto-cleaved from the replicase polyprotein into NSP1α and NSP1β subunits and played an important role in the immune suppression. In this study, six monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the recombinant PRRSV NSP1, expressed in Escherichia coli system, were screened out and identified. Western blot and IFA results indicated that 4 out of 6 MAbs recognized the recombinant NSP1α and 2 MAbs recognized NSP1β. Epitope mapping results indicated that MAb 4H2 recognized the linear epitopes E(54)EPLRW(59) in NSP1α, MAbs (2G5, 3E11 and 4D4) recognized the epitopes H(157)VLTNLP(163) in NSP1α, and MAbs 3C7 and 1H7 reacted with the epitopes 185aa to 232aa in NSP1β. Protein sequence alignment of NSP1 indicated E(54)EPLRW(59) was conserved in all North American PRRSV strains, whereas European type strains has variable amino acids in this region. The epitope H(157)VLTNLP(163) was relatively conserved among all PRRSV strains, except for a L162→S162 change in European type strains. The epitope 185-232aa was variable among North American PRRSV strains. These results may facilitate future investigations into the function of NSP1 of PRRSV and diagnostic methods for PRRSV infection.","Song, Yanhua; Zhou, Yefei; Li, Yufeng; Wang, Xianwei; Bai, Juan; Cao, Jun; Jiang, Ping",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.09.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21996544/,176

In clinic, four stages (A, B, C, and D) were used to describe heart failure progression. This study was aimed to explore plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles in different HF stages to identify potential biomarkers. Metabolomics and lipidomics were performed using plasma of heart failure patients at stages A (n = 49), B (n = 61), and C+D (n = 26). Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for screening dysregulated molecules. Bioinformatics was used to retrieve perturbed metabolic pathways. Univariate and multivariate receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were used for potential biomarker screening. Stage A showed significant difference to other stages, and 142 dysregulated lipids and 134 dysregulated metabolites were found belonging to several metabolic pathways. Several marker panels were proposed for the diagnosis of heart failure stage A versus stage B-D. Several molecules, including lysophosphatidylcholine 18:2, cholesteryl ester 18:1, alanine, choline, and Fructose, were found correlated with B-type natriuretic peptide or left ventricular ejection fractions. In summary, using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic profiling, several dysregulated small molecules were successfully identified between HF stages A and B-D. These molecules would provide valuable information for further pathological researches and biomarker development.","Zhou, Juntuo; Chen, Xi; Chen, Wei; Zhong, Lijun; Cui, Ming",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-021-04159-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974232/,176

SUBJECTS AND METHODS This was a randomized clinical study having a Canadian Task Force Classification of I. In tertiary-care university-based teaching hospitals, 117 women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy were enrolled. In accord with randomization, uterine wall defects were closed with either extracorporeal (poliglecaprone 25; Monocryl™-1; Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) or intracorporeal (polyglactin 910; Vicryl™-1; Ethicon Inc.) knots or a bidirectional knotless barbed suture (Quill™-0; Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). RESULTS Time required to suture was significantly lower in the group operated on with a bidirectional suture than in groups with traditional sutures (P<.001). No significant difference was observed in operative time among the study groups. The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in the Quill group than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS Use of barbed sutures reduces the time required to repair a uterine wall defect during laparoscopic myomectomy. In a follow-up of patients carried out at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery, there were no wound dehiscence, no bleeding, and no other potential major complications.","Ardovino, Mario; Castaldi, Maria Antonietta; Fraternali, Fernando; Ardovino, Italo; Colacurci, Nicola; Signoriello, Giuseppe; Cobellis, Luigi",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

To identify possible indirect actions of androgens via the AR in neurons to regulate muscle, we generated neuron-ARKO mice in which the dominant DNA binding-dependent actions of the AR are deleted in neurons of the cortex, forebrain, hypothalamus, and olfactory bulb. Serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were elevated twofold in neuron-ARKO males compared with wild-type littermates due to disruption of negative feedback to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Despite this increase in serum testosterone levels, which was expected to increase muscle mass, the mass of the mixed-fiber gastrocnemius (Gast) and the fast-twitch fiber extensor digitorum longus hind-limb muscles was decreased by 10% in neuron-ARKOs at 12 weeks of age, whereas muscle strength and fatigue of the Gast were unaffected. The mass of the soleus muscle, however, which consists of a high proportion of slow-twitch fibers, was unaffected in neuron-ARKOs, demonstrating a stimulatory action of androgens via the AR in neurons to increase the mass of fast-twitch hind-limb muscles. Furthermore, neuron-ARKOs displayed reductions in voluntary and involuntary physical activity by up to 60%. These data provide evidence for a role of androgens via the AR in neurons to positively regulate fast-twitch hind-limb muscle mass and physical activity in male mice.","Davey, Rachel A; Clarke, Michele V; Russell, Patricia K; Rana, Kesha; Seto, Jane; Roeszler, Kelly N; How, Jackie M Y; Chia, Ling Yeong; North, Kathryn; Zajac, Jeffrey D",Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2017-00470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28977603/,176

The measured data are analyzed by quantum chemical calculations at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. This combined experimental and theoretical approach demonstrates that water binds to the naphthalene ring via π hydrogen bond (H-bond) for n = 1 case. Further addition of the solvent molecules occurs via the formation of a H-bonded water network facilitated by the nonadditive cooperative force. No isomers are observed in which the solvent molecules separately bind to the aromatic ring. For n = 3 case, we observe the formation of a cyclic H-bonded water moiety. Comparison with corresponding cationic and anionic naphthalene±-(water)n clusters demonstrates the charge-induced modification of the hydration motif. Our results are further compared with the prototypical benzene-(water)n complexes to comprehend the effect of an additional phenyl ring on the solvation network.","Chatterjee, Kuntal; Roy, Tarun Kumar; Khatri, Jai; Schwaab, Gerhard; Havenith, Martina",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cp01789f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151322/,176

Overall, over 200,000 cases are registered every year worldwide, with a fatality rate ranging between 0.1-15% for HFRS and 20-40% for HCPS. No specific treatment or vaccines have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat or prevent hantavirus-caused syndromes. Currently, little is known about the mechanisms at the basis of hantavirus-induced disease. However, it has been hypothesized that an excessive inflammatory response plays an essential role in the course of the disease. Furthermore, the contributions of the cellular immune response to either viral clearance or pathology have not been fully elucidated. This article discusses recent findings relative to the immune responses elicited to hantaviruses in subjects suffering HFRS or HCPS, highlighting the similarities and differences between these two clinical diseases.

OBJECTIVE To determine the risk factors associated with hypoxemia and the influence of hypoxemia on clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with mild pneumonia. METHODS We performed a multicenter prospective cohort study of 585 consecutive hospitalized patients with mild pneumonia (CURB-65 groups 0 and 1). We stratified the patients according to the presence of hypoxemia, defined as a P(aO(2))/F(IO(2)) < 300 mm Hg on admission. We assessed the risk factors associated with hypoxemia, hypoxemia's influence on the course of pneumonia, and clinical outcomes (mortality, hospital stay, and need for intensive care unit admission), with multivariable regression. RESULTS Fifty percent of the patients (294 cases) had hypoxemia on admission. The risk factors independently associated with hypoxemia were: bilateral radiological involvement (odds ratio 2.8, 95% CI 1.1-7.5), history of COPD (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.4-4.3), and hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5). The hypoxemic patients had longer hospital stay, higher intensive care unit admission rate, higher rate of severe sepsis, and higher mortality than the non-hypoxemic patients. CONCLUSIONS Hypoxemia in patients with mild pneumonia is independently associated with several adverse clinical and radiological variables, and the hypoxemic patients had worse clinical outcomes than the non-hypoxemic patients. Therefore, additional attention should be paid to the presence of hypoxemia, regardless of a low CURB-65 score.","Sanz, Francisco; Restrepo, Marcos I; Fernández, Estrella; Mortensen, Eric M; Aguar, María Carmen; Cervera, Angela; Chiner, Eusebi; Blanquer, Jose",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.00853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21276314/,176

Evaluating completeness of ablation is difficult with standard intraoperative B-mode ultrasound. This study evaluates the ability of B-mode ultrasound (US) and tissue elastography to adequately measure the extent of ablation compared to pathologic assessment. MATERIALS AND METHODS An in vivo porcine model was used to compare B-mode ultrasonography and elastography to pathologic assessment of the microwave ablation zone area. In parallel, intraoperative ablations in patients were used to assess the ability of B-mode US and elastographic measures of tissue strain immediately after ablation to predict ablation size, compared to postprocedural computed tomography (CT). RESULTS In the animal model, ablation zones appeared to decrease in size when monitored with ultrasound over a 10-minute span with both B-mode US and elastography. Both techniques estimated smaller zones than gross pathology, however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Biopsies from the edges of the ablation zone, as assessed by US, contained viable tissue in 75% of the cases. In the human model, B-mode US and elastography estimated similar ablation sizes; however, they underestimate the final size of the ablation defect as measured on postprocedure CT scan (median area [interquartile range]: CT, 7.3 cm(2) [5.2-9.5] vs. US 3.6 cm(2) [1.7-6.3] and elastography 4.1 cm(2) [1.4-5.1]; P = .005). CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound and elastography provide an accurate gross estimation of ablation zone size but are unable to predict the degree of cellular injury and significantly underestimate the ultimate size of the ablation.","Correa-Gallego, Camilo; Karkar, Ami M; Monette, Sebastien; Ezell, Paula C; Jarnagin, William R; Kingham, T Peter",Academic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2013.09.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24331267/,176

METHODS From February 2012 to November 2013, 101 patients underwent minimally invasive partial nephrectomy for renal masses. Computed tomography arteriography was carried out 3-4 days after surgery; radiologists diagnosed renal artery pseudoaneurysm in a blinded manner. Factors influencing the occurrence of renal artery pseudoaneurysm were analyzed with the logistic regression model. RESULTS The incidence of renal artery pseudoaneurysm was unexpectedly high at 21.7% when detected by computed tomography arteriography during the early period after minimally invasive partial nephrectomy. The renal artery pseudoaneurysm group showed a significantly larger tumor size (P = 0.02), significantly higher N component score (P = 0.01) and higher incidence of renal sinus exposure or opening of the collecting system (P < 0.01) compared with the no renal artery pseudoaneurysm group. Although these aforementioned factors were found to be significant by univariate analysis, multivariate analysis showed that renal sinus exposure was the only significant independent predictive factor for occurrence of renal artery pseudoaneurysm. Tumor-related factors, such as the N component of the nephrometry scoring system or tumor size, did not show an independent influence on the occurrence of renal artery pseudoaneurysm. CONCLUSIONS The present study shows an unexpectedly high incidence of asymptomatic unruptured renal artery pseudoaneurysm detected by computed tomography arteriography in the early period after minimally invasive partial nephrectomy. Renal sinus exposure is an independent significant factor predicting the occurrence of renal artery pseudoaneurysm. Avoidance of deep excision into the renal sinus could reduce the risk of renal artery pseudoaneurysm.","Omae, Kenji; Kondo, Tsunenori; Takagi, Toshio; Morita, Satoru; Hashimoto, Yasunobu; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Iizuka, Junpei; Nozaki, Taiji; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Tanabe, Kazunari",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.12696; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25581594/,176

To clarify the hypothesis that CRF attenuates the incident risk of pneumonia due to inflammation, we conducted a prospective study examining the independent and joint associations of inflammation and CRF on the risk of pneumonia in a population sample of 2041 middle-aged men. METHODS Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly measured as peak oxygen uptake (V˙O2peak) during progressive exercise testing to volitional fatigue, and categorized into tertiles. Inflammation was defined by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Pneumonia cases were identified by internal medicine physicians using the International Classification of Diseases codes in clinical practice. RESULTS During a median follow-up of 27 yr, 432 pneumonia cases were recorded. High hsCRP and CRF were associated with a higher risk (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88) and a lower risk of pneumonia (HR = 0.55; CI, 0.39-0.76) after adjusting for potential confounders, respectively. Compared with normal hsCRP-Fit, moderate to high hsCRP-Unfit had an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.63; CI, 1.21-2.20), but moderate to high hsCRP-Fit was not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.25; CI, 0.93-1.68). CONCLUSIONS High CRF attenuates the increased risk of pneumonia due to inflammation. These findings have potential implications for the prevention of respiratory infection characterized by systemic inflammation, such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).","Jae, Sae Young; Heffernan, Kevin S; Kurl, Sudhir; Kunutsor, Setor K; Kim, Chul-Ho; Johnson, Bruce D; Franklin, Barry A; Laukkanen, Jari A",Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1097/hcr.0000000000000581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560044/,176

Due to varied manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, many scoring systems, which were earlier used for community acquired pneumonia (CAP) are in use to determine the disease severity and the need of ICU admissions for proper management. COVID-19 is a relatively new disease and the validity of these scoring systems in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not completely known. This study aimed to validate these scoring systems in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Indian setup. The study has also tried to find the most accurate indicator of disease severity and 14-day mortality among these scoring systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study included 122 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at a tertiary hospital in Ranchi, Jharkhand. The severity of the disease according to ICMR protocol for COVID-19, the PSI/PORT score, the CURB-65 score and the SCAP score were calculated in all the patients and analyzed with the disease outcome i.e. 14-day mortality. RESULTS SCAP score, PSI/PORT score and CURB-65 criteria, all were good indicators of disease severity and 14-day mortality. However, when compared to other scoring systems, SCAP score was a more accurate marker of disease severity and 14-day mortality. CONCLUSION The PSI/PORT scoring system, the CURB-65 criteria and the SCAP scoring system can be used to assess the COVID-19 severity and predict the 14-day mortality risk in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Anurag, A; Preetam, M",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13326; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33417280/,176

METHOD Participants were drawn from two large online samples (mean age = 12; range: 6-17) with (N = 1323) and without (N = 921) ASD. The study used the Emotion Dysregulation Inventory (EDI), a parent-report measure designed for youth with ASD. The EDI asks parents about current severity and perceived change (i.e. how current severity compares to lifetime severity) in emotion dysregulation, and includes two factors: Reactivity (rapidly escalating, intense negative affect) and Dysphoria (poorly upregulated positive affect, general unease). RESULTS Results indicated that youth with ASD had greater Reactivity severity and also greater positive change in Reactivity than non-ASD peers. Furthermore, differences between youth with and without ASD in the relationship between Reactivity and Dysphoria suggest a distinct profile of emotion dysregulation in ASD. Within the ASD sample, age and severity of stereotyped behavior predicted Reactivity and Dysphoria severity and Reactivity change. Female gender, lower parent education, and fluent verbal ability were additional predictors of increased Reactivity severity, while intellectual disability predicted lower Dysphoria severity. CONCLUSIONS This study provides new insight into predictors of emotion dysregulation in youth with ASD and represents a first step toward identifying which children with ASD may be most vulnerable to severe emotion dysregulation problems.","Northrup, Jessie B; Patterson, Mark T; Mazefsky, Carla A","Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53",https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2021.1955369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369833/,176

We argue that addressing conspiracy theories with only corrective information is not enough. Instead, considering that they are complex narratives embedded in personal and cultural worldviews, they should be encountered with counternarratives. To identify existing narrative interventions aimed at countering anti-vaccination conspiracy theories and, more generally, map prerequisites for a narrative intervention to be successful, we present a systematic review of experimental effects of exposure to pro-vaccine narratives on a range of vaccination outcomes, based on 17 studies and 97 comparisons. We did not find any narrative interventions aimed directly at conspiracy theories. However, the review allowed us to make evidence-based recommendations for future research and for public communicators. This might help pro-vaccine communication match anti-vaccine communication in its potential to spread and go viral.","Lazić, Aleksandra; Žeželj, Iris",Public understanding of science,https://doi.org/10.1177/09636625211011881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34006153/,176
145117,The Patient's Perspective on Returning to Elective Surgery After COVID-19.,2021-02-01,"OBJECTIVE Parotidectomies are commonly performed procedures by head and neck surgeons. Although parotidectomies are historically inpatient procedures, recent observational evidence has highlighted the potential for parotidectomies to be performed on an outpatient basis. This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to compare complications and unplanned health care utilization between patients undergoing outpatient versus inpatient parotidectomy. DATA SOURCES A systematic review was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. REVIEW METHODS Studies comparing the outcomes of outpatient parotidectomy with those of inpatient parotidectomy were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Postoperative complications (hematoma, facial nerve dysfunction, seroma, fistulisation, Frey syndrome, and wound infection) and rates of 30-day readmission, reintervention, and emergency department presentation were compared. RESULTS We screened 1018 nonduplicate articles to include 5 studies, all of which were retrospective cohort studies. There were fewer complications found in the outpatient group (relative risk = 0.61, 95% confidence interval: 0.40-0.93). Outpatient procedures were more commonly performed on patients who lived close to the hospital, had fewer comorbidities, and had less extensive planned surgery. CONCLUSION Outpatient parotidectomy appears safe in select patients with outcomes comparable with inpatient surgery. However, evidence overall is of low quality, and further work is needed to delineate a satisfactory set of criteria for appropriate patient identification.","Forner, David; Lee, Daniel J; Walsh, Chris; Witterick, Ian J; Taylor, S Mark; Freeman, Jeremy",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820911725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286187/,176
145284,Acute and sustained increase in endothelial biomarkers in COVID-19.,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUND Cumulative supplemental oxygen (CSO) and cumulative mean airway pressure (CMAP) are associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants, but their relationships to white matter injury (WMI) and neurodevelopment have not been evaluated. METHODS Preterm infants <32 weeks' gestation were prospectively imaged with 3 T MRI near term. CSO and CMAP were retrospectively summed over the first 14 and 28 days. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 30 months adjusted using the Bayley-III. ROC and linear regression were used to evaluate the relationship between CSO, CMAP, and BPD with WMI and neurodevelopmental performance, respectively. RESULTS Of the 87 infants, 30 (34.5%) had moderate-severe BPD, which was associated with WMI (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.1-34.9, p = 0.012). CSO and CMAP predicted WMI as well as BPD (AUC 0.68-0.77). CSO was independently associated with decreased language and cognitive performance (mean difference at 14 days: -11.0, 95% CI -19.8 to -2.2, p = 0.015 and -9.8, 95% CI -18.9 to -0.7, p = 0.035, respectively) at 30 months adjusted. CONCLUSIONS BPD precursors predict WMI as well as BPD. Cumulative supplemental oxygen over the first 14 days of life is independently associated with lower language and cognitive performances. These data suggest that early respiratory status influences the risk of adverse neurodevelopment in preterm infants. IMPACT Respiratory precursors to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cumulative supplemental oxygen and mean airway pressure, over the first 14-28 days performed as well as BPD for the prediction of white matter injury on MRI in preterm infants.Cumulative supplemental oxygen was independently associated with lower language and cognitive performance on the Bayley-III at 30 months adjusted.These data suggest that early respiratory status may help explain why BPD is independently associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the preterm population and highlights the importance of interventions targeting respiratory status as a potential avenue to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.","Grelli, Kimberly N; Keller, Roberta L; Rogers, Elizabeth E; Colin Partridge, J; Xu, Duan; James Barkovich, A; Gano, Dawn",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-01162-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937647/,176
145288,"COVID-19: Current understanding of its Pathophysiology, Clinical presentation and Treatment.",2020-09-25,"OBJECTIVE To report a novel surgical approach of transvaginal hybrid natural orifice transluminal surgery (NOTES) living donor nephrectomy. We conceptualized this approach by incorporating 2 existing concepts: laparoendoscopic single-site surgery and NOTES. MATERIALS AND METHODS After thorough consent and under institutional review board approval, a 61-year-old woman volunteered to donate her kidney through hybrid transvaginal NOTES. Under general anesthesia, she was placed in a modified right lateral decubitus position. A SILS port and an 8-mm trocar were placed through the same umbilical incision. The GelPoint port was placed transvaginally via the posterior fornix, and the robot was docked. After dissection of the left kidney in preparation for extraction, the robot was undocked, and the retrieval bag was inserted through the GelPoint port. The graft was bagged before vessel stapling and extracted without breaching the bag. The kidney was delivered to the perfusion table with a clean pair of gloves without contamination with the bag exterior. RESULTS Donor nephrectomy was successfully completed without conversion or perioperative complications. The total operative time was 240 minutes, the warm ischemic time was 5.8 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was 75 mL. No complications occurred and extra ports were not needed. The patient was discharged after an uneventful 48-hour stay. Her creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL at 4 weeks of follow-up. The recipient was given pulse steroids for biopsy-proven acute rejection, and her serum creatinine was 1.16 mg/dL at 4 weeks postoperatively. CONCLUSION Transvaginal hybrid NOTES robotic donor nephrectomy is feasible. Additional advances in robotic technology are awaited for development of this approach and to foster its clinical application.","Kaouk, Jihad H; Khalifeh, Ali; Laydner, Humberto; Autorino, Riccardo; Hillyer, Shahab P; Panumatrassamee, Kamol; Modlin, Charles; Goldman, Howard B",Urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urology.2012.08.061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23206759/,176

SETTING French refractive surgeons. DESIGN Anonymous practice survey. METHODS The questionnaire was sent in a single email invitation to 400 declared refractive surgeons. The following information was recorded between December 2019 and April 2020, before the coronavirus pandemic: demographics data, preoperative evaluation and preparation of the patient, surgical management, immediate and postoperative protocol, and infections reported after corneal refractive surgery. RESULTS Eighty-three 83 of 400 surgeons (20.75%) responded to the questionnaire; 55 (66.0%) performed more than 50 corneal refractive surgeries a year, and 25 (30.1%) performed more than 200 procedures a year. Thirty-six (43.4%) surgeons wore 3 protective items, 37 (44.6%) 2, 5 (6.0%) 1, and 5 (6.0%) zero. Seventy-seven (92.8%) surgeons used povidone-iodine for skin area disinfection and 54 (65%) for conjunctival fornix disinfection. The contact time of povidone-iodine was less than 3 minutes for 71 (85.0%) surgeons. Twenty surgeons (24.1%) reported at least 1 post-refractive surgery infection. Twenty percent of surgeons who wore sterile gloves for PRK reported post-operative infections compared with 62.5% for those who did not (p=0.008). These figures were, respectively, 8.7% and 66.7% for the use of sterile gloves during LASIK (p=0.002); 8.9% of surgeons who wore surgical masks for LASIK reported postoperative infections compared with 50.0% for those who did not (p=0.01). CONCLUSION Practices are variable among French refractive surgeons. Wearing a surgical mask and sterile gloves during corneal refractive surgery appears to be advisable.","Tourabaly, Moïse; Knoeri, Juliette; Leveziel, Loïc; Bouheraoua, Nacim; Ameline, Barbara; Borderie, Vincent",Journal of cataract and refractive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.jcrs.0000000000000396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826703/,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 227 ICA-UA in 190 patients were treated with BAC (120 patients, 141 ICA-UA) or SAC (70 patients, 86 ICA-UA. We compared characteristics of patients and ICA-UA, and clinical and angiographic outcomes between groups. RESULTS Aneurysm size and neck diameter were greater for SAC than in BAC, but aneurysm volume and coil packing density were not different between groups. Immediate angiographic occlusion grade was better for BAC than for SAC. Periprocedural thromboembolic events were more frequent during SAC (11.6%) than BAC (2.4%) per aneurysm, but hemorrhagic events were the opposite (2.4% for BAC and none for SAC per aneurysm) (p < 0.05). At discharge, treatment-related morbi-mortality rates were 1.6% for BAC and 1.4% per patient for SAC. At clinical follow-up (BAC, 118 patients [98.3%] for a mean of 48.4 months; SAC, 69 patients [98.6%], for a mean of 37.4 months), 1 additional treatment-related infarction occurred during SAC, resulting in a modified Rankin scale score of 4. Thus, overall treatment-related morbi-mortality rates were 1.7% in BAC and 2.9% in SAC. At imaging follow-up (BAC, 135 aneurysms [95.7%] for 28.3 months; SAC, 81 aneurysms [94.1%] for 23.9 months), BAC and SAC showed stable or improved occlusion in 94.1% and 95.0%, minor recurrence in 4.4% and 2.5%, and major recurrence in 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION Both BAC and SAC were safe and effective techniques for ICA-UA.

The use of educational technology (EdTech) offers an alternative to in-person learning and reinforces social distancing, but there is limited evidence on whether and how EdTech affects academic outcomes. Recently, we conducted two large-scale randomized experiments, involving ~10,000 primary school students in China and Russia, to evaluate the effectiveness of EdTech as a substitute for traditional schooling. In China, we examined whether EdTech improves academic outcomes relative to paper-and-pencil workbook exercises of identical content. We found that EdTech was a perfect substitute for traditional learning. In Russia, we further explored how much EdTech can substitute for traditional learning. We found that EdTech substitutes only to a limited extent. The findings from these large-scale trials indicate that we need to be careful about using EdTech as a full-scale substitute for the traditional instruction received by schoolchildren.","Fairlie, Robert; Loyalka, Prashant",NPJ science of learning,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-020-00072-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32821427/,176

The findings can provide observational information on treatment of patients derived from everyday clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS TRISP is an open, investigator-driven collaborative research initiative of European stroke centres with expertise in treatment with revascularisation therapies and maintenance of hospital-based registries. All participating centres made a commitment to prospectively collect data on consecutive patients with stroke treated with IVT using standardised definitions of variables and outcomes, to assure accuracy and completeness of the data and to adapt their local databases to answer novel research questions. FINDINGS TO DATE Currently, TRISP comprises 18 centres and registers >10 000 IVT-treated patients. Prior TRISP projects provided evidence on the safety and functional outcome in relevant subgroups of patients who were excluded, under-represented or not specifically addressed in randomised controlled trials (ie, pre-existing disability, cervical artery dissections, stroke mimics, prior statin use), demonstrated deficits in organisation of acute stroke care (ie, IVT during non-working hours, effects of onset-to-door time on onset-to-needle time), evaluated the association between laboratory findings on outcome after IVT and served to develop risk estimation tools for prediction of haemorrhagic complications and functional outcome after IVT. FUTURE PLANS Further TRISP projects to increase knowledge of the effect and safety of revascularisation therapies in acute stroke are ongoing. TRISP welcomes participation and project proposals of further centres fulfilling the outlined requirements. In the future, TRISP will be extended to include patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy.","Scheitz, Jan F; Gensicke, Henrik; Zinkstok, Sanne M; Curtze, Sami; Arnold, Marcel; Hametner, Christian; Pezzini, Alessandro; Turc, Guillaume; Zini, Andrea; Padjen, Visnja; Wegener, Susanne; Nordanstig, Annika; Kellert, Lars; Kägi, Georg; Bejot, Yannick; Michel, Patrik; Leys, Didier; Nolte, Christian H; Nederkoorn, Paul J; Engelter, Stefan T",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023265; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30224398/,176
148114,"First known COVID-19 case and contact tracing efforts in Istanbul, Turkey.",2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND This study evaluated our new strategy for treating suspected T2 gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) using a laparoscopic approach. METHODS We examined 19 patients with suspected T2 GBC who were treated laparoscopically (LS group) between December 2007 and December 2013; these patients were compared with 14 patients who underwent open surgery (OS group). Laparoscopic staging was initially performed to exclude factors making the patients ineligible for curative resection. Intraoperative pathological examination of the surgical margin of the cystic duct was performed prior to laparoscopic gallbladder bed resection, and pathological examination was again performed to confirm the presence of carcinoma and the depth of tumor invasion. Surgery was completed when the pathological findings indicated that the patient was cancer free. Lymph node dissection was performed according to the depth of tumor invasion. RESULTS None of the patients required conversion to laparotomy. For three patients with benign lesions, only gallbladder bed resection was required. Additional regional lymph node dissection was performed in 16 patients in the LS group. The mean operative time (309 vs. 324 min, p = 0.755) and mean number of dissected lymph nodes (12.6 vs. 10.2, p = 0.361) were not significantly different between the LS and OS groups. The intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower (104 vs. 584 mL, p = 0.002) and the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter (9.1 vs. 21.6 days, p = 0.002) for LS patients than for those in the OS group. In the LS group, one patient developed postoperative pneumonia, but all patients survived without recurrence after a mean follow-up of 37 months.

148227,Communicating With Vaccine-Hesitant Parents: A Narrative Review.,2021,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS Open transabdominal repair of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) requires a long cystotomy incision, suprapubic drainage and delayed recovery. Laparoscopic repair is limited by difficult suturing in pelvic procedures. Therefore, the utility of robotic assistance is being increasingly explored. We share our initial experience of robot-assisted laparoscopic VVF repair. METHODS The data from patients who underwent robot-assisted VVF repair from December 2014 to August 2016 were recorded and analyzed. Patients underwent standard preoperative evaluation. After cystovaginoscopy and placement of an access catheter across the fistula, a four-port transperitoneal approach was used. Following adhesiolysis, limited posterior cystotomy was performed. The vaginal and bladder flaps were separated and repaired in the transverse and vertical directions, respectively. V-Loc sutures were used for bladder closure. Omental/sigmoid colon epiploicae or a peritoneal flap was interposed. A pelvic drain was placed. RESULTS During the study period, 30 patients underwent surgery, of whom 11 (36.7 %) had complex VVF (9 with failure of a previous repair, 1 following radiotherapy, and 1 with a large defect following obstructed labor), and 27 had supratrigonal VVF. The mean age of the patients was 43.5 ± 8.6 years. The mean operative time was 133 ± 48 min. Median blood loss was 50 ml (IQR 50 ml). No suprapubic catheter was placed. The median durations of drain placement and hospital stay were 3 days (IQR 2 days) and 7.5 days (IQR 4.5 days), respectively. The median duration of follow up was 38 weeks (IQR 46 weeks). No recurrence was seen in 28 patients (93.3 %). CONCLUSIONS Current data suggest that robot-assisted VVF repair is safe and feasible and probides the advantages of minimally invasive surgery.","Bora, Girdhar S; Singh, Shivanshu; Mavuduru, Ravimohan S; Devana, Sudheer K; Kumar, Santosh; Mete, Uttam K; Singh, Shrawan K; Mandal, Arup K",International urogynecology journal,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00192-016-3194-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27844120/,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty four infertile women with stage III or IV endometriosis were randomly divided to two groups. The control group received the routine treatment and the treatment group, beside the routine protocol, received 50000 IU vitamin D weekly for 12-14 weeks. Blood and endometrial tissue were collected from both groups before and after the intervention. Protein and Gene expression levels of β-catenin were assessed by Western blotting and Real-Time PCR, respectively. RESULTS Compared to before intervention, the expression of active form of β-catenin reduced significantly within treatment group (p = .000), in addition, the difference between control and treatment groups (p = .012) was significant after intervention, too. Also, the ratio of active/total form of β-catenin protein expression was significantly decreased within the treatment group at the end of intervention period (p = .000).

150296,The influence of the genetic background of the host on vitamin D deficiency in children with COVID-19.,2020-12-14,"Due to their low immunogenicity in patients, humanized or fully human mAbs are becoming increasingly important for the treatment of a growing number of diseases, including cancer, infections, and immune disorders. Here, we describe a technology allowing for the rapid isolation of fully human mAbs. In contrast to previously described methods, B cells specific for an antigen of interest are directly isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of human donors. Recombinant, antigen-specific single-chain Fv (scFv) libraries are generated from this pool of B cells and screened by mammalian cell surface display by using a Sindbis virus expression system. This method allows isolating antigen-specific antibodies by a single round of FACS. The variable regions (VRs) of the heavy chains (HCs) and light chains (LCs) are isolated from positive clones and recombinant fully human antibodies produced as whole IgG or Fab fragments. In this manner, several hypermutated high-affinity antibodies binding the Qbeta virus like particle (VLP), a model viral antigen, as well as antibodies specific for nicotine were isolated. All antibodies showed high expression levels in cell culture. The human nicotine-specific mAbs were validated preclinically in a mouse model. Thus, the technology presented here allows for rapid isolation of high-affinity, fully human antibodies with therapeutic potential from human volunteers.","Beerli, Roger R; Bauer, Monika; Buser, Regula B; Gwerder, Myriam; Muntwiler, Simone; Maurer, Patrik; Saudan, Philippe; Bachmann, Martin F",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0805942105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18812621/,176

These cysts are benign tumors and mostly clinically silent. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Their pathogenesis remains unclear. CASE PRESENTATION During a routine ultrasound examination of a Caucasian 25-year-old woman, a structure that raised our suspicions of an ovarian cyst was found. MRI showed a 4.5 cm cystic lesion in the cecal region. Laparoscopic exploration revealed unexpected contact with the ascending colon. The cyst, including its base and of portion of the colon, was resected laparoscopically. The histological examination revealed cystic lymphangioma. CONCLUSION Lymphangiomatous cysts of the colon are very rare lesions. Although their pathology is benign, the recommended treatment is resection, which can be performed with minimal invasiveness.","Hoffmann, Jonas; Kirschniak, Andreas; Scharf, Gregor; von Feilitzsch, Maximilian; Königsrainer, Alfred; Zdichavsky, Marty",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/1752-1947-5-431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892928/,176

METHODS A total of 152 rats were randomized as follows: (1) sham; (2) portal vein ligation; (3) portal vein ligation/surgical split (ALPPS); (4) portal vein ligation/split of the liver with a radiofrequency ablation needle; (5) portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation of the deportalized liver (portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation necrosis in the deportalized liver); (6) portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation of the future liver remnant (portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation-future liver remnant); and (7) controls. Animals were evaluated on postoperative days 2 and 4. Bodyweight, liver parameters, hepatic regeneration rate, proinflammatory cytokines, hepatocyte proliferation, and gene expression were measured. RESULTS Hepatic regeneration rate indicated a steady increase in all intervention groups compared with sham rats (P < .001). At postoperative day 2, the hepatic regeneration rate was significantly higher in the portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation necrosis in the deportalized liver group than in the portal vein ligation group (P = .039). On postoperative day 4, we found significant differences between the portal vein ligation group and the ALPPS (P = .015), portal vein ligation/split of the liver with a radiofrequency ablation needle (P = .010), and portal vein ligation/radiofrequency ablation necrosis in the deportalized liver (P = .046) groups. Hepatocyte proliferation was significantly higher at all times compared with sham rats. On postoperative day 4, we found a significantly higher proliferation in groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 compared to portal vein ligation. Gene analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in cellular proliferation and downregulation of genes involved in cellular homeostasis in all intervention groups. Between the intervention groups, gene expression was nearly identical. Biochemical markers and proinflammatory cytokines were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION The surplus liver regeneration after ALPPS is probably mediated through parenchymal damage and subsequent release of growth stimulators, which again upregulates genes involved in cellular regeneration and downregulates genes involved in cellular homeostasis. We also demonstrate that growth of the future liver remnant, comparable to that seen after ALPPS, could be achieved by radiofrequency ablation treatment of the deportalized liver, that is, a procedure in which the initial step in humans can be performed percutaneously.","Andersen, Kasper Jarlhelt; Knudsen, Anders Riegels; Jepsen, Betina Norman; Meier, Michelle; Gunnarsson, Anders Patrik Alexander; Jensen, Uffe Birk; Nyengaard, Jens Randel; Hamilton-Dutoit, Stephen; Mortensen, Frank Viborg",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2017.03.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28408101/,176

RECENT FINDINGS New observations in the field from 2019 to 2020 have resulted in a better understanding of the clinical association and pathogenic origins of IIM. The use of patient-reported outcome measures and perspectives, identifying biomarkers and making better use of autoantibody testing are summarized. Basic sciences have led to an improved understanding of the role of NETosis in calcinosis, and of interferon type 1, in IIM. Preliminary insights are offered into Covid-19 in the setting of IIM, and the use of potential tools for monitoring disease remotely, which may assume larger importance for optimal disease management during a global pandemic. The wider exploration of newer imaging modalities and the use of nailfold capillaroscopy is a further step in better management of the condition. SUMMARY The summarized research in IIM is a step forward in being able to further define, and to distinguish disease activity from damage, in order to potentially aid future clinical diagnosis and management in this challenging disease.","Gupta, Latika; Chinoy, Hector",Current opinion in rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1097/bor.0000000000000749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32890032/,176

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, in Japanese HD patients. METHODS A total of 124 patients (24-h urine volume ≥500 mL) on thrice-weekly HD were randomized to receive oral tolvaptan 15 mg/day (n = 40), tolvaptan 30 mg/day (n = 40) or placebo (n = 44) for 24 weeks. Efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in 24-h urine volume, total fluid removal by HD per week and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). Safety was assessed via the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). RESULTS At treatment end, the difference (95% confidence interval) from the placebo group in the mean change from baseline in 24-h urine volume was significant in the tolvaptan 15 mg {429.1 mL [95% confidence interval (CI) 231.0, 627.2]; P < 0.0001} and 30 mg [371.6 mL (95% CI 144.1, 599.2); P = 0.0017] groups. The mean changes from baseline in total fluid removal by HD and IDWG were not significantly different in the tolvaptan groups versus the placebo group. Although the proportion of patients with TEAEs was lower in the placebo group (77.3%) than in the tolvaptan groups (92.3%), tolvaptan was safe and well-tolerated during the study period. CONCLUSIONS Tolvaptan significantly sustained diuretic action for 24 weeks in HD patients but did not reduce total fluid removal by HD per week and IDWG to the same extent.","Ogata, Hiroaki; Shimofurutani, Naoko; Okada, Tadashi; Nagamoto, Hisashi; Akizawa, Tadao","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfaa148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901255/,176

Pb adverse effects on nitric oxide (NO-) production and variable effects on inflammatory cytokines in activated macrophages have been reported, but no effects have been reported in anti-inflammatory macrophages. We studied Pb (0.03 - 6 µg/dl equivalent to 0.014 - 2.89 µM) effects on the function of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) induced to either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory phenotypes, with LPS + IFNγ or IL-4+IL-13, respectively, and whether these effects are related. Pb did not induce cytotoxicity at any concentration in both macrophage phenotypes. In inflammatory BMDM, Pb (6 µg/dl) inhibited NO- production without affecting inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels or basal arginase activity. At 3 and 6 µg/dl, Pb enhanced the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) membrane expression but did not modify CD86 expression, TNFα, or IL-1β production and secretion. In anti-inflammatory BMDM, Pb did not alter arginase activity, but at 3 and 6 µg/dl, increased TGF-β1 and mannose receptor expression. Results showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of Pb alter functional outcomes or phenotypic markers of anti-inflammatory for the first time. The Pb effects on the inflammatory macrophages are not dependent on negative feedback resulting from the Pb effect on the anti-inflammatory phenotype. The Pb affected only some molecules or specific pathways related to both phenotypes. These effects could be related to Pb effects on immune defense against intracellular pathogens and allergy susceptibility.","Ortiz-Robles, Christian D; Cortés-Montoya, Vanessa; Reyes-Aguilar, Sandra S; Albores, Arnulfo; Calderón-Aranda, Emma S",Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.152885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352350/,176

The second aim was to estimate the potential number of candidates for the MeCFES device. The application of MeCFES provides the user with direct control of the grasp force as opposed to triggered FES systems. METHODS Screening 253 medical records of C5 to C7 spinal cord injury resulted in 27 participants who trained activities of daily living for 12 × 2 hours, using the MeCFES. Hand function was evaluated by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Primary outcome was the ARAT change score with/without the device, before/after the intervention period. Secondary outcome was the number of positive or clinically relevant change scores with respect to the cohort. RESULTS The MeCFES improved hand test score in 63% of the subjects at first application. Training resulted in a significant therapeutic effect, which resulted in an overall increase of hand function in 89% of the participants and 30% experienced a clinically relevant change (6 points or more). CONCLUSIONS Clinical relevance was found both as an assistive aid and as a therapeutic tool in rehabilitation. The therapeutic effect deserves further investigation in clinical studies.","Thorsen, Rune; Dalla Costa, Davide; Chiaramonte, Sara; Binda, Luca; Beghi, Ettore; Redaelli, Tiziana; Occhi, Eugenio; Ferrarin, Maurizio",TheScientificWorldJournal,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/836959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24489513/,176

METHODS A self-administered survey was distributed to 150 members of the CSSANZ. They were asked to rank the importance of 33 variables considered when making decisions to use radiotherapy in the treatment of rectal cancer. The responses were assessed for association of surgeon age, area of practise or access to radiotherapy with decisions in this field. RESULTS A hierarchy of variables was produced which showed tumour characteristics had the highest average importance, higher than that attained by patient characteristics and side effects. There were subtle but statistically significant differences in the ranking of importance when surgeons were grouped by age, site of subspeciality training, site of practise and availability of radiotherapy service. CONCLUSION This study identifies a hierarchy of variables used in decision making concerning radiotherapy in rectal cancer treatment, which may be used in heuristic decision making. Decisions on using radiotherapy are influenced by age, site of practise, site of training, and the presence of radiotherapy on site.","Hong, Jonathan S Y; Young, Christopher J; Solomon, Michael J",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.03.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686031/,176

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of breast lesions has been considered to be the primary investigation in detecting breast cancers, especially in low-cost settings. The main objective of this study was to prospectively re-confirm the diagnostic accuracy of breast FNAB using the IAC Yokohama system. Additionally, separate secondary subgroup analysis was done to confirm the accuracy of breast FNAB excluding lymph-node positive and lymphadenopathy positive tumors. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospective study was done on patients undergoing biopsy of breast lesions between September 01, 2019 and November 30, 2020 (519 biopsies on 487 unique patients). Of these 519 histopathology biopsies, 505 had corresponding FNAB report of the same site. The FNAB was reported using the IAC Yokohama system and the most suitable category was allotted in every case. The rates of malignancy for each category and the accuracy of breast FNAB in diagnosing malignancy were calculated. RESULTS Of the total 487 patients, 120 cases were benign on histology, while 367 were malignant. The rates of malignancy in benign, atypical, suspicious and malignant categories were 5%, 25%, 71%, and 99.7%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of atypical, suspicious and malignant categories was calculated as 90.1%, 95.2%, and 93.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION The high diagnostic accuracy for each BIRADS category suggest excellent accuracy for Breast FNAB using the IAC Yokohama system.","Agrawal, Shruti; Anthony, Michael Leonard; Paul, Pranoy; Singh, Divya; Mehan, Anoushika; Singh, Ashok; Joshi, Prashant Pranesh; Kumar, Arvind; Syed, Anjum; Ravi, Bina; Rao, Shalinee; Chowdhury, Nilotpal",Diagnostic cytopathology,https://doi.org/10.1002/dc.24743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33755356/,176

Therefore, development of new anti-tuberculosis antibiotics is urgent for the control of tuberculosis (TB) infections. FtsZ, the homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is a GTPase that assembles into cytokinetic Z rings essential for cell division in prokaryotic cells. FtsZ (filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z) polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner, and polymerization of FtsZ forms into dynamic protofilaments. In this study, we screened 20,000 compounds to identify inhibitors of GTPase activity of M. tuberculosis FtsZ. We found that 297F inhibited GTPase and polymerization of FtsZ, and reduced the amount of FtsZ polymers. Furthermore, 297F has anti-TB activity with low cytotoxicity and shows no antibacterial activities toward other Gram-positive or Gram-negative strains. In vitro, 297F also induced filamentation in Mycobacterium smegmatis. All results suggest that 297F inhibits bacterial proliferation by targeting M. tuberculosis FtsZ and it may be useful as a lead compound for developing anti-TB agents.","Lin, Yuan; Zhu, Ningyu; Han, Yanxing; Jiang, Jiandong; Si, Shuyi",The Journal of antibiotics,https://doi.org/10.1038/ja.2014.89; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24984796/,176

In this review we consider a year later where we are now, what the future holds, and what the long term effects of the pandemic will be on stroke. Stroke occurs in about 1.4% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 infection, who show an excess of large vessel occlusion and increased mortality. Despite this association, stroke presentations fell dramatically during the pandemic, although emerging data suggests that total stroke mortality may have risen with increased stroke deaths at home and in care homes. Strategies and guidelines have been developed to adapt stroke services worldwide, and protect healthcare workers. Adaptations include increasing use of telemedicine for all aspects of stroke care. The pandemic is exacerbating already marked global inequalities in stroke incidence and mortality. Lastly the pandemic has had a major impact on stroke research and funding, although it has also emphasised the importnace of large scale collaborative research initiatives.","Markus, Hugh S; Martins, Sheila Cristina Ouriques",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/17474930211006435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003703/,176

The outcome of patients with isolated M2 occlusions treated with the Mindframe Capture low profile (LP) stent retriever was reviewed. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively collected data on all consecutive patients treated for isolated M2 occlusions between June 2013 and December 2017 using the Mindframe Capture LP was performed. Technical aspects of the recanalization procedure, recanalization rate, complication rate, and clinical outcome were analyzed. RESULTS Mechanical thrombectomy with the Mindframe Capture LP was performed in 38 patients (median age 79 years) with an isolated M2 occlusion. The median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 7.5 (interquartile range, IQR 5-12) and successful reperfusion modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI 2b or 3) was achieved in 28 patients (74%). A compensated/adjusted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0-2 at 3 months was observed in 65% when taking pre-stroke disability into account. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) occurred in 1 patient (2.6%). Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aICH) was noted in 8 patients (21%) and a small subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the immediate vicinity of the target vessel was apparent in 8 patients (21%). CONCLUSION The Mindframe Capture LP is a technically effective thrombectomy device for the treatment of isolated M2 occlusions. The lower profile of the device is advantageous when targeting peripheral intracranial occlusions.","Dobrocky, Tomas; Bellwald, Sebastian; Kurmann, Rebekka; Piechowiak, Eike I; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Mosimann, Pascal J; Zibold, Felix; Jung, Simon; Arnold, Marcel; Fischer, Urs; Gralla, Jan; Mordasini, Pasquale",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-018-0739-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30413830/,176

Three-dimensional ultrasound was used to examine the immediate effect of isolated eccentric exercise on the mechanical properties of the distal (free tendon) and proximal (gastrocnemii) regions of the Achilles tendon. Participants (n = 14) underwent two testing sessions in which tendon measurements were made at rest and during a 30% and 70% isometric plantar flexion contractions immediately before and after either: (a) 3 × 15 eccentric heel drops or (b) 10-min rest. There was a significant time-by-session interaction for free tendon length and strain for all loading conditions (P < 0.05). Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant increase in free tendon length and strain at all contraction intensities after eccentric exercise (P < 0.05). There was no significant time-by-session interaction for the gastrocnemii (medial or lateral) aponeurosis or tendon for any of the measured parameters. Immediate changes in Achilles tendon mechanical properties were specific to the free tendon and consistent with changes due to mechanical creep. These findings suggest that the mechanical properties of the free tendon may be more vulnerable to change with exercise compared with the gastrocnemii aponeurosis or tendon.,"Obst, S J; Newsham-West, R; Barrett, R S",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.12466; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919320/,176

METHODS We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol. The whole blood samples were centrifuged to separate the plasma with or without prior heat inactivation, or only the separated plasma was heat inactivated. Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 ℃ for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol. The plasma standard and quality control samples were inactivated in an identical manner and tested with LC-MS/MS along with the treated samples. RESULTS The optimized method showed a high imprecision (with mean intra- and inter-day imprecisions of 3.59% and 2.81%, respectively) and a high accuracy (mean 97.37%) for detecting voriconazole in the inactivated samples at different concentration levels. Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%). The measured voriconazole concentrations in inactivated whole blood, inactivated plasma and the samples without inactivation all showed good linear correlations with correlation coefficients all greater than 0.99. CONCLUSIONS Heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Boxin; Liu, Sijia; Liu, Yuan; Li, Guofeng; Zhang, Qing",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32376593/,176
157224,Epidemiology of COVID-19 in Indonesia: common source and propagated source as a cause for outbreaks.,2021-05-31,"Increasing numbers of pregnant women with COVID-19 are being reported around from the world. The majority of neonates delivered to pregnant women infected with the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have been negative for the virus, but a small number have tested positive for infection. It is important to determine whether vertical transmission of COVID-19 occurs and the mechanisms for its development. Based on a number of clinical and laboratory findings it has been suggested that transplacental transmission may be occurring, but a method to confirm this is necessary. This communication analyzes and evaluates the covariables that have been discussed as potential indicators of vertical and, specifically, intrauterine transmission including the timing of onset of neonatal illness, neonatal viral test positivity, neonatal antibody testing for IgG and IgM, and viral analysis of swabs of whole specimens of placental tissue. None of these methods can provide confirmatory evidence that infection developed prior to labor and delivery, or that transplacental transmission occurred. This commentary proposes that diagnosis of early-onset neonatal COVID-19 infection should be limited to neonates with positive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 within the initial 72 hours of life. It also proposes that the occurrence of intrauterine transplacental SARS-CoV-2 among infected mother-infant dyads be based upon identification of SARS-CoV-2 in chorionic villous cells using immunohistochemistry or such nucleic acid methods such as in situ hybridization. Evaluating placentas from neonates with COVID-19 using these methods will be instrumental in determining the potential role and prevalence of transplacental transmission of the coronavirus.","Schwartz, David A; Morotti, Denise; Beigi, Babak; Moshfegh, Fereshteh; Zafaranloo, Nazanin; Patanè, Luisa",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0442-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886737/,176
157486,What every orthopaedic surgeon should know about COVID-19: A review of the current literature.,2020,"INTRODUCTION The use of flow diverters (FDs) has shown promising results, particularly in the treatment of large or complex intracranial aneurysms. However, some complications can occur both during and after FD treatment, including delayed ipsilateral parenchymal hemorrhage (DIPH). The clinical presentation, etiopathogeny, and management of this complication are not well understood. We report a series of four patients with DIPH and discuss the potential mechanisms and modalities of treatment. METHODS Four patients treated with FDs and presenting with DIPH were diagnosed in two different centers. Clinical and imaging data were reviewed before and after the procedure. Characteristics of the intraparenchymal hematomas, the modalities of treatment, and clinical course were analyzed. RESULTS Intraparenchymal hemorrhage occurred 1 to 4 days after aneurysm treatment with FDs. All hemorrhages were situated in the ipsilateral hemisphere and were anatomically remote from the treated aneurysm. The four patients were treated with emergency surgery (hematoma evacuation). All patients had a favorable clinical outcome (mRS = 1) at midterm evaluation. Follow-up imaging showed good permeability of the FD in all subjects and complete aneurysm occlusion in all patients. CONCLUSION From the literature review, DIPH appears to be more frequent than delayed aneurysm rupture and may be a cause of increasing concern for the use of flow diverters. However, the mechanisms of DIPH are not completely understood. Surgical evacuation of the hematoma seems to be feasible with acceptable safety and good clinical outcomes.","Tomas, Catherine; Benaissa, Azzedine; Herbreteau, Denis; Kadziolka, Krzysztof; Pierot, Laurent",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-013-1302-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24240633/,176

Herein, we report a case of sacrococcygeal hernia occurring in a patient who had no history of sacrococcygeal operation, present the operative procedures of mesh repair via a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach that has not been described, and discuss our experience in diagnosis and treatment with a review of the literature. CASE SUMMARY A 54-year-old woman who chiefly complained of a 10-year history of a reversible bulge in her right sacrococcygeal region was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination revealed a bulge in the right sacrococcygeal region upon standing, which disappeared in the prone position but relapsed when performing the Valsalva manoeuvre. Computed tomography displayed an abnormality in the structure of the tissues between the midline of the sacrococcygeal region and the right gluteus muscle. The patient was diagnosed with sacrococcygeal hernia and received hernia repair with mesh through a combined laparoscopic and sacrococcygeal approach. On laparoscopy, the rectum was dissected posterolaterally, and a defect was identified in the right anterior sacrococcygeal region through which part of the rectum protruded. This was followed by the placement of a self-gripping polyester mesh via a sacrococcygeal approach. There were no postoperative complications. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 and was followed for more than 6 mo with no recurrence. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic mesh repair is recommended as a priority of surgical options for sacrococcygeal hernias, while choosing a self-gripping mesh can help avoid the risk of presacral vessel injury by reducing suture fixation.","Dong, Yuan-Qiang; Liu, Li-Jia; Fu, Zan; Chen, Si-Meng",World journal of clinical cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i2.362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047786/,176

Despite medical progress, the prevalence of complicated pneumococcal pneumonia became increased without apparent explanations. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) were used to compare the plasma protein profiles from children with different severities of pneumococcal pneumonia. Plasma samples from 14 cases, 7 with complicated and the other 7 with uncomplicated pneumonia, were analyzed. Complicated pneumonia was defined by the presence of pleural fluid parameters consistent with empyema, and/or a computed tomography compatible with necrotizing pneumonitis. The normal control group included 7 age-matched volunteers. By comparing the plasma proteins of patients with different severities, 4 proteins with significant differences were identified. The up-regulated proteins were haptoglobin and immunoglobulin kappa chain. The down-regulated were apolipoprotein A-I (Apo-AI) and transthyretin. All these proteins are known to take part in the inflammation reaction, which implicates the active innate immune responses in severe infections of S. pneumoniae. In addition, the up-regulated haptoglobin, which protects lung tissues against oxidative damage by the clearance of hemoglobin, can also act as an inflammatory inhibitor. Thus, our data seem to indicate that inflammation balance may take place in the occurrence of complicated pneumococcal pneumonia.","Tsai, Ming-Han; Lin, Tzou-Yien; Hsieh, Sen-Yung; Chiu, Chih-Yung; Chiu, Cheng-Hsun; Huang, Yhu-Chering",Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365540902936909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19396720/,176

At the same time, other studies have indicated that CRM is a successful notion of improving healthcare business, service quality and overall satisfaction. This study aims to explore the implementation CRM in the Malaysian healthcare sector, and in order to achieve this aim a qualitative approach will be applied. A number of private hospitals located in the state of Perak have been interviewed, but currently on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions. The findings from several IT executives and medical professionals indicated that no hospital has fully implemented the CRM yet and there is a lack of knowledge on what does CRM really means. However, further investigations will be taking place in various states and hospitals once restrictions were eased to find out more about the current status of CRM implementation. We believe that ANT can be very valuable in evaluating the CRMS implementation in healthcare, as it can help in exploring how certain technologies would form human's interaction. © 2021 IEEE.","Baashar, Y.; Alkawsi, G.; Alhussian, H.; Bahbouh, H.

Although tremendous amount of research devoted to the robustness across its biology, diagnostics, vaccines and treatment has exploded in the past two years. However, still science do not have robust answers for causes, for example (i) What are the reasons of non-uniform global distribution of COVID-19? (ii) Why the United States, India, and Brazil, are the first-three most affected nations?, (iii) How did Bhutan, a nation sharing a boundary with China manage nearly 0.34% infections and 3 deaths from COVID-19? Nonetheless, the biomass bistribution of biosphere report suggest more than 1550-fold larger microbial biomass involving bacteria, fungi, archaea, protists and viruses is exist in comparision to all global human population in the biosphere. The rich microbiota act a first line of defence to invade pathogens and affect us both through the environment and microbiome. Unfortunately, a role of pathogen-transmission factors viz. implicit factors (competitive microflora) is still under represented. This study is an attempt from a gold standard correlation methodology using a large pesticide use global data. The non-specific pesticides kill both pests as well as protective microbiota, resulting a loss in rich biodiversity and allow easy pathogen entry to human. Entire predictions were found consistent with the recently observed evidences. These insights enhanced scientific ability to interrogate viral epidemiology and recommended to limit pesticide use for future pandemic prevention.","Aggarwal, A.; Rai, R.; Joshi, G.; Gahtori, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.09.21263347v1?rss=1,176

At present, no single study has been published on Filipino nurses’ experiences outside the country during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This descriptive phenomenological study explored the Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) nurses’ experiences working in COVID-19 intensive care units. Methods: The study was conducted in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where there is a high number of COVID-19 cases. This study utilized a qualitative Husserlian phenomenological approach to describe and explore the lived experiences of the OFW nurses’ caring for COVID-19 critically ill patients. The research key interview informants were eight ICU nurses who cared for COVID-19 patients in Dubai hospitals. Data saturation was reached. Data collection was done in 2020, and Collaizi’s method of data analysis was utilized. Results: A total of 135 significant statements were extracted from the interview transcripts. There were 36 formulated meanings generated, and four themes emerged from this study. The first theme is Challenges During the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Away from Home, Caring for the COVID-19 Patients, and Fear of the Unknown. The second theme is Patient Care during COVID-19 with the following subthemes: COVID-19 ICU Patient Care and The Nursing Profession. Third, Adapting to Change with the subthemes: Living the New Normal and Protecting One’s Self from COVID-19. Lastly, Resilience Amidst the Pandemic with the following subthemes: Being with Others and Seeing Oneself. Conclusion: Despite the existing challenges like cultural differences and homesickness faced by these OFW nurses and the new challenges they are faced with the pandemic today, they were still able to continue living and do what is expected of them. From the hassle of wearing the PPEs, shortage of PPE, and being transferred from one unit in the hospital to another, the OFW nurses were able to adapt to these changes. The nurses already got used to the routine, but the fear of getting infected by the virus is still there.","Pogoy, Jane Marnel; Cutamora, Jezyl Cempron; en,",Belitung Nursing Journal,https://doi.org/10.33546/bnj.1427,176

We now have a choice, which is to return to our pre-pandemic lives and livelihoods, or to leverage the anthropause to address ecological imbalances and injustices to change how, when, where, and with whom we create ecological knowledge. Meanwhile, three actions for bolstering social and ecological resilience, inspired by this unique moment in time, are suggested. These include bringing ecological knowledge to bear on complex problems, expanding and refocusing the lenses through which we view and practice ecology, and focusing on feedbacks within and among social and ecological systems.","Weathers, Kathleen C.; Ojima, Dennis Collinge Sharon K.; Sala, Osvaldo",Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment,https://doi.org/10.1002/fee.2382,176

The most affected countries are developing countries because of their weak HC infrastructure and meagre resources. Hence, building the resilience of the HC system of such countries becomes essential. Therefore, this study aims to build a resilience-based model on the HC sector of Pakistan to combat the COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a novel hybrid approach to formulate a model based on resilient attributes (RAs) and resilient strategies (RSs). In the first step, the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique, i.e. full consistency method (FUCOM) is used to prioritize the RAs. Whereas, the fuzzy quality function deployment (QFD) is used to rank the RSs. Findings: The findings suggest “leadership and governance capacity” to be the topmost RA. Whereas “building the operational capacity of the management”, “resilience education” and “Strengthening laboratories and diagnostic systems” are ranked to be the top three RSs, respectively. Practical implications: The model developed in this study and the prioritization REs and RSs will help build resilience in the HC sector of Pakistan. The policymakers and the government can take help from the prioritized REs and RSs developed in this study to help make the current HC system more resilient towards the current COVID-19 and future pandemics in the country. Originality/value: A new model has been developed to present a sound mathematical model for building resilience in the HC sector consisting of FUCOM and fuzzy QFD methods. The main contribution of the paper is the presentation of a comprehensive and more robust model that will help to make the current HC system of Pakistan more resilient. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Khan, F.; Ali, Y.; Pamucar, D.",Kybernetes,https://doi.org/10.1108/k-02-2021-0130,176
175210,Evaluation of the conformity between chest CT scan results with molecular diagnosis test in patients with COVID-19. (Special issue on COVID-19.) [Persian],2020,"Objectives: New or increased cough is an important sign of pulmonary exacerbation. There is unmet need to objectively quantify and analyse cough trends in early life. Advances in flexible electronics and materials allow development of soft, skin-like, accelerometer-based wearable devices that seamlessly interface with the human body in unique locations, enabling the simultaneous capture of low-frequency body, chest, and throat motion along with high-frequency vocal, throat, and lung sound signals associated with various body processes including coughs and vital signs. Methods: A small, flexible, fully wireless, accelerometer-based mechano-acoustic sensor (MAS) was applied using gentle adhesives to the suprasternal notch of 10 paediatric CF subjects during regular clinic visits. A 15-minute protocol consisting of eliciting cough, throat clearing, speech, and laughs in various head/body orientations, ambient environments, and physical activity intensities. The MAS recorded at a high bandwidth 1.6kHz rate and automatically uploaded to a cloud server upon replacement on a wireless charging platform. Results: The captured sensor data was analysed using an existing machine learning algorithm developed for COVID-19 symptom tracking. Preliminary results show the device differentiates cough from other vocal, respiratory noises and motion artifacts, both at rest and during activity. A majority of children found the device to be acceptable, though device size and adhesive removal caused minor discomfort for some. Conclusion: The extraction of well-classified cough events is feasible, facilitating further analysis of cough episode duration, force, and clinically relevant features associated with early decompensation, response to treatment, and daily symptom tracking. Objective measurement of cough may be useful as a clinical study outcome measure and for clinical monitoring. Future work will include evaluation for longer time periods during stability and pulmonary exacerbations.","Tzavelis, A.; Rangaraj, V.; Chiang, J.; Bedford, B.; Palla, J.; Rychlik, K.; Rogers, J.

176244,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on staging at presentation of patients with invasive melanoma,2021,"Exploring and analyzing data using visualizations is at the heart of many decision-making tasks. Typically, people perform visual data analysis using mouse and touch interactions. While such interactions are often easy to use, they can be inadequate for users to express complex information and may require many steps to complete a task. Recently natural language interaction has emerged as a promising technique for supporting exploration with visualization, as the user can express a complex analytical question more easily. In this paper, we investigate how to synergistically combine language and mouse-based direct manipulations so that the weakness of one modality can be complemented by the other. To this end, we have developed a novel system, named Multimodal Interactions System for Visual Analysis (MIVA), that allows user to provide input using both natural language (e.g., through speech) and direct manipulation (e.g., through mouse or touch) and presents the answer accordingly. To answer the current question in the context of past interactions, the system incorporates previous utterances and direct manipulations made by the user within a finite-state model. The uniqueness of our approach is that unlike most previous approaches which typically support multimodal interactions with a single visualization, MIVA enables multimodal interactions with multiple coordinated visualizations of a dashboard that visually summarizes a dataset. We tested MIVA's applicability on several dashboards including a COVID-19 dashboard that visualizes coronavirus cases around the globe. We further empirically evaluated our system through a user study with twenty participants. The results of our study revealed that MIVA system enhances the flow of visual analysis by enabling fluid, iterative exploration and refinement of data in a dashboard with multiple-coordinated views.","Chowdhury, I.; Moeid, A.; Hoque, E.; Kabir, M.

179863,Mode of Presentation and Outcomes of COVID-19 Cases in a Tertiary Hospital in Nigeria,2021-07-13,"Advances in microbiome researches have led us to the realization that the composition of microbial communities of indoor environment is profoundly affected by the function of buildings, and in turn may bring detrimental effects to the indoor environment and the occupants. Thus investigation is warranted for a deeper understanding of the potential impact of the indoor microbial communities. Among these environments, the biological laboratories stand out because they are relatively clean and yet are highly susceptible to microbial contaminants. In this study, we assessed the microbial compositions of samples from the surfaces of various sites across different types of biological laboratories. We have qualitatively and quantitatively assessed these possible microbial contaminants, and found distinct differences in their microbial community composition. We also found that the type of laboratories has a larger influence than the sampling site in shaping the microbial community, in terms of both structure and richness. On the other hand, the public areas of the different types of laboratories share very similar sets of microbes. Tracing the main sources of these microbes, we identified both environmental and human factors that are important factors in shaping the diversity and dynamics of these possible microbial contaminations in biological laboratories. These possible microbial contaminants that we have identified will be helpful for people who aim to eliminate them from samples. Importance Microbial communities from biological laboratories might hamper the conduction of molecular biology experiments, yet these possible contaminations are not yet carefully investigated. In this work, a metagenomic approach has been applied to identify the possible microbial contaminants and their sources, from the surfaces of various sites across different types of biological laboratories. We have found distinct differences in their microbial community compositions. We have also identified the main sources of these microbes, as well as important factors in shaping the diversity and dynamics of these possible microbial contaminations. The identification and interpretation of these possible microbial contaminants in biological laboratories would be helpful for alleviate their potential detrimental effects.","Li, Xi; Zhu, Xue; Wang, Wenjie; Ning, Kang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/439570,176

This crisis highlights both spill-overs from major asymmetries in EMU and weaknesses in the incomplete economic governance of the Eurozone. We focus on the financial support mechanisms agreed upon after intergovernmental negotiations in major crisis situations. These reforms represent compromise solutions that reflect well-entrenched disagreements among member states. We explain why more far-reaching reforms to Eurozone economic governance–notably, the adoption of mutualized Euro-denominated debt and the generalized use of grants over loans–have not been adopted, despite the severity of the Covid-19-related crisis. These reforms–notably the Next Generation European Union (NGEU) financial package adopted in July 2020–fail to address and, rather, contribute to existing asymmetries, thus sowing the seeds of future crises. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Howarth, D.; Quaglia, L.",Journal of European Public Policy,https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2021.1954060,176
182047,Reduction in prostate cancer hospitalizations in the COVID-19 pandemic epicenter of Latin America,2021,"Adaptation of the Russian education system to the changes forced by the COVID-19 pandemic was complicated by the sheer size of the country, which entails the differentiation of the regions in terms of the quality of education, access to knowledge networks, communication resources, and top universities. Amid the pandemic, the country’s education system experienced an initial shock after the introduction of distance learning in March 2020, attempted to return to classroom learning in September 2020, and introduced blended learning in October 2020. Each stage brought about changes in organization and management of teaching and learning processes, development of online learning platforms and courses, and technological improvements. A diversified teacher education system impeded these changes. In effect, only the largest among 300 education institutions that offer teacher education programs had the necessary resources to provide high-quality distance and blended learning. Their experience could form the basis for creating a standardized model of teacher training for the purposes of blended learning. This is most probable in the context of the tight control and the top–down approach typical of the Russian education system. The article, therefore, analyzes some examples regarding teacher training during the pandemic implemented at Russian universities. These cases have the potential to become major trends that would ensure consistency of the country’s education system in extreme situations that might recur in the future.","Valeeva, Roza Kalimullin Aydar",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11080408,176
182200,"Reply to the letter ""Evidence of effectiveness in the pharmacological management of patients with COVID-19""",2021,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and related technologies have played an active role in the prevention and control of novel coronaviruses at home and abroad, especially in epidemic pre-vention, surveillance, and elimination. However, the existing UAVs have a single function, limited processing capacity, and poor interaction. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed an intelligent anti‐epidemic patrol detection and warning flight system, which integrates UAV autonomous navigation, deep learning, intelligent voice, and other technologies. Based on the convolution neural network and deep learning technology, the system possesses a crowd density detection method and a face mask detection method, which can detect the position of dense crowds. Intelligent voice alarm technology was used to achieve an intelligent alarm system for abnormal situations, such as crowd-gathering areas and people without masks, and to carry out intelligent dissemination of epidemic prevention policies, which provides a powerful technical means for epidemic prevention and de-laying their spread. To verify the superiority and feasibility of the system, high‐precision online analysis was carried out for the crowd in the inspection area, and pedestrians’ faces were detected on the ground to identify whether they were wearing a mask. The experimental results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the crowd density detection was less than 8.4, and the mean av-erage precision (mAP) of face mask detection was 61.42%. The system can provide convenient and accurate evaluation information for decision‐makers and meets the requirements of real‐time and accurate detection. © 2021 by the authors.

Hypokinesia contributes to changes in the work of many adaptive systems of the body, which leads to disorders in the musculoskeletal system, respiratory, muscular, and cardiovascular systems. Of particular relevance and practical interest is the effect on the body not only of hypokinesia, but also the processes during the transition from it to an active motor regime (recovery period). The study was carried out on 2 groups of white outbred rats: group 1 - animals growing under limited motor activity for 30 days, group 2 - animals in the recovery period after 30 days of hypokinesia. The study of the functional parameters of the Langendorff heart of rats (LVP, HR, CF) was carried out on the selected groups. Results of the study revealed that after 30 days of hypokinesia and 14 days recovery period, the heart rate decreased 1.2 times and the coronary flow decreased 2 times. Further, the current study has shown a tendency to restore the heart rate parameters of an isolated heart but the restoration of the coronary flow and cardiac contractility has not been identified. The result of the study suggested that 14 days is not a full-fledged period for the restoration of the functional parameters of the body.

182351,COVID-19 in patients with oncohematological diseases,2021,"Motivated by the challenge of using DNA-seq data to identify viruses in human blood samples, we propose a novel classification algorithm called""Radial Distance Weighted Discrimination""(or Radial DWD). This classifier is designed for binary classification, assuming one class is surrounded by the other class in very diverse radial directions, which is seen to be typical for our virus detection data. This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions naturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance Weighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data set, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear separating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more appropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary. Simulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better generalizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional kernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods essentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape of the separating boundary. The effectiveness of Radial DWD is demonstrated for real virus detection.","Xiong, Jie; Dittmer, D. P.; Marron, J. S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.02900v1.pdf,176

The number of infections rose steeply and preventative measures such as lockdowns were implemented to slow down the spread of the disease. Infections peaked around mid-September the same year and the cases gradually started declining. Following the relaxation of lockdown and the appearance of mutant strains of the virus, a much severe second wave of COVID-19 emerged starting mid-February. For characterization and comparison of both the waves, a SIQR (Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Removed) model is used in this paper. The results indicate that a single patient can infect approximately 2.44 individuals in the population. The epidemic doubling time was calculated to be 11.8 days.

182978,COVID-19: Preliminary Clinical Guidelines for Ophthalmology Practices,2020-04-06,"Over the last decade, banking sector stability has received much attention as Basel III implementations take shape in response to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. Since said crisis, regulators have increased banking sector regulation and supervision in an effort to increase banking sector resilience and avert potential future crises. Notwithstanding the importance of these regulatory and supervisory enhancements, we consider the potential threat of a banking crisis and investigate the ability of important banking stability parameters to provide economic growth resilience. We perform a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation methodology on a global panel dataset of 140 countries, across the period 1995–2017, to determine the effect of banking sector stability, banking sector regulatory capital, and banking sector liquidity, on the relationship between banking crises and GDP growth. Our results indicate that a more stable banking sector reduces the negative effect of a banking crisis on GDP growth, hence providing economic resilience during said crisis periods. This effect is experienced by developed and developing economies. However, asymmetries are observed for banking sector liquidity and banking sector regulatory capital across high-income and middle-income economies. Liquidity provides resilience for economic growth, but the effect is only apparent for high-income countries. Regulatory capital provides growth resilience, but this effect is not apparent for high-income economies. We argue that while overall banking stability is critical, regulators and other policymakers must account for the differences in the relevant characteristics of their market structures when designing effective strategies in order to maximize the effectiveness of said policies.","Stewart, Robert Chowdhury Murshed",The Journal of Economic Asymmetries,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeca.2021.e00218,176

184174,Active Telephonic Follow-up During COVID-19 Lockdown: Initial Experience.,2020-06-24,"Background: Patients with autoimmune disease often require immunosuppressive medications that may increase their risk of developing severe illness from COVID-19. The importance of immunization in this population is particularly high. While the studied vaccines show efficacy in the general population, nothing is known regarding the immune response or safety profile in patients with autoimmune disease and those taking immunomodulatory medications. Objectives: To assess the safety profile and degree of adverse events from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disease. Methods: This study is part of a larger prospective observational study examining the immunogenicity and safety profile of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in patients with immune-mediated diseases taking immunomodulatory medications. Adults with an immune-mediated disease scheduled to receive either a Pfizer or Moderna SARS-COV-2 vaccine were enrolled in this study. Subjects participated in 3 study visits (pre-vaccine, dose 1 (D1) and dose 2 (D2)) where blood, for immunologic assays, and clinical data were collected. Assessments of adverse events (AE), including local and systemic symptoms and validated degree of AE severity were solicited within 7 days of receiving each vaccine dose. Results: To date, 70 patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disease have been enrolled. Demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. Distribution of current immunomodulatory medications included prednisone 18.6%, conventional synthetic DMARD 55.7%, targeted synthetic DMARD 4.3%, and biologic DMARD 68.5%. Almost all participants experienced an adverse event following vaccination (D1 96%, D2 100%). Following D1 AEs were generally mild (76.5%) whereas following D2 a large portion of patients experienced AEs that were moderate (47.8%) and severe (30.5%). Injection site pain was the most common AE following both doses followed by arthralgias (D1 21.6%, D2 78.2%), fever (D1 21.6%, D2 70%) and fatigue (D1 21.6%, D2 65.2%) (Figure 1). Conclusion: Patients with autoimmune and inflammatory disease experience a significant burden of adverse events following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with both frequency and severity appearing greater than that of the reported results from the vaccine clinical trials. Several of the endorsed AEs such as fever, fatigue and arthralgias can also be commonly seen in rheumatologic diseases, mimicking flares. While SARS-CoV-2 immunization is crucial in patients with autoimmune diseases, this study demonstrates the importance of understanding the AEs experienced by this patient population to better inform patients of possible expected side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and further management in the future.","Yang, M.; Katz, P.; Paez, D.; Carvidi, A.; Matloubian, M.; Nakamura, M.; Gensler, L.

Comparative genome analysis showed that the various open reading frames (ORFs) of the genomes of the three coronaviruses had significantly higher amino acid identities to those of other group 2 coronaviruses than group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Phylogenetic trees constructed using chymotrypsin-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, spike, and nucleocapsid all showed that the group 2a and 2b and putative group 2c and 2d coronaviruses are more closely related to each other than to group 1 and 3 coronaviruses. Unique genomic features distinguishing between these four subgroups, including the number of papain-like proteases, the presence or absence of hemagglutinin esterase, small ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes and ORFs (NS7a and NS7b), bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot structures downstream of the nucleocapsid gene, transcription regulatory sequence, and ribosomal recognition signal for the envelope gene, were also observed. This is the first time that NS7a and NS7b downstream of the nucleocapsid gene has been found in a group 2 coronavirus. The high Ka/Ks ratio of NS7a and NS7b in bat-CoV HKU9 implies that these two group 2d-specific genes are under high selective pressure and hence are rapidly evolving. The four subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses probably originated from a common ancestor. Further molecular epidemiological studies on coronaviruses in the bats of other countries, as well as in other animals, and complete genome sequencing will shed more light on coronavirus diversity and their evolutionary histories.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Wang, Ming; Lau, Susanna K P; Xu, Huifang; Poon, Rosana W S; Guo, Rongtong; Wong, Beatrice H L; Gao, Kai; Tsoi, Hoi-Wah; Huang, Yi; Li, Kenneth S M; Lam, Carol S F; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17121802/,176

Interestingly, a low-pH pulse overcame the BafA1 block to JSRV infection, although this occurred only if virus-bound cells were preincubated at 37 degrees C, consistent with a very early entry event such as endocytosis being required before the low-pH-dependent step occurs. Moreover, JSRV pseudovirions were resistant to low-pH inactivation.

It is reported to be valid because it is based on the universe of symptoms of DSM-IV and ICD-10 depression. The aim of the current preliminary study was to assess the reliability, validity and psychometric properties of the Greek translation of the MDI. METHODS 30 depressed patients of mean age 23.41 (+/- 5.77) years, and 68 controls patients of mean age 25.08 (+/- 11.42) years, entered the study. In 18 of them, the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later and the Translation and Back Translation made. Clinical diagnosis was reached with the use of the SCAN v.2.0 and the International Personality Disorders Examination (IPDE). The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and the Zung Depression Rating Scale (ZDRS) were applied for cross-validation purposes. Statistical analysis included ANOVA, the Spearman Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Principal Components Analysis and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS Sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, at 26/27. Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was equal to 0.89. The Spearman's rho between MDI and CES-D was 0.86 and between MDI and ZDRS was 0.76. The factor analysis revealed two factors but the first accounted for 54% of variance while the second only for 9%.

The mean lowest oxygen saturation was (94.8 +/- 3.1)% with supplementary oxygen through a nasal cannula. 68.8% of the patients were treated with methylprednisolone for a mean period l of (4.9 +/- 2.4) days. The initial dose was (67.3 +/- 28.2) mg/d and the maximal dose was (82.4 +/- 30.5) mg/d. Ninety-five patients (99.0%) had a complete clinical recovery, and 1 patient died of progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome. The mean hospitalized duration was (17.2 +/- 8.0) days. CONCLUSION SARS appears to be highly contagious and potentially lethal among health care workers, characterized by acute onset and rapid progression. Corticosteroids, antibiotics, human gamma-globulin, interferon-alpha, and antiviral drugs, although used empirically, might be of some benefits in shortening the clinical course.","Wu, Wei; Wang, Jing-feng; Liu, Pin-ming; Chen, Wei-xian; Yin, Song-mei; Jiang, Shan-ping; Yan, Li; Zhan, Jun; Chen, Xi-long; Huang, Zi-tong; Xu, Jian-xing; Li, Jian-guo; Ma, Li-ping; Huang, Hong-zhang",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12921601/,176
194846,Comment on: Challenge of diagnosing ANCA-associated vasculitis during COVID-19 pandemic: a missed 'window of opportunity' by Giollo et al.,2021-05-28,"AIM In this study, buccal swabs from patients with the clinical picture of parotitis epidemica in whom mumps virus (MV) infection was not confirmed by direct detection or serologically were tested. The aim was to detect by molecular methods nucleic acids (NAs) of other respiratory viruses possibly involved in salivary gland swelling. At the same time, paired sera, if available, were tested. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group consisted of 72 buccal swabs from patients of the Clinic of infectious, tropical, and parasitic diseases, Na Bulovce Hospital. Paired sera were available from ten patients. Samples were collected in 2013 to 2015. Buccal swabs were tested by PCR for the presence of NAs of adenoviruses (AdV), bocaviruses (hBoV), parainfluenza viruses of types 1-4 (HPIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses (HCoV: NL63, OC43, HKU1, and 229E), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Paired sera were screened by the complement fixation test (AdV and influenza A and B viruses), hemagglutination inhibition test (HPIV types 2 and 3), ELISA (AdV, EBV), and immunofluorescence (EBV). RESULTS NAs from viruses other than the mumps virus were detected in 27 of 72 patients with clinical symptoms of parotitis epidemica, and serological tests revealed etiological links with parainfluenza viruses in three more cases. Overall, 30 (41.7%) of 72 patients with suspected mumps tested positive for one or more viruses from the study panel. The most commonly detected viruses were AdV 11/72 (15.3%), EBV 9/72 (12.5%), and HPIV 3/72 (4.2%), but influenza A virus (H3N2) 1/72 (1.4%) was also found. Some patients tested positive for more than one virus: 2/72 (3%) for AdV plus hBoV and 1/72 (1.4%) for HPIV plus HCoV. In addition, examination of paired sera revealed HPIV positivity in three more patients. PCR and serology detected etiological link with HPIV in six (8.3%) of 72 patients tested. CONCLUSION In our study group, nearly 42% of patients with the clinical picture of parotitis epidemica in whom mumps virus (MV) infection was not confirmed by direct detection or serologically tested positive for viruses other than the mumps virus. Thorough laboratory diagnosis of suspected mumps in vaccinated persons is important not only for the treatment of patients and adoption of isolation and other measures, but also for a better understanding of the epidemiology of the disease and outcomes of the immunisation programmes.","Limberková, R; Havlíčková, M; Smíšková, D; Labská, K; Herrmannová, K; Procházková, J; Jiřincová, H; Marešová, V","Epidemiologie, mikrobiologie, imunologie : casopis Spolecnosti pro epidemiologii a mikrobiologii Ceske lekarske spolecnosti J.E.

195147,HOME DIALYSIS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK - IT IS WORTH TO CONSIDER.,2020,"In this paper, we introduce an interactive telecommunication system that supports video/audio signal acquisition, data processing, transmission, and 3D animation for post stroke rehabilitation. It is designed for stroke patients to use in their homes. It records motion exercise data, and immediately transfers this data to hospitals via the internet. A real-time videoconferencing interface is adopted for patients to observe therapy instructions from therapists. The system uses a peer-to-peer network architecture, without the need for a server. This is a potentially effective approach to reducing costs, allowing easy setup and permitting group-rehabilitation sessions. We evaluate this system using the following steps: (1) motion detection in different movement patterns, such as reach, drink, and reach-flexion; (2) online bidirectional visual telecommunication; and (3) 3D rendering using a proposed offline animation package. This evaluation has subjectively been proved to be optimal.","Zhang, Shumei; Hu, Huosheng; Zhou, Huiyu",Medical & biological engineering & computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18087743/,176
195935,Molecular-based Alternatives for Colorectal Cancer Screening during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-04-29,"BACKGROUND Women are less likely than men to receive some stroke care interventions. It is not known whether gender differences in patient preferences explain some of the observed variations in stroke care delivery. METHODS Outpatients with and without a history of cerebrovascular disease were recruited from stroke, vascular, and general internal medicine ambulatory clinics between September 2002 and October 2003. Self-administered surveys described hypothetical scenarios, and participants were asked if they would accept therapy with thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke or carotid endarterectomy for secondary stroke prevention. The surveys also included questions on sociodemographic factors and decision-making preferences. RESULTS A total of 586 patients (45% women) completed the survey. Women were less likely than men to accept thrombolysis (79% vs. 86%, P=0.014), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.92). Women and men were equally likely to accept carotid endarterectomy (82% vs. 84%, P=0.502), even after adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.58- 1.53). Women were less confident in their decisions, were more risk averse, and would have preferred more information to assist them in their decision-making. CONCLUSIONS No gender differences were found in patient preferences for carotid surgery. However, we observed gender differences in patient preferences for thrombolysis and in general attitudes toward stroke care decision-making. Health care providers should be aware that, compared with men, women may be more concerned about risks and may require more information before they make a decision.","Kapral, Moira K; Devon, Jennifer; Winter, Anne-Luise; Wang, Julie; Peters, Anne; Bondy, Susan J",Medical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16365615/,176
198128,Desperate Times Call for Deliberate Measurement: A Review of COVID-19 Aerosol Barrier Devices and a Perspective from a Military Treatment Facility.,2021,"Norovirus (NoV), a member of the family Caliciviridae, is a major cause of acute water- and food-borne nonbacterial gastroenteritis and forms antigenically diverse groups of viruses. Human NoVs are divided into at least three genogroups, genogroups I (GI), GII, and GIV, which contain at least 15, 18, and 1 genotypes, respectively. Except for a few genotypes, all NoVs bind to histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), namely ABH antigens and Lewis antigens, in which carbohydrate core structures, (types 1 and 2) constitute antigenically distinct phenotypes. Volunteer challenge studies have indicated that carbohydrate binding is essential for genogroup I genotype 1 (GI/1) infection. Non-secretors who do not express FUT2 fucosyltransferase, and consequently do not express H type 1 or Lewis b antigens in the gut, are not infected after challenge with GI/1. NoV virus-like particles (VLPs), which are recombinant particles that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native virion, display different ABH and Le carbohydrate-binding profiles in vitro. Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABH phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner. On the other hand, an in vitro binding assay using NoV VLPs showed a uniform recognition pattern against type 1 and 2 core structures, and bind more tightly to type 1 carbohydrates than to type 2. Type 1 carbohydrates are expressed at the surface of the small intestine and are presumably targeted by NoV. This property may afford NoV tissue specificity. GII/4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more HBGAs than other genogroups. This characteristic may be linked to the worldwide transmission of GII/4 strains. Although it is still unclear whether HBGAs act as primary receptors or enhance NoV infectivity, they are important factors in determining tissue specificity and the risk of transmission.","Shirato, Haruko",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21519121/,176

199906,Informed Consent for Surgery During COVID-19: Some Important Issues,2020,"In Aplysia, long-term synaptic plasticity is induced by serotonin (5-HT) or neural activity and requires gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that ApLLP, a novel nucleolus protein, is critically involved in both long-term facilitation (LTF) and behavioral sensitization. Membrane depolarization induced ApLLP expression, which activated ApC/EBP expression through a direct binding to CRE. LTF was produced by a single pulse of 5-HT 30 min after the membrane depolarization. This LTF was blocked when either ApLLP or ApC/EBP were blocked by specific antibodies. In contrast, ApLLP overexpression induced LTF in response to a single 5-HT treatment. Simultaneously, a siphon noxious stimulus (SNS) to intact Aplysia induced ApLLP and ApC/EBP expression, and single tail shock 30 min after SNS transformed short-term sensitization to long-term sensitization of siphon withdrawal reflex. These results suggest that ApLLP is an activity-dependent transcriptional activator that switches short-term facilitation to long-term facilitation.","Kim, Hyoung; Lee, Sue-Hyun; Han, Jin-Hee; Lee, Jin-A; Cheang, Ye-Hwang; Chang, Deok-Jin; Lee, Yong-Seok; Kaang, Bong-Kiun",Neuron,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16504946/,176

RESULTS Chest X-rays radiogram showed significant changes until peak stage (4-12 days) with the same doses of methylprednisolone, but it was dissolved consistently afterwards. CONCLUSION It is appeared that corticosteroid therapy has no marked effect on the development of chest radiogram in patients with SARS.

199935,A National Survey of Practice Patterns For Accepting Living Kidney Donors With Prior Covid-19,2021,"AIM This paper is a report of a study to evaluate the intent of epidemiologists to remain in their chosen career and identify the variables that contributed to or predicted their intent to stay. BACKGROUND Recently, emerging new infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome or bird flu, have placed significant occupational and psychological stress on epidemiologists, especially in South-East Asia, resulting in a high intent to change their career. In the light of possible staff shortages, retention strategies for epidemiologists have gained importance. METHODS A self-administered questionnaire survey and stratified sampling were used to collect data from 351 epidemiologists including nurse epidemiologists in Taiwan in 2005; response rate was 70.6%. Correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used to examine relationships among occupational stress, psychological stress, human resources and intent to stay in their career. RESULTS Occupational stress, psychological stress and human resources had an impact on epidemiologists' intent to stay in their career. Results show that the relationship between occupational stress (operation and personal safety hazard) and intent to stay could be influenced by organizational capital, and the relationship between emotional distress and intent to stay could be influenced by a broad spectrum of human resources (organizational, social and human capital). CONCLUSION The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic raised worldwide attention and challenged epidemiologists' intent to stay. Results indicate that human resources play an important role in this issue. Managers should enhance human resources in organizations as much as possible to attenuate epidemiologists' stress, which may, in turn, strengthen their intent to stay.","Tsai, Ming-Tien; Ya-Ti, Hsu",Journal of advanced nursing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18034819/,176

US Cities Readiness Initiative (CRI) open POD preparedness is assessed using the Technical Assistance Review (TAR) but focuses on oral prophylaxis dispensing; mass vaccination readiness is not well measured. Non-CRI preparedness had not been studied. In 2013 an online questionnaire was sent to all 456 CRIs and a random sample of 500 non-CRIs to measure open POD preparedness and exercise participation. Hierarchical linear regression was used to describe factors associated with higher POD preparedness and exercise participation scores. In total, 257 subjects participated, for a 41% response rate. Almost all open PODs have existing written plans and/or a layout for each site (93.4%, n=240, and 87.0%, n=220). Only half (46.7%, n=120) have an alternative dispensing modality in place, and even fewer (42.6%, n=104) report having adequate staffing. Determinants of open POD preparedness were perceived preparedness, participation in more POD exercises, and more closed POD coverage. Most jurisdictions conducted a full-scale exercise and a staff notification drill (83.7%, n=215 for both). Fewer than half (40.5%, n=104) have conducted a vaccination clinic exercise. Determinants of increased POD exercises were perceived preparedness, years of work experience, community type (nontribal), and larger population. Because successful open POD deployment is critical, jurisdictions need to plan for mass vaccination, use of alternative dispensing modalities, and recruitment strategies to increase POD staffing.","Rebmann, Terri; Loux, Travis M; Swick, Zachary; Dolgin, Harlan; Reddick, David; Wakefield, Mary",Health security,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25813973/,176

Because rIFN-beta serine17 (rIFN-beta ser) appears less active than rIFN-alpha 2b in preventing natural rhinovirus colds, we compared the two IFNs in two in vitro assays against selected respiratory viruses. In a yield reduction assay, both IFNs had comparable activity against rhinovirus types 39 and 1A and coronavirus 229E, which were inhibited by 90% or more at IFN concentrations of 10(-11) to 10(-10) gram of protein/ml (approximately 2-20 IU/ml). Similar activities were observed with rIFN-beta ser against rhinoviruses isolated from clinical specimens. At concentrations of 10(-9) gram protein/ml, both IFNs inhibited the growth of influenza A and parainfluenza viruses, but not of adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus in the cell culture systems tested. Thus, the different clinical protection conferred by rIFN-alpha 2b and rIFN-beta ser in studies of natural rhinovirus colds are not accounted for by differences in their in vitro activity against these viruses, and other explanations must be found.","Sperber, S J; Hayden, F G",Journal of interferon research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2545792/,176

The scFv antibody fragments secreted into the supernatant or expressed on the surface of the bacteria showed binding activity against SAI/II in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and surface scFv-expressing lactobacilli agglutinated SAI/II-expressing S. mutans in vitro without affecting the corresponding SAI/II knockout strain. Lactobacilli expressing the scFv fragment fused to an E-tag were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using beads coated with a monoclonal anti-E-tag antibody, and they bound directly to beads coated with SAI/II.

AIM: To analyze the available evidence in the literature on the safety in processing FFRs. METHODS: A systematic review conducted by searching for studies in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, LILACS, CENTRAL, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus. RESULTS: The disinfectant/sterilizing agents most frequently tested at different concentrations and exposure periods were ultraviolet irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide and steam sterilization. Microbial reduction was assessed in 21 (52.5%) studies. The only disinfectants/sterilizers that did not caused degradation of the material-integrity were alcohol, electric cooker, ethylene oxide and peracetic acid fogging. Exposure to ultraviolet irradiation or microwave generated-steam resulted in a non-significant reduction in filter performance. CONCLUSION: There is a complex relationship between the FFR raw materials and the cycle conditions of the decontamination methods, evidencing the need for validating FFRs by models and manufacturers, as well as the process. Some methods may require additional tests to demonstrate the safety of FFRs for use due to toxicity.","Gnatta, Juliana Rizzo; de Souza, Rafael Queiroz; Lemos, Cassiane de Santana; Oliveira, Ramon Antônio; Martins, Lisiane Ruchinsque; Moriya, Giovana Abrahão de Araújo; Poveda, Vanessa de Brito",Am J Infect Control,,176

Millions of people got affected around the globe and many lost their loving ones while fighting with the deadly disease. The two critical challenges of the pandemic are: there are no known treatments for COVID-19 and secondly, its transmission from one person to another is very prompt. Therefore, to control the deadly spread of the pandemic the countries have adopted complete lockdown for months, people were isolated and quarantined to control the spread of the disease. Several terminologies such as lockdown, quarantine, social-distancing, home isolation, and Corona waves can be heard around. In all these necessary measures to control the virus taken by the government the entire humankind suffered and still suffering from several challenges towards living a normal life.

Clinically relevant growth was detected in 197/3,027 (6.5%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 717/6,663 (10.8%) in control group-2020 (p<0.0001) and 850/8,175 (10.4%) in control group-2019 (p<0.0001). Contamination was present in 255/3,027 (8.4%) BC episodes in the COVID-19 group compared to 330/6,663 (5.0%) in control group-2020 (p<0.0001) and 354/8,175 (4.3%) in control group-2019 (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of bloodstream bacterial infection is low and the contamination rate of BC is high. This knowledge should influence guidelines regarding blood culture sampling and empirical antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 patients.","Yu, David; Ininbergs, Karolina; Hedman, Karolina; Giske, Christian G; Strålin, Kristoffer; Özenci, Volkan",PLoS One,,176

Whereas current techniques have been optimized for imaging selected nonpigmented organs such as the mammalian brain, natural pigmentation remains challenging for most other biological specimens of larger volume. We have developed a fast DEpigmEntation-Plus-Clearing method (DEEP-Clear) that is easily incorporated in existing workflows and combines whole system labeling with a spectrum of detection techniques, ranging from immunohistochemistry to RNA in situ hybridization, labeling of proliferative cells (EdU labeling) and visualization of transgenic markers. With light-sheet imaging of whole animals and detailed confocal studies on pigmented organs, we provide unprecedented insight into eyes, whole nervous systems, and subcellular structures in animal models ranging from worms and squids to axolotls and zebrafish. DEEP-Clear thus paves the way for the exploration of species-rich clades and developmental stages that are largely inaccessible by regular imaging approaches.","Pende, Marko; Vadiwala, Karim; Schmidbaur, Hannah; Stockinger, Alexander W; Murawala, Prayag; Saghafi, Saiedeh; Dekens, Marcus P S; Becker, Klaus; Revilla-I-Domingo, Roger; Papadopoulos, Sofia-Christina; Zurl, Martin; Pasierbek, Pawel; Simakov, Oleg; Tanaka, Elly M; Raible, Florian; Dodt, Hans-Ulrich",Sci.

We established a BAC-based reverse genetics system for a Korean isolate of MERS-CoV KNIH002 in the clade B phylogenetically far from the EMC strain, and generated a recombinant MERS-CoV expressing red fluorescent protein. The virus rescued from the infectious clone and KNIH002 strain displayed growth attenuation compared to the EMC strain. Consecutive passages of the rescued virus rapidly generated various ORF5 variants, highlighting its genetic instability and calling for caution in the use of repeatedly passaged virus in pathogenesis studies and for evaluation of control measures against MERS-CoV. The infectious clone for the KNIH002 in contemporary epidemic clade B would be useful for better understanding of a functional link between molecular evolution and pathophysiology of MERS-CoV by comparative studies with EMC strain.","Kim, Minwoo; Cho, Hee; Lee, Seung-Hoon; Park, Woo-Jung; Kim, Jeong-Min; Moon, Jae-Su; Kim, Geon-Woo; Lee, Wooseong; Jung, Hae-Gwang; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Choi, Jang-Hoon; Lee, Joo-Yeon; Kim, Sung Soon; Oh, Jong-Won",Emerg Microbes Infect,,176

Prospective biomarkers may help to predict the severity of an individual's clinical course and mortality risk. We analyzed asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) in blood samples from 31 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. We calculated associations of ADMA and SDMA with mortality and organ failure, and we developed a predictive algorithm based upon these biomarkers to predict mortality risk. Nine patients (29%) experienced in-hospital death. SDMA and ADMA serum concentrations were significantly higher at admission in COVID-19 patients who died than in survivors. Cut-offs of 0.90 µmol/L for SDMA (AUC, 0.904, p = 0.0005) and 0.66 µmol/L for ADMA (AUC, 0.874, p = 0.0013) were found in ROC analyses to best discriminate both subgroups of patients. Hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality was 12.2 (95% CI: 2.2-31.2) for SDMA and 6.3 (1.1-14.7) for ADMA above cut-off. Sequential analysis of both biomarkers allowed discriminating a high-risk group (87.5% mortality) from an intermediate-risk group (25% mortality) and a low-risk group (0% mortality). Elevated circulating concentrations of SDMA and ADMA may help to better identify COVID-19 patients with a high risk of in-hospital mortality.","Hannemann, Juliane; Balfanz, Paul; Schwedhelm, Edzard; Hartmann, Bojan; Ule, Johanna; Müller-Wieland, Dirk; Dahl, Edgar; Dreher, Michael; Marx, Nikolaus",Sci Rep,,176

Toward improved testing of recirculating air purification units, we developed and applied a medium-scale single-pass wind tunnel test to examine the size-dependent collection of particles and the collection and inactivation of viable bovine coronavirus (BCoV, a betacoronavirus), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV, an alphacoronavirus), and influenza A virus (IAV), by a commercial air purification unit. The tested unit, the Molekule Air Mini, incorporates a MERV 16 filter as well as a photoelectrochemical oxidating layer. It was found to have a collection efficiency above 95.8% for all tested particle diameters and flow rates, with collection efficiencies above 99% for supermicrometer particles with the minimum collection efficiency for particles smaller than 100 nm. For all three tested viruses, the physical tracer-based log reduction was near 2.0 (99% removal). Conversely, the viable virus log reductions were found to be near 4.0 for IAV, 3.0 for BCoV, and 2.5 for PRCV, suggesting additional inactivation in a virus family- and genus-specific manner. In total, this work describes a suite of test methods which can be used to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of recirculating air purification technologies.","Qiao, Yuechen; Yang, My; Marabella, Ian A; McGee, Devin A J; Olson, Bernard A; Torremorell, Montserrat; Hogan, Christopher J",Indoor air,,176

METHODS: A Web-based survey was sent to 1069 active endodontic specialists and general dentists who provided endodontic care in Hubei Province from May 7 to May 9, 2020. The survey consisted of 18 questions on demographics, the current situation of endodontic practice for the participants, and concerns regarding contracting or spreading the virus in newly opened endodontic practices. RESULTS: A total of 322 participants completed the survey. Most respondents (62%) were from Wuhan. Almost 83% of the respondents have resumed their endodontic practice partially or fully. Most respondents in practice (99%) would take measures to screen patients before treatment including paid screening measures. More than 93% of the respondents reported having taken special measures for routine endodontic treatment at this stage, with the most common measure taken being wearing an N95 mask. The rubber dam was recognized as efficient in preventing infection by most respondents. Many respondents were concerned about contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of routine endodontic practice at this stage, and respondents with more than 11 years of endodontic experience were significantly less concerned about infection compared with those with fewer than 5 years of experience (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a fear of contracting/spreading COVID-19 among endodontic clinicians, the fear is negatively associated with years of practice, and most clinicians believe that rubber dam isolation can protect them and their patients from COVID-19.","Yu, Jingjing; Hua, Fang; Shen, Ya; Haapasalo, Markus; Qin, Danchen; Zhao, Dan; Peng, Bin; Fouad, Ashraf F",J. endod,,176

Twenty-five adult eugonadal patients with idiopathic gynaecomastia and 50 age- and BMI-matched controls were selected. Clinical and biochemical parameters and ultrasound testis volume were reviewed retrospectively. Patients and controls differed for no biochemical parameter, except for LH levels, which were 31% higher in patients (p = 0.019), although within the normal range. Compared with controls, patients had a threefold greater rate of elevated LDL-c (p = 0.025). Patients &#8805; 25 years had higher levels of serum LDL-c compared with either patients < 25 years (p = 0.006) or controls &#8805; 25 years (p = 0.012). In patients, both at bivariate analysis and at linear regression, age correlated positively with total cholesterol and LDL-c, the latter correlated inversely with total testosterone. Negative interactions were found for age and total testosterone with LDL-c, for LH and estradiol to testosterone ratio (E2:T) with LDL-c, and for age and E2:T with total cholesterol. Our data suggest inadequate local androgen action in patients with idiopathic gynaecomastia. This partial androgen resistance might blunt the beneficial effects of testosterone on lipid metabolism. Further studies are needed to verify whether this metabolic derangement impacts the cardiovascular health of these patients.","Vita, Roberto; Capodicasa, Giovanni; Di Bari, Flavia; Amadeo, Giuseppe; D039, Stagno; Alcontres, Francesco; Benvenga, Salvatore",Andrologia,,176

During the peak time of COVID-19, as the long queues at health care facilities can result in spread of the virus. ICT can play an effective role especially for reducing the extended waiting time of patients to consult a medical practitioner which is considered as a source of hazard during the pandemic. However, in developing countries where majority population is semiliterate so find difficulty when come into contact with appointment systems which are not particularly designed keeping in consideration the requirements of semiliterate users. It is extremely important to better understand how to design user interface which allow semiliterate users to effectively perform the tasks. So there is a dire need to develop a simple, effective, easy to learn user interface (UI) of an online appointment system for the productive doctor-patient consultation. Therefore, this study aimed to providing an effective user interface of web based online appointment system to semi-literate users through User-Centered Design (UCD) methodology. To achieve this, a prototype was designed to overcome issues in the existing appointment systems gathered through a field study. The needs and expectation for semiliterate users were fulfilled by incorporating the requirements of UI development for the target users. A sample of forty-two semiliterate users was used to evaluate the prototype. The evaluation results showed that semiliterate users’ performance measured using— effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction significantly improved while interacting with the prototype as compared to existing interfaces. The effectiveness is measured through number of errors and tasks accomplished in UI, efficiency by the time required to complete the task and satisfaction by System Usability Scale (SUS). The SUS score improved from 50.8 to 77.6 for the prototype. © 2021, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.","Chaudhry, S.; Batool, F.; Muhammad, A.

In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Pavesi, Angelo",Virology,,176

After the mandatory priority of a focus on the most qualified health literature, the survey provides essential elements of information and analysis on scenarios which more closely coincide with the challenges to be faced if and when the imaginary of a 'different-better' world should be translated into reality, specifically in the model area of health. With the obvious limitation of an exercise of methodology (which cannot pretend to a completeness of coverage), both world famous and 'significant' authors are included, as well as Italian voices. The take-home - not easy - message is clear. The pandemic has not been an 'health-disease' event. Its 'syndemic' nature (i.e. its interaction with structural, permanent, economic, social, cultural pandemics) imposes the acceptance and the long-term pursuit of new civilisation paradigms. Health care is definitely one of the areas where this cultural challenge must be met.","Tognoni, Gianni",Assist Inferm Ric,,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out including patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in 3 hospitals, health workers exposed to the infection and outpatients who met suspicious case criteria, all of which underwent the molecular test (RT-PCR) and the rapid serological test. The additional diagnostic performance of rapid serological test was evaluated in comparison to molecular tests. Likewise, an approximation was made to the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid serological test. RESULTS: 144 people were included. With the rapid test, 19.4% of positive results were obtained compared to 11.1% in the molecular test (p = 0.03). The rapid serological test detected 21 cases that had been negative by the initial (RT-PCR), providing an additional diagnostic performance of 56.8% compared to the RT-PCR. The additional diagnostic performance was 50.0% during the first week, 70.0% during the second week and 50.0% during the third week of symptom onset. The sensitivity of the rapid serological test was 43.8% and the specificity of 98.9%. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test was able to detect a greater number of cases than those detected by the molecular test especially after the second week of onset of symptoms. It also showed high specificity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data of 140 patients with pneumonia in our hospital, including 70 who had COVID-19 and 70 who had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), were statistically analyzed. The levels of PCT, IL-6, and CRP were measured and statistically analyzed to determine the differences between the two groups. The differences in the COVID-19 group were analyzed after subgrouping into the ordinary type, severe type, and critical type. RESULTS: The PCT and CRP levels in the COVID-19 group were statistically lower than those in the CAP group (p < 0.05), but IL-6 was not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences existed in IL-6 and CRP when comparing the COVID-19 subgroups of the critical type, severe type, and ordinary type (p < 0.05). However, there was no clinical meaning in the evaluation of the difference in PCT levels among the three subgroups with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: PCT and CRP could be used as indicators in the differentiation between COVID-19 and CAP, but IL-6 was of little significance in the differentiation. The higher the IL-6 and CRP, the more severe the condition of COVID-19 might be.","Zhou, Y-Z; Teng, X-B; Han, M-F; Shi, J-F; Li, C-X; Zhang, X-H; Hou, D-Y; Yang, L-L",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,176
212544,Consensus on pre-examination and triage in clinic of dermatology during outbreak of COVID-19 from Chinese experts,2020,"Location-based applications have become very popular in recent years, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has intensified the trend towards applications for electronic purchases and delivery services, to provide customers the facility of buying from anywhere and anytime, with great ease. However, there are some issues with these kind of purchases and delivery services. In particular, the data collected by these applications has the potential of having their security and privacy breached. Thus, trust of the service provider cannot be taken for granted. In fact, the service provider may prove to be a source of real danger to the privacy of users, especially if the service provider itself is a malicious party. Thus, it is difficult for the user to determine which applications can be trusted, and who to share their home or business location with. To solve this problem, in this research, we propose a new central platform that enables users to gather all of their (main) locations and control access to these locations in one place. Then the user can share them with other applications, such as link with hash-code included in a quick response (QR) barcode without the need to save their data in any application database. Moreover, the QR-code will be deactivated once it is used by the service provider, after the order is delivered.

Each sector responds to this differently, and the Higher Education (HE) sector is no exception, where energy-intensive laboratories are prevalent in most universities. The COVID-19 crisis has meant that these laboratories have either closed or reduced their opening hours;hereby, this offers an excellent opportunity to assess how shutdown periods impact on electrical consumption. This research assesses unregulated electrical consumption within a single laboratory building, which functions as a research engineering building. An Energy-Management System (EMS) was used to collect the room-level data, primarily electrical consumption. This study found that unregulated electricity consumption typically reduced rapidly during the shutdown period with a percentage reduction of 46.61% between the week before lockdown and the week during the lockdown.","Birch, C.; Edwards, R.; Mander, S.; Sheppard, A.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee Pes &amp; Ias Powerafrica Conference,,176
213179,What to do in an oncology department to face the new COVID-19 era challenges?,2020,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are our first line of defence against virus infection. Recent studies have suggested the ability of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to inhibit IFN responses. Emerging data also suggest that timing and extent of IFN production is associated with manifestation of COVID-19 severity. In spite of progress in understanding how SARS-CoV-2 activates antiviral responses, mechanistic studies into wildtype SARS-CoV-2-mediated induction and inhibition of human type I IFN responses are scarce. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a type I IFN response in vitro and in moderate cases of COVID-19. In vitro stimulation of type I IFN expression and signaling in human airway epithelial cells is associated with activation of canonical transcriptions factors, and SARS-CoV-2 is unable to inhibit exogenous induction of these responses. Furthermore, we show that physiological levels of IFN&#945; detected in patients with moderate COVID-19 is sufficient to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway cells.","Banerjee, Arinjay; El-Sayes, Nader; Budylowski, Patrick; Jacob, Rajesh Abraham; Richard, Daniel; Maan, Hassaan; Aguiar, Jennifer A; Demian, Wael L; Baid, Kaushal; D039,; Agostino, Michael R; Ang, Jann Catherine; Murdza, Tetyana; Tremblay, Benjamin J-M; Afkhami, Sam; Karimzadeh, Mehran; Irving, Aaron T; Yip, Lily; Ostrowski, Mario; Hirota, Jeremy A; Kozak, Robert; Capellini, Terence D; Miller, Matthew S; Wang, Bo; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison J; McArthur, Andrew G; Doxey, Andrew C; Mossman, Karen",iScience,,176

Healthcare institutions and providers have been at the forefront of containing the ravages of this disease, and are experiencing unprecedented challenges. Medical decision making has become all the more complex because of the moral weight of difficult decisions that need to be made. This paper discusses three areas where ethical decision making is extremely important: dealing with those patients with COVID-19 who no longer have access to their doctors; following ethical criteria for assigning risky duties to healthcare professionals; and in making life and death decisions while allocating scarce resources.

The clinical, socioeconomic, and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should not affect the long-term care of people living with HIV, which creates an urgent need to optimize the diagnostic and treatment approach to the first-line or switch regimens. The use of dolutegravir plus a lamivudine two-drug regimen is one of the most promising solutions to ease the management of HIV treatment in this difficult period. In this review, we report the most salient features related to the use of this regimen from real-life cohorts, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials, and studies presented at international conferences up to March 2021. We focused on the diagnostic and clinical-management implications of its use in real life, and how these comply with the contingent historical situation. The issue of the timing and type of diagnostic procedures and the relevance of classical diagnostic tests (such as genotype for resistance detection) is also discussed. According to the currently available results, dolutegravir plus a lamivudine two-drug regimen represents an outstanding tool, whose expected advantages fulfill the current requirements for optimal daily care of our HIV patients.","Cento, V.; Perno, C.

214807,Experience of a novel community testing programme for COVID-19 in London: Lessons learnt,2020,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to review SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe to understand how they may be used to inform ongoing control strategies for COVID-19. DESIGN: Scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and manuscripts on preprint servers from January 2020 to 15 September 2020. PRIMARY MEASURE: Seroprevalence estimate (and lower and upper CIs). For studies conducted across a country or territory, we used the seroprevalence estimate and the upper and lower CIs and compared them to the total number of reported infections to calculate the ratio of reported to expected infections. RESULTS: We identified 23 population-based seroprevalence studies conducted in Europe. Among 12 general population studies, seroprevalence ranged from 0.42% among residual clinical samples in Greece to 13.6% in an area of high transmission in Gangelt, Germany. Of the eight studies in blood donors, seroprevalence ranged from 0.91% in North-Western Germany to 23.3% in a high-transmission area in Lombardy region, Italy. In three studies which recruited individuals through employment, seroprevalence ranged from 0.5% among factory workers in Frankfurt, Germany, to 10.2% among university employees in Milan, Italy. In comparison to nationally reported cases, the extent of infection, as derived from these seroprevalence estimates, is manyfold higher and largely heterogeneous. CONCLUSION: Exposure to the virus in Europe has not reached a level of infection that would prevent further circulation of the virus. Effective vaccine candidates are urgently required to deliver the level of immunity in the population.","Grant, Rebecca; Dub, Timothée; Andrianou, Xanthi; Nohynek, Hanna; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Fontanet, Arnaud",BMJ Open,,176
215008,Collaborative Overview of coronaVIrus impact on ORTHopaedic training in the UK (COVI - ORTH UK),2021,"OBJECTIVE: Obese body habitus is a challenging issue to address in lumbar spine surgery. There is a lack of consensus on the long-term influence of BMI on patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction. This study aimed to examine the differences in patient-reported outcomes over the course of 12 and 24 months among BMI classifications of patients who underwent lumbar surgery. METHODS: A search was performed using the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) Spine Registry from 2012 to 2018 to identify patients who underwent lumbar surgery and had either a 12- or 24-month follow-up. Patients were categorized based on their BMI as normal weight (&#8804; 25 kg/m2), overweight (25-30 kg/m2), obese (30-40 kg/m2), and morbidly obese (> 40 kg/m2). Outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the visual analog scale (VAS) for back pain (BP) and leg pain (LP), and patient satisfaction was measured at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 31,765 patients were included. At both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, those who were obese and morbidly obese had worse ODI, VAS-BP, and VAS-LP scores (all p < 0.01) and more frequently rated their satisfaction as ""I am the same or worse than before treatment"" (all p < 0.01) compared with those who were normal weight. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the BMI cutoffs for predicting worsening disability and surgery dissatisfaction were 30.1 kg/m2 and 29.9 kg/m2 for the 12- and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI was associated with poorer patient-reported outcomes and satisfaction at both the 12- and 24-month follow-ups. BMI of 30 kg/m2 is the cutoff for predicting worse patient outcomes after lumbar surgery.","Park, Christine; Garcia, Alessandra N; Cook, Chad; Shaffrey, Christopher I; Gottfried, Oren N",J Neurosurg Spine,,176

Cefixime (CEF) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is used against bacterial infections. In the present study, Raman spectroscopy has been applied for the identification and quantification of Raman spectral features of cefixime with different concentrations of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) and excipients in solid dosage forms. The changes in Raman spectral features of API and excipients in the solid dosage forms of cefixime were studied and Raman peaks were assigned based on the literature. Multivariate data analysis techniques including the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Regression analysis (PLSR) have been performed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of solid dosage forms of cefixime. PCA was found helpful in differentiating all the Raman spectral data associated with the different solid dosage forms of cefixime. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean relative error (MRE) for the calibration data-set were 0.99, 0.72, and 0.01 respectively and for the validation data-set were 0.99, 3.15, and 0.02 respectively, that shows the performance of the model.

Conversely, dual immunomodulation may weaken anti-viral responses and delay viral clearance, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to expand its population and accrue genetic diversity within individual hosts. Generating a pool of hosts with genetically diverse viral populations while introducing new selective pressures in the form of vaccination-induced immunity, could accelerate the process of antigenic drift in SARS-CoV-2. However, clinical trials to date have largely disregarded viral outcomes, and data on viral kinetics in response to immunomodulation is scarce. Co-administration of antiviral agents with immunomodulation could serve as a potential strategy to aid viral clearance and reduce the risk of genetic diversification.","Koeckerling, David; Barker, Joseph",J. infect. dis,,176

However, the etiology of KD remains unclear. AIM2, an intracellular receptor, plays a vital role during the infection caused by a variety of pathogens. However, its role in KD remains unclear. The principal aim of the present research is to concentrate on the relation between AIM2 and KD. We detected the levels of AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1ß in all subjects by ELISA. The conventional inflammatory indices were detected in all subjects, such as WBC, HB, CRP and so on. The serum concentrations of AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1ß were notably upregulated in the KD group compared to the febrile group and healthy group, respectively. And the three indicators in the KD patients were greatly reduced after interpreted with IVIG. Furthermore, the expressions of IL-18 and IL-1ß were positively correlated with AIM2. Meanwhile, the cutoff value of serum AIM2 level for the diagnosis of KD was 541.90 ng/L with the specificity of 60% and sensitivity of 92.5%, compared to the febrile controls. And the area under curve (AUC) of AIM2 was 0.771. And no difference was observed in patients with CALs when compared with patients without CALs. The serum AIM2, IL-18 and IL-1ß might play a critical role during the progress of KD.

The aim of this study was to identify which blood tests could be used to assist in diagnosing COVID-19. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients referred to hospital with a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 over a period of four weeks. The patient's clinical presentation and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) were recorded. The patients were divided by diagnosis into COVID (COVID-19 infection) or CONTROL (an alternate diagnosis). A retrospective review of consecutive patients over a further two-week period was used for the purposes of validation. RESULTS: Overall, 399 patients (53% COVID, 47% CONTROL) were analysed. White cell count, neutrophils and lymphocytes were significantly lower, while lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin were significantly higher, in the COVID group in comparison to CONTROL. Combining the white cell count, lymphocytes and ferritin results into a COVID Combined Blood Test (CCBT) had an area under the curve of 0.79. Using a threshold CCBT of -0.8 resulted in a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.63. Analysing this against a further retrospective review of 181 suspected COVID-19 patients, using the same CCBT threshold, resulted in a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.75. The sensitivity was comparable to the SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR. DISCUSSION: Mathematically combining the blood tests has the potential to assist clinical acumen allowing for rapid streaming and more accurate patient flow pending definitive diagnosis. This may be of particular use in low-resource settings.","Parsons, I T; Parsons, A T; Balme, E; Hazell, G; Gifford, R; Stacey, M; Woods, D R; Russell-Jones, D",Ann Clin Biochem,,176

A snapshot of the evolving role of a radiology unit facing the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Sociologists have argued that we live nowadays in a World Risk Society, in which we are hyperconnected and exposed to many risks. Although risks involve gradients on a grey scale, individuals often seem to have black-or-white perceptions and responses to the world risk society: either they deny that any risks exist and continue living in their habitual ways, or they feel overwhelmed by the risks, develop panic and engage in obsessive-compulsive self-protection. These black-or-white perceptions and responses may have large consequences for the physical, mental and social well-being of individuals, and for the epidemiological risks and the economy in general. This book discusses the following key players: politicians;science;individuals experiencing stress and mental health problems;media;individuals impacted by existential threats, quarantine, and inequality. It discusses COVID-19 in the context of SARS, MERS, Ebola, Zika, HIV, H1N1, H5N1, and other pandemics. The book is based on systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses. It offers examples of resilience for each of the themes and describes the World Resilience Society. The book exemplifies the themes with citations from interviews with individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the psychology of COVID-19 is to understand how individuals perceive and respond to the uncertainties of the World Risk Society. However, we need to differentiate uncertainties in different life domains, which each have their own key actors. Resilience is the capacity to adjust to challenges flexibly and to recover quickly from difficulties, like a young twig on a tree is resilient as it can withstand storms whereas an old rigid branch may crack. The book offers glimpses of hope for coping in more resilient ways with future pandemics, and these will lay out how we could move from a World Risk Society to a World Resilience Society.

Herein we provide pragmatic advice on the management of commonly encountered calcium metabolic problems and osteoporosis. Non-urgent elective appointments should be postponed, and remote consultations and digital health solutions promoted. Patients should be empowered to self-manage their conditions safely. Patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers should be directed to assured national or international online resources and specific patient groups. For patients in acute hospital settings, existing emergency guidance on the management of hyper- and hypo-calcaemia should be followed. An approach to osteoporosis management is outlined. IV zoledronic acid infusions can be delayed for 6-9 months during the pandemic. Patients established on denosumab, teriparatide and abaloparatide should continue planned therapy. In the event of supply issues with teriparatide or abaloparatide, pausing this treatment in the short term is likely to be relatively harmless, whereas delaying denosumab may cause an immediate increased risk of fracture. The challenge of this pandemic will act as a catalyst to innovate within our management of metabolic bone and mineral disorders to ensure best use of resources and resilience of healthcare systems in its aftermath.","Gittoes, Neil J; Criseno, Sherwin; Appelman-Dijkstra, Natasha M; Bollerslev, Jens; Canalis, Ernesto; Rejnmark, Lars; Hassan-Smith, Zaki",Eur J Endocrinol,,176

As of 14 April 2020, more than 1.9 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 185 countries. Some patients with COVID-19 develop severe clinical manifestations, while others show mild symptoms, suggesting that dysregulation of the host immune response contributes to disease progression and severity. In this review, we have summarized and discussed recent immunological studies focusing on the response of the host immune system and the immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as immunotherapeutic strategies for COVID-19. Immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2, functional exhaustion of lymphocytes, and cytokine storm have been discussed as part of immunopathology mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple, and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies toward the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Herein, we present the design of an mRNA vaccine, based on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)-encapsulated SARS-CoV-2 human Fc-conjugated receptor-binding domain (RBD-hFc). Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase (luc) mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulations have been chosen for the subsequent RBD-hFc mRNA vaccine strategy. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD-hFc mRNA elicited robust humoral response, a high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. The data in the current study demonstrate the potential of these lipids as promising candidates for LNP-based mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular.","Elia, Uri; Ramishetti, Srinivas; Rosenfeld, Ronit; Dammes, Niels; Bar-Haim, Erez; Naidu, Gonna Somu; Makdasi, Efi; Yahalom-Ronen, Yfat; Tamir, Hadas; Paran, Nir; Cohen, Ofer; Peer, Dan",ACS nano,,176

In our study, we report our findings based on molecular docking analysis which could be the new effective way for controlling the SARS-CoV-2 virus and additionally, another manipulative possibilities involving the mimicking of immune system as occurred during the bacterial cell recognition system. For this purpose, we performed molecular docking using computational biology techniques on several SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are responsible for its pathogenicity against N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. A similar molecular dynamics analysis has been carried out on both SARS-CoV-2 and anti-Staphylococcus aureus neutralizing antibodies to establish the potential of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine which likely induces the immune response against the virus. The results of molecular dynamic analysis have confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (PDB: 6M0J), RNA-binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (PDB: 6WKP), refusion SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer (PDB: 6X79), and main protease 3clpro at room temperature (PDB: 7JVZ) could bind with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine that these proteins play an important role in SARS-CoV-2's infection and evade the immune system. Moreover, our molecular docking analysis has supported a strong protein-ligand interaction of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with these selected proteins. Furthermore, computational analysis against the D614G mutant of the virus has shown that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine affinity and its binding potential were not affected by the mutations occurring in the virus' receptor binding domain. The analysis on the affinity of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine towards human antibodies has shown that it could potentially bind to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins and antibodies based on our predictive modelling work. Our results confirmed that N-acetyl-D-glucosamine holds the potential to inhibit several SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as induce an immune response against the virus in the host.","Baysal, Ömür; Abdul Ghafoor, Naeem; Silme, Ragip Soner; Ignatov, Alexander N; Kniazeva, Volha",PLoS One,,176

219575,The rise and fall in therapeutic candidates for COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has made unprecedented impact on the psychological health of university students, a population vulnerable to distress and mental health disorders. This study investigated psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress) during state-enforced quarantine among university students in China (N = 1912) through a cross-sectional survey during March and April 2020. RESULTS: Psychiatric symptoms were alarmingly prevalent: 67.05% reported traumatic stress, 46.55% had depressive symptoms, and 34.73% reported anxiety symptoms. Further, 19.56% endorsed suicidal ideation. We explored risk and protective factors of psychological health, including demographic variables, two known protective factors for mental health (mindfulness, perceived social support), four COVID-specific factors (COVID-19 related efficacy, perceived COVID-19 threat, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, COVID-19 prosocial behavior) and screen media usage. Across symptom domains, mindfulness was associated with lower symptom severity, while COVID-19 related financial stress, perceived COVID-19 societal stigma, and perceived COVID-19 threat were associated with higher symptom severity. COVID-19 threat and COVID-19 stigma showed main and interactive effects in predicting all mental health outcomes, with their combination associated with highest symptom severity. Screen media device usage was positively associated with depression. Female gender and COVID-19 prosocial behavior were associated with higher anxiety, while COVID-19 self-efficacy associated with lower anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest high need for psychological health promotion among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic and inform an ecological perspective on the detrimental role of stigma during an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Interventions targeting multi-level factors, such as promoting mindfulness and social support at individual and interpersonal levels while reducing public stigma about COVID-19, may be particularly promising. Attending to the needs of disadvantaged groups including those financially impacted by COVID-19 is needed.","Sun, Shufang; Goldberg, Simon B; Lin, Danhua; Qiao, Shan; Operario, Don",Global Health,,176
219668,"Histopathological basis of COVID-19: a short review. (Special Issue: COVID-19: disease progression, impact & comorbidity.)",2020,"OBJECTIVE: There are both opportunities and challenges with the implementation of oral health value-based care (OHVBC). To tackle concerns and advance conversation, a symposium was convened with subject matter experts to develop a gap analysis and capture insights into professional readiness for value-based care design. METHODS: The symposium was convened as a private event for 46 participants over the course of one and a half days in December 2019. Thematic analyses utilized the OHVBC Readiness Framework (DentaQuest Partnership, 2019) to further codify conversations as part of the gap-analysis process. Poll Everywhere, a text messaging application that allows participants to answer questions in real time, was also employed to solicit responses. RESULTS: Attendees of the symposium felt that OHVBC would have a large portion of market share within the next 10 years. A qualitative assessment of multiple table discussions determined that the participants developed more consensus around themes for the current state and the future-desired state than the action-planning needed to close the gap between the two. This may relate to individual ideology, and the siloed environment is still prevalent in the oral health realm. In a postsymposium survey, respondent attendees did not perceive that COVID-19 would delay or negatively impact the adoption of OHVBC and may result in accelerating its utilization. CONCLUSION: The oral health community is experiencing multiple drivers to adopt more OHVBC within business and care models. However, there is still a lack of uniformity on how to execute this delivery model.","Boynes, Sean; Nelson, Joni; Diep, Vuong; Kanan, Christine; Pedersen, Da-Nell; Brown, Carolyn; Mathews, Rebekah; Tranby, Eric; Apostolon, Danielle; Bayham, Mary; Minter-Jordan, Myechia",J Public Health Dent,,176
220425,Globalization and Infectious Diseases: Evidence on the Reproduction Rate of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Rural communities with predominantly older adult populations could be especially vulnerable to poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to lacking intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Our objective is to describe the scope of the problem by summarizing population totals of older adults in rural America and their community’s ICU bed availability. We performed a review of peer-reviewed literature, in addition to hand searching non–peer-reviewed and governmental/non-governmental agency reports, using the Kaiser Health News data report to assess the number of ICU beds in 10 predominantly rural states with the highest older adult populations. We found that while 19% of the U.S. population lives in rural counties, these counties contain only 1% of the ICU beds in the United States. Counties particularly at risk for inadequate ICU capacity include Crittenden, Arkansas; Cass, Minnesota; and Sagadahoc, Maine. Solutions include building new delivery systems, reopening previously closed rural hospitals, and calling on local businesses to create medical supplies. In summary, the 10 million older adults in rural communities in the United States may face challenges with obtaining critical care treatment due to the increased need of ICU beds during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Davoodi, Natalie M.; Healy, Margaret; Goldberg, Elizabeth M.",Gerontol.

A matrix of researcher and activist challenges and opportunities has been co-created with young environmental activists using an emergent research design, incorporating a phased and intensive iterative process using online ethnography and online qualitative interviews. The article focuses on reflections emerging from the process of co-designing and then use of this matrix in practice. It offers an evidence base which others researching hard-to-reach youth populations may themselves deploy when negotiating face-to-face fieldwork approval at their own academic institutions. The pandemic and its associated control regimes, such as lockdown and social distancing measures, will have lasting effects for both activism and researchers.

221570,COVID-19 Pandemic: A Wake-Up Call for Indian Medical Research,2021,"COVID-19 vaccines were approved in late 2020 and early 2021 for public use in countries across the world. Several studies have now highlighted COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in the general public. However, little is known about the nature and extent of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in healthcare workers worldwide. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive worldwide assessment of published evidence on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers. A scoping review method was adopted to include a final pool of 35 studies in this review with study sample size ranges from n = 123 to 16,158 (average = 2185 participants per study). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy worldwide in healthcare workers ranged from 4.3 to 72% (average = 22.51% across all studies with 76,471 participants). The majority of the studies found concerns about vaccine safety, efficacy, and potential side effects as top reasons for COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy in healthcare workers. The majority of the studies also found that individuals who were males, of older age, and doctoral degree holders (i.e., physicians) were more likely to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Factors such as the higher perceived risk of getting infected with COVID-19, direct care for patients, and history of influenza vaccination were also found to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake probability. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in healthcare workers, communication and education strategies along with mandates for clinical workers should be considered to increase COVID-19 vaccination uptake in these individuals. Healthcare workers have a key role in reducing the burden of the pandemic, role modeling for preventive behaviors, and also, helping vaccinate others.","Biswas, Nirbachita; Mustapha, Toheeb; Khubchandani, Jagdish; Price, James H",J. community health,,176

We found that there were statistically significant treatment effects of those stringent interventions which reduced the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19. Those reduction effects would increase over time. Also, if the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of COVID-19. The slower the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic would have been, and the stronger the interventions would have been required.","Tian, Ting; Luo, Wenxiang; Jiang, Yukang; Chen, Minqiong; Wen, Canhong; Pan, Wenliang; Mathematics, Xueqin Wang School of; University, Sun Yat-sen; Management, School of; Science, University of; China, Technology of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00523v1.pdf,176

(Special Issue: The histopathology of COVID-19.),2020,"Background: The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family that has caused a global public health emergency. Currently, there is no approved treatment or vaccine available against it. The current study aimed to cover the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 strains reported from all over the world and to design a broad-spectrum multi-epitope vaccine using an immunoinformatics approach. Methods: For this purpose, all available complete genomes were retrieved from GISAID and NGDC followed by genome multiple alignments to develop a global consensus sequence to compare with the reference genome. Fortunately, comparative genomics and phylogeny revealed a significantly high level of conservation between the viral strains. All the Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of the reference sequence NC_045512.2 were subjected to epitope mapping using CTLpred and HLApred, respectively. The predicted CTL epitopes were then screened for antigenicity, immunogenicity and strong binding affinity with HLA superfamily alleles. HTL predicted epitopes were screened for antigenicity, interferon induction potential, overlapping B cell epitopes and strong HLA DR binding potential. The shortlisted epitopes were arranged into two multi-epitope sequences, Cov-I-Vac and Cov-II-Vac, and molecular docking was performed with Toll-Like Receptor 8 (TLR8). Results: The designed multi-epitopes were found to be antigenic and non-allergenic. Both multi-epitopes were stable and predicted to be soluble in an Escherichia coli expression system.

225312,Challenges of oral medicine specialists at the time of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In early 2020, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic swept the world. In China, COVID-19 has caused severe consequences. Moreover, online rumors during COVID-19 epidemic increased people's panic about public health and social stability. Understanding and curbing the spread of online rumor is an urgent task at present. Therefore, we analyzed the rumor spread mechanism and proposed a method to quantify the rumor influence by the speed of new insiders. We use the search frequency of rumor as an observation variable of new insiders. We calculated the peak coefficient and attenuation coefficient for the search frequency, which conform to the exponential distribution. Then we designed several rumor features and used the above two coefficients as predictable labels. The 5-fold cross-validation experiment using MSE as the loss function shows that the decision tree is suitable for predicting the peak coefficient, and the linear regression model is ideal for predicting the attenuation coefficient. Our feature analysis shows that precursor features are the most important for the outbreak coefficient, while location information and rumor entity information are the most important for the attenuation coefficient. Meanwhile, features which are conducive to the outbreak are usually harmful to the continued spread of rumors. At the same time, anxiety is a crucial rumor-causing factor. Finally, we discussed how to use deep learning technology to reduce forecast loss by use BERT model.","Lin, Yiou; Lei, Hang; Deng, Yu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02446v1.pdf,176

Clinical manifestations vary widely among patients with MIS-C, and the aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with severe outcomes. METHODS: In this retrospective surveillance study, patients who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for MIS-C (younger than 21 years, fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, admitted to hospital, multisystem [&#8805;2] organ involvement [cardiac, renal, respiratory, haematological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, or neurological], no alternative plausible diagnosis, and either laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test, or known COVID-19 exposure within 4 weeks before symptom onset) were reported from state and local health departments to the CDC using standard case-report forms. Factors assessed for potential links to severe outcomes included pre-existing patient factors (sex, age, race or ethnicity, obesity, and MIS-C symptom onset date before June 1, 2020) and clinical findings (signs or symptoms and laboratory markers). Logistic regression models, adjusted for all pre-existing factors, were used to estimate odds ratios between potential explanatory factors and the following outcomes: intensive care unit (ICU) admission, shock, decreased cardiac function, myocarditis, and coronary artery abnormalities. FINDINGS: 1080 patients met the CDC case definition for MIS-C and had symptom onset between March 11 and Oct 10, 2020. ICU admission was more likely in patients aged 6-12 years (adjusted odds ratio 1·9 [95% CI 1·4-2·6) and patients aged 13-20 years (2·6 [1·8-3·8]), compared with patients aged 0-5 years, and more likely in non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with non-Hispanic White patients (1·6 [1·0-2·4]). ICU admission was more likely for patients with shortness of breath (1·9 [1·2-2·9]), abdominal pain (1·7 [1·2-2·7]), and patients with increased concentrations of C-reactive protein, troponin, ferritin, D-dimer, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type BNP, or interleukin-6, or reduced platelet or lymphocyte counts. We found similar associations for decreased cardiac function, shock, and myocarditis. Coronary artery abnormalities were more common in male patients (1·5 [1·1-2·1]) than in female patients and patients with mucocutaneous lesions (2·2 [1·3-3·5]) or conjunctival injection (2·3 [1·4-3·7]).

A look-back to ""Transfusion clinique et biologique""",2021,"Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is an emerging RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family that was recently discovered in domestic cats (Felis catus). To date, 2 genotypes (FeMV-1 and FeMV-2) have been detected in cats from various countries, and FeMV-1 is recognized as a pathogen associated with nephritis. However, information regarding the pathological roles and potential transmission to other felids is limited. In this article, we describe the identification of FeMV in 2 black leopards (Panthera pardus) in Thailand that showed severe azotemia and tubulointerstitial nephritis. Molecular analysis of the partial coding sequence of the L gene revealed that these leopard FeMV strains were genetically close to the FeMV-1 isolate from domestic Thai cats. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses using polyclonal IgG antibodies against the FeMV matrix (M) protein showed FeMV-M antigen in renal tubular epithelial cells. These analyses also showed infiltrating lymphocytes in the renal parenchymal lesions and in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells residing in the spleen, suggesting viral tropism and a possible pathological role. These findings are the first evidence that indicates that the black leopard could be a possible host for FeMV infection. As for other cats, the role of FeMV as a potential cause of renal disease remains to be established. The pathogenesis of FeMV infection in black leopards, or in other wild felids, through a viral transmission mechanism warrants further investigation.","Piewbang, Chutchai; Chaiyasak, Surangkanang; Kongmakee, Piyaporn; Sanannu, Saowaphang; Khotapat, Pornsuda; Ratthanophart, Jadsada; Banlunara, Wijit; Techangamsuwan, Somporn",Vet Pathol,,176

226716,To trace or not to trace: Saving lives from COVID-19 at the cost of privacy breach in Bangladesh,2020,"Pedicle screw instrumentation is performed in the surgical treatment of a wide variety of spinal pathologies. A common postoperative complication associated with this procedure is screw loosening. It has been shown that patient-specific screw fixation can be automated to match standard clinical practice and that failure can be estimated preoperatively using computed tomography images. Hence, we set out to optimize three-dimensional preoperative planning to achieve more mechanically robust screw purchase allowing deviation from intuitive, standard screw parameters. Toward this purpose, we employed a genetic algorithm optimization to find optimal screw sizes and trajectories by maximizing the CT derived bone mechanical properties. The method was tested on cadaveric lumbar vertebrae (L1 to L5) of four human spines (2 female/2 male; age range 60-78 years). The main boundary conditions were the predefined, level-dependent areas of possible screw entry points, as well as the automatically located pedicle structures. Finite element analysis was used to compare the genetic algorithm output to standard clinical planning of screw positioning in terms of the simulated pull-out strength. The genetic algorithm optimization successfully found screw sizes and trajectories that maximize the sum of the Young's modulus within the screw's volume for all 40 pedicle screws included in this study. Overall, there was a 26% increase in simulated pull-out strength for optimized compared to traditional screw trajectories and sizes. Our results indicate that optimizing pedicle screw instrumentation in lumbar vertebrae based on bone quality measures improves screw purchase as compared to traditional instrumentation.","Caprara, Sebastiano; Fasser, Marie-Rosa; Spirig, José Miguel; Widmer, Jonas; Snedeker, Jess G; Farshad, Mazda; Senteler, Marco",Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Engin,,176

The aims of this study were to assess (1) provider-reported use of medications and their perceived effectiveness and (2) degree of difficulty managing specific symptoms at episodic COVID-19 care sites and in a longitudinal monitoring program. METHODS: We sent an online survey to physicians, advanced practice providers, and registered nurses redeployed to COVID-19 care sites at an academic medical center from March to May 2020. We asked about the use of medications and perceived effectiveness of medications to treat symptoms of COVID-19 and the perceived challenge of symptom management. Comparison was made by provider type (episodic or longitudinal site of care). RESULTS: Responses from 64 providers were included. The most frequently used medications were acetaminophen (87.1% of respondents), benzonatate (83.9%), and albuterol metered dose inhalers (MDI) (80.6%). Therapies for lower respiratory tract symptoms were reported as more commonly used by longitudinal follow-up providers compared to episodic providers including guaifenesin (90.6% vs 60.0%, p = 0.007), benzonatate (93.8% vs 73.3%, p = 0.04), nebulized albuterol for patients with asthma (75.0% vs 43.3%, p = 0.019), and albuterol MDIs for patients without asthma (90.6% vs 66.7%, p = 0.029). Medications found to have the highest perceived efficacy by respondents using the therapy (> 80% reporting ""very efficacious"") included albuterol, acetaminophen for fever, non-sedating antihistamines, nasal steroid spray, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for myalgia, arthralgia, or headache. Lower respiratory symptoms and anxiety were rated as the most challenging symptoms to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Providers reported that clinical care of mild COVID-19 with medications in common use for other respiratory infections is effective, both at episodic care and longitudinal sites of care, but that specific symptoms are still challenging to manage.","O039,; Keefe, James B; Newsom, Lydia C; Taylor, Thomas H",,,176

Here, we demonstrated that load initiation time, magnitude, and mode all regulate microvascular growth, as well as upstream angiogenic and mechanotransduction signaling pathways. Immediate load initiation inhibited angiogenesis and expression of early sprout tip cell selection genes, while delayed loading enhanced microvascular network formation and upstream signaling pathways. This research provides foundational understanding of how extracellular matrix mechanics regulate angiogenesis and has critical implications for clinical translation of new regenerative medicine therapies and physical rehabilitation strategies designed to enhance revascularization during tissue regeneration.","Ruehle, M A; Eastburn, E A; LaBelle, S A; Krishnan, L; Weiss, J A; Boerckel, J D; Wood, L B; Guldberg, R E; Willett, N J",Sci.

OBJECTIVE: The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. METHODS: Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16â¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32â¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Jing; Fu, Mingqi; Liu, Danxia; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Xiaohua; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H",Child Abuse Negl,,176

If this reaction time is speedy, then such risk is undesirable because prevalence is initially convex in time. In this case, frequent rotation acts as insurance against exposure-time risk and is optimal. Infrequent rotation becomes optimal if the organization reacts slowly. Cross-mixing of the rotating subpopulations is detrimental because it increases contacts between sick and healthy individuals.

230204,"Retour des peurs ancestrales avec le coronavirus, Covid-19./ [Return of ancestral fears with coronavirus, Covid-19]",2020,"The correct identification of change-points during ongoing outbreak investigations of infectious diseases is a matter of paramount importance in epidemiology, with major implications for the management of health care resources, public health and, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, social live. Onsets, peaks, and inflexion points are some of them. An onset is the moment when the epidemic starts. A ""peak"" indicates a moment at which the incorporated values, both before and after, are lower: a maximum. The inflexion points identify moments in which the rate of growth of the incorporation of new cases changes intensity. In this study, after interpreting the concept of elasticity of a random variable in an innovative way, we propose using it as a new simpler tool for anticipating epidemic remission change-points. In particular, we propose that the ""remission point of change"" will occur just at the instant when the speed in the accumulation of new cases is lower than the average speed of accumulation of cases up to that moment. This gives stability and robustness to the estimation in the event of possible remission variations. This descriptive measure, which is very easy to calculate and interpret, is revealed as informative and adequate, has the advantage of being distribution-free and can be estimated in real time, while the data is being collected. We use the 2014-2016 Western Africa Ebola virus epidemic to demonstrate this new approach.

231503,"Dietary supplements, vitamins and minerals as potential interventions against viruses: Perspectives for COVID-19",2021,"OBJECTIVE: In view of the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the increasing global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is likely that many patients with OSA get exposed to this virus. Besides theoretical assumptions, there is no evidence that OSA may favor SARS-CoV-2 acquisition or may lead to a more severe disease. Taking the opportunity of the Atahualpa Project cohort, we aimed to assess the relationship between previously diagnosed OSA and SARS-CoV-2 infection in older adults living in rural Ecuador. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were determined in 180 individuals aged > 60 years that underwent polysomnography previously to this novel pandemic. Those with OSA remained untreated due to income limitations. Exposure-effect models were fitted with OSA as the exposure, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology as the outcomes, and confounders - age, gender, obesity, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, individuals per house, home confinement - as independent variables. RESULTS: A total of 87 (48%) individuals were seropositive to SARS-CoV-2, 77% of whom were symptomatic. The mean apnea/hypopnea index was 11.1 ± 11.7 episodes per hour, with 83 (46%) individuals having mild, and 38 (21%) moderate-to-severe OSA. Exposure-effect models demonstrated lack of relationship between OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows no relationship between history of OSA and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or symptomatology, opposing previous suggestions that persons with OSA are more prone to acquire the infection and have a more severe disease.","Del Brutto, Oscar H; Mera, Robertino M; Castillo, Pablo R; Recalde, Bettsy Y; Costa, Aldo F",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,,176
231792,Telehealth in Oncology During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Bringing the House Call Back Virtually,2020,"Background: Although hyperuricemia frequently associates with respiratory diseases, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) can show marked hypouricemia. Previous studies on the association of serum uric acid with risk of adverse outcomes related to COVID-19 have produced contradictory results. The precise relationship between admission serum uric acid and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients is unknown. Methods: Data of patients affected by laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and admitted to Leishenshan Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was composite and comprised events, such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the association between serum concentrations of uric acid and the composite outcome, as well as each of its components. To determine the association between serum uric acid and in-hospital adverse outcomes, serum uric acid was also categorized by restricted cubic spline, and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to estimate odds ratios (OR). Results: The study cohort included 1854 patients (mean age, 58 years; 52% women). The overall mean ± SD of serum levels of uric acid was 308 ± 96 µmol/L. Among them, 95 patients were admitted to ICU, 75 patients received mechanical ventilation, and 38 died. In total, 114 patients reached composite end-points (have either ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death) during hospitalization. Compared with a reference group with estimated baseline serum uric acid of 279-422 µmol/L, serum uric acid values &#8805; 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.07- 6.29) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.06- 8.51). Serum uric acid &#8804; 278 µmol/L was associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.18- 3.65), ICU admission (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.17- 4.05]), and mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.06- 4.28), as assessed by multivariate analysis. Conclusions: This study shows that the association between admission serum uric acid and composite outcome of COVID-19 patients was U-shaped. In particular, we found that compared with baseline serum uric acid levels of 279-422 µmol/L, values &#8805; 423 µmol/L were associated with an increased risk of composite outcome and mechanical ventilation, whereas levels &#8804; 278 µmol/L associated with increased risk of composite outcome, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation.","Chen, Bo; Lu, Chenyang; Gu, Hong-Qiu; Li, Yang; Zhang, Guqin; Lio, Jonathan; Luo, Xiongyan; Zhang, Lingshu; Hu, Yidan; Lan, Xiaomeng; Chen, Zerong; Xie, Qibing; Pan, Huaqin",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,176

232382,A Review of Canadian Cancer-Related Clinical Practice Guidelines and Resources during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of negative health related consequences, including impacts on mental health. More than 22% of Canadians reported that they had felt depressed in the last week, in response to a December 2020 national survey. Given the need to physically distance during the pandemic, and the increase in demand for mental health services, digital interventions that support mental health and wellness may be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research was to identify digital interventions that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives were to identify (1) the populations these interventions were developed for, inclusive of exploring areas of equity such as socioeconomic status, sex/gender, race/ethnicity and culture, and relevance to Indigenous peoples and communities; (2) the effect of the interventions; and (3) any barriers or facilitators to the use of the intervention. METHODS: This study was completed using a Cochrane Rapid Review methodology. A search of Embase, PsycInfo, Medline, and Web of Science, along with Google, Million Short, and popular mobile app libraries, was conducted. Two screeners were involved in applying inclusion criteria using Covidence software. Academic articles and mobile apps identified were screened using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields resource, the American Psychiatric Association App Evaluation Framework, and the Mental Health Commission of Canada's guidance on app assessment and selection. RESULTS: A total of 31 mobile apps and 114 web-based resources (eg, telemedicine, virtual peer support groups, discussion forums, etc) that could be used to support the mental health of the Canadian population during the pandemic were identified. These resources have been listed on a publicly available website along with search tags that may help an individual make a suitable selection. Variability exists in the populations that the interventions were developed for, and little assessment has been done with regard to areas of equity. The effect of the interventions was not reported for all those identified in this synthesis; however, for those that did report the effect, it was shown that they were effective in the context that they were used. A number of barriers and facilitators to using these interventions were identified, such as access, cost, and connectivity. CONCLUSIONS: A number of digital interventions that could support population mental health in Canada during the global COVID-19 pandemic were identified, indicating that individuals have several options to choose from. These interventions vary in their purpose, approach, design, cost, and targeted user group. While some research and digital interventions addressed equity-related considerations, more research and focused attention should be given to this area.","Strudwick, Gillian; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Kassam, Iman; Sequeira, Lydia; Bonato, Sarah; Youssef, Alaa; Mehta, Rohan; Green, Nadia; Agic, Branka; Soklaridis, Sophie; Impey, Danielle; Wiljer, David; Crawford, Allison",JMIR Ment Health,,176

We present an initial evaluation of self-reported pediatric surgical policy changes from hospitals across North America. METHODS: On March 30, 2020, an online open access, data gathering spreadsheet was made available to pediatric surgeons through the American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) website, which captured information surrounding COVID-19 related policy changes. Responses from the first month of the pandemic were collected. Open-ended responses were evaluated and categorized into themes and descriptive statistics were performed to identify areas of consensus. RESULTS: Responses from 38 hospitals were evaluated. Policy changes relating to three domains of program structure and care processes were identified: internal structure, clinical workflow, and COVID-19 safety/prevention. Interhospital consensus was high for reducing in-hospital staffing, limiting clinical fellow exposure, implementing telehealth for conducting outpatient clinical visits, and using universal precautions for trauma. Heterogeneity in practices existed for scheduling procedures, implementing testing protocols, and regulating use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has induced significant upheaval in the usual processes of pediatric surgical care. While policies evolve, additional research is needed to determine the effect of these changes on patient and healthcare delivery outcomes.

233185,The effect of COVID-19 on trainee operative experience at a multihospital academic neurosurgical practice: A first look at case numbers,2021,"BACKGROUND: Predicting successful liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) in critically ill patients is challenging. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been proposed to help guide decision-making for readiness to liberate from MV following a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and prospective observational studies that measured BNP levels at the time of SBT in patients receiving MV. The primary endpoint was successful liberation from MV (absence of reintubation or non-invasive ventilation at 48 h). Statistical analyses included bi-variate and Moses-Littenberg models and DerSimonian-Laird pooling of areas under ROC curve (AUROC). RESULTS: A total of 731 articles were screened. Eighteen adult and 2 pediatric studies were fulfilled pre-specified eligibility. The measure of the relative variation of BNP during SBT (&#916;BNP%) after exclusion of SBT failure by clinical criteria in adults yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 0.889 [0.831-0.929] and 0.828 [0.730-0.896] for successful liberation from MV, respectively, with a pooled AUROC of 0.92 [0.88-0.97]. The pooled AUROC for any method of analysis for absolute variation of BNP (&#916;BNP), pre-SBT BNP, and post-SBT BNP were 0.89 [0.83-0.95], 0.77 [0.63-0.91], and 0.85 [0.80-0.90], respectively. CONCLUSION: The relative change in BNP during a SBT has potential value as an incremental tool after successful SBT to predict successful liberation from MV in adults. There is insufficient data to support the use of BNP in children or as an alternate test to clinical indices of SBT, or the use of &#916;BNP, BNP-pre, and BNP-post as an alternate or incremental test.

Individuals in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) are uniquely challenged because of disruption to treatment, medication diversion, and isolation during the pandemic. METHODS: Between January and September 2020, we utilized the electronic medical record from a chain of 67 opioid agonist treatment clinics in Ontario, Canada, to examine routinely collected urine drug screen results of patients in opioid agonist treatment by Public Health Units. RESULTS: We present evidence of a 108% increase in the percentage of fentanyl positive urine drug screens from April to September (p< 0.001). During the same period, health regions in northern and southwestern Ontario, areas with a high concentration of rural communities, have seen the most notable increase in the percent of fentanyl positive urine drug screen results. CONCLUSION: The use of fentanyl increased by 108% among OAT patients in Ontario during the COVID 19 pandemic. We argue that the persistent increase of fentanyl exposure over time, specifically in the OAT population, suggests that reduced monitoring may decrease OAT's effectiveness and negatively impact patient outcomes.","Morin, Kristen A; Acharya, Shreedhar; Eibl, Joseph K; Marsh, David C",Int J Drug Policy,,176

Later, those cases were attributed to a novel respiratory virus currently known as COVID-19. The infection is affecting every continent. It was characterized by WHO as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. Countries worldwide are implementing various preventive measures to contain the spread of the infection such as travel and trade restrictions, closure of educational institutions and shops, and some took more strict measures such as imposing curfew. WHO is emphasizing the importance of early detection of cases, contact tracing, risk communications, implementing multisectoral approach in order to combat COVID-19 infection. Countries should provide the public with accurate, transparent information about the local and global situation of this escalating infection. Much uncertainty still surrounds this viral infection, its modes of transmission and dynamics. Epidemiological investigations particularly for the first few cases of COVID-19 infection are critical to expand our knowledge about this evolving pandemic. In this review we summarized the data available about the first few cases and fatalities of COVID-19 infection up to 18 March 2020 across Eastern Mediterranean Region of the World Health Organization. such data were only available in websites of ministries of health of the targeted countries, WHO situational reports, online newspapers, and other media channels and this gave us an idea about the amount and type of data available for the public regarding this evolving infection.","Abed Alah, Muna; Abdeen, Sami; Kehyayan, Vahe",J Infect Public Health,,176

Here, we describe a method to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and machine learning analysis. This approach uses equipment and expertise commonly found in clinical laboratories in developing countries. We obtained mass spectra from a total of 362 samples (211 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 151 negative by RT-PCR) without prior sample preparation from three different laboratories. We tested two feature selection methods and six machine learning approaches to identify the top performing analysis approaches and determine the accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 detection. The support vector machine model provided the highest accuracy (93.9%), with 7% false positives and 5% false negatives. Our results suggest that MALDI-MS and machine learning analysis can be used to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swab samples.","Nachtigall, Fabiane M; Pereira, Alfredo; Trofymchuk, Oleksandra S; Santos, Leonardo S",Nat Biotechnol,,176
235642,Pediatric Surgery in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Rapid testing is paramount during a pandemic to prevent continued viral spread and excess morbidity and mortality. This study investigates whether testing strategies based on sample pooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2, especially in resource-limited settings. METHODS: In a mathematical modelling approach conducted in May 2020, six different testing strategies were simulated based on key input parameters such as infection rate, test characteristics, population size, and testing capacity. The situations in five countries were simulated, reflecting a broad variety of population sizes and testing capacities. The primary study outcome measurements were time and number of tests required, number of cases identified, and number of false positives. FINDINGS: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input parameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen one tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1%, realistic optimised testing strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the US, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy, and 10 in Germany. This is ca. eight times faster compared to individual testing. When infection rates are lower, or when employing an optimal, yet more complex pooling method, the gains are more pronounced. Pool-based approaches also reduce the number of false positive diagnoses by a factor of up to 100. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide a rationale for adoption of pool-based testing strategies to increase speed and throughput of testing for SARS-CoV-2, hence saving time and resources compared with individual testing.","de Wolff, Timo; Pflüger, Dirk; Rehme, Michael; Heuer, Janin; Bittner, Martin-Immanuel",PLoS One,,176

Such unprecedented extent of mobility restriction to curb the COVID-19 pandemic may have profound impacts on how individuals live, travel and retain well-being. This systematic review aims to identify (i) the social consequences of mass quarantine-community-wide movement restrictions-during previous and current infectious disease outbreaks and (ii) recommended strategies to mitigate the negative social implications of COVID-19 lockdowns. Considering social determinants of health, we conducted a systematic review by searching five databases (Ovid-MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database) for publications from inception to 9 April 2020. No limitation was set on language, location or study type. Studies that (i) contained peer-reviewed original empirical evidence and (ii) focussed on non-epidemiological implications of mass quarantine were included. We thematically synthesized and reported data due to heterogeneous disease and country context. Of 3067 publications found, 15 original peer-reviewed articles were selected for full-text extraction. Psychological distress, heightened communication inequalities, food insecurity, economic challenges, diminished access to health care, alternative delivery of education and gender-based violence were identified as negative social consequences of community-based quarantine in six infectious disease epidemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. In contrast, altruistic attitudes were identified as a positive consequence during previous quarantines. Diverse psychological and social consequences of mass quarantine in previous and current epidemics were evident, but individual country policies had been highly varied in how well they addressed the needs of affected individuals, especially those who are socially marginalized. Policymakers should balance the pros and cons of movement restrictions, facilitate multisectoral action to tackle social inequalities, provide clear and coherent guidance to the public and undertake time-bound policy evaluations to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdowns and to establish preparedness strategies for future epidemics.","Chu, Isaac Yen-Hao; Alam, Prima; Larson, Heidi J; Lin, Leesa",J. travel med,,176

Developments in the propagation of laser power calibration via transfer standards to on-line power sensors monitoring the modulated laser power have enabled generation of length fiducials with improved accuracy. Estimated uncertainties are almost a factor of two smaller than the lowest values previously reported. This is partly due to improvements in methodology that have increased confidence in the results reported. Referencing the laser power calibration standards for each observatory to a single transfer standard enables reducing relative calibration errors between elements of the detector network. Efforts within the national metrology institute community to realize improved laser power sensor calibration accuracy are ongoing.","Bhattacharjee, D; Lecoeuche, Y; Karki, S; Betzwieser, J; Bossilkov, V; Kandhasamy, S; Payne, E; Savage, R L",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00130v1.pdf,176

238755,"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Pulmonary and Nutritional Status in Children and Young Adults With Cystic Fibrosis, in Greece",2021,"Purpose: COVID-19 profoundly affected the United States, with New York City rapidly becoming the epicenter of the disease. Patients with cancer represent a vulnerable population in this pandemic, with data suggesting a higher risk for severe events and unfavorable outcomes. Timely identification of COVID-19 in patients with cancer has been thwarted by the limited availability of outpatient testing for SARS-CoV-2. Chest computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in the identification of COVID-19 pneumonia, with radiologic hallmarks including bilateral, peripheral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation. Patients with cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) commonly have daily cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) obtained for image-guided RT, and such imaging frequently includes the chest. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the CBCT scans of an initially asymptomatic patient undergoing image-guided RT for breast cancer who developed COVID-19 symptoms during the second week of RT. Lung windows of daily CBCT scans were reviewed with diagnostic radiology to survey for changes consistent with COVID-19. Diagnostic CT scans at the time of recovery were obtained and compared with the CBCTs. Results: Five consecutive CBCT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Bilateral, peripheral GGOs were noted on the fourth and fifth CBCT scans in the 2 days before symptom onset. CBCT on the day of RT resumption demonstrated substantial worsening of the GGO compared with scans obtained during the asymptomatic phase. Diagnostic CTs demonstrated bilateral, peripheral GGOs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, findings suggesting COVID-19 pneumonitis. Repeat diagnostic CT 3 days later showed improved pulmonary findings, and the patient resumed RT without incident. Conclusions: Familiarity with typical CT changes of COVID-19 pneumonitis may allow for early detection in cancer patients undergoing CBCT for RT treatment. Prompt review of the lung windows is recommended to identify such changes, with the hope that presymptomatic diagnosis leads to expedited patient management, improved outcomes, and a reduction of inadvertent COVID-19 dissemination.","Youssef, Irini; Donahue, Bernadine; Flyer, Mark; Thompson, Sharon; Huang, Alice; Gallant, Fleure",Adv.

238756,"Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Pulmonary and Nutritional Status in Children and Young Adults With Cystic Fibrosis, in Greece",2021,"The early months of 2020 witnessed a spike in anti-Asian violence in the United States, which many commentators attributed to President Donald Trump’s racist remarks calling the coronavirus the ‘Chinese virus’. This essay offers a historical lens through which to understand anti-Asian racism within the current conjuncture of the COVID-19 pandemic and US racist state violence. It argues that anti-Asian violence should be seen not merely as episodic or as individual acts of violence targeting Asian peoples but as a structure of US settler colonialism and racial capitalism. The first half of the essay examines this history; the second half focuses on Asian American activist organisations that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Coalition Against Anti-Asian Violence_ Organizing Asian Communities and Nodutdol, to illustrate their abolitionist visions of justice and how they are finding space to enact these visions in the current moment. The essay ultimately argues for the need to approach the struggle against anti-Asian racism expansively so as to encompass the struggle for decolonisation and Black liberation.","Man, Simeon",Race Cl.,,176

241473,A Quantitative Framework for Establishing Low-risk Interdistrict Travel Corridors during COVID-19,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation demands a lot from citizens, health care providers, and governmental institutions. Citizens need to cope with guidelines on social interaction, work, home isolation, and symptom recognition. Additionally, health care providers and policy makers have to cope with unprecedented and unpredictable pressure on the health care system they need to manage. By providing citizens with an app, they always have access to the latest information and can assess their own health. This data could be used to support policy makers and health care providers to get valuable insights in the regional distribution of infection load and health care consumption. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this observational study is to assess people's use of an app to support them with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and monitoring of their own health for a 7-day period. In addition, we aim to assess the usability of this data for health care providers and policy makers by applying it to an interactive map and combining it with hospital data. The secondary outcomes of the study were user's satisfaction with the information provided in the app, perceived usefulness of the app, health care providers they contacted, and the follow-up actions from this contact. METHODS: This observational cohort study was carried out at the nonacademic teaching hospital ""Elisabeth Twee Steden"" (ETZ) in Tilburg, Netherlands. From April 1, 2020, onwards ETZ offered the COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and symptom tracking diary to their already existing app for patient education and monitoring. RESULTS: Between April 1 and April 20, 2020, a total of 6194 people downloaded the app. The self-assessment functionality was used abundantly to check one's health status. In total, 5104 people responded to the question about severe symptoms, from which 242 indicated to suffer from severe symptoms. A total of 4929 people responded to the question about mild symptoms, from which 3248 indicated to suffer from these. The data was successfully applied to an interactive map, displaying user demographics and health status. Furthermore, the data was linked to clinical data. App users were satisfied with the information in the app and appreciated the symptom diary functionality. In total, 102 users reached out to a health care provider, leading to 91 contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated the successful implementation and use of an app with COVID-19 education, self-assessment, and a 7-day symptom diary. Data collected with the app were successfully applied to an interactive map. In addition, we were able to link the data to COVID-19 screening results from the hospital's microbiology laboratory. This data could be used to support policy makers and health care providers to get valuable insights in the regional distribution of infection load and health care consumption.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) before and on dialysis and specifically renal transplant patients represent a particularly vulnerable population. The increasing number of COVID-19 infected patients with renal involvement led to an evolving interest in the analysis of its pathophysiology, morphology and modes of virus detection in the kidney. Meanwhile, there are ample data from several autopsy and kidney biopsy studies that differ in the quantity of cases as well as in their quality. While the detection of SARS-CoV­2 RNA in the kidney leads to reproducible results, the use of electron microscopy for visualisation of the virus is difficult and currently critically discussed due to various artefacts. The exact contribution of indirect or direct effects on the kidney in COVID-19 are not yet known and are currently the focus of intensive research.","Amann, K; Boor, P; Wiech, T; Singh, J; Vonbrunn, E; Knöll, A; Hermann, M; Büttner-Herold, M; Daniel, C; Hartmann, A",Pathologe,,176

We hypothesized that the increase in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) with age is due to increased arterial stiffness and wave reflection and is thus associated with the pathogenesis of the renal small artery in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recruited 122 patients with CKD (stages 1-5) who underwent renal biopsy and ABI measurements between 2010 and 2013. Renal small artery intimal thickening (SA-IT) severity was assessed by semiquantitative grading. The median age was 47 years, with a range of 15-86 years (47% women). The median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 62 mL/min/1.73 m2. Compared with patients with the lowest 1-3 SA-IT index quartile, those with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index were older in age had higher mean arterial pressure, ABI, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, and lower eGFR. ABI was positively associated with SA-IT severity and inversely associated with eGFR. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that ABI was significantly associated with the highest quartile of the SA-IT index (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.26) and low eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (odds ratio per SD increase in ABI, 1.74; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.03). In conclusion, a high normal ABI was associated with severe renal small artery intimal thickening and low eGFR in patients with CKD.","Zamami, Ryo; Ishida, Akio; Miyagi, Tsuyoshi; Yamazato, Masanobu; Kohagura, Kentaro; Ohya, Yusuke",Hypertens. res,,176

We recommended planning the pregnancy after the achievement of major molecular response and completion of TKI therapy because we could not promise complete safety of the fetus, However, he and his partner insisted on starting the TKI therapy immediately and planned the pregnancy during the therapy. The patient was started on nilotinib 600mg/body. CCyR, MMR, and CMR were achieved in 3, 8, and 12 months, respectively. The patient's partner got pregnant when he had been on TKI therapy for 15 months, and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Since many patients with CMLcan live for a long time after receiving TKI therapy, the quality of life of these patients is more important. Even if the percentage of patients with CML who are under 50 years of age is approximately 30%, the safety information of TKI with respect to pregnancy is unsatisfactory. Doctors struggle to address the problems of the patient's wish of childbearing, priority of TKI therapy, and fetal risks of the treatment.

245214,Anxiety and depression in COVID-19: Treatment options,2021,"There is an urgent need for automated methods to assist accurate and effective assessment of COVID-19. Radiology and nucleic acid test (NAT) are complementary COVID-19 diagnosis methods. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multitask learning (MTL) framework (COVID-MTL) that is capable of automated and simultaneous detection (against both radiology and NAT) and severity assessment of COVID-19. COVID-MTL learns different COVID-19 tasks in parallel through our novel random-weighted loss function, which assigns learning weights under Dirichlet distribution to prevent task dominance; our new 3D real-time augmentation algorithm (Shift3D) introduces space variances for 3D CNN components by shifting low-level feature representations of volumetric inputs in three dimensions; thereby, the MTL framework is able to accelerate convergence and improve joint learning performance compared to single-task models. By only using chest CT scans, COVID-MTL was trained on 930 CT scans and tested on separate 399 cases. COVID-MTL achieved AUCs of 0.939 and 0.846, and accuracies of 90.23% and 79.20% for detection of COVID-19 against radiology and NAT, respectively, which outperformed the state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, COVID-MTL yielded AUC of 0.800 $\pm$ 0.020 and 0.813 $\pm$ 0.021 (with transfer learning) for classifying control/suspected, mild/regular, and severe/critically-ill cases. To decipher the recognition mechanism, we also identified high-throughput lung features that were significantly related (P<0.001) to the positivity and severity of COVID-19.","Bao, Guoqing; Chen, Huai; Liu, Tongliang; Gong, Guanzhong; Yin, Yong; Wang, Lisheng; Wang, Xiuying",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05509v3.pdf,176
245376,What I Learned From SARS in 2003 That Will Help Me Cope With COVID-19 in 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 global pandemic coupled with high transmission rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID-19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (&#8805;1,500 JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals. Policymakers and mental healthcare providers are advised to provide further mental support to these vulnerable groups during this pandemic.","Naser, Abdallah Y; Dahmash, Eman Zmaily; Al-Rousan, Rabaa; Alwafi, Hassan; Alrawashdeh, Hamzeh Mohammad; Ghoul, Imene; Abidine, Anwer; Bokhary, Mohammed A; Al-Hadithi, Hadeel T; Ali, Dalia; Abuthawabeh, Rasha; Abdelwahab, Ghada Mohammad; Alhartani, Yosra J; Al Muhaisen, Haneen; Dagash, Ayah; Alyami, Hamad S",Brain Behav,,176

245844,I am having trouble keeping up with virtual teaching activities: Reflections in the COVID-19 era,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered daily life in cities across the world. To slow the spread of COVID-19, many countries have introduced mobility restrictions, ordered the temporary closure of businesses, and encouraged social distancing. These policies have directly and indirectly influenced travel behaviour, particularly modal preferences. The purpose of this paper to explore modality profiles for non-mandatory trips and analyze how they have changed in response to the pandemic and pandemic-related public health policies. The data used for this study were collected from web-based surveys conducted in the Greater Toronto Area. Modality profiles were identified through the application of latent class cluster analysis, with six modality profiles being identified for both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods. The results indicate that the importance of public transit has declined during the pandemic, while the roles of private vehicles and active modes have become more prominent. However, individuals’ changes in modal preferences vary based on their pre-pandemic modality profile. In particular, it appears that pre-pandemic transit users with access to a private vehicle have substituted public transit for travel by private vehicle, while those without private vehicle access are continuing to use public transit for non-mandatory trips. Consequently, pandemic-related transportation policies should consider those who do not have access to a private vehicle and aim to help those making non-mandatory trips using transit or active modes comply with local public health guidelines while travelling. The results highlight how the changes in modal preferences that occurred due to the pandemic differ among different segments of the population. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Loa, P.; Hossain, S.; Mashrur, S.

246219,What are the effects of quarantine for close contacts of people with confirmed COVID‐19?,2020,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over the world since it broke out massively in December 2019, which has caused a large loss to the whole world. Both the confirmed cases and death cases have reached a relatively frightening number. Syndrome coronaviruses 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, can be transmitted by small respiratory droplets. To curb its spread at the source, wearing masks is a convenient and effective measure. In most cases, people use face masks in a high-frequent but short-time way. Aimed at solving the problem that we don't know which service stage of the mask belongs to, we propose a detection system based on the mobile phone. We first extract four features from the GLCMs of the face mask's micro-photos. Next, a three-result detection system is accomplished by using KNN algorithm. The results of validation experiments show that our system can reach a precision of 82.87% (standard deviation=8.5%) on the testing dataset. In future work, we plan to expand the detection objects to more mask types. This work demonstrates that the proposed mobile microscope system can be used as an assistant for face mask being used, which may play a positive role in fighting against COVID-19.","Chen, Yuzhen; Hu, Menghan; Hua, Chunjun; Zhai, Guangtao; Zhang, Jian; Li, Qingli; Yang, Simon X.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06421v1.pdf,176
246503,Estimated HbA1c and glucose management indicator (GMI): are they the same?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range from mild symptoms to severe pneumonia and severe organ damage. When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. DESIGN: This retrospective chart review, followed by a descriptive survey design study, was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24 ± 16.99 yrs were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared with the preinfectious and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and limbs during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the head and limbs were the most common painful body regions during COVID-19. It was also found that pain can continue in the postinfection period.","Sahin, Tülay; Ayyildiz, Aylin; Gencer-Atalay, Kardelen; Akgün, Cem; Özdemir, Haci Mustafa; Kuran, Banu",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,176

248452,The Effect of Radiological and Laboratory Parameters on Prognosis in COVID 19 Disease,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infections cause the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and challenge the immune system with ongoing inflammation. Several redox-relevant micronutrients are known to contribute to an adequate immune response, including the essential trace elements zinc (Zn) and selenium (Se). In this study, we tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 patients are characterised by Zn deficiency and that Zn status provides prognostic information. Serum Zn was determined in serum samples (n = 171) collected consecutively from patients surviving COVID-19 (n = 29) or non-survivors (n = 6). Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study were used for comparison. Zn concentrations in patient samples were low as compared to healthy subjects (mean ± SD; 717.4 ± 246.2 vs 975.7 ± 294.0 µg/L, P < 0.0001). The majority of serum samples collected at different time points from the non-survivors (25/34, i.e., 73.5%) and almost half of the samples collected from the survivors (56/137, i.e., 40.9%) were below the threshold for Zn deficiency, i.e., below 638.7 µg/L (the 2.5th percentile in the EPIC cohort). In view that the Se status biomarker and Se transporter selenoprotein P (SELENOP) is also particularly low in COVID-19, we tested the prevalence of a combined deficit, i.e., serum Zn below 638.7 µg/L and serum SELENOP below 2.56 mg/L. This combined deficit was observed in 0.15% of samples in the EPIC cohort of healthy subjects, in 19.7% of the samples collected from the surviving COVID-19 patients and in 50.0% of samples from the non-survivors. Accordingly, the composite biomarker (SELENOP and Zn with age) proved as a reliable indicator of survival in COVID-19 by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 94.42%. We conclude that Zn and SELENOP status within the reference ranges indicate high survival odds in COVID-19, and assume that correcting a diagnostically proven deficit in Se and/or Zn by a personalised supplementation may support convalescence.","Heller, Raban Arved; Sun, Qian; Hackler, Julian; Seelig, Julian; Seibert, Linda; Cherkezov, Asan; Minich, Waldemar B; Seemann, Petra; Diegmann, Joachim; Pilz, Maximilian; Bachmann, Manuel; Ranjbar, Alireza; Moghaddam, Arash; Schomburg, Lutz",Redox Biol,,176

The task environment for emergencies was divided into four categories. Targeted policies were assigned to explicit task environments by placing them in one of the four quadrants: public health procedures, medical operation standards, supervisory and regulatory measures, and norms and instructions. Institutional diversity resulted when the very loci of decision-making carried a dominant or subordinate role, providing a hierarchical system for relating the institutional processes needed to address the challenges of institutional fragments.","Yan, Jingjing; Zhao, Dahai",,,176
248700,A review of global mistakes in the spread of COVID-19 and the approach of India towards it,2020,"Musculoskeletal simulations are an essential tool for studying functional implications of pathologies and of potential surgical outcomes, e.g., for the complex shoulder anatomy. Most shoulder models rely on line-segment approximation of muscles with potential limitations. Comprehensive shoulder models based on continuum-mechanics are scarce due to their complexity in both modeling and computation. In this paper, we present a surface-based modeling approach for muscles, which simplifies the modeling process and is efficient for computation. We propose to use surface geometries for modeling muscles, and devise an automatic approach to generate such models, given the locations of the origin and insertion of tendons. The surfaces are expressed as higher-order tensor B-splines, which ensure smoothness of the geometrical representation. They are simulated as membrane elements within a finite element simulation. This is demonstrated on a comprehensive model of the upper limb, where muscle activations needed to perform desired motions are obtained by using inverse dynamics. In synthetic examples, we demonstrate our proposed surface elements both to be easy to customize (e.g., with spatially varying material properties) and to be substantially (up to 12 times) faster in simulation compared to their volumetric counterpart. With our presented automatic approach of muscle wrapping around bones, the humeral head is exemplified to be wrapped physiologically consistently with surface elements. Our functional simulation is shown to successfully replicate a tracked shoulder motion during activities of daily living. We demonstrate surface-based models to be a numerically stable and computationally efficient compromise between line-segment and volumetric models, enabling anatomical correctness, subject-specific customization, and fast simulations, for a comprehensive simulation of musculoskeletal motion.","Péan, Fabien; Goksel, Orcun",Med Eng Phys,,176
249128,Well-Being During a Time of Crisis and Beyond: Supporting a Culture of Mindfulness in Oncology Practices,2020,"Testing and case identification are key strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Contact tracing and isolation are only possible if cases have been identified. The effectiveness of testing should be assessed, but a single comprehensive metric is not available to assess testing effectiveness, and no timely estimates of case detection rate are available globally, making inter-country comparisons difficult. The purpose of this paper was to propose a single, comprehensive metric, called the COVID-19 Testing Index (CovTI) scaled from 0 to 100, derived from epidemiological indicators of testing, and to identify factors associated with this outcome. The index was based on case-fatality rate, test positivity rate, active cases, and an estimate of the detection rate. It used parsimonious modeling to estimate the true total number of COVID-19 cases based on deaths, testing, health system capacity, and government transparency. Publicly reported data from 165 countries and territories that had reported at least 100 confirmed cases by June 3, 2020 were included in the index. Estimates of detection rates aligned satisfactorily with previous estimates in literature (R2 = 0.44). As of June 3, 2020, the states with the highest CovTI included Hong Kong (93.7), Australia (93.5), Iceland (91.8), Cambodia (91.3), New Zealand (90.6), Vietnam (90.2), and Taiwan (89.9). Bivariate analyses showed the mean CovTI in countries with open public testing policies (66.9, 95% CI 61.0-72.8) was significantly higher than in countries with no testing policy (29.7, 95% CI 17.6-41.9) (p<0.0001). A multiple linear regression model assessed the association of independent grouping variables with CovTI. Open public testing and extensive contact tracing were shown to significantly increase CovTI, after adjusting for extrinsic factors, including geographic isolation and centralized forms of government. The correlation of testing and contact tracing policies with improved outcomes demonstrates the validity of this model to assess testing effectiveness and also suggests these policies were effective at improving health outcomes. This tool can be combined with other databases to identify other factors or may be useful as a standalone tool to help inform policymakers.","Kuster, Anthony C; Overgaard, Hans J",PLoS One,,176

This study aims to evaluate the involvement of SNPs and tissue expression of IL-17A and the neutrophils recruitment in post-mortem lung samples from patients who died of severe forms of COVID-19 comparing to those who died by H1N1pdm09. Twenty lung samples from patients SARS-CoV-2 infected (COVID-19 group) and 10 lung samples from adults who died from a severe respiratory H1N1pdm09 infection (H1N1 group) were tested. The tissue expression of IL-8/IL-17A was identified by immunohistochemistry, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain slides were used for neutrophil scoring. DNA was extracted from paraffin blocks, and genotyping was done in real time-PCR for two IL17A target polymorphisms. Tissue expression increasing of IL-8/IL-17A and a higher number of neutrophils were identified in samples from the H1N1 group compared to the COVID-19 group. The distribution of genotype frequencies in the IL17A gene was not statistically significant between groups. However, the G allele (GG and GA) of rs3819025 was correlated with higher tissue expression of IL-17A in the COVID-19 group. SARS-CoV-2 virus evokes an exacerbated response of the host's immune system but differs from that observed in the H1N1pdm09 infection since the IL-8/IL-17A tissue expression, and lung neutrophilic recruitment may be decreased.

However, clinicopathologic features diagnostic of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have not been reported. We studied the reticuloendothelial organs of 4 consecutive patients who died of COVID-19 and correlated with clinical and laboratory parameters to detect HLH. METHODS: Autopsies were performed on 4 patients who died of COVID-19. Routine H&E staining and immunohistochemical staining for CD163 were performed to detect hemophagocytosis. Clinical and laboratory results from premortem blood samples were used to calculate H-scores. RESULTS: All 4 cases demonstrated diffuse alveolar damage within the lungs. Three of the 4 cases had histologic evidence of hemophagocytosis within pulmonary lymph nodes. One case showed hemophagocytosis in the spleen but none showed hemophagocytosis in liver or bone marrow. Lymphophagocytosis was the predominant form of hemophagocytosis observed. One patient showed diagnostic features of HLH with an H-score of 217, while a second patient likely had HLH with a partial H-score of 145 due to a missing triglyceride level. The remaining 2 patients had H-scores of 131 and 96. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated HLH. Identification of HLH in a subset of patients with severe COVID-19 will inform clinical trials of therapeutic strategies.","Prilutskiy, Andrey; Kritselis, Michael; Shevtsov, Artem; Yambayev, Ilyas; Vadlamudi, Charitha; Zhao, Qing; Kataria, Yachana; Sarosiek, Shayna R; Lerner, Adam; Sloan, J Mark; Quillen, Karen; Burks, Eric J",Am J Clin Pathol,,176

This Perspective aims to provide a guide based on the Italian and French experience to better face the difficulties encountered by endoscopists during this global health emergency. In particular, recommendations regarding the use of personal protective equipment to prevent COVID-19 transmission, both for patients and health-care professionals, are proposed and different scenarios in endoscopic IBD management are evaluated to suggest when endoscopy could be rescheduled and replaced by alternative biomarkers.","Furfaro, Federica; Vuitton, Lucine; Fiorino, Gionata; Koch, Stephane; Allocca, Mariangela; Gilardi, Daniela; Zilli, Alessandra; D039,; Amico, Ferdinando; Radice, Simona; Chevaux, Jean-Baptiste; Schaefer, Marion; Chaussade, Stanislas; Danese, Silvio; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,,176
252659,Clinical Trial Ethics in the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed an unprecedented challenge to governments worldwide. Effective government communication of COVID-19 information with the public is of crucial importance. OBJECTIVE: We investigate how the most-read state-owned newspaper in China, People's Daily, used an online social networking site, Sina Weibo, to communicate about COVID-19 and whether this could engage the public. The objective of this study is to develop an integrated framework to examine the content, message style, and interactive features of COVID-19-related posts and determine their effects on public engagement in the largest social media network in China. METHODS: Content analysis was employed to scrutinize 608 COVID-19 posts, and coding was performed on three main dimensions: content, message style, and interactive features. The content dimension was coded into six subdimensions: action, new evidence, reassurance, disease prevention, health care services, and uncertainty, and the style dimension was coded into the subdimensions of narrative and nonnarrative. As for interactive features, they were coded into links to external sources, use of hashtags, use of questions to solicit feedback, and use of multimedia. Public engagement was measured in the form of the number of shares, comments, and likes on the People's Daily's Sina Weibo account from January 20, 2020, to March 11, 2020, to reveal the association between different levels of public engagement and communication strategies. A one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Tukey test and negative binomial regression analysis were employed to generate the results. RESULTS: We found that although the content frames of action, new evidence, and reassurance delivered in a nonnarrative style were predominant in COVID-19 communication by the government, posts related to new evidence and a nonnarrative style were strong negative predictors of the number of shares. In terms of generating a high number of shares, it was found that disease prevention posts delivered in a narrative style were able to achieve this purpose. Additionally, an interaction effect was found between content and style. The use of a narrative style in disease prevention posts had a significant positive effect on generating comments and likes by the Chinese public, while links to external sources fostered sharing. CONCLUSIONS: These results have implications for governments, health organizations, medical professionals, the media, and researchers on their epidemic communication to engage the public. Selecting suitable communication strategies may foster active liking and sharing of posts on social media, which in turn, might raise the public's awareness of COVID-19 and motivate them to take preventive measures. The sharing of COVID-19 posts is particularly important because this action can reach out to a large audience, potentially helping to contain the spread of the virus.","Ngai, Cindy Sing Bik; Singh, Rita Gill; Lu, Wenze; Koon, Alex Chun",J Med Internet Res,,176

We aimed to investigate the needs of healthcare professionals and the technical difficulties faced by them during the initial outbreak. A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among the healthcare workforce in the most populous cities from three Latin American countries in April 2020. In total, 1,082 participants were included. Of these, 534 (49.4%), 263 (24.3%), and 114 (10.5%) were physicians, nurses, and other professionals, respectively. At least 70% of participants reported a lack of PPE. The most common shortages were shortages in gown coverall suits (643, 59.4%), N95 masks (600, 55.5%), and face shields (569, 52.6%). Professionals who performed procedures that generated aerosols reported shortages more frequently (p<0.05). Professionals working in the emergency department and primary care units reported more shortages than those working in intensive care units and hospital-based wards (p<0.001). Up to 556 (51.4%) participants reported the lack of sufficient knowledge about using PPE. Professionals working in public institutions felt less prepared, received less training, and had no protocols compared with their peers in working private institutions (p<0.001). Although the study sample corresponded to different hospital centers in different cities from the participating countries, sampling was non-random. Healthcare professionals in Latin America may face more difficulties than those from other countries, with 7 out of 10 professionals reporting that they did not have the necessary resources to care for patients with COVID-19. Technical and logistical difficulties should be addressed in the event of a future outbreak, as they have a negative impact on healthcare workers.

We conducted an online search in Medline/PubMed to identify original cohorts comparing data between survivors and non-survivors from COVID-19. The presence of cardiovascular events and related biomarkers were compared between the two groups. Data on 1,845 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were pooled from 12 comparative studies. The overall mortality rate in relation to COVID-19 was 17.6%. Men aged > 50 years old were more likely to die from COVID-19. Significant co-morbidities contributing to mortality were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, a previous history of cardiovascular disease including chronic heart failure, and cerebrovascular accidents. A significant relationship was observed between mortality and patient presentation with dyspnea, fatigue, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. Cardiovascular disease-related laboratory biomarkers related to mortality were elevated serum level of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and cardiac troponin I. Adverse cardiovascular disease-related clinical events preceding death were shock, arrhythmias, and acute myocardial injury. In conclusion, elevated biomarkers in COVID-19 patients with established risk factors can predict mortality from cardiovascular causes.","Shoar, Saeed; Hosseini, Fatemeh; Naderan, Mohammad; Mehta, Jawahar L",Am. j. cardiol,,176

The induction of a coordinated immune response is crucial to the elimination of any pathogenic infection. However, SARS-CoV-2 can modulate the host immune system to favor viral adaptation and persistence within the host. The virus can counteract type I interferon (IFN-I) production, attenuating IFN-I signaling pathway activation and disrupting antigen presentation. Simultaneously, SARS-CoV-2 infection can enhance apoptosis and the production of inflammatory mediators, which ultimately results in increased disease severity. SARS-CoV-2 produces an array of effector molecules, including nonstructural proteins (NSPs) and open-reading frames (ORFs) accessory proteins. We describe the complex molecular interplay of SARS-CoV-2 NSPs and accessory proteins with the host's signaling mediating immune evasion in the current review. In addition, the crucial role played by immunomodulation therapy to address immune evasion is discussed. Thus, the current review can provide new directions for the development of vaccines and specific therapies.","Abdalla, Abualgasim Elgaili; Xie, Jianping; Junaid, Kashaf; Younas, Sonia; Elsaman, Tilal; Abosalif, Khalid Omer Abdalla; Alameen, Ayman Ali Mohammed; Mahjoob, Mahjoob Osman; Elamir, Mohammed Yagoub Mohammed; Ejaz, Hasan",Bosn. j. basic med. sci.

253779,Respiratory Therapeutic Strategies in Children and Adolescents with COVID-19: a Critical Review,2020,"INTRODUCTION: There is an outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide. As there is no effective therapy or vaccine yet, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures such as isolation and quarantine remains the most effective tool to control the outbreak. When an asymptomatic individual with COVID-19 exposure is being quarantined, it is necessary to perform temperature and symptom surveillance. As such surveillance is intermittent in nature and highly dependent on self-discipline, it has limited effectiveness. Advances in biosensor technologies made it possible to continuously monitor physiological parameters using wearable biosensors with a variety of form factors. OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of using wearable biosensors to continuously monitor multidimensional physiological parameters for early detection of COVID-19 clinical progression. METHOD: This randomised controlled open-labelled trial will involve 200-1000 asymptomatic subjects with close COVID-19 contact under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. Subjects will be randomised to receive a remote monitoring strategy (intervention group) or standard strategy (control group) in a 1:1 ratio during the 14 day-quarantine period. In addition to fever and symptom surveillance in the control group, subjects in the intervention group will wear wearable biosensors on their arms to continuously monitor skin temperature, respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation and daily activities. These physiological parameters will be transferred in real time to a smartphone application called Biovitals Sentinel. These data will then be processed using a cloud-based multivariate physiology analytics engine called Biovitals to detect subtle physiological changes. The results will be displayed on a web-based dashboard for clinicians' review. The primary outcome is the time to diagnosis of COVID-19. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from institutional review boards at the study sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.","Wong, Chun Ka; Ho, Deborah Tip Yin; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Zhou, Mi; Lau, Yuk Ming; Tang, Milky Oi Yan; Tong, Raymond Cheuk Fung; Rajput, Kuldeep Singh; Chen, Gengbo; Chan, Soon Chee; Siu, Chung Wah; Hung, Ivan Fan Ngai",BMJ Open,,176

However, there are knowledge gaps about the severity, prevalence, etiology, and duration of OD in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Olfactory function was assessed in all participants using questionnaires and the butanol threshold test (BTT). Patients with COVID-19 and abnormal olfaction were further evaluated using the smell identification test (SIT), sinus imaging, and nasoendoscopy. Selected patients received nasal biopsies. Systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed items from January 1, 2020 to April 23, 2020 were searched. Studies that reported clinical data on olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Results: We included 18 COVID-19 patients and 18 controls. Among COVID-19 patients, 12 of 18 (67%) reported olfactory symptoms and OD was confirmed in 6 patients by BTT and SIT. Olfactory dysfunction was the only symptom in 2 patients. Mean BTT score of patients was worse than controls (P =. 004, difference in means = 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-2.9). Sinusitis and olfactory cleft obstruction were absent in most patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of nasal biopsy revealed the presence of infiltrative CD68+macrophages harboring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigen in the stroma. Olfactory dysfunction persisted in 2 patients despite clinical recovery. Systematic review showed that the prevalence of olfactory disturbances in COVID-19 ranged from 5% to 98%. Most studies did not assess olfaction quantitatively. Conclusions: Olfactory dysfunction is common in COVID-19 and may be the only symptom. Coronavirus disease 2019-related OD can be severe and prolonged. Mucosal infiltration by CD68+macrophages expressing SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen may contribute to COVID-19-related OD.","Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Sridhar, Siddharth; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Li, Hang-Long; Wong, Fergus Kai-Chuen; Ng, Ming-Yen; Tsang, Raymond King-Yin; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Fan, Zhimeng; Ho, Ronnie Siu-Lun; Luk, Shiobhon Yiu; Kan, Wai-Kuen; Lam, Sonia Hiu-Yin; Wu, Alan Ka-Lun; Leung, Sau-Man; Chan, Wai-Ming; Ng, Pauline Yeung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Lung, Kwok-Cheung; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Open Forum Infect.

These issues however are not new. Delays in time from the first dose in a high-income country to introduction at scale in a low-income country can take years. These delays are driven by several challenges, some of which are unique to the vaccine development ecosystem. The patenting and overall intellectual property (IP) protection are complex, regulatory oversight is rigorous, manufacturing processes require technical support or know-how transfer from the innovator, and market dynamics create obstacles to delivering at scale. However, there are opportunities to accelerate the introduction of vaccines at scale in low and middle-income countries. To identify those opportunities, this paper provides an overview of the vaccine research and development process and where reform of the current system could increase access [1].","Kristian Aars, Ole; Clark, Michael; Schwalbe, Nina",Vaccine X,,176

We have previously reported doxycycline, a nonselective matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) inhibitor, to attenuate aortic root widening and improve aortic contractility and elasticity in MFS mice. We were also first to use multiphoton microscopy, a non-invasive and label-free imaging technique, to quantify and link the aortic ultrastructure to possible changes in the skin dermis. Here, we aimed to assess the effects of long-term doxycycline treatment on the aortic ultrastructure and skin dermis of MFS mice through immunohistochemical evaluation and quantification of elastic and collagen content and morphology using multiphoton microscopy. Our results demonstrate a rescue of aortic elastic fiber fragmentation and disorganization accompanied by a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression within the aortic wall in doxycycline-treated MFS mice. At 12 months of age, reduced skin dermal thickness was observed in both MFS and control mice, but only dermal thinning in MFS mice was rescued by doxycycline treatment. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was reduced in the skin of doxycycline-treated MFS mice. A decrease in dermal thickness was found to be positively associated with increased aortic root elastin disorganization and wall thickness. Our findings confirm the beneficial effects of doxycycline on ultrastructural properties of aortic root as well as on skin elasticity and structural integrity in MFS mice.","Tehrani, Arash Y; Cui, Jason Z; Bucky Jones, T; Hotova, Ester; Castro, Monica; Bernatchez, Pascal; van Breemen, Cornelis; Esfandiarei, Mitra",Sci Rep,,176

Vaccines represent a key answer to control these viruses. However, in the case of a public health emergency, vaccine development, safety, and partial efficacy concerns may hinder their prompt deployment. Thus, developing broad-spectrum antiviral molecules for a fast response is essential to face an outbreak crisis as well as for bioweapon countermeasures. So far, broad-spectrum antivirals include two main categories: the family of drugs targeting the host-cell machinery essential for virus infection and replication, and the family of drugs directly targeting viruses. Among the molecules directly targeting viruses, nucleoside analogues form an essential class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this review, we will discuss the interest for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies and their limitations, with an emphasis on virus-targeted, broad-spectrum, antiviral nucleoside analogues and their mechanisms of action.","Geraghty, Robert J; Aliota, Matthew T; Bonnac, Laurent F",Viruses,,176

Schools and universities provide rich resources for adolescents and young adults to develop significant coping mechanisms. AIM: This study assessed the perceptions of risk, fear, mental health status, and coping strategies among Saudi student nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using an online survey, the mental health of the students was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form version, whereas the coping was assessed by the Brief-Coping Orientation of Problem Experienced scale. RESULTS: The students had modest risk perception and fear of contracting COVID-19. ""Religion"" was reported as the most frequently used coping strategy. Approximately 43.3%, 37.2%, and 30.9% of the respondents manifested some degree of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Poor COVID-19 knowledge, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and the use of some coping strategies were predictors of fear. Knowing someone infected with COVID-19, fear, and several coping strategies predicted students' mental health. CONCLUSION: This study provides data that can be used to create educational and health policies that focus on the mental health of university students, specifically nursing students.","Alsolais, Abdullelah; Alquwez, Nahed; Alotaibi, Khalaf Aied; Alqarni, Aidah Sanad; Almalki, Mohammed; Alsolami, Fatmah; Almazan, Joseph; Cruz, Jonas Preposi",J Ment Health,,176

Accumulating evidence point out that an “endothelitis” due to a cytokines storm causes intravascular thrombosis, especially in the lungs, and is related to the poor outcome. We tested possible relationships between anticoagulant treatment and/or administration of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at different doses and outcome in a population of 258 COVID-19 patients admitted from February 28th to April 30th, 2020 to General Medicine ward of the Hospital of Montichiari (Brixia, Italy). Design and method: A group of 258 consecutive patients (174 males and 84 females, mean age 71 years +/-14) was included in the present study. In 168 patients, high-flow oxygen was required (Venturi mask), 6 patients needed orotracheal intubation and 20 were given continuous positive pressure oxygen therapy (CPAP). Patient were treated (unless a pulmonary embolism was detected) with different doses of prophylactic LMWH, according to emerging evidence during pandemic period. As of June 10th, 65 deaths had been observed. Survival curves were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed with Breslow and Mantel-Cox test. Results: LMWH at standard dose (4000 IU once daily) didn't reduce mortality compared to no treatment (p=ns), while LMWH at a higher dose than usual prophylactic dose (enoxaparin 6000 IU once daily or 4000 IU bid) was associated with better outcome (p&lt;0.001 vs untreated and treated with standard dose). Significance was confirmed adding patients treated with oral anti-coagulant (OAC)for any reason. None of the patients treated with LMWH at higher doses or OAC died. Conclusions: The administration of subcutaneous LMWH at a higher dose than indicated for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is associated with a better outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, confirming some emerging evidence.","Bonetti, S.; Boari, G.

The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Fabry disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy is still unknown. Many patients who receive treatment in the hospital experienced infusion disruptions due to fear of infection. Effects of temporary treatment interruption was described in more detail in other lysosomal storage diseases, but the recommencement of therapy does not fully reverse clinical decline due to the temporary discontinuation.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%. We hope this method will speed up COVID-19 detection and lead to more robust systems of radiology.","Waheed, Abdul; Goyal, Muskan; Gupta, Deepak; Khanna, Ashish; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Pinheiro, Placido Rogerio",IEEE Access,,176

Infrared thermal evaluation was performed to measure the facial temperature of the perioral region and the perception ratings related to the humidity, heat, breathing difficulty, and discomfort were recorded. A significant difference in heat flow and perioral region temperature was recorded between the surgical mask and the N95 respirator (p < 0.05). A statistically significant difference in humidity, heat, breathing difficulty, and discomfort was present between the groups. The study results suggest that N95 respirators are able to induce an increased facial skin temperature, greater discomfort and lower wearing adherence when compared to the medical surgical masks.","Scarano, Antonio; Inchingolo, Francesco; Lorusso, Felice",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,176

266754,Stroke Family Caregiving and the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact and Future Directions,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similar to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and case fatalities. COVID-19 disease severity is worse in older obese patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung disease. Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.","Bassendine, Margaret F; Bridge, Simon H; McCaughan, Geoffrey W; Gorrell, Mark D",J Diabetes,,176
267289,COVID-19: angiotensin II in development of lung immunothrombosis and vasculitis mimics,2021,"Extracellular pH is an important biomarker in many diseases yet a routine method for imaging tissue pH has not been established in the clinic. Paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (paraCEST) agents are well-suited for imaging tissue pH because the basis of CEST, chemical exchange, is inherently sensitive to pH. Several previous pH-sensitive paraCEST agents were based upon with an exchanging Ln 3+ bound water molecule as the CEST antenna but this design often added additional line-broadening of the bulk water signal due to T 2 exchange. We report here a pH-sensitive paraCEST agent that lacks an inner-sphere water molecule but contains one Ln-bound -OH group for CEST activation. The Yb 3+ - complex, Yb( 1 ), displayed a single, highly-shifted CEST peak originating from the exchangeable Yb-OH proton, the frequency of which changed over the biologically relevant pH range. CEST images of phantoms ranging in pH from 6-8 demonstrate the potential of this agent for imaging pH. Initial rodent imaging studies showed that Gd( 1 ) remains in the vascular system much longer than anticipated but is cleared slowing via renal filtration.","Sherry, A Dean; Ratnakar, James; Chirayil, Sara; Funk, Alexander; Zhang, Shanrong; Queiro, J F; Geraldes, Carlos; Kovacs, Zoltan",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,176

Current methods of examining chest X-rays and CT scan requires profound knowledge and are time consuming, which suggests that it shrinks the precious time of medical practitioners when people's lives are at stake. This study tries to assist this process by achieving state-of-the-art performance in classifying chest X-rays by fine-tuning Vision Transformer(ViT). The proposed approach uses pretrained models, fine-tuned for detecting the presence of COVID-19 disease on chest X-rays. This approach achieves an accuracy score of 97.61%, precision score of 95.34%, recall score of 93.84% and, f1-score of 94.58%. This result signifies the performance of transformer-based models on chest X-ray.","Krishnan, Koushik Sivarama; Krishnan, Karthik Sivarama",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.04458v1.pdf,176

However, despite the proliferation of technical guidance, tools and roadmaps, as the recent COVID-19 emergency demonstrates, a significant challenge still remains. The unique and complex environment within countries is increasingly being recognised as a factor which needs greater consideration if system strengthening activities are to be successful.This paper reflects on the learning from and charts out the journey of the authors' in their efforts to support the Pakistan government to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, specifically through strengthening its Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system.To effect change, public health technical specialists bring their grounded technical and scientific expertise along with their softer public health skills of, among other things, relationship building and multisector working. In the authors' experience, the importance of taking time throughout to build and maintain strong trusted relationships and peer-to-peer support has been the key to the successes experienced. The nature of this relationship and ongoing reflexive dialogue enabled the co-construction of the reality of the background environment, which, in turn, led to more realistic visioning of the desired system for IDSR, and therefore more appropriate bespoke technical support to be given, leading to the design and initial implementation of a country owned system developed with sustainability in mind.","Wilson, Anne; Cartwright, Christopher",,,176

While clinical symptoms present in some COVID-19 patients, others have been incidentally identified. The objective of this study was to examine the clinical and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were symptomatic or had atypical symptoms and to make a contribution to the literature. METHODS: Patients with the likelihood of having COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated with RT-PCR samples, other laboratory tests, and chest computed tomography. RESULTS: There were significant differences between these groups in terms of age, dyspnea, saturation, and comor-bidities including hypertension [HT] in 19 patients, cerebrovascular events [CVE] that were classified as other diseases in two patients (intracranial mass in one patient and Alzheimer's disease in one patient), and CRP and platelet counts (PLT) among the laboratory parameters (for all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical symptoms have increased due to the progression of the outbreak. Infected people with atypical symptoms can act as sources of the infection. Therefore, the epidemiological history of these patients should be sought in detail, and individuals with atypical symptoms in society should be identified as soon as possible in order to control the spreading of the disease.","Akpinar, Guleser; Demir, Mehmet C; Sultanoglu, Hasan; Unlu, Elif N; Oksuz, Sukru",Clin. lab,,176

Although measures to control SARS-CoV-2, namely, vaccination, medication, and chemical disinfectants are being investigated, there is an increase in the demand for auxiliary antiviral approaches using natural compounds. Here we have focused on hydroxytyrosol (HT)-rich aqueous olive pulp extract (HIDROX®) and evaluated its SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activity in vitro. We showed that the HIDROX solution exhibits time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities, and that HIDROX has more potent virucidal activity than pure HT. The evaluation of the mechanism of action suggested that both HIDROX and HT induced structural changes in SARS-CoV-2, which changed the molecular weight of the spike proteins. Even though the spike protein is highly glycosylated, this change was induced regardless of the glycosylation status. In addition, HIDROX or HT treatment disrupted the viral genome. Moreover, the HIDROX-containing cream applied on film showed time- and concentration-dependent SARS-CoV-2-inactivating activities. Thus, the HIDROX-containing cream can be applied topically as an antiviral hand cream. Our findings suggest that HIDROX contributes to improving SARS-CoV-2 control measures.","Takeda, Yohei; Jamsransuren, Dulamjav; Matsuda, Sachiko; Crea, Roberto; Ogawa, Haruko",Viruses,,176

Modelled human sACE2 and the spike (S1) protein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 (INS1) docked with each other. On the other hand, nicotine docked with sACE2 in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2. Nicotine established a stable interaction with negatively charged Asp368 of sACE2, which in turn binds with amino acids like Thr362, Lys363, Thr365, Thr371, and Ala372. In the presence of nicotine, INS1 and sACE2 showed a reduced binding affinity score of -12.6 kcal/mol (Vs -15.7 kcal/mol without nicotine), and a lowered interface area of 1933.6 Å2 (Vs 2057.3Å2 without nicotine). The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor showed 19.85 % sequence identity among themselves. Following these receptors possessed conserved Trp302 and Cys344 amino acids between them for nicotine binding. However, nicotine showed a higher binding affinity score of -6.33 kcal/mol for the sACE2-INS1 complex than the sACE2 alone with -5.24 kcal/mol. A lowered inhibitory constant value of 22.95µM recorded while nicotine interacted with the sACE2-INS1 complex over the sACE2 alone with 151.69 µM. In summary, nicotine showed a profound binding affinity for the sACE2-INS1 complex than the sACE2 alone paving for the clinical trials to validate its therapeutic efficacy as a bitter compound against the SARS-CoV-2 virulence.","C, Selvaa Kumar; Kumar, Senthil Arun; Wei, Haiyan",,,176

Despite much effort by scientists, medical experts, and society in general, the slow progress on drug discovery and antibody therapeutic development, the unknown possible side effects of the existing vaccines, and the high transmission rate of the SARS-CoV-2, remind us of the sad reality that our current understanding of the transmission, infectivity, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is unfortunately very limited. The major limitation is the lack of mechanistic understanding of viral-host cell interactions, the viral regulation, protein-protein interactions, including antibody-antigen binding, protein-drug binding, host immune response, etc. This limitation will likely haunt the scientific community for a long time and have a devastating consequence in combating COVID-19 and other pathogens. Notably, compared to the long-cycle, highly cost, and safety-demanding molecular-level experiments, the theoretical and computational studies are economical, speedy, and easy to perform.

While most out-of-home leisure activities were prohibited, in England the lockdown rules allowed for restricted use of outdoor greenspace for the purposes of exercise and recreation. In this paper, we use data recorded by Google from location-enabled mobile devices coupled with a detailed recreation demand model to explore the welfare impacts of those constraints on leisure activities. Our analyses reveals evidence of large-scale substitution of leisure time towards recreation in available greenspaces. Indeed, despite the restrictions the economic value of greenspace to the citizens of England fell by only £150 million over lockdown. Examining the outcomes of counterfactual policies we find that the imposition of stricter lockdown rules would have reduced welfare from greenspace by £1.14 billion. In contrast, more relaxed lockdown rules would have delivered an aggregate increase in the economic value of greenspace equal to £1.47 billion.","Day, Brett H",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,176

The developed localization system is based on wireless Local Area Network (LAN) infrastructure (commonly referred to as Wi-Fi), evaluating signal strength from different access points, using the fingerprinting method for localization. The most serious problems consist in multipath signal propagation and the different sensitivities (calibration) of Wi-Fi adapters installed in different mobile devices. To solve these issues, an algorithm based on fuzzy logic is proposed to optimize the localization performance. The localization system consists of five elements, which are mobile applications for Android OS, a fuzzy derivation model, and a web surveillance environment for displaying the localization results. All of these elements use a database and shared storage on a virtualized server running Ubuntu. The developed system is implemented in Java for Android-based mobile devices and successfully tested. The average accuracy is satisfactory for determining the position of a client device on the level of rooms.","Hrad, Jaromir; Vojtech, Lukas; Cihlar, Martin; Stasa, Pavel; Neruda, Marek; Benes, Filip; Svub, Jiri",,,176

Seven coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to infect humans and they are OC43 CoV, NL63 CoV, HKU1 CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS CoV, and SARS CoV-2. Virus replication weakens the immune system of host thereby altering T-cell count and much of interferon response. Although no vaccine or therapeutic treatment has been approved till now for CoV infection, trials of vaccine against SARS CoV-2 are in progress. One of the epitopes used for vaccine production is of the spike protein on the surface of virus. The work focuses on designing of multi-epitope vaccine construct for treatment of seven human CoV infections using the epitopes present on the spike protein of human CoVs. To address this, immuno-informatics techniques have been employed to design multi-epitope vaccine construct. B- and T-cell epitopes of the spike proteins have been predicted and designed into a multi-epitope vaccine construct. The tertiary structure of the vaccine construct along with the adjuvant has been modelled and the physiochemical properties have been predicted. The multi-epitope vaccine construct has antigenic and non-allergenic property. After validation, refinement and disulphide engineering of the vaccine construct, molecular docking with toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been performed. Molecular dynamics simulation in aqueous environment predicted that the vaccine-TLRs complexes were stable. The vaccine construct is predicted to be able to trigger primary immune response in silico.

It was too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of measures in each of the selected countries; however, the authors present some efforts to identify and classify response and containment measures, country-by-country, for future comparison and analysis. There is a significant variety of policy tools and response measures employed in different countries, and while it is still hard to directly compare the different approaches based on their efficacy, it will definitely provide many inputs for the future data analysis efforts.","Rozanova, Liudmila; Temerev, Alexander; Flahault, Antoine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,176

277044,Exceptional times: 5G networks in a COVID-19 era,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, we have experienced a reduction in admissions in our Service and a decrease in urgent surgical activity. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the incidence of potentially surgical abdominal emergency in our center during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed. It included all patients admitted for urgent abdominal pathology with potential surgical treatment in our General and Digestive Surgery Department from February 24, 2020 to April 19, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients with a mean age of 58.85±22.2 were included. The median time from symptom onset to the Emergency Department (ED) visit was 48 (P25-P75 = 24-96) hours. On arrival at the ED, 18 (20%) patients presented with systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria. Fifty-one (57%) surgical procedures were performed. The rate of post-surgical complications at 30 days was 31% and the mortality rate was 2%. Concerning the same period from 2017 to 2019, the mean number of admissions from the ED to our Department decreased by 14% during the epidemic period. CONCLUSION: There has been a decrease in the number of patients admitted for urgent, potentially surgical, abdominal pathology during the period of the COVID-19 epidemic in our center.","Pérez-Rubio, Álvaro; Sebastián Tomás, Juan Carlos; Navarro-Martínez, Sergio; Gonzálvez Guardiola, Paula; Torrecillas Meroño, Daniel Guillermo; Domingo Del Pozo, Carlos",Cir.

277239,Impact of COVID-19 infection on in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer volume in central Tokyo,2020,"Hygiene measures were intensified when the COVID-19 pandemic began. Patient contacts were limited to a minimum. Visitors were either not allowed for a certain period or limited for the rest of the time. The hospital staff began to wear masks and gloves continuously. Clinical examinations and routine wound controls were also performed under intensified hygiene standards. These circumstances result in a limitation of direct physical interactions between the nursing staff, the physicians and the patients. We analyzed to what extent the intensification of hygiene measures affects the rate of surgical site infections (SSI) after neurosurgical procedures. The rate of SSI during the 6-month interval after the beginning of COVID-19 measures was compared with the SSI rate before. The numbers of the period before COVID-19 were analyzed as mean values resulting from the analysis of two separate time periods each consisting of 6 months. The spectrum of surgical procedures was compared. Patient-related risk factors for SSIs were noted. Microorganisms were analyzed. We focused on SSIs occurring at a maximum of 60 days after the primary surgery. Overall, in the two respective 6-month periods before COVID-19, a mean of 1379 patients was surgically treated in our institution. After the beginning of COVID-19 (starting from 04/2020) our surgical numbers dropped by 101, resulting in a total number of 1278 patients being operated after 03/2020 until 09/2020. The SSI rate was 3.6% (03/2019-09/2019, 50 SSIs) and 2.2% (09/2019-03/2020, 29 SSIs), resulting in a mean of 2.9% before COVID-19 began. After the beginning of COVID-19 hygiene measures, this rate dropped to 1.4% (16 SSIs) resembling a significant reduction (p=0.003). Risk factors for the development of SSI were present in 81.3% of all patients. Pre- and post-COVID-19 patient groups had similar baseline characteristics. The same holds true when comparing the percentage of cranial and spinal procedures pre- and post-COVID-19 (p=0.91). Comparing the numbers (p=0.28) and the species (p=0.85) of microorganisms (MO) causing SSI, we found a similar distribution. Despite equal demographics and characteristics of SSI, the rate of SSI dropped substantially. This argues for an effective reduction of postoperative SSI resulting from the implementation of strict hygiene measures being established after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore advocate continuing with strict and intensive hygiene measures in the future.","Chacón-Quesada, T; Rohde, V; von der Brelie, C",Neurosurg. rev,,176

Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Megan A; Powell, Anna M; Coleman, Jenell S; Keller, Jean M; Livingston, Alison; Anderson, Jean R",Am J Obstet Gynecol,,176

Here, we describe a case of a 59-year-old male with severe COVID-19 infection who developed severe encephalopathy, which persisted well after his acute infection had subsided and had begun to improve from his respiratory dysfunction. He was found to have diffuse leukoencephalopathy with concomitant diffusion restriction on MR imaging. This case represents a delayed onset of leukoencephalopathy secondary to hypoxia in a small but growing cohort of COVID-related leukoencephalopathy due to similarities in imaging features and lack of superior alternate diagnosis. Patient's clinical improvement suggests reversibility with likely pathology being demyelination rather than infarction.","Vines, Brannon L; Agnihotri, Shruti P",J. neurovirology,,176

280148,What's Important: Empathy for Leaders in the Time of COVID-19,2021,"Prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) has been an important aspect of Pharmacovigilance because of its impact in the pharma industry. The standard process of introduction of a new drug into a market involves a lot of clinical trials and tests. This is a tedious and time consuming process and also involves a lot of monetary resources. The faster approval of a drug helps the patients who are in need of the drug. The in silico prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions can help speed up the aforementioned process. The challenges involved are lack of negative data present and predicting ADR from just the chemical structure. Although many models are already available to predict ADR, most of the models use biological activities identifiers, chemical and physical properties in addition to chemical structures of the drugs. But for most of the new drugs to be tested, only chemical structures will be available. The performance of the existing models predicting ADR only using chemical structures is not efficient. Therefore, an efficient prediction of ADRs from just the chemical structure has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method involves a separate model for each ADR, making it a binary classification problem. This paper presents a novel CNN model called Drug Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to predict ADRs using chemical structures of the drugs. The performance is measured using the metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Specificity, F1 score, AUROC and MCC. The results obtained by the proposed DCNN model outperform the competing models on the SIDER4.1 database in terms of all the metrics. A case study has been performed on a COVID-19 recommended drugs, where the proposed model predicted the ADRs that are well aligned with the observations made by medical professionals using conventional methods.","Mantripragada, Anjani Sankar; Teja, Sai Phani; Katasani, Rohith Reddy; Joshi, Pratik; V, Masilamani; Ramesh, Raj",J Bioinform Comput Biol,,176
280244,GUEST EDITORIAL: The impact of Covid-19 on clinical practice hours in pre-licensure registered nurse programs,2020,"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has brought healthcare workers in general and nurses in particular into the limelight as never before. It is important to study the intensity of the impact of this pandemic on the profession. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the occupational satisfaction during the pandemic of Covid-19 among the nurses in Israel, to shed light on conditions of work and to identify factors associated with low occupational satisfaction. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 130 Israeli nurses. Minnesota Satisfaction and Measure of Job Satisfaction questionnaire with 28 items was used to assess occupational satisfaction. RESULTS: In the multivariable model, nurses working in the community had higher occupational satisfaction than those working in hospitals (ß = 0.24, p = .032); nurses who took care of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 had significantly lower occupational satisfaction than others (ß = -0.48, p = .009). Most of the sample reported lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurses who experienced lack of PPE reported lower occupational satisfaction than those who did not (3.4 vs. 3.8, p = .039). Occupational satisfaction was mainly based on the component, built by the intrinsic characteristics of the occupation related to the personal accomplishment. Most of nurses had to increase their workload as a result of staff shortages, but the elevation of the workload was not associated with lower occupational satisfaction. CONCLUSION: Even under the circumstances of the pandemic, the most important nurses` occupational values are worthwhile accomplishments, importance of professional challenge, diversity and interest in the job, personal growth and development and independence in their practice.","Savitsky, Bella; Radomislensky, Irina; Hendel, Tova",Appl Nurs Res,,176
280349,Japan's Drug Regulation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons From a Case Study of Favipiravir,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral loads change rapidly following symptom onset, so to assess antivirals it is important to understand the natural history and patient factors influencing this. We undertook an individual patient-level meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in humans to describe viral dynamics and estimate the effects of antivirals used to date. This systematic review identified case reports, case series, and clinical trial data from publications between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH) regression model of time to viral clearance was fitted to respiratory and stool samples. A simplified four parameter nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) model was fitted to viral load trajectories in all sampling sites and covariate modeling of respiratory viral dynamics was performed to quantify time-dependent drug effects. Patient-level data from 645 individuals (age 1 month to 100 years) with 6,316 viral loads were extracted. Model-based simulations of viral load trajectories in samples from the upper and lower respiratory tract, stool, blood, urine, ocular secretions, and breast milk were generated. Cox-PH modeling showed longer time to viral clearance in older patients, men, and those with more severe disease. Remdesivir was associated with faster viral clearance (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 9.19, P < 0.001), as well as interferon, particularly when combined with ribavirin (AHR = 2.2, P = 0.015; AHR = 6.04, P = 0.006). Combination therapy should be further investigated. A viral dynamic dataset and NLME model for designing and analyzing antiviral trials has been established.","Gastine, Silke; Pang, Juanita; Boshier, Florencia A T; Carter, Simon J; Lonsdale, Dagan O; Cortina-Borja, Mario; Hung, Ivan F N; Breuer, Judy; Kloprogge, Frank; Standing, Joseph F",Clin. pharmacol. ther,,176

280692,Die Covid-19-Pandemie: ein massiver Stress-Test für uns alle,2020,"BACKGROUND: As a result of the growing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for treating malignancy, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been increasingly reported. Higher body mass index (BMI) has been highlighted as a potential risk factor for the development of irAEs. However, there are no meta-analyses summarizing the association between BMI and irAEs in patients on ICI therapies. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane and grey literature were searched up to January 2020. Odds ratios (ORs) 95% and confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using the random-effects model. Heterogeneity test, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (number registration: CRD42020168790). RESULTS: Five studies (n = 1937) met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Being overweight or obese was associated with an increased odds of developing irAEs (OR 2.62, 95% CI 1.70-4.03, P &#8804; 0.00001, I2 = 53%). In subgroup analyses, higher BMI was associated with irAEs in patients using anti-CTLA-4 single agents or in combination with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.17-2.98, P = 0.009, I2 = 0%) and in patients using anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (OR 3.22, 95% CI 2.06-5.01, P = 0.00001, I2 = 32%) monotherapy. The increased odds of irAEs in patients with higher BMI was comparable (test for subgroup differences, P = 0.72, I2 = 0%) between studies with adjusted OR (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.44-3.38, P = 0.0003, I2 = 4%) and unadjusted OR (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.08-6.50, P = 0.03, I2 = 66%). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis provides evidence of a relationship between higher BMI (overweight-obesity) and increased risk of irAEs in patients on ICI therapies.

We also discuss potential strategies to mitigate these downsides. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and EuropePMC were searched (inception-18 May 2020), and clinical registries were searched via CENTRAL. We also did a forward-backward citation search of the included studies. INCLUSION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials and observational studies comparing face mask use to any active intervention or to control. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two author pairs independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. The primary outcomes were compliance, discomforts, harms and adverse events of wearing face masks. RESULTS: We screened 5471 articles, including 37 (40 references); 11 were meta-analysed. For mask wear adherence, 47% (95% CI 25% to 68%, p<0.0001), more people wore face masks in the face mask group compared with control; adherence was significantly higher (26%, 95% CI 8% to 46%, p<0.01) in the surgical/medical mask group than in N95/P2 group. The largest number of studies reported on the discomfort and irritation outcome (20 studies); fewest reported on the misuse of masks, and none reported on mask contamination or risk compensation behaviour. Risk of bias was generally high for blinding of participants and personnel and low for attrition and reporting biases. CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient data to quantify all of the adverse effects that might reduce the acceptability, adherence and effectiveness of face masks. New research on face masks should assess and report the harms and downsides.

281318,Surgery in times of COVID-19-recommendations for hospital and patient management,2020,"There has been a rise in non-communicable diseases (NCD) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driven by westernization, urbanization and unhealthy lifestyles. The prevalence of NCDs and their risk factors vary considerably in SSA between countries and the various sub-populations. A study documented the prevalence of stroke ranging from 0.07 to 0.3%, diabetes mellitus from 0 to 16%, hypertension from 6 to 48%, obesity from 0.4 to 43%, and current smoking from 0.4 to 71%. The numbers of these NCD cases are predicted to rise over the next decade. However, in the context of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, with the rising cases, lockdowns and deaths recorded worldwide, many people living with NCDs may find accessing care more difficult. The majority of the available resources on the subcontinent have been diverted to focus on the ongoing pandemic. This has caused interruptions in care, complication management, drug pick-up alongside the almost neglected silent NCD epidemic, with major consequences for the health system post the COVID-19 era. We explore the issues surrounding the continuity of care and offer some solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa.","Owopetu, Oluwatomi; Fasehun, Luther-King; Abakporo, Uzoma",Glob Health Promot,,176

Several dental care facilities in affected countries have been completely closed or have been only providing minimal treatment for emergency cases. However, several facilities in some affected countries are still providing regular dental treatment. This can in part be a result of the lack of universal protocol or guidelines regulating the dental care provision during such a pandemic. This lack of guidelines can on one hand increase the nosocomial COVID-19 spread through dental health care facilities, and on the other hand deprive patients' in need of the required urgent dental care. Moreover, ceasing dental care provision during such a period will incense the burden on hospitals emergency departments already struggle with the pandemic. This work aimed to develop guidelines for dental patients' management during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidelines for dental care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic were developed after considering the nature of COVID-19 pandemic, and were based on grouping the patients according to condition and need, and considering the procedures according to risk and benefit. It is hoped that the guidelines proposed in this work will help in the management of dental care around the world during and after this COVID-19 pandemic.","Alharbi, Ali; Alharbi, Saad; Alqaidi, Shahad",,,176

282077,Implications of COVID-19 on urological laparoscopic surgery,2020,"Drug repositioning became the first choice for treating Covid-19 patients due to the urgent need to deal with the pandemic. Similarities in the hijacking mechanisms used by SARS-CoV-2 and several type of cancer, suggest the repurposing of cancer drugs to treat Covid-19. CK2 kinase antagonists have been proposed for the treatment of cancer. A recent study in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus found a significant CK2 kinase activity, and the use of a CK2 inhibitor showed antiviral responses. CIGB-300, originally designed as an anticancer peptide, is an antagonist of CK2 kinase activity that binds to CK2 phospho-acceptor sites. Recent preliminary results show an antiviral activity of CIGB-300 versus a surrogate model of coronavirus. Here we present a computational biology study that provides evidences at the molecular level of how CIGB-300 might interfere with SARS-CoV-2 life cycle inside infected human cells. First, from SARS-CoV studies, we infer the potential incidence of CIGB-300 in SARS-CoV-2 interference on immune response. Next, from the analysis of multiple Omics data, we propose the action of CIGB-300 since early stage of viral infections perturbing the virus hijacking of RNA splicing machinery. It was also predicted the interference of CIGB-300 in virus-host interactions responsible for the high infectivity and the particular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, we provide evidences of CIGB-300 attenuation of phenotypes related to muscle, bleeding, coagulation and respiratory disorders.","Miranda, Jamilet; Bringas, Ricardo; de-Cossio, Jorge Fernández; Perera, Yasser",,,176

282367,Estimation of the basic reproduction number (R0) of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: The cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been covered insufficiently in the literature. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients admitted to the study hospital with confirmed COVID-19 who experienced various skin manifestations during hospitalization or in the convalescence period, were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients with COVID-19, admitted to the study hospital between 23 March and 12 September 2020, had intra-infectious rash or lesions of cutaneous vasculitis during convalescence. The most common cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 were erythematous and erythematous papular rash. Twenty-seven of the 39 patients had anosmia (69.2%), 26 patients had ageusia (66.7%), 34 patients had pneumonia (87.2%) and 24 patients had intra-infectious enterocolitis (61.5%). Skin biopsies were rarely performed in these patients. This article reports the results of biopsies performed in two patients, showing histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in erythematous rash and erythema multiforme-like lesions. Both skin biopsies revealed early fibrous remodelling of the dermis, suggesting similarity with changes that occur in the lungs and other tissues in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between skin lesions and anosmia, ageusia and enteritis in patients with COVID-19 do not seem to be accidental, but are associated with a similar response to ACE2 receptor expression in these tissues.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Feiereisz, Alin Iulian; Oprinca, George; Dobritoiu, Simona; Rotaru, Maria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Iancu, Gabriela Mariana",Int J Infect Dis,,176
282515,Retrospective Analysis of Controversial Subtopics on COVID-19 in Japan,2021-06-17,"INTRODUCTION: In 2009, the Institute of Medicine published guidelines for implementation of Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) at the state level in the United States (US). Based in part on the then concern for H1N1 pandemic, there was a recognized need for additional planning at the state level to maintain health system preparedness and conventional care standards when available resources become scarce. Despite the availability of this framework, in the years since and despite repeated large-scale domestic events, implementation remains mixed. PROBLEM: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rejuvenates concern for how health systems can maintain quality care when faced with unrelenting burden. This study seeks to outline which states in the US have developed CSC and which areas of care have thus far been addressed. METHODS: An online search was conducted for all 50 states in 2015 and again in 2020. For states without CSC plans online, state officials were contacted by email and phone. Public protocols were reviewed to assess for operational implementation capabilities, specifically highlighting guidance on ventilator use, burn management, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, pediatric standards, and reliance on influenza planning. RESULTS: Thirty-six states in the US were actively developing (17) or had already developed (19) official CSC guidance. Fourteen states had no publicly acknowledged effort. Eleven of the 17 public plans had updated within five years, with a majority addressing ventilator usage (16/17), influenza planning (14/17), and pediatric care (15/17), but substantially fewer addressing care for burn patients (9/17). CONCLUSION: Many states lacked publicly available guidance on maintaining standards of care during disasters, and many states with specific care guidelines had not sufficiently addressed the full spectrum of hazard to which their health care systems remain vulnerable.","Margus, Colton; Sarin, Ritu R; Molloy, Michael; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehosp Disaster Med,,176

An increasing body of evidence has supported central nervous system involvement. METHODS: We conducted a review of the reported data for studies concerning COVID-19 pathophysiology, neurological manifestations, and neuroscience provider recommendations and guidelines. RESULTS: Central nervous system manifestations range from vague nonfocal complaints to severe neurological impairment associated with encephalitis. It is unclear whether the neurological dysfunction results from direct viral injury or systemic disease. The virus could affect brainstem pathways that lead to indirect respiratory dysfunction, in addition to direct pulmonary injury. Necessary adaptations in patient management, triage, and diagnosis are evolving in light of the ongoing scientific and clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: The present review has consolidated the current body of data regarding the neurological impact of coronaviruses, discussed the reported neurological manifestations of COVID-19, and highlighted the recommendations for patient management. Specific recommendations pertaining to clinical practice for neurologists and neurosurgeons have also been provided.","Werner, Cassidy; Scullen, Tyler; Mathkour, Mansour; Zeoli, Tyler; Beighley, Adam; Kilgore, Mitchell D; Carr, Christopher; Zweifler, Richard M; Aysenne, Aimee; Maulucci, Christopher M; Dumont, Aaron S; Bui, Cuong J; Keen, Joseph R",World Neurosurg,,176

Amid this situation, investigational agents are being used, including chloroquine. We report here the clinical features and therapeutic course of the first reported patient with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia that recovered in Colombia, after the use of chloroquine and clarithromycin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old male, returning from Spain, presented with complaints of fever, and cough, and class-II obesity, being hospitalized. The respiratory viruses and bacteria tested by FilmArray® PCR were negative. Two days later, clarithromycin was started because the patient was suspected as community-acquired pneumonia. At the third day, the rRT-PCR confirmed the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A day later, chloroquine was started because of that. His chest computed tomography was performed and showed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities with consolidation, which suggested viral pneumonia as a differential diagnosis. Progressively his clinical condition improved and at day 9, patient rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 became negative. The patient was discharged and isolated at home per 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient improved significantly. This and other COVID-19 cases are urgently demanding results from clinical trials that support evidence-based therapeutical approaches to this pandemic and the clinical management of patients, especially those at critical care.","Millán-Oñate, José; Millan, William; Mendoza, Luis Alfonso; Sánchez, Carlos Guillermo; Fernandez-Suarez, Hugo; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,,176

283844,Reduced Sleep in the Week Prior to Diagnosis of COVID-19 is Associated with the Severity of COVID-19,2020,"Importance: Maternally derived antibodies are a key element of neonatal immunity. Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies. Objective: To assess the association between maternal and neonatal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody concentrations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study took place at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A total of 1714 women delivered at the study site between April 9 and August 8, 2020. Maternal and cord blood sera were available for antibody measurement for 1471 mother/newborn dyads. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: IgG and IgM antibodies to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data. Results: The study cohort consisted of 1714 parturient women, with median (interquartile range) age of 32 (28-35) years, of whom 450 (26.3%) identified as Black/non-Hispanic, 879 (51.3%) as White/non-Hispanic, 203 (11.8%) as Hispanic, 126 (7.3%) as Asian, and 56 (3.3%) as other race/ethnicity. Among 1471 mother/newborn dyads for which matched sera were available, SARS-CoV-2 IgG and/or IgM antibodies were detected in 83 of 1471 women (6%; 95% CI, 5%-7%) at the time of delivery, and IgG was detected in cord blood from 72 of 83 newborns (87%; 95% CI, 78%-93%). IgM was not detected in any cord blood specimen, and antibodies were not detected in any infant born to a seronegative mother. Eleven infants born to seropositive mothers were seronegative: 5 of 11 (45%) were born to mothers with IgM antibody only, and 6 of 11 (55%) were born to mothers with significantly lower IgG concentrations compared with those found among mothers of seropositive infants. Cord blood IgG concentrations were positively correlated with maternal IgG concentrations (r = 0.886; P < .001). Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. Transfer ratios increased with increasing time between onset of maternal infection and delivery. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy. Cord blood antibody concentrations correlated with maternal antibody concentrations and with duration between onset of infection and delivery. Our findings demonstrate the potential for maternally derived SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies to provide neonatal protection from coronavirus disease 2019.","Flannery, Dustin D; Gouma, Sigrid; Dhudasia, Miren B; Mukhopadhyay, Sagori; Pfeifer, Madeline R; Woodford, Emily C; Triebwasser, Jourdan E; Gerber, Jeffrey S; Morris, Jeffrey S; Weirick, Madison E; McAllister, Christopher M; Bolton, Marcus J; Arevalo, Claudia P; Anderson, Elizabeth M; Goodwin, Eileen C; Hensley, Scott E; Puopolo, Karen M",JAMA pediatr.

283845,Reduced Sleep in the Week Prior to Diagnosis of COVID-19 is Associated with the Severity of COVID-19,2020,"The pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear, and its symptoms vary in different patients. Initial reports of COVID-19 concentrated on pulmonary issues, but with time, additional features such as hyposmia/anosmia, dysgeusia, and skin lesions were added to the list of COVID-19 symptoms. There have been an increasing number of reports on oral cavity lesions in individuals with COVID-19, which might be relevant considering that this location is one of the first sites coming into contact with the virus and that it contains the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. We hereby aim to familiarize practicing head and neck clinicians with the range of oral lesions reported in COVID-19 patients and to critically appraise the most recent data on the role of SARS-CoV-2 in these lesions. We also discuss the ongoing debate on the direct/indirect association of oral symptoms with the disease. COVID-19 cases with simultaneous oral symptoms were extracted from the literature, and articles discussing the role of SARS-CoV-2 in oral lesions were compiled and methodically analyzed. We found approximately 95 COVID-19 patients with a wide range of oral lesions. Based on current evidence, the exact role of SARS-CoV-2 in the development of oral lesions remains unclear. Oral examination of patients is needed to provide adequate cases for analysis to clarify unknown problems related to COVID-19. There is evidence to support both the direct and indirect roles of SARS-CoV-2 in the development of oral lesions. Awareness of the possibility of oral manifestations in COVID-19 is important to clarify the range of disease signs and symptoms.","Etemad-Moghadam, S.; Alaeddini, M.",Int J Dent,,176

The objective of this study is to describe the role of Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's national emergency prehospital medical organization, in the pre-exposure period, before widespread governmental action. These efforts were based on (1) phone diagnosis, dispatch, and transport; and (2) border management checkpoints. METHODS: This is a descriptive study of MDA's role in pandemic response during the pre-exposure period. Medical emergency telephone calls from either individuals or medical sources were identified by a dispatcher as ""suspected COVID-19"" based on symptoms and travel exposure. Data were also collected for travelers approaching the MDA border checkpoint at Ben-Gurion International Airport. RESULTS: The total number of protected transports during this time was 121. Of these, 44 (36.3%) were referred by medical sources, and 77 (63.7%) were identified as ""suspected COVID-19"" by dispatchers. The checkpoint was accessed by 156 travelers: 87 were sent to home-quarantine; 12 were transported to the hospital; 18 were refused entry; and 39 required no further action. CONCLUSION: EMS can work effectively in the pre-exposure period through instructing home quarantine, providing protected transport, and staffing border control checkpoints.","Jaffe, Eli; Sonkin, Roman; Podolsky, Timna; Alpert, Evan Avraham; Siman-Tov, Maya",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,176

Ghana joined thinternational community by confirming first two COVID-19 cases on March 12, 2020. The study aimed to assess the public knowledge, risk perceptioand preparedness to respond the COVID-19 in the early stage of the outbreak in Ghana.Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted to collect information from Ghanaian during the early stage of the outbreak from 12th to 20th March 2020. Electronic based questionnaire was developed to collected information on the public knowledge, risk perceptions and preparedness to respond the COVID-19. All people who were aged 18 years and over were invited to participate in the study.Results: a total of 350 participants were recruited into the analysis; 56% were males, with the majority of the study population aged between 18-30 years (61.4%), single (68.9%) and attained tertiary education (95.1%). Regarding COVID-19, 62.7% had “good” knowledge about the outbreak, 68.3% had a high risk of contracting the COVID-19 infection and 81.4% had a moderate preparedness skill to prevent and control the disease. Internet (77.1%) was the major sources of information.

286605,Considerations and strategies for restarting elective spine surgery in the midst of a pandemic of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: ESPEN guidelines advocate that energy needs of critically ill patients with COVID 19 should be assessed using indirect calorimetry, if safely available. This study described energy needs of intubated patients with COVID-19 and explores whether neuromuscular blockade administration (NMBAs) is associated with altered energy expenditure. METHODS: Resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory exchange rate (RER) evaluated among critically ill intubated COVID-19 patients until 28th day of intensive care unit stay (ICU-S) by indirect calorimetry. Paralysed patients were defined as those with drug induced paralysis using cicatracurium, for at least 3 days during their ICU-S. RESULTS: 34 adult COVID 19 patients (59.8% male, 35.2% obese) requiring mechanical ventilation were assessed prospectively. REE measurements suggest a gradual increase of energy needs post 3rd day of ICU-S in both patients without obesity (non ob) ((from 17.8 kcal/kgr up to 29.3 kcal/kgr actual body weight (AcBW) during 28th day of ICU-S, p = 0.011)) and patients with obesity (ob) ((from 18.1 kcal/kgr up to 30.1 kcal/kgr adjusted body weight (AjBW) during 28th day of ICU-S, p = 0.021)). NMBAs use was accompanied by a significant drop in REE, especially during first 7 days of hospitalization, both in non ob (22.9 vs 17.9 kcal/kgr AcBW, p = 0.014) and ob patients (22.5 vs 19.5 kcal/kgr ABW, p = 0.027). CONCLUSION: We identified the energy needs of COVID-19 intubated patients and highlighted a significant increase beyond the 1st week in the ICU.

287187,Covid-19 and cardiovascular comorbidities,2020,"Pollution of industry-adjacent surface water bodies become a major environmental concern in Bangladesh recently. Therefore, this study aimed to elaborate assessment of physico-chemical characteristics of the Dhaleshwari River (the adjacent river of newly shifted tannery industrial park) and also the discharged effluent from the central effluent treatment plant (CETP) considering both seasonal and spatial variations. Among the examined 30 water quality parameters (including 11 heavy metals), only TDS, Cl-, NO3-N, EC, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Ni met the standards for discharged wastewater from industrial units into inland surface water set by Bangladesh government. This indicated that the CETP is not fully and/or effectively functioning. Out of 19 parameters (excluding heavy metal), 14 parameters exceeded the Bangladesh standard for drinking water quality either spatially or seasonally. The river water quality indicated slowly biodegradable capacity with algal bloom risk. The concentrations of the studied heavy metals in the river water followed a decreasing order of Ca > K > Mg > Na > Fe > Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Zn > Cd, and Cr concentration in the winter season exceeded the standard values. The concentrations of other heavy metals met the quality standard that indicated still the river is capable to self-purify. Furthermore, strong (p < 0.01) and significant (p < 0.05) correlation were observed among the quality parameters in river water. This study suggested that the efficiency of the existing CETP needs to be enhanced, and the proper operation and maintenance are required to meet the desired discharge standard quality. Also, all the unauthorized wastewater outfalls from tanneries must be closed to save the Dhaleshwari River.","Hasan, Md Mahmudul; Ahmed, Md Shakil; Adnan, Raofur",Environ Monit Assess,,176

287958,Covid-19: Doctors are told not to perform CPR on patients in cardiac arrest,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a serious hazard to global health. Apart from attacking respiratory system, it can induce multiorgan dysfunction, including cardiovascular system, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and immune system. However, there are few reviews focusing on summary and comparison of diagnostic methods and complications induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which places a significant limit on the effective management. AREAS COVERED: This review is a blend of evidence obtained by literature retrieval from PubMed, clinical experience, and the authors' opinions. We searched PubMed using the terms 'COVID-19 & diagnosis' and 'COVID-19 & complications' and selected the most relevant articles. Here we summarize the diagnostic methods that are available in clinic and discuss their different characters. Furthermore, the review offers an insight into the symptoms, incidence, and clinical strategies of complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. EXPERT OPINION: COVID-19 has been a global pandemic, which requires rapid response. The comparison between different characters of the diagnostic methods and the summary of the symptoms, incidence, and clinical strategies of complications given in this review are not only significant for the optimal use of diagnostic methods, but also beneficial for the prevention and management of complications.","Ai, Leilei; Jiang, Liyu; Xu, Zhifei; Yan, Hao; Luo, Peihua; He, Qiaojun",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,,176
288015,Adolescent and Young Adult ME/CFS After Confirmed or Probable COVID-19,2021,"The accurate forecasting of infectious epidemic diseases such as influenza is a crucial task undertaken by medical institutions. Although numerous flu forecasting methods and models based mainly on historical flu activity data and online user-generated contents have been proposed in previous studies, no flu forecasting model targeting multiple countries using two types of data exists at present. Our paper leverages multi-task learning to tackle the challenge of building one flu forecasting model targeting multiple countries; each country as each task. Also, to develop the flu prediction model with higher performance, we solved two issues; finding suitable search queries, which are part of the user-generated contents, and how to leverage search queries efficiently in the model creation. For the first issue, we propose the transfer approaches from English to other languages. For the second issue, we propose a novel flu forecasting model that takes advantage of search queries using an attention mechanism and extend the model to a multi-task model for multiple countries' flu forecasts. Experiments on forecasting flu epidemics in five countries demonstrate that our model significantly improved the performance by leveraging the search queries and multi-task learning compared to the baselines.","Murayama, Taichi; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01760v2.pdf,176

However, there is a lack of evidence on the impact of the pandemic on functional prognosis. The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients hospitalised due to acute ischaemic stroke in Aragon (Spain). MATERIL AND METHODS: We reviewed the data of all patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke to any hospital in our regional healthcare system between 30 December 2019 and 3 May 2020. We compared modified Rankin Scale scores and mortality at 3 months in patients hospitalised before and after the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 318 patients with acute ischaemic stroke met our inclusion criteria. No differences were observed between periods in global or specific characteristics, with the exception of a higher proportion of patients older than 80 years during the first period (42.2% vs. 29.0%, P=.028). In the comparative analysis, we found no significant differences in mortality (12.3 vs. 7.9, P=.465) or in the proportion of patients with modified Rankin Scale scores &#8804; 2 (57.7% vs. 57.1%, P=.425) at 3 months. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyse the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the 3-month functional outcomes of patients with ischaemic stroke. In our region, there has been no increase in rates of mortality or disability at 3 months in patients admitted due to ischaemic stroke during the pandemic.","Tejada Meza, H; Lambea Gil, Á; Villar Yus, C; Pérez Lázaro, C; Navarro Pérez, M P; Campello Morer, I; Giménez Muñoz, Á; Artal Roy, J; Alberti González, O; Hernando Quintana, N; Ruiz Palomino, P; Crespo Burillo, J A; García Arguedas, C; Ballester Marco, L; Palacin Larroy, M; Seral Moral, M; Marta Moreno, J","Neurologia (Barc., Ed. impr.)",,176
288156,India's COVID-19 Testing Strategy: Why Pediatric Hospitals Need to Focus More on ILI than SARI?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis, tests with high sensitivity and specificity are crucial for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. There is an urgent need for low-cost rapid antigen COVID-19 test with a good diagnostic performance. Although various antigen rapid detection tests are widely available, strong evidence of their usefulness in clinical practice are still limited. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate clinical performance of STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea). METHODS: The performance of the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen was evaluated in comparison to RT-qPCR results in 120 symptomatic patients (median age 49, IQR 36-70) who presented to health care facility in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia. RESULTS: Twenty five out of 120 samples have been tested positive using STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test, and all of them were also positive on RT-qPCR. Overall, the STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test showed sensitivity of 58.1% (95% CI 42.1-73.0) but it was higher in the early days of disease, when the highest viral loads were detected. During the first five days after the symptom onset, the sensitivity ranged from 66.7% to 100% and the pooled accuracy and Kappa values were high (0.92 and 0.852). CONCLUSIONS: A strong agreement between performance of STANDARD Q COVID-19 Ag Test and RT-qPCR was observed during the first five days of illness, suggesting that this rapid antigenic test can be very useful for COVID-19 diagnosis in the early phase of disease.","Ristic, Mioljub; Nikolic, Natasa; Cabarkapa, Velibor; Turkulov, Vesna; Petrovic, Vladimir",PLoS One,,176

Measures imposed by governments and health authorities such as confinement and lockdown have had important consequences, including mental health problems, economic crisis, and social isolation. Combined with newly acquired habits such as hand washing, sanitization, and face masks, these have all directly and indirectly led to reduced immunity. Such effects on the immune system not only impact the epidemiological profile with respect to COVID-19 and other infectious diseases but also limit the efficacy of the ongoing anti-COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Therefore, there is a need to review these approaches and optimize measures towards better population immunity, which is much needed during such an epidemic.","Ghanemi, Abdelaziz Yoshioka Mayumi St-Amand Jonny",Biology,,176

One-size-fits-all assessments fail to capture the nuance of different BestPractice Advisory (BPA) formats. To demonstrate a tailored evaluation methodology, we assessed a BPA after implementation of Storyboard for changes in alert fatigue, behavior influence, and task completion; (2) Methods: Data from 19 weeks before and after implementation were used to evaluate differences in each domain. Individual clinics were evaluated for task completion and compared for changes pre- and post-redesign; (3) Results: The change in format was correlated with an increase in alert fatigue, a decrease in erroneous free text answers, and worsened task completion at a system level. At a local level, however, 14% of clinics had improved task completion; (4) Conclusions: While the change in BPA format was correlated with decreased performance, the changes may have been driven primarily by the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework and metrics proposed can be used in future studies to assess the impact of new CDS formats. Although the changes in this study seemed undesirable in aggregate, some positive changes were observed at the level of individual clinics.

To what extent has leaders’ reliance on scientific advice shaped government responses to the COVID-19 outbreak? We argue that leaders who tend to orient themselves on expert advice realized the extent of the crisis earlier. Consequently, these governments would adopt containment measures relatively quickly, despite the high uncertainty they faced. Over time, differences in government responses based on the use of science would dissipate due to herding effects. We test our argument on data combining 163 government responses to the pandemic with national- and individual-level characteristics. Consistent with our argument, we find that countries governed by politicians with a stronger technocratic mentality, approximated by holding a PhD, adopted restrictive containment measures faster in the early, but not in the later, stages of the crisis. This importance of expert-based leadership plausibly extends to other large-scale societal crises.

METHODS: 119 serum samples were randomly selected by convenience and distributed in the groups: (1) Group with SARS-CoV-2 infection [n=82; RT-qPCR positive (definite, n=70), and probable (n=12)]; (2) other diseases [n= 27; other viruses identified (n=8), SARS of other etiologies (n=19)]; (3) healthy control group (n=10). LFA essays of four manufacturers were compared: MedTest Coronavírus (COVID-19) IgG/IgM (MedLevensohn, Brazil); COVID-19 IgG/IgM ECO Test (Ecodiagnóstica, Brazil); Camtech COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test Kit (Camtech Diagnostics Pte Ltd, Singapore); and one Step COVID-19 Test for total antibodies (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech Co, China). RESULTS: The four tests studied showed high diagnostic performance characteristics for the diagnoses of definite or probable SARS-CoV-2 infection. The best measures were for the Wondfo test: sensitivity (86.59%; 95%CI, 77.26-93.11%); specificity (100%; 90.51-100%); DOR (257; 60-1008); LR+ (33.43; 4.82-231.85); LR- (0.13; 0.08 - 0.23); accuracy (90.76%; 84.06- 95.29%); Matthews Correlation coefficient (MCC) 0.82.

However, research aiming to examine public willingness to wear (WTW) face masks in Pakistan are scarce. The current research aims to overcome this research void and contributes by expanding the theoretical mechanism of theory of planned behavior (TPB) to include three novel dimensions (risk perceptions of the pandemic, perceived benefits of face masks, and unavailability of face masks) to comprehensively analyze the factors that motivate people to, or inhibit people from, wearing face masks. The study is based on an inclusive questionnaire survey of a sample of 738 respondents in the provincial capitals of Pakistan, namely, Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, Gilgit, and Quetta. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to analyze the proposed hypotheses. The results show that attitude, social norms, risk perceptions of the pandemic, and perceived benefits of face masks are the major influencing factors that positively affect public WTW face masks, whereas the cost of face masks and unavailability of face masks tend to have opposite effects. The results emphasize the need to enhance risk perceptions by publicizing the deadly effects of COVID-19 on the environment and society, ensure the availability of face masks at an affordable price, and make integrated and coherent efforts to highlight the benefits that face masks offer.","Irfan, Muhammad; Akhtar, Nadeem; Ahmad, Munir; Shahzad, Farrukh; Elavarasan, Rajvikram Madurai; Wu, Haitao; Yang, Chuxiao",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,176

This study aims to assess the effect of unintended delays in anti-VEGF treatment during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective case series identified patients receiving regularly scheduled anti-VEGF intravitreal injections based on current procedural terminology (CPT) code at two practices in Minnesota. Diagnoses were limited to nAMD, diabetic macular edema (DME), proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and RVO. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they maintained or delayed their follow-up visit by more than two weeks beyond the recommended treatment interval during the COVID-19 lockdown. The 'COVID-19 lockdown' was defined as the period after March, 28th, 2020, when a lockdown was declared in Minnesota. We then compared the visual acuity and structural changes to the retina using ocular coherence tomography (OCT) to assess whether delayed treatment resulted in worse visual outcomes.

294090,Phenome-wide and eQTL Associations of COVID-19 Genetic Risk Loci,2021,"Based on an ecological perspective on the COVID-19 lockdown experience, this study describes psychological responses among Italian university students. Our study considers three zones of the country that have differed in the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this research explores whether differences in pandemic conditions can account for their divergent psychological outcomes. The participants were 792 university students from seven different Italian universities. Students were asked to express their emotions and describe meaningful events during the lockdown in writing. Based on the grounded theory approach, this study conducted qualitative data analysis using ATLAS.ti 8.0. The core emerged categories are emotions, emotional moods and states of mind, coping strategies, and resilience. The results describing these emergent factors in relation to environmental variables highlight differences in the feeling of anxiety among individuals: anxiety was more self-focused in zones that were more affected by the lockdown, while such anxiety was more related to family and friends in less-affected zones. In addition to identifying the negative repercussions that this emergency has had, this study describes some positive outcomes, such as the elaboration of new personal perspectives that help foster individual growth and allow individuals to gain new awareness of themselves and others. The confinement due to the COVID-19 emergency measures has been a very unique experience for people, and further research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the different coping responses activated by participants during and after the lockdown. © 2021, University of Salento.

Appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks, protective gowns, face shields/safety goggles, and disposable gloves, together with pertinent safety training, was provided for laboratory work. Proper disinfection and good hand hygiene practices could minimize the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection at work. All residual risk levels of the potential hazards identified were within the acceptable level. Contamination by gloved hands was considered as a major exposure route for SARS-CoV-2 when compared with eye protection equipment.

294982,Validation of the Telephone-Based Application of the ABILHAND for Assessment of Manual Ability After Stroke,2020,"In this article we propose a compartmental model for the dynamics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to contain the epidemic: social distancing, isolation of a portion of the population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.","Aronna, M S; Guglielmi, R; Moschen, L M",Epidemics,,176

297325,The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Obesity Undergoing Bariatric Care,2021,"Background: COVID-19 is disrupting health services for mothers and newborns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Preterm newborns are particularly vulnerable. We undertook analyses of the benefits of kangaroo mother care (KMC) on survival among neonates weighing &#8804;2000 g compared with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquired from infected mothers/caregivers. Methods: We modelled two scenarios over 12 months. Scenario 1 compared the survival benefits of KMC with universal coverage (99%) and mortality risk due to COVID-19. Scenario 2 estimated incremental deaths from reduced coverage and complete disruption of KMC. Projections were based on the most recent data for 127 LMICs (~90% of global births), with results aggregated into five regions. Findings: Our worst-case scenario (100% transmission) could result in 1,950 neonatal deaths from COVID-19. Conversely, 125,680 neonatal lives could be saved with universal KMC coverage. Hence, the benefit of KMC is 65-fold higher than the mortality risk of COVID-19. If recent evidence of 10% transmission was applied, the ratio would be 630-fold. We estimated a 50% reduction in KMC coverage could result in 12,570 incremental deaths and full disruption could result in 25,140 incremental deaths, representing a 2·3-4·6% increase in neonatal mortality across the 127 countries. Interpretation: The survival benefit of KMC far outweighs the small risk of death due to COVID-19. Preterm newborns are at risk, especially in LMICs where the consequences of disruptions are substantial. Policymakers and healthcare professionals need to protect services and ensure clearer messaging to keep mothers and newborns together, even if the mother is SARS-CoV-2-positive.

297563,Recognizing the Clinical Sequelae of COVID-19 in Adults: COVID-19 Long-Haulers,2021,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the basis of treatments and diagnostics for pathogens and other biological phenomena. We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs' flexibility and how this flexibility affects the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the antigen-binding fragments is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we show that rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices, which are critical for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.","Hodge, Curtis D; Rosenberg, Daniel J; Grob, Patricia; Wilamowski, Mateusz; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Hura, Greg L; Hammel, Michal",MAbs,,176

Consequently, in addition to the monitoring performed by fixed microbalance instruments installed under legal obligation, we are proposing to deploy the Pollutrack network of mobile sensors within the city of Paris (France). The measurements are performed by mobile aerosol counters mounted on the roof of cars, providing a constant series of readings in the 0.3–10 µm size range that are then aggregated to identify areas of mass concentrations of pollution. The performance of the Pollutrack sensors has been established in ambient air in comparison with the microbalance measurement devices and with the Light Optical Aerosols Counter (LOAC) aerosol counter. A measurement uncertainty of about 5 µg. m−3 is obtained with absolute values from the Pollutrack measurements made at a given location. Instead of the current modelizations based on very few PM2.5 values, maps built from real measurements with a spatial resolution down to 100 m can now be produced each day for Paris, and potentially for specific times of the day, thanks to the high number of measurements achievable with the Pollutrack system (over 70,000 on weekdays). Interestingly, the global trend of PM2.5 content shows several significant pollution events in 2020 despite the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown. The Pollutrack pollution maps recorded during different PM2.5 pollution conditions in the city frequently identified a strong spatial heterogeneity where the North and the East of Paris were more polluted than the west. These “hot spots” could be due to the city topology and its sensitivity to wind direction and intensity. These high-resolution maps will be crucial in creating evidence for the relevant authorities to respond appropriately to local sources of pollution and to improve the understanding of transportation of urban PM. © 2021 by the authors.

The study aimed to identify the regions of Brazil with higher specific mortality rates from these comorbidities and the regions with the greatest shortage of ICU beds and mechanical ventilators. A cross-sectional ecological study was performed in which the units of analysis were the country's Health Regions. Data were obtained from Brazilian Health Informatics Department - DATASUS (National Registry of Healthcare Establishments - 2019, Mortality Information Systems - 2017, and Population Projections - 2017). We calculated the disease group-specific mortality rates for hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases and the rates of total ICU beds, private ICU beds, ICU beds in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), and ventilators in the SUS, per 100,000 inhabitants. The mortality profile was determined by latent profiles analysis, and the cluster analysis of ICU beds and ventilators used the spatial scan method. Kernel maps were constructed for the data's visualization. Level of significance was set at 5%. Four latent mortality profiles were observed. The Health Regions with the highest mean mortality rates were located in regions with shortages of ICU beds and ventilators, especially in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil.

300667,The way forward after COVID-19 vaccination: Vaccine passports with blockchain to protect personal privacy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disorder caused by inactivation of ADAMTS13. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Previous studies have produced conflicting data regarding seasonal association of TTP diagnoses. This study evaluated the seasonal distribution of acute TTP in southern Louisiana. Additionally, this study timeline overlapped with the initiation of a new screening protocol for ADAMTS13 testing. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients receiving ADAMTS13 testing at Ochsner Medical Center from January 2010 to December 2017 was performed. TTP patient episodes were defined by ADAMTS13 activity <10%. Episodes were plotted according to season of presentation and a chi-square analysis was performed. Data of identified TTP patients was analyzed to evaluate for confounding variables. ADAMTS13 order volumes and results before and after screening protocol implementation were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two ADAMTS13 tests were ordered on 245 unique patients. Twenty-five patients had ADAMTS13 activity <10%. No significant differences in seasonal TTP case distribution were identified. Patients with confirmed TTP were younger and more likely to be Black or African American. A screening protocol did not decrease the number of annual ADAMTS13 test orders in our time frame, but was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the percentage of positive results. CONCLUSION: No significant seasonal distribution of TTP was identified in our population. This analysis provides previously unexamined regional information regarding this diagnosis. The number of tests ordered after the implementation of the screening protocol increased, corresponding with our facility's expanding reach.","Simenson, Victoria; Burton, Jeffrey; Del Toro, Alejandra; Alquist, Caroline Raasch",,,176

The COVID-19 pandemic presents a potential developmental immune challenge to the fetal brain, in the setting of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection with its attendant potential for cytokine production and, in severe cases, cytokine storming. There is currently no biomarker or model for in utero microglial priming and function that might aid in identifying the neonates and children most vulnerable to neurodevelopmental morbidity, as microglia remain inaccessible in fetal life and after birth. This study aimed to generate patient-derived microglial-like cell models unique to each neonate from reprogrammed umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells, adapting and extending a novel methodology previously validated for adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We demonstrate that umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells can be used to create microglial-like cell models morphologically and functionally similar to microglia observed in vivo. We illustrate the application of this approach by generating microglia from cells exposed and unexposed to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

302624,Telegenetics: Remote Counseling During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BackgroundThere have been recent reports of myocarditis (including myocarditis, pericarditis or myopericarditis) as a side-effect of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, particularly in young males. Less information is available regarding the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection itself. Such data would be helpful in developing a complete risk-benefit analysis for this population. MethodsA de-identified, limited data set was created from the TriNetX Research Network, aggregating electronic health records from 48 mostly large U.S. Healthcare Organizations (HCOs). Inclusion criteria were a first COVID-19 diagnosis during the April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 time period, with an outpatient visit 1 month to 2 years before, and another 6 months to 2 years before that. Analysis was stratified by sex and age (12-17, 12-15, 16-19). Patients were excluded for any prior cardiovascular condition. Primary outcome was an encounter diagnosis of myocarditis within 90 days following the index date. Rates of COVID-19 cases and myocarditis not identified in the system were estimated and the results adjusted accordingly. Wilson score intervals were used for 95% confidence intervals due to the very low probability outcome. ResultsFor the 12-17-year-old male cohort, 6/6,846 (0.09%) patients developed myocarditis overall, with an adjusted rate per million of 876 cases (Wilson score interval 402 - 1,911). For the 12-15 and 16-19 male age groups, the adjusted rates per million were 601 (257 - 1,406) and 561 (240 - 1,313). For 12-17-year-old females, there were 3 (0.04%) cases of myocarditis of 7,361 patients. The adjusted rate was 213 (73 - 627) per million cases. For the 12-15- and 16-19-year-old female cohorts the adjusted rates per million cases were 235 (64 - 857) and 708 (359 - 1,397). The outcomes occurred either within 5 days (40.0%) or from 19-82 days (60.0%). ConclusionsMyocarditis (or pericarditis or myopericarditis) from primary COVID19 infection occurred at a rate as high as 450 per million in young males. Young males infected with the virus are up 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who have received the vaccine.","Singer, Mendel E; Taub, Ira B.; Kaelber, David C.",,,176
302652,Telemedicine Review in Neuro-Oncology: Comparative experiential analysis for Barrow Neurological Institute and Geisinger Health during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) persists on stainless steel and plastic for up to 7 days, suggesting that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be spread by fomite transmission. There is limited research on the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on textiles, with the risk of textiles acting as fomites not being well understood. To date, there does not appear to be any published research on the stability of coronaviruses during laundering, which is required to determine the efficacy of current laundering policies in the decontamination of health care textiles. The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental stability of human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E on different textile fiber types and the persistence of HCoV-OC43 on textiles during domestic and industrial laundering. This study demonstrated that human coronaviruses (5 log10 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]) remain infectious on polyester for &#8805;72 h, cotton for &#8805;24 h, and polycotton for &#8805;6 h; HCoV-OC43 was also able to transfer from polyester to PVC or polyester after 72 h. Under clean conditions, HCoV-OC43 was not detectable on cotton swatches laundered with industrial and domestic wash cycles without temperature and detergent (&#8805;4.57-log10-TCID50 reduction), suggesting that the dilution and agitation of wash cycles are sufficient to remove human coronaviruses from textiles. In the presence of interfering substances (artificial saliva), &#8804;1.78 log10 TCID50 HCoV-OC43 was detected after washing domestically without temperature and detergent, unlike industrial laundering, where the virus was completely removed. However, no infectious HCoV-OC43 was detected when washed domestically with detergent.IMPORTANCE Synthetic textiles such as polyester could potentially act as fomites of human coronaviruses, indicating the importance of infection control procedures during handling of contaminated textiles prior to laundering. This study provides novel evidence that human coronaviruses can persist on textiles for up to 3 days and are readily transferred from polyester textile to other surfaces after 72 h of incubation. This is of particular importance for the domestic laundering of contaminated textiles such as health care uniforms in the United Kingdom and United States, where there may be a risk of cross-contaminating the domestic environment. It was demonstrated that human coronaviruses are removed from contaminated textiles by typical domestic and commercial wash cycles, even at low temperatures without detergent, indicating that current health care laundering policies are likely sufficient in the decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 from textiles.","Owen, Lucy; Shivkumar, Maitreyi; Laird, Katie",MSphere,,176
302816,Two COVID-19-related video-accompanied cases of severe ataxia-myoclonus syndrome,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced health authorities around the world to introduce public health measures to contain the risks of contagion. This greatly impacted on citizens' quality of life, often raising concerns and reactance. There is an ongoing urgent need to promote and sustain behavioral changes and adherence to preventive measures. Based on the theoretical framework of the Patient Health Engagement Model and a participatory co-design process, a social media campaign aimed at improving citizens' health engagement toward behavioral change for preventing the spread of COVID-19 was promoted in Italy in the early months of the pandemic. In this paper, we describe the methodological process adopted to develop the campaign, its characteristics, and the first results-in terms of audience reach and engagement in its early implementation. The discussion of this grounded-up and citizen-centered approach to social campaign development highlights key ways of promoting learning, engaging citizens, and supporting their participation in the co-production of educational interventions for behavioral change toward preventive actions.","Graffigna, Guendalina; Bosio, Caterina; Savarese, Mariarosaria; Barello, Marina; Barello, Serena",Front Psychol,,176

In a systematic quantitative review, we analyzed 11 studies of PIMS-TS, including 468 children reported before July 1, 2020. We found a myriad of clinical features, but we were able to describe common characteristics: previously healthy school-aged children, persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphopenia, and high inflammatory markers. Clinical syndromes such as myocarditis and Kawasaki disease were present in only one third of cases each one. Pediatric intensive care unit admission was frequent, although length of stay was less than 1 week, and mortality was low. Most patients received immunoglobulin or steroids, although the level of evidence for that treatment is low. The PIMS-ST was recently described, and the detailed quantitative pooled data will increase clinicians' awareness, improve diagnosis, and promptly start treatment. This analysis also highlights the necessity of future collaborative studies, given the heterogeneous nature of the PIMS-TS.","Bustos B, Raúl; Jaramillo-Bustamante, Juan Camilo; Vasquez-Hoyos, Pablo; Cruces, Pablo; Díaz, Franco",Pediatr. emerg. care,,176

305530,Brief report: International perspectives on the pediatric COVID-19 experience,2020,"Lactoferrin is a nutrient classically found in mammalian milk. It binds iron and is transferred via a variety of receptors into and between cells, serum, bile, and cerebrospinal fluid. It has important immunological properties, and is both antibacterial and antiviral. In particular, there is evidence that it can bind to at least some of the receptors used by coronaviruses and thereby block their entry. Of importance are Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as based on other activities lactoferrin might prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from attaching to the host cells. Lactoferrin (and more specifically enteric-coated LF because of increased bioavailability) may consequently be of preventive and therapeutic value during the present COVID-19 pandemic.","Kell, Douglas B; Heyden, Eugene L; Pretorius, Etheresia",Front Immunol,,176

In this paper, we explore spatial k-anonymity, a privacy-preserving method that can address this unnecessary tradeoff by providing the best of both privacy and utility. After evaluating its past implications in geo-spatial use cases, we propose applications of spatial k-anonymity in the data sharing and managing of COVID-19 contact tracing technologies as well as heat maps showing a user's travel history. We then justify our propositions by comparing spatial k-anonymity with several other spatial privacy methods, including differential privacy, geo-indistinguishability, and manual consent based redaction. Our hope is to raise awareness of the ever-growing risks associated with spatial privacy and how they can be solved with Spatial K-anonymity.","Iyer, Rohan; Rex, Regina; McPherson, Kevin P.; Gandhi, Darshan; Mahindra, Aryan; Singh, Abhishek; Raskar, Ramesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02556v1.pdf,176

306273,The implications of COVID-19 in radiation oncology in the United States,2020,"The recent outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus leading to the disease COVID 19 has become a global pandemic that is spreading rapidly and has caused a global health emergency. Hence, there is an urgent need of the hour to discover effective drugs to control the pandemic caused by this virus. Under such conditions, it would be imperative to repurpose already known drugs which could be a quick and effective alternative to discovering new drugs. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-COV-2 is an attractive drug target because of its essential role in the processing of the majority of the non-structural proteins which are translated from viral RNA. Herein, we report the high-throughput virtual screening and molecular docking studies to search for the best potential inhibitors against Mpro from FDA approved drugs available in the ZINC database as well as the natural compounds from the Specs database. Our studies have identified six potential inhibitors of Mpro enzyme, out of which four are commercially available FDA approved drugs (Cobicistat, Iopromide, Cangrelor, and Fortovase) and two are from Specs database of natural compounds (Hopeaphenol and Cyclosieversiodide-A). While Cobicistat and Fortovase are known as HIV drugs, Iopromide is a contrast agent and Cangrelor is an anti-platelet drug. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using GROMACS were performed to calculate the stability of the top-ranked compounds in the active site of Mpro. After extensive computational studies, we propose that Cobicistat and Hopeaphenol show potential to be excellent drugs that can form the basis of treating COVID-19 disease.

306410,General practice attendances among patients attending a post-COVID-19 clinic: a pilot study,2021,"In December, 2019, a highly infectious and rapidly spreading new pneumonia of unknown cause was reported to the Chinese WHO Country Office. A cluster of these cases had appeared in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. These infections were found to be caused by a new coronavirus which was given the name “2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV). It was later renamed “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,” or SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on February 11, 2020. It was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its close genetic similarity to the coronavirus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2002 (SARS-CoV-1). The aim of this review is to provide information, primarily to the food industry, regarding a range of biocides effective in eliminating or reducing the presence of coronaviruses from fomites, skin, oral/nasal mucosa, air, and food contact surfaces. As several EPA approved sanitizers against SARS-CoV-2 are commonly used by food processors, these compounds are primarily discussed as much of the industry already has them on site and is familiar with their application and use. Specifically, we focused on the effects of alcohols, povidone iodine, quaternary ammonium compounds, hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), peroxyacetic acid (PAA), chlorine dioxide, ozone, ultraviolet light, metals, and plant-based antimicrobials. This review highlights the differences in the resistance or susceptibility of different strains of coronaviruses, or similar viruses, to these antimicrobial agents.","Dev Kumar, Govindaraj; Mishra, Abhinav; Dunn, Laurel; Townsend, Anna; Oguadinma, Ikechukwu Chukwuma; Bright, Kelly R.; Gerba, Charles P.",Front.

Regarding this problem, there is gap of evidence in Ethiopia, and this study aimed to assess the HCW generation rate and management in Tepi General Hospital, southwest Ethiopia. Methods: Institution-based cross-sectional and case studies were conducted. The total amount of waste generated and its type among various case teams were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r) was used to assess the correlation between the total numbers of patients and the total amount of HCW generated. Qualitative data were transcribed verbatim, translated to English, and analyzed with Open Code version 4.02 software, and content analysis was followed. Results: The total mean weight (±SD) of waste generation rate in all service units of the hospital was 492.5 ± 11.5 kg/day. The higher proportion (61.9%) of the total HCW produced was general waste and the remaining (38.1%) was hazardous waste. There was a statistically significant (X 2 = 82.1, p < 0.001) difference in daily HCW generation rate among different case teams. Similarly, the hospital waste generation amount and total patient flow had a strong positive linear relationship (r = 0.7, p=0.032). COVID-19-related medical wastes were not properly handled, segregated, stored, and disposed. There was a scarcity of resources needed to manage HCW, and available resources were utilized poorly. Overall, healthcare wastes were managed as usual (pre-COVID-19). Conclusion: The mean HCW generation rate in Tepi General Hospital was high. Overall, wastes were mismanaged, and COVID-19-related HCWs have been managed as usual.

307124,The COVID-19 emergency in the age of executive aggrandizement: what role for legislative and judicial checks?,2020,"Recent coronavirus outbreak and ""stay at home"" policies have accelerated the implementation of virtual healthcare. Many surgery departments are implementing telemedicine to enhance remote perioperative care. However, concern still arises regarding the safety of this modality in postoperative follow-up after gastrointestinal surgery. The aim of the present prospective study is to compare the use of telemedicine clinics to in-person follow-up for postoperative care after gastrointestinal surgery during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Prospective study that included all abdominal surgery patients operated since the COVID-19 outbreak. On discharge, patients were given the option to perform their postoperative follow-up appointment by telemedicine or by in-person clinics. Demographic, perioperative, and follow-up variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 219 patients who underwent abdominal surgery, 106 (48%) had their postoperative follow-up using telemedicine. There were no differences in age, gender, ASA score, and COVID-19 positive rate between groups. Patients who preferred telemedicine over in-person follow-up were more likely to have undergone laparoscopic surgery (71% vs. 51%, P = 0.037) and emergency surgery (55% vs. 41%; P = 0.038). Morbidity rate for telemedicine and in-person group was 5.7% and 8%, (P = 0.50). Only 2.8% of patients needed an in-person visit following the telemedicine consult, and 1.9% visited the emergency department.

This study aimed to understand the experiences of trainees working in a large intensive care unit during the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic from an educational and operational perspective in order to highlight what worked and what could be improved. DESIGN: A qualitative study using peer-to-peer semistructured interviews, developed using appreciative inquiry methodology, was conducted during July 2020. Responses were analysed using a thematic analysis technique. SETTING: A large, tertiary intensive care unit in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: All trainees in anaesthesia and intensive care working on the intensive care unit during the first surge were invited to participate. RESULTS: Forty interviews were conducted and four over-arching themes were identified. These were: feeling safe and supported; physical demands; the emotional burden of caring; and a sense of fulfilment, value and personal development. Positive aspects of the organisational response to the pandemic included communication, personal protective equipment supply, team working and well-being support. Suggestions for improvement focused on rest facilities, rota patterns and hierarchies, creating opportunities for reflection and ensuring continued educational and training opportunities despite operational demands. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees described opportunities for learning and fulfilment, as well as challenges, in working through a pandemic. Trainees described their needs and how well these were met during the pandemic. Ideas for improvement most frequently related to basic needs including safety and fatigue, but suggestions also related to supporting learning and development. The appreciative inquiry methodology of the project facilitated effective reflection on positive aspects of trainee experiences.","Warren, Jennifer; Plunkett, Emma; Rudge, James; Stamoulis, Christina; Torlinski, Tomasz; Tarrant, Carolyn; Mullhi, Randeep",BMJ Open,,176

309190,A case of COVID-19 with urticaria-like rashes,2020,"An alternative strategy for men who have sex with men (MSM) experiencing challenges with daily HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) includes 2-1-1 dosing. Understanding 2-1-1 PrEP facilitators and barriers, especially during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, may guide researchers and healthcare providers in future studies and clinical preparedness. We conducted a national cross-sectional study of MSM in the US who had taken 2-1-1 PrEP to examine facilitators and barriers of this on-demand PrEP dosing option. With the shelter-in-place orders in March 2020, this study was adapted to include questions on how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected participants' PrEP use. A total of 140 individuals participated in the survey, 106 of which completed questions pertaining to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The most common reasons for switching from once-daily to 2-1-1 PrEP included having sex less frequently (63.6%) and wanting to take fewer pills (46.4%). Participants reported high medication adherence based on each component of 2-1-1 PrEP dosing (>84%). The most common barriers with 2-1-1 PrEP dosing included unplanned sexual encounters resulting in missing the double-dose pre-sex (43.6%) and trouble remembering doses post-sex (29.3%). Facilitators of the 2-1-1 PrEP dosing strategy included reductions in sexual encounters (63.6%), preference to take fewer pills (46.4%), need to reduce cost (22.1%), and desire to reduce side effects (19.3%). Challenges to receiving PrEP services during the pandemic included obtaining laboratory testing (25.5%) and PrEP refills (either receipt of a refill authorization from a healthcare provider or processing of a refill from the pharmacy) (18.9%). 2-1-1 PrEP is an effective HIV prevention method; therefore, understanding facilitators and barriers of this dosing strategy can result in continuous provision of HIV prevention efforts, particularly during a pandemic.","Camp, Christina; Saberi, Parya",PLoS One,,176

310085,Heart ultrasound in COVID-19/ Особенности ультразвукового исследования сердца у пациентов с новой коронавирусной инфекцией,2020,"AIM: This study aims to determine the frequency of COVID-19 related AKI and to identify the early predictors of AKI. METHODS: This study is a single-center, retrospective, observational study. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients between 24/03/2020 and 31/05/2020 were included in the study. All patients were evaluated for renal dysfunctions with urine dipstick, protein/creatinine ratio, albumin/creatinine ratio in spot urine, serum cystatin C, serum creatinine level on hospital admission, and 28th day of hospital admission. To assess the utility of these parameters to predict AKI, a receiver-operating characteristic curve was generated and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. RESULTS: 348 patients were included. The average incidence of AKI was 4.9% (n = 17). The incidence of AKI in mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 cases was 1.3% (n = 4), 9.0% (n = 3) and 76.9% (n = 10), respectively. Proteinuria was detected in 7.8% (n = 27) of patients with a urine dipstick test. In spot urine analysis, proteinuria was found in 20.1% (n = 70) of patients. The frequency of persistent proteinuria was 5.2% (n = 18). The AUC alue of serum cystatin C, D-dimer and albumin/creatinine ratio to predict COVID-19 related AKI were 0.96 (0.90 to 1.0), 0.94 (0.89-0.98), and 0.95 (0.91-0.98). CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with normal serum creatinine levels on hospital admission, albuminuria, serum cystatin C and D-dimer levels may be an early predictor of COVID-19 related AKI and these patients should be monitored closely for AKI. Since the sample size in the AKI group was small, our study results should be confirmed with larger cohort studies.","Yildirim, Cigdem; Ozger, Hasan Selcuk; Yasar, Emre; Tombul, Nazrin; Gulbahar, Ozlem; Yildiz, Mehmet; Bozdayi, Gulendam; Derici, Ulver; Dizbay, Murat",Nephrology (Carlton),,176

As no vaccine is available for COVID-19, the development of directly acting antiviral agents and preventive strategies have to be considered. Nature provides a huge reservoir of anti-infectious compounds, from which we can deduce innovative ideas, therapies, and products. Anti-adhesive natural products interact with the receptor-mediated recognition and early interaction of viruses with the host cells, leading to a reduced internalisation of the virus and reduced infections (e.g., procyanidin-B-2-di-O-gallate against influenza and herpes virus). Lignans like podophyllotoxin and bicyclol show strong antiviral activities against different viruses, and essential oils can directly interact with viral membranes and reduce the host's inflammatory responses (e.g., 1,8-cineol). Echinacea extracts stimulate the immune system, and bioavailable alkamides are key players by interacting with immunomodulating cannabinoid receptors. COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infections have, in part, successfully been treated in China by preparations from traditional Chinese medicine and, while it is too early to draw conclusions, some promising data are available. There is huge potential, but intensified research is needed to develop evidence-based medicines with a clearly defined chemical profile. Intensified research and development, and therefore funding, are needed for exploiting nature's reservoir against viral infections. Combined action for basic research, chemistry, pharmacognosy, virology, and clinical studies, but also supply chain, sustainable sourcing, and economic aspects have to be considered.

We develop a SIR-type model taking into account the presence of asymptomatic, or however undetected, infective, and the substantially long time these spend being infective and not isolated. In the second part of the note, we apply our model to the COVID-19 epidemics in Northern Italy, by numerical simulations based on estimate of certain parameters on the basisof medical evidence, and on fit of the other parameters from data on the first decade of March; the simulations reproduce quite satisfactorily the developements in the subsequent week, at difference with the standard SIR model. Our simulations show that if no actions were taken, the estimates based on this model would be about one third of those based on the SIR model as far as the height of the epidemic peak is concerned, and about half for what concerns the time scale of the epidemics. Moreover, the model suggests that an overwhelming part of the population would be in contact with the virus, most of them with no or very little symptoms. We also consider the situation in which the restrictive measures are taken into account by a""reduction factor"", and discuss on the one hand how a prompt isolation of asymptomatic infectives would change the dynamics in this framework, and on the other what the time-scale could be in this context; this both in the""mitigation""scenario, in which the measures taken only reduce the epidemic, and in the""eradication""one, in which the measures raise sufficiently the epidemc threshold, as it appears to have happened in China.","Gaeta, Giuseppe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.08720v1.pdf,176

312755,Telepsychiatry and COVID-19: Preparing for What's Next,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients affected by COVID-19 may develop disease related malnutrition (DRM) due to the catabolic situation, symptoms that interfere with intake and prolonged hospital stay. This study aims to know the percentage of patients admitted for COVID-19 who required artificial nutrition (AN), their clinical characteristics, as well as the prevalence of DRM and the risk of sarcopenia at hospital discharge and after 6 months. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, prospective study, with successive inclusion of adult patients admitted for COVID-19 in whom institutional nutritional support (NS) care protocol was applied. Those who received AN underwent a nutritional screening by Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire (SNAQ) and an assessment by Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) at hospital discharge, as well as a screening for sarcopenia (SARC-F test) and SNAQ re-test 15 days and 6 months after by a phone call. Symptoms related to food intake, anthropometric and analytical data were also collected. RESULTS: We evaluated 936 patients with a mean age of 63.7 ± 15.3 years; predominantly male (59.7%), overweight 41%, obesity 40.4%; hypertension 52.9%; diabetes mellitus 26.6% and cancer 10.4%. The stay hospital length was 17.3 ± 13.8 days and 13.6% patients died during hospitalization. The modality of nutritional support was: 86.1% dietary adaptation + oral nutritional supplements (ONS); 12.4% enteral nutrition (EN) by nasogastric (NG) tube; 0.9% parenteral nutrition (PN) and 0.6% EN plus PN. Focusing on patients who received AN, follow-up post discharge was possible in 62 out of 87 who survived. Of these, at the time of hospital discharge, 96.7% presented nutritional risk by SNAQ and 100% malnutrition by SGA (20% B; 80% C). During admission, 82.3% presented intense anorexia and the mean weight loss was 10.9 ± 6 Kg (p < 0.001). Fifteen days after being discharged, 12.9% still had anorexia, while hyperphagia appeared in 85.5% of the patients and risk of sarcopenia by SARC-F was present in 87.1% of them. Six months after discharge, 6.8% still had anorexia and 3.4% hyperphagia, with a global weight gain of 4.03 ± 6.2 Kg (p=<0.0001). Risk of malnutrition was present in only 1.7% of the patients, although risk of sarcopenia persisted in 49.2%. CONCLUSION: All patients admitted by COVID-19 for whom EN or PN were indicated following an institutional protocol still presented malnutrition at hospital discharge, and almost all showed risk of sarcopenia, that persisted in almost half of them at 6 months. These findings suggest that nutritional and functional problems persist in these patients after discharge, indicating that they require prolonged nutritional support and monitoring.","Ramos, Analía; Joaquin, Clara; Ros, Mireia; Martin, Mariona; Cachero, Montserrat; Sospedra, María; Martínez, Eva; Sánchez Migallón, José Manuel; Sendrós, María-José; Soldevila, Berta; Puig-Domingo, Manel",Clin. nutr.

We prospectively recruited HCWs from a university hospital in Turkey. Serum samples from 1072 HCWs were obtained following 28 days of the first, and 21 days of the second dose. Detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies were performed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant; Abbott). Results greater than or equal to the cutoff value 50.0 AU/ml were reported as positive. After the first dose, antispike antibodies were detected in 834 of 1072 (77.8%) HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among females (84.6%) than males (70.6%) (p < 0.001) and was found to be highest in both women and men between the ages of 18-34. After the second dose, antibodies were detected in 1008 of 1012 (99.6%) HCWs. Antibody titers were significantly higher in those who had coronavirus disease-2019 before vaccination than those who did not (p < 0.001). Antibody positivity and median antibody titers were significantly less in HCWs with chronic diseases compared to those without (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a relatively high frequency (99.6%) of humoral immunity was produced in HCWs aged 18-59 after two doses of CoronaVac. Quantitation of antibodies may help facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response, which will be especially useful in deciding the dose of the vaccine in vulnerable groups such as those over 60 years of age and those with chronic diseases.","Bayram, Aysen; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Günel Karadeniz, Pinar; Erdogan, Merve; Koçer, Ipek",J. med. virol,,176
313849,Virtual Ophthalmology: Telemedicine in a COVID-19 Era,2020,"Social capital describes the social bonds that exist within a community and comprises norms of reciprocity and trust as well as social relationships and social networks. We use data from counties in the United States to identify if community level responses to COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic (February 17 - May 10) depended on levels of social capital. We find that individuals who lived in counties with high levels of social capital reduced mobility faster than individuals living in counties with low levels of social capital and that they especially reduced mobility directed at retail and recreational activities, i.e. non-essential activities with higher potential risk. Difference-in-difference results show that the adoption of shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) in a county, an increase in the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and a rainy weather were all associated with a decline in mobility, but that effects were heterogenous and depended on community level social capital. Effects were more pronounced in high social capital communities. Based on these findings, we map the level of vulnerability of communities in the United States to COVID-19: counties with a large share of the population suffering from pre-existing medical conditions and low levels of community level social capital are especially susceptible to experiencing severe health outcomes because of COVID-19.","Borgonovi, Francesca; Andrieu, Elodie",Soc Sci Med,,176

We aimed to illustrate how the stroke services were interrupted during the pandemic in China. METHODS: A 61-item questionnaire designed on Wenjuanxing Form was completed by doctors or nurses who were involved in treating patients with stroke from 1 February to 31 March 2020. RESULTS: A total of 415 respondents completed the online survey after informed consent was obtained. Of the respondents, 37.8%, 35.2% and 27.0% were from mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively. Overall, the proportion of severe impact (reduction >50%) on the admission of transient ischaemic stroke, acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) was 45.0%, 32.0% and 27.5%, respectively. Those numbers were 36.9%, 27.9% and 22.3%; 36.5%, 22.1% and 22.6%; and 66.4%, 47.5% and 41.1% in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively (all p<0.0001). For AIS, thrombolysis was moderate (20%-50% reduction) or severely impacted (>50%), as reported by 54.4% of the respondents, while thrombectomy was 39.3%. These were 44.4%, 26.3%; 44.2%, 39.4%; and 78.2%, 56.5%, in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively (all p<0.0001). For patients with acute ICH, 39.8% reported the impact was severe or moderate for those eligible for surgery who had surgery. Those numbers were 27.4%, 39.0% and 58.1% in mild, moderate and severe epidemic areas, respectively. For staff resources, about 20% (overall) to 55% (severe epidemic) of the respondents reported moderate or severe impact on the on-duty doctors and nurses. CONCLUSION: We found a significant reduction of admission for all types of patients with stroke during the pandemic. Patients were less likely to receive appropriate care, for example, thrombolysis/thrombectomy, after being admitted to the hospital. Stroke service in severe COVID-19 epidemic areas, for example, Wuhan, was much more severely impacted compared with other regions in China.","Wang, Xia; Ouyang, Menglu; Carcel, Cheryl; Chen, Chen; Sun, Lingli; Yang, Jie; Zhang, Yao; Chen, Guofang; You, Shoujiang; Cao, Yongjun; Ma, Lu; Hu, Xin; Sui, Yi; Anderson, Craig; Song, Lili; Wang, Yongjun; Wang, David",,,176

314093,A comparison of COVID-19 mortality rates between European and Asian States,2020,"AIMS: We aimed to investigate the heterogeneity of seasonal suicide patterns among multiple geographically, demographically and socioeconomically diverse populations. METHODS: Weekly time-series data of suicide counts for 354 communities in 12 countries during 1986-2016 were analysed. Two-stage analysis was performed. In the first stage, a generalised linear model, including cyclic splines, was used to estimate seasonal patterns of suicide for each community. In the second stage, the community-specific seasonal patterns were combined for each country using meta-regression. In addition, the community-specific seasonal patterns were regressed onto community-level socioeconomic, demographic and environmental indicators using meta-regression. RESULTS: We observed seasonal patterns in suicide, with the counts peaking in spring and declining to a trough in winter in most of the countries. However, the shape of seasonal patterns varied among countries from bimodal to unimodal seasonality. The amplitude of seasonal patterns (i.e. the peak/trough relative risk) also varied from 1.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-1.62) to 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.1) among 12 countries. The subgroup difference in the seasonal pattern also varied over countries. In some countries, larger amplitude was shown for females and for the elderly population (&#8805;65 years of age) than for males and for younger people, respectively. The subperiod difference also varied; some countries showed increasing seasonality while others showed a decrease or little change. Finally, the amplitude was larger for communities with colder climates, higher proportions of elderly people and lower unemployment rates (p-values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the common features of a spring peak and a winter trough, seasonal suicide patterns were largely heterogeneous in shape, amplitude, subgroup differences and temporal changes among different populations, as influenced by climate, demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Our findings may help elucidate the underlying mechanisms of seasonal suicide patterns and aid in improving the design of population-specific suicide prevention programmes based on these patterns.","Yu, J; Yang, D; Kim, Y; Hashizume, M; Gasparrini, A; Armstrong, B; Honda, Y; Tobias, A; Sera, F; Vicedo-Cabrera, A M; Kim, H; Íñiguez, C; Lavigne, E; Ragettli, M S; Scovronick, N; Acquaotta, F; Chen, B; Guo, Y L; de Sousa Zanotti Stagliori Coelho, M; Saldiva, P; Zanobetti, A; Schwartz, J; Bell, M L; Diaz, M; De la Cruz Valencia, C; Holobâca, I; Fratianni, S; Chung, Y",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,176

There are sparse data regarding the prognostic value of serum calprotectin in COVID-19 patients. AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum calprotectin level and clinical severity of COVID-19 disease in hospitalized patients. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional cohort study included 80 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The study population was divided into two groups as patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and patients hospitalized but not in the ICU. The serum calprotectin levels, other laboratory, and clinical parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 66.5 ± 15.7 years. Of the patients, 42 were in the ICU and 38 were not. Serum calprotectin level and acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, fibrinogen, and white blood cell were significantly higher in ICU patients than in non-ICU patients. ROC curve analysis identified that serum calprotectin level was a predictor for ICU requirement with an area under the curve of 0.641 (p = 0.031). Logistic regression analysis revealed that serum calprotectin was a significant determinant for whether or not patient required the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that serum calprotectin level seems to be a useful biomarker that can predict the severity of COVID-19 disease. Serum calprotectin is a significant predictor of ICU requirement in patients with COVID-19.","Kaya, Tezcan; Yaylaci, Selçuk; Nalbant, Ahmet; Yildirim, Ilhan; Kocayigit, Havva; Çokluk, Erdem; Sekeroglu, Mehmet Ramazan; Köroglu, Mehmet; Güçlü, Ertugrul",Ir. j. med. sci,,176
315155,The show must go on,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Using strategy of drug repurposing, antiviral agents against influenza A virus (IAV) and newly emerging SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, also as 2019-nCoV) could be quickly screened out. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously reported engineered replication-competent PR8 strain carrying luciferase reporter gene (IAV-luc) and multiple pseudotyped IAV and SARS-CoV-2 virus was used. To specifically evaluate the pH change of vesicles containing IAV, we constructed an A549 cell line with endosomal and lysosomal expression of pHluorin2. RESULTS: Here, we identified azithromycin (AZ) as an effective inhibitor against multiple IAV and SARS-CoV-2 strains. We found that AZ treatment could potently inhibit IAV infection in vitro. Moreover, using pseudotyped virus model, AZ could also markedly block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in HEK293T-ACE2 and Caco2 cells. Mechanistic studies further revealed that such effect was independent of interferon signalling. AZ treatment neither impaired the binding and internalization of IAV virions, nor the viral replication, but rather inhibited the fusion between viral and vacuolar membranes. Using a NPC1-pHluorin2 reporter cell line, we confirmed that AZ treatment could alkalize the vesicles containing IAV virions, thereby preventing pH-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings demonstrate that AZ can exert broad-spectrum antiviral effects against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, and could be served as a potential clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in emergency as well as a promising lead compound for the development of next-generation anti-IAV drugs.","Du, Xiaohong; Zuo, Xiangyang; Meng, Fang; Han, Chenfeng; Ouyang, Wei; Han, Yu; Gu, Yayun; Zhao, Xin; Xu, Feng; Qin, Frank Xiaofeng",Cell Prolif,,176

Individual user profiles are produced by platform providers to make money from tracking, predicting, exploiting and influencing their users' decision preferences and behavior, while product and service providers transform their business models by targeting potential customers with more accuracy. There have been many social and economic benefits to this digital disruption, but it has also largely contributed to the digital destruction of mental model alignment and shared situational awareness through the propagation of mis-information i.e. reinforcement of dissonant mental models by recommender algorithms, bots and trusted individual platform users (influencers). To mitigate this process of digital destruction, new methods and approaches to the centralized management of these platforms are needed to build on and encourage trust in the actors that use them (and by association trust in their mental models).

As it is a novel disease, we have less experience in its possible appearances. Predominantly affecting the respiratory tract, about 20-43% patients also present with extrapulmonary manifestations such as coagulation disorders with thrombotic angiopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: In our institution, a patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain which was caused by portal vein thrombosis. As a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal antigen swab few days earlier was negative, we performed several tests to find out its etiology. After all tests were inconclusive and the patient suffered flu-like symptoms 2 weeks before, we repeated COVID-19 molecular testing and received a positive test result. The patient was treated symptomatically and received therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 infection can also be present without typical pulmonary symptoms. In patients with severe abdominal pain and new diagnosed portal vein thrombosis, it is important to think of a COVID-19 infection. Also, the reliability of antigen nasopharyngeal swab should be considered critically, especially if performed wrongly. We recommended to perform molecular tests when in doubt. After the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis, immediate anticoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk of further complications like intestinal infarction.","Sinz, Stefanie; Glaser-Gallion, Florian; Steffen, Thomas",Surg Case Rep,,176

317618,"Clinical Trials, Adaptability and the COVID-19 Pandemic",2020,"To evaluate an academic institution's implementation of a gynecologic electronic consultation (eConsult) service, including the most common queries, turnaround time, need for conversion to in-person visits, and to demonstrate how eConsults can improve access and convenience for patients and providers. This is a descriptive and retrospective electronic chart review. We obtained data from the UCSF eConsult and Smart Referral program manager. The medical system provided institution-wide statistics. Three authors reviewed and categorized gynecologic eConsults for the last fiscal year. The senior author resolved conflicts in coding. The eConsult program manager provided billing information and provider reimbursement. A total of 548 eConsults were submitted to the gynecology service between July 2017 and June 2020 (4.5% of institutional eConsult volume). Ninety-five percent of the eConsults were completed by a senior specialist within our department. Abnormal pap smear management, abnormal uterine bleeding, and contraception questions were the most common queries. Over half (59.3%) of all inquiries were answered on the same day as they were received, with an average of 9% declined. Gynecology was the 10th largest eConsult provider at our institution in 2020. The present investigation describes one large university-based experience with eConsults in gynecology. Results demonstrate that eConsults permit appropriate, efficient triaging of time-sensitive conditions affecting patients especially in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. eConsult services provide the potential to improve access, interdisciplinary communication, and patient and provider satisfaction.","Corbetta-Rastelli, Chiara M; Morgan, Tamandra K; Homaifar, Nazaneen; Deangelis, Lisa; Autry, Amy M",J Med Syst,,176
317663,Monitoring of Simulated Occlusal Tooth Wear by Objective Outcome Measures,2020,"BACKGROUNDThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a novel viral pneumonia (COVID-19), which is rapidly spreading throughout the world. The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear.METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis in 5630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates.RESULTSThe overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1952/5630). Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525 × 10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years. Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 × 10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P = 7.797 × 10-14). More than 3 testing administrations was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk. Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no. 2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2018YFE0204500).","Shen, Na; Zhu, Yaowu; Wang, Xiong; Peng, Jing; Liu, Weiyong; Wang, Feng; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",JCI insight,,176

The main goals of this study were: (1) to enhance students' self-regulated learning by shifting the direction of assessment from instructors to the students;and (2) to promote deep active learning in mathematics. Students were required to conduct self-regulated learning on a selected topic. They were encouraged to formulate two multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and pose them after each presentation in an online course. The effectiveness of Student-generated Questions (SGQs) as a learning strategy was measured in terms of: (1) students' engagement;and (2) learning outcomes. While evidence on students' engagement was gathered through an online questionnaire survey, the learning outcomes were measured by analyzing the quality of SGQs. Results indicated that authoring questions, though leading to a higher students' engagement with the materials, could be quite challenging for students and did not lead to higher achievement. The authors provide some suggestions for improving the process through regular uses of digital technologies such as PeerWise.","Caspari-Sadeghi, Sima Forster-Heinlein Brigitte Maegdefrau Jutta Bachl Lena",International Journal for the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning,,176

This study included 22 patients, 20 adults, and 2 children, and an overall mean age of 46 years old at the time of transplantation. Twelve patients (54.5%) received IT, and the remainder (45.5%) MVT. The mean time between transplantation and mTORs initiation was 24 months. The indication was worsening renal function in 13 patients (59%), with 9/13(69.2%) noted to have an increase in glomerular filtration rate of at least 10 mL/min/1.73m2. The indication for 4 patients (18.2%) was history of neuroendocrine tumor. After mTOR initiation, 50% of patients were reduced or weaned off tacrolimus and 13.7% off prednisone. mTORs were discontinued in 11/22 patients. Six patients (54.5%) stopped due to side effects, two (18.1%) for surgery, and one (9%) for acute cellular rejection. Side effects were edema (33.3%), headaches (33.3%), diarrhea (16.7%), and oral ulcers (16.7%). Average duration of mTORs prior to discontinuation due to side effects was 7 months. mTORs may function in their own niche of patients due to the potential renal safety profile, but use is most limited by tolerance to side effects.","Modi, Krishna; Segovia, Maria; Mavis, Alisha; Schiano, Thomas; Patel, Yuval; Boike, Justin; Sudan, Debra; Nagai, Shunji; Jafri, Syed-Mohammed",Clin Transplant,,176
319937,Current smoking and COVID-19 risk: results from a population symptom app in over 2.4 million people,2021,"AIMS: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, incidence of hip fracture has not changed. Evidence has shown increased mortality rates associated with COVID-19 infection. However, little is known about the outcomes of COVID-19 negative patients in a pandemic environment. In addition, the impact of vitamin D levels on mortality in COVID-19 hip fracture patients has yet to be determined. METHODS: This multicentre observational study included 1,633 patients who sustained a hip fracture across nine hospital trusts in North West England. Data were collected for three months from March 2020 and for the same period in 2019. Patients were matched by Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS), hospital, and fracture type. We looked at the mortality outcomes of COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative patients sustaining a hip fracture. We also looked to see if vitamin D levels had an impact on mortality. RESULTS: The demographics of the 2019 and 2020 groups were similar, with a slight increase in proportion of male patients in the 2020 group. The 30-day mortality was 35.6% in COVID-19 positive patients and 7.8% in the COVID-19 negative patients. There was a potential association of decreasing vitamin D levels and increasing mortality rates for COVID-19 positive patients although our findings did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: In 2020 there was a significant increase in 30-day mortality rates of patients who were COVID-19 positive but not of patients who were COVID-19 negative. Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with high mortality rates in COVID-19 positive patients.

319967,"COVID-19, an Incentive to Tackle Sugar in Hospitals and at Home",2021,"The ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a huge number of human deaths. Currently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines available for this virus (SARS-CoV-2). The viral polymerase is a promising antiviral target. Here, we describe the near-atomic-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex consisting of the nsp12 catalytic subunit and nsp7-nsp8 cofactors. This structure highly resembles the counterpart of SARS-CoV with conserved motifs for all viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and suggests a mechanism of activation by cofactors. Biochemical studies reveal reduced activity of the core polymerase complex and lower thermostability of individual subunits of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV. These findings provide important insights into RNA synthesis by coronavirus polymerase and indicate adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 toward humans with a relatively lower body temperature than the natural bat hosts.","Peng, Qi; Peng, Ruchao; Yuan, Bin; Zhao, Jingru; Wang, Min; Wang, Xixi; Wang, Qian; Sun, Yan; Fan, Zheng; Qi, Jianxun; Gao, George F; Shi, Yi",Cell Rep,,176
320022,Pediatric Dentistry During and After COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is spreading all over the world and poses a great threat to humans. This study aimed to systematically review the current situation and public health burden associated with children infected with SARS-CoV2. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases without language limitations. The pooled proportion or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each analysis to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and coinfection, as well as to assess the sex of SARS-CoV-2-infected children. RESULTS: We obtained data from 14 eligible studies with 410 patients for the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was 40.45% (95% CI, 24.04-56.85), while coinfection was 10.14% (95% CI, 3.97-16.30), of which Mycoplasma pneumonia (50%; 95% CI, 28.24-71.76) and influenza virus or parainfluenza virus (22.76%; 95% CI, 4.76-40.77) were the most common pathogens. Both male and female children were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. And the pooled proportion of family clustering infection was 83.63% (95% CI, 77.54-89.72). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of asymptomatic infections occurs in children infected with SARS-CoV2, who are also susceptible to coinfection regardless of sex. These data affirm the increasing public health burden arising from infected children regarding the causation of asymptomatic infection or misdiagnosis and as a significant contributor to virus spread. The public should pay more attention to children during epidemics and conduct multimethod detection to further effectively identify infected children and control the source of infection.","Zheng, Baojia; Wang, Hui; Yu, Cuixiang",Pediatr Pulmonol,,176

As of now,27th May,2020, there are about 54,88,825 infected cases and 3,49,095 deaths globally. Coronavirus samples collected from all the countries have been sequenced for advanced studies in a bid to understand the structure and functioning of the virus. In our study we have tried working on every available sequence to setup both comparisons and co-relations. There is no such available study as of now for reference and hence it can become a pioneer stone in this direction. The mortality rate calculated turns out to be 9.19%,34.37% and 6.29% for SARS-2003, MERS-2012 and COVID-19 respectively. The basic reproduction rate R0 was 2-5 for SARS-2003, 0.3-0.8 for MERS-2012 and 1.4- 5.7 for COVID-19. We found out the relation between number of mutations and mortality as well as phylogenetic relations. High number of mutations corresponded to higher mortality rate as in countries like Italy and Spain. Alpha and Beta-coronaviruses show a common ancestor from which they descended. Brazil and Iran have shown similar phylogenetic descent explaining their mortality rate. India however showed a distant relation from the common ancestor of other genome sequences. This study highlights the mutations of the SARS-CoV2 virus as well as sets up a comparison with the previous outbreaks. Similar type of studies should be conducted when more genome samples are present. These results can also contribute towards making an effective anti-viral therapy and vaccines.","Sharp, Kumar; Dange, Shubhangi",J. Pure Appl. Microbiol.,,176

323802,Telemedicine and Neurological Practice in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"COVID-19 diagnosis relies on molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab in the presence of suggestive clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Since bronchoalveolar lavage liquid (BAL) collected during fibrobronchoscopy may increase test sensitivity compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, it was performed during the 2020 pandemic in clinically or radiologically suspected cases. Our aim was to determine whether clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) findings or laboratory tests may predict patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after a negative nasopharyngeal swab. We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study with multivariable analysis of suspected patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at BAL after at least one negative nasopharyngeal swab. Univariable logistic regression for odds ratio and multivariate models was calculated to determine clinical, radiological and laboratory predictors. 32/198 (16%) patients had BAL positive for SARS-CoV-2, while 65/198 tested positive for other pathogens at BAL. Of the 32 patients positive for COVID, 4 had a coinfection at BAL, being thus positive both for COVID as well as for another pathogen while the remaining 105 patients were negative for COVID and other pathogens at BAL. COVID-19 patients had more often highly suggestive CT findings, higher number of involved lobes, more often ground glass opacity of more than 50% of lung parenchyma, and less frequently other radiologically suspected infections. At multivariate model, temperature also predicted BAL positivity. The procedure was well tolerated-with only one desaturation episode-while no healthcare worker was infected. In conclusion, when nasopharyngeal swabs are negative but there is clinical or imaging suspicion of COVID-19, BAL represents a complementary diagnostic tool, particularly in conjunction with suggestive/more extensive lung involvement at CT scan. The procedure did not carry increased risks for patients nor for operators, while allowing to free hospital resources, avoiding unnecessary isolations.","Barberi, Caterina; Castelnuovo, Elena; Dipasquale, Andrea; Mrakic Sposta, Federica; Vatteroni, Giulia; Canziani, Lorenzo Maria; Alloisio, Marco; Ciccarelli, Michele; Selmi, Carlo; Ferraroli, Giorgio Maria",Intern. emerg. med,,176

The outbreak affected healthcare workers (HCWs) and kidney disease patients including transplant patients and those requiring maintenance hemodialysis. Methods: The outbreak investigation and report were conducted in accordance with the Orion statement guidelines. Results: In this study, 15 cases of COVID-19 affecting 10 patients and 5 HCWs were identified on a ward with 31 beds and 43 HCWs. The patients had tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on admission. One of the HCWs was identified as the probable index case. Five patients died (mortality rate, 50%). They were all elderly and had significant comorbidities. The infection control measures taken included the transfer of infected patients to COVID-19 isolation wards, implementation of universal preventive measures, weekly PCR testing of patients and HCWs linked to the ward, training of HCWs on infection control and prevention measures, and enhancement of cleaning and disinfection. The outbreak was contained in 2 weeks, and no new cases occurred. Conclusion: Nosocomial COVID-19 outbreaks can have high attack rates involving both patients and HCWs and carry a high risk of patient mortality. Hospitals need to implement effective infection prevention and control strategies to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 spread.","Montero, María Milagro Hidalgo López Carlota López Montesinos Inmaculada Sorli Luisa Barrufet Gonzalez Cristina Villar-García Judith Güerri-Fernández Roberto Herranz Milagros Crespo Marta Arenas Jiménez María Dolores Pascual Julio González Juanes Cristina Horcajada Juan P.",Antibiotics,,176

Therefore, determining their health and safety perceptions and attitudes in the pandemic process is very important. This study aims to determine which is more effective in work accident prevention behavior: safety awareness and competencies of healthcare professionals or perception of fatalism. METHOD: For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to 326 healthcare professionals. The questionnaire consists of four parts: (1) demographic information of the employees, (2) scale of preventing occupational accidents, (3) fatalism perception scale in occupational health and safety, and (4) security awareness and competency scale. Descriptive statistical methods, multiple regression and correlation analysis were used in the analysis of the data. RESULTS: It was determined that the participants' safety awareness and competencies were at the high level and their fatalism perceptions were at the low level. The average of the responses given by the participants to the scale of preventing work accidents was above the middle level. According to the study, the safety awareness and competencies of health workers were found to be about three times more effective on the behavior of preventing work accidents than the perception of fatalism. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, it is important to recommend managers to take the step to increase the safety awareness and competencies of those working in their institutions.","Ünal, Özgün",Work,,176

326169,Predictive Value of Prognostic Nutritional Index on COVID-19 Severity,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 resulted in considerable mental health burden in the Chinese general population and among health care workers at the beginning and peak of the pandemic. However, little is known about potentially vulnerable groups during the final stage of the lockdown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this survey study was to assess the mental health burden of different professions in China in order to find vulnerable groups, possible influencing factors, and successful ways of coping during the last 4 weeks of the lockdown in Hubei Province. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey asked participants about current residence, daily working hours, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and media preferences. We used a shortened version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to assess mental health. Further assessments included perceived stress (Simplified Chinese version of the 14-item Perceived Stress Scale), coping strategies for all participants, and specific stressors for health care workers. We followed the reporting guidelines of the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) statement for observational studies. RESULTS: The sample (N=687) consisted of 158 doctors, 221 nurses, 24 other medical staff, 43 students, 60 teachers/government staff, 135 economy staff, 26 workers/farmers, and 20 professions designated under the ""other"" category. We found increased depression (n=123, 17.9%), anxiety (n=208, 30.3%), and stress (n=94, 13.7%) in our sample. Professions that were vulnerable to depression were other medical staff and students. Doctors, nurses, and students were vulnerable to anxiety; and other medical staff, students, and economy staff were vulnerable to stress. Coping strategies were reduced to three factors: active, mental, and emotional. Being female and emotional coping were independently associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. Applying active coping strategies showed lower odds for anxiety while mental coping strategies showed lower odds for depression, anxiety, and stress. Age, being inside a lockdown area, exposure to COVID-19 at work, and having a high workload (8-12 hours per day) were not associated with depression, anxiety, or stress. WeChat was the preferred way of staying informed across all groups. CONCLUSIONS: By the end of the lockdown, a considerable part of the Chinese population showed increased levels of depression and anxiety. Students and other medical staff were the most affected, while economy staff were highly stressed. Doctors and nurses need support regarding potential anxiety disorders. Future work should focus on longitudinal results of the pandemic and develop targeted preventive measures.","Du, Junfeng; Mayer, Gwendolyn; Hummel, Svenja; Oetjen, Neele; Gronewold, Nadine; Zafar, Ali; Schultz, Jobst-Hendrik",J Med Internet Res,,176

However, the development of OFET-based protein biochips is still at an early stage. On the one hand, single-biomarker determination is not sufficient for the diagnosis of cancer; thus, simultaneous monitoring of electrical signals toward multi-biomarkers is widely concerned and explored. On the other hand, an optimized functionalization strategy for efficient protein immobilization is another key to make OFET-based protein biochips accessible with improved detection performance. Herein, a facile functionalization strategy is developed for excellent charge-transport thin films by suppressing the gelation of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymer semiconductors with the addition of the glutaraldehyde cross-linking agent. Besides, functional groups are introduced on the device surface for efficient attachment of antibodies as receptors via a condensation reaction, enabling simultaneous determination of &#945;-fetoprotein biomarker and carcinoembryonic antigen biomarker with improved sensitivity and reliability. Therefore, the proposed high-throughput OFET-based protein biochip has the potential to be widely utilized in early liver cancer diagnosis.","Sun, Chenfang; Vinayak, Manikkedath V; Cheng, Shanshan; Hu, Wenping",Anal. chem,,176

Despite the severity of the complications associated with COVID-19, no antiviral agent is yet available for the treatment of this disease. Several studies have reported arrhythmias as one of the numerous manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection. Clinicians use different therapeutic agents in the management of COVID-19 patients with arrhythmias, apart from ranolazine; however, some of these drugs are administered with caution because of their significant side effects. In this study, we reviewed the potential antiarrhythmic effects of ranolazine in the management of cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19. Ranolazine is a second-line drug approved for the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris. Previous studies have shown that ranolazine produces its beneficial cardiac effects without any significant impact on the body's hemodynamics; hence, blood pressure is not altered. Due to its reduced side effects, ranolazine may be more effective than other drugs in producing the desired relief from COVID-19 related arrhythmias, since it produces its antiarrhythmic effect by modulating sodium, potassium and calcium channels, and suppressing cytokine expression.","Chukwunyere, Ugochukwu; Sehirli, Ahmet Ozer; Abacioglu, Nurettin",Med Hypotheses,,176

One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest way to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 5,000 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 2,000 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 3,000 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 97\%($\pm$ 5\%), while having a specificity rate of around 90\%. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), area under the curve (AUC), and confusion matrix of each model.

Antimalarial drug chloroquine (CHL) and its safer derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCHL) have been proposed to be repurposed to treat SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19. CHL/HCHL have anti-inflammatory activity and are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and lupus. Although, CHL/HCHL have an anti-viral activity against several viruses in cell-cultures, the anti-viral activity in-vivo is questionable. Repurposing of CHL/HCHL to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is appealing. However, there is empirical evidence from animal studies with other viruses suggesting that CHL/HCHL may have an untoward paradoxical effect. One thus cannot exclude the possibility that CHL may increase the severity of the disease and prove deleterious both for the patients and public health efforts to contain the highly contagious and explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Sharma, Anuj",Microbes Infect,,176

Patients with comorbidities (obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus) are particularly at risk of a more severe course of infection. We present a 33-year old lean patient with a medical history of ulcerative colitis on immunosuppressive treatment with Azathioprine, after unsuccessful in vitro fertilization one week before the onset of symptoms, admitted to hospital for two-week-long cough with sore throat with fever ap to 40°C. CT confirmed bilateral bronchopneumonia without etiological detection of the infectious agent. Three PCR tests (two of nasopharyngeal swabs and one of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) were negative for COVID-19, including antigen and antibody tests. Complex parenteral ATB treatment with high-flow nasal oxygen therapy was ineffective, and artificial lung ventilation was indicated for acute respiratory failure. After 4 days antifungal treatment of Fluconazole, condition of patient progressed to hepatic and multiorgan failure and the patient died on day 14 of hospitalization. Post-mortem histological examination revealed the presence of coronavirus in the cells of lung parenchyma. The case recalls that even young patients with immunosuppressive treatment are at risk for the critical course of COVID-19 disease. The negativity of the tests was due to the capture of the patient only after the second week of infection, at the time of the diagnostic window between the positive PCR test and the formation of antibodies. The persistent effect of immunosuppression was most likely the reason for the lack of antibody response.","Faktorová, Xénia Horniaková Lucia Sedlačko Jozef Havranová Alena Martanovič Peter Malíková Petra Jakabovičová Martina Urkovičová Zuzana Szántová Mária",Vnitrni lekarstvi,,176

The aim of our study was to establish best-evidence to inform pediatric CHQ doses for children infected with COVID-19. A previously developed physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for CHQ was used to simulate exposure in adults and children and verified against published pharmacokinetic data. The COVID-19 recommended adult dosage regimen of 44 mg/kg total was tested in adults and children to evaluate the extent of variation in exposure. Based on differences in area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 70 hours (AUC0-70h ) the optimal CHQ dose was determined in children of different ages compared with adults. Revised doses were re-introduced into the model to verify that overall CHQ exposure in each age band was within 5% of the predicted adult value. Simulations showed differences in drug exposure in children of different ages and adults when the same body-weight based dose is given. As such, we propose the following total cumulative doses: 35 mg/kg (CHQ base) for children 0-1 month, 47 mg/kg for 1-6 months, 55 mg/kg for 6 months-12 years, and 44 mg/kg for adolescents and adults, not to exceed 3,300 mg in any patient. Our study supports age-adjusted CHQ dosing in children with COVID-19 in order to avoid suboptimal or toxic doses. The knowledge-driven, model-informed dose selection paradigm can serve as a science-based alternative to recommend pediatric dosing when pediatric clinical trial data is absent.","Verscheijden, Laurens F M; van der Zanden, Tjitske M; van Bussel, Lianne P M; de Hoop-Sommen, Marika; Russel, Frans G M; Johnson, Trevor N; de Wildt, Saskia N",Clin Pharmacol Ther,,176
331247,How paediatric psycho-oncology is changing during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy: New approaches,2020,"Amantadine and memantine, apart from their action on cholinergic receptors and dopamine secretion, have a significant influence on the inflammatory process, including the so-called ""cytokine storm"" and reduction of apoptosis and oxidative stress Amantadine also inhibits the induction of inflammatory factors such as RANTES, activates kinase p38 of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), which inhibit viral replication It also significantly inhibits the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the bronchial epithelial cell and blocks the viroporin proton channel of the virus In addition, it has the ability to pass through the membrane of lysosomes into their interior and act as an alkalizing agent, which prevents the release of viral RNA into the cell, which may be a key element in therapeutic management Memantine also reduces inflammation, mainly in the nervous system, but also acts as a lysosomotropic factor, inhibiting viral replication However, it is important to bear in mind when undertaking amantadine or memantine therapy with side effects that may overlap with COVID- 19 symptoms, worsening the condition of patients Currently, the effectiveness of amantadine and memantine in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 symptoms has been demonstrated in a few clinical trials, mainly in patients treated for neurodegenerative diseases The obtained results are of considerable value, but require confirmation in further studies","Plusa, T.",Polski Merkuriusz Lekarski,,176

However, patients with tumor-like brain lesions requiring urgent surgery still received treatment as usual, in order to ensure ongoing neurooncologic care. From a series of 31 patients admitted for brain surgery, 3 were confirmed as infected by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the clinical outcomes of these 3 COVID-19 patients, who underwent an intracerebral biopsy in our department during April 2020. All suffered from a diffuse intraparenchymal hemorrhage postoperatively. Unfortunately, we were not able to identify a clear etiology of these postoperative complications. It could be hypothesized that an active COVID-19 infection status may be related to a higher bleeding risk. The remaining 28 neurooncologic non-COVID-19 patients underwent uneventful surgery during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: This case series reports the previously unreported and unexpected outcomes of COVID-19 patients suffering from acute hemorrhage after intracerebral biopsy procedures. Although no direct relation can yet be established, we recommend the neurosurgical community be cautious in such cases.","Degeneffe, Aurélie; Bruneau, Michaël; Spitaels, Julien; Gilis, Nathalie; De Witte, Olivier; Lubansu, Alphonse",World Neurosurg,,176

334708,COVID-19 letter to the editor: Epicardial fat inflammation as possible enhancer in COVID-19?,2021,"To forecast the time dynamics of an epidemic, we propose a discrete stochastic model that unifies and generalizes previous approaches to the subject. Viewing a given population of individuals or groups of individuals with given health state attributes as living in and moving between the nodes of a graph, we use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain techniques to simulate the movements and health state changes of the individuals according to given probabilities of stay that have been preassigned to each of the nodes. We utilize this model to either capture and predict the future geographic evolution of an epidemic in time, or the evolution of an epidemic inside a heterogeneous population which is divided into homogeneous sub-populations, or, more generally, its evolution in a combination or superposition of the previous two contexts. We also prove that when the size of the population increases and a natural hypothesis is satisfied, the stochastic process associated to our model converges to a deterministic process. Indeed, when the length of the time step used in the discrete model converges to zero, in the limit this deterministic process is driven by a differential equation yielding the evolution of the expectation value of the number of infected as a function of time. In the second part of the paper, we apply our model to study the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic. We deduce a decomposition of the function yielding the number of infectious individuals into""wavelets"", which allows to trace in time the expectation value for the number of infections inside each sub-population. Within this framework, we also discuss possible causes for the occurrence of multiple epidemiological waves.","Protin, Fr'ed'eric; Jules, Martel; Nguyen, Duc Thang; Nguyen, Hang T.T.; Piffault, Charles; Rodr'iguez, Willy; Iglesias, Susely Figueroa; To, Tat Dat; Tuschmann, Wilderich; Le, Hong Van; Yeo, Tenan; Nguyen, Tien Zung",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13463v1.pdf,176

To do so, we conducted a search of 7 databases for relevant full-text articles. A cohort study and case-control study were included. A meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the pooled odds ratio with a random-effects model. We identified studies that reported mortality among older adults with dementia and non-dementia who have COVID-19. The pooled mortality rates of dementia and non-dementia older adults infected with COVID-19 were 39% (95% CI: 0.23-0.54%, I2 = 83.48%) and 20% (95% CI: 0.16-0.25%, I2 = 83.48%), respectively.

336845,Managing children with brain tumors during the COVID-19 era: Don't stop the care!,2021,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 marked the synchronization of the world to a peculiar clock that is counting infected cases and deaths instead of hours and minutes. The pandemic, highly transmissible severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has indeed caused considerable morbidity and mortality and drastically changed our everyday lives. As we continue to become acquainted with the seventh coronavirus known to infect our species, a number of its characteristics keep surprising us. Among those is the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which ranges from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections to severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death. MAIN BODY: Data, now from patient populations, are beginning to accumulate on human genetic factors that may contribute to the observed diversified disease severity. Therefore, we deemed it prudent to review the associations between specific human genetic variants and clinical disease severity or susceptibility to infection that have been reported in the literature to date (at the time of writing this article in early August 2020 with updates in mid-September). With this work, we hope (i) to assist the fast-paced biomedical research efforts to combat the virus by critically summarizing current knowledge on the potential role of host genetics, and (ii) to help guide current genetics and genomics research towards candidate gene variants that warrant further investigation in larger studies. We found that determinants of differing severity of COVID-19 predominantly include components of the immune response to the virus, while determinants of differing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 mostly entail genes related to the initial stages of infection (i.e., binding of the cell surface receptor and entry). CONCLUSION: Elucidating the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection would allow for the stratification of individuals according to risk so that those at high risk would be prioritized for immunization, for example, if or when safe and effective vaccines are developed. Our enhanced understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms could also guide personalized therapeutics. Such knowledge is already beginning to provide clues that help explain, at least in part, current epidemiologic observations regarding the typically more severe or benign disease course in older males and children, respectively.","Anastassopoulou, Cleo; Gkizarioti, Zoi; Patrinos, George P; Tsakris, Athanasios",Hum Genomics,,176

Chest X-ray is currently accepted to be one of the reliable means for such a detection purpose. However, most of the available methods utilize large training data, and there is a need for improvement in the detection accuracy due to the limited boundary segment of the acquired images for symptom identifications. In this study, a robust and efficient method based on transfer learning techniques is proposed to identify normal and COVID-19 patients by employing small training data. Transfer learning builds accurate models in a timesaving way. First, data augmentation was performed to help the network for memorization of image details. Next, five state-of-the-art transfer learning models, AlexNet, MobileNetv2, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and Xception, with three optimizers, Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp, were implemented at various learning rates, 1e-4, 2e-4, 3e-4, and 4e-4, to reduce the probability of overfitting. All the experiments were performed on publicly available datasets with several analytical measurements attained after execution with a 10-fold cross-validation method. The results suggest that MobileNetv2 with Adam optimizer at a learning rate of 3e-4 provides an average accuracy, recall, precision, and F-score of 97%, 96.5%, 97.5%, and 97%, respectively, which are higher than those of all other combinations. The proposed method is competitive with the available literature, demonstrating that it could be used for the early detection of COVID-19 patients.","Fan, Zeming; Jamil, Mudasir; Sadiq, Muhammad Tariq; Huang, Xiwei; Yu, Xiaojun",J Healthc Eng,,176
338203,A reality check on the use of face masks during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong,2020,"The heterogeneity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) results in prognostic uncertainty concerning end-of-life discussions and optimal timing for transplantation. Effective prognostic markers and prediction models are needed. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a comprehensive assessment of the physiological changes in the respiratory, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems in a controlled laboratory environment. It has shown promise as a prognostic factor for other chronic respiratory conditions. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD. MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used to identify studies reporting the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD. Study quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Study risk of bias tool. Thirteen studies were included that reported the prognostic value of CPET in ILD. All studies reported at least one CPET parameter predicting clinical outcomes in ILD, with survival being the principal outcome assessed. Maximum oxygen consumption, reduced ventilatory efficiency and exercise-induced hypoxaemia were all reported to have prognostic value in ILD. Issues with study design (primarily due to inherent problems of retrospective studies, patient selection and presentation of numerous CPET parameters), insufficient adjustment for important confounders and inadequate statistical analyses limit the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn at this stage. There is insufficient evidence to confirm the value of CPET in facilitating ""real-world"" clinical decisions in ILD. Additional prospective studies are required to validate the putative prognostic associations reported in previous studies in carefully phenotyped patient populations.","Barratt, Shaney L; Davis, Richard; Sharp, Charles; Pauling, John D",ERJ open res,,176

338671,Tele-consultations in the wake of COVID-19 - Suggested guidelines for clinical ophthalmology,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global public health event, which has raised concerns regarding individuals' health. Individuals need to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic with guidelines on symptom recognition, home isolation, and maintain mental health. Besides routine use of mobile health (mHealth) such as accessing information to keep healthy, individuals can use mHealth services in situations requiring urgent medical care, which is defined as mHealth emergency use. It is not known whether individuals have increased their daily mHealth services emergency use as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this diary analysis study is to assess the influences of daily disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals' mHealth emergency use. The secondary purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of COVID-19-induced strain and the moderating role of promotion regulatory focus in the relationship between daily disruptions of COVID-19 and mHealth emergency use. Drawing from the cognitive activation theory of stress, we investigated the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of the influence of COVID-19-related disruptions on daily mHealth emergency use. METHODS: To test the proposed model, this study adopts the experience sampling method to collect daily data. The experience sampling method helps researchers to capture participants' fluctuations in emotions, mental engagement in an activity, and experienced stress. This study collected 550 cases nested in 110 samples in mainland China to test the conceptual model. In addition, we employed hierarchical linear modeling analysis to test the effect of COVID-19-related disruptions on mHealth emergency use. RESULTS: We found that COVID-19-related disruptions increased COVID-19-induced strain (Î³=0.24, P<.001) and mHealth emergency use on a daily basis (Î³=0.28, P<.001). COVID-19-induced daily strain mediated this relationship (effect=0.09, 95% CI 0.05-0.14). Promotion regulatory focus moderated the relationship between COVID-19-induced strain and mHealth emergency use (Î³=0.35, P=.02). In addition, the indirect relationship between disruptions and mHealth emergency use intentions through COVID-19-induced strain is contingent upon promotion regulatory focus: this relationship was stronger in those with high promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.19) than in those with low promotion regulatory focus (effect=0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Event disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic induced mHealth emergency use intention through increased psychological strain. Furthermore, individuals' promotion regulatory focus amplified this indirect relationship. Our findings extend our understanding of the factors underlying mHealth emergency use intention and illustrate the potential contingent role of promotion regulatory focus in the cognitive activation theory of stress. This study also opens avenues for future research on mHealth emergency use intention in other countries and cultural settings.","Zhang, Zhenduo; Zhang, Li; Zheng, Junwei; Xiao, Huan; Li, Zhigang",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,176

However, data on the impact of mHealth tools on the QoL in people living with HIV are limited to the evaluation of SMS text messaging; these are infeasible in high-illiteracy settings. OBJECTIVE: The primary and secondary outcomes were to determine the impact of interactive voice response (IVR) technology on Medical Outcomes Study HIV QoL scores and viral suppression at 12 months, respectively. METHODS: Within the Call for Life study, ART-experienced and ART-naïve people living with HIV commencing ART were randomized (1:1 ratio) to the control (no IVR support) or intervention arm (daily adherence and pre-appointment reminders, health information tips, and option to report symptoms). The software evaluated was Call for Life Uganda, an IVR technology that is based on the Mobile Technology for Community Health open-source software. Eligibility criteria for participation included access to a phone, fluency in local languages, and provision of consent. The differences in differences (DIDs) were computed, adjusting for baseline HIV RNA and CD4. RESULTS: Overall, 600 participants (413 female, 68.8%) were enrolled and followed-up for 12 months. In the intervention arm of 300 participants, 298 (99.3%) opted for IVR and 2 (0.7%) chose SMS text messaging as the mode of receiving reminders and health tips. At 12 months, there was no overall difference in the QoL between the intervention and control arms (DID=0.0; P=.99) or HIV RNA (DID=0.01; P=.94). At 12 months, 124 of the 256 (48.4%) active participants had picked up at least 50% of the calls. In the active intervention participants, high users (received >75% of reminders) had overall higher QoL compared to low users (received <25% of reminders) (92.2 versus 87.8, P=.02). Similarly, high users also had higher QoL scores in the mental health domain (93.1 versus 86.8, P=.008) and better appointment keeping. Similarly, participants with moderate use (51%-75%) had better viral suppression at 12 months (80/94, 85% versus 11/19, 58%, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was high uptake and acceptability of the IVR tool. While we found no overall difference in the QoL and viral suppression between study arms, people living with HIV with higher usage of the tool showed greater improvements in QoL, viral suppression, and appointment keeping. With the declining resources available to HIV programs and the increasing number of people living with HIV accessing ART, IVR technology could be used to support patient care. The tool may be helpful in situations where physical consultations are infeasible, including the current COVID epidemic.

339484,Best practice in the implementation of telehealth-based supportive cancer care: Using research evidence and discipline-based guidance,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has already killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. OBJECT: The principal intent of this work was to investigate lead compounds by screening natural product library (NPASS) for possible treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: Pharmacophore features were used to screen a large database to get a small dataset for structure-based virtual screening of natural product compounds. In the structure-based screening, molecular docking was performed to find a potent inhibitor molecule against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6Y7M). The predicted lead compound was further subjected to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to check the stability of the leads compound with the evolution of time. RESULTS: In pharmacophore-based virtual screening, 2,361 compounds were retained out of 30,927. In the structure-based screening, the lead compounds were filtered based on their docking scores. Among the 2,360 compounds, 12 lead compounds were selected based on their docking score. Kazinol T with NPASS ID: NPC474104 showed the highest docking score of -14.355 and passed criteria of Lipinski's drug-like parameters. Monitoring ADMET properties, Kazinol T showed its safety for consumption. Docking of Kazinol T with two Asian mutants (R60C and I152V) showed variations in binding and energy parameters. Normal mode analysis for ligand-bound and unbound form of protease along with its mutants, revealed displacement and correlation parameters for C-alpha atoms. MD simulation results showed that all ligand-protein complexes remained intact and stable in a dynamic environment with negative Gibbs free energy. CONCLUSIONS: The natural product Kazinol T was a predicted lead compound against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and will be the possible treatment for COVID-19.","Muhammad, Ijaz; Rahman, Noor; Niaz, Sadaf; Basharat, Zarrin; Rastrelli, Luca; Jayanthi, Sivaraman; Efferth, Thomas; Khan, Haroon",Comput Biol Med,,176
339616,Oncology and COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and it has reached to more than 14.5 million cases. Although Hubei province is the epicenter of China, little is known about epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in other areas in Hubei province around Wuhan. In addition, the virological data, particularly the factors associated with viral shedding of COVID-19 has not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Tianmen city, and identify risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding of COVID-19. METHODS: Inpatients with COVID-19 admitted before February 9, 2020 were included. Characteristics were compared between patients with early and late viral RNA shedding. Multivariate cox regression model was used to investigate variables associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were included. About 8.2% patients were categorized as critical degree of severity. All patients received antiviral therapy, with arbidol and interferon being the commonest. About 38.3% and 16.9% patients were treated with corticosteroid and immunoglobulin, respectively. Time from onset to admission (HR = 0.829, P < 0.001), and administration of corticosteroid (HR = 0.496, P = 0.002), arbidol (HR = 2.605, P = 0.008) and oseltamivir (HR = 0.416, P < 0.001) were independently associated with duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of patients from Tianmen are relatively mild. Treatment should be started as early as possible, but corticosteroid and oseltamivir should be initiated with caution. In addition, clinical trials on arbidol should be conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness.","Hu, Fuying; Yin, Gang; Chen, Youping; Song, Jiangqin; Ye, Maosong; Liu, Jie; Chen, Cuicui; Song, Yuanlin; Tang, Xinjun; Zhang, Yong",Clin Respir J,,176
339726,"Reply to: ""Liver tests abnormalities in COVID-19: trick or treat?""",2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has emerged and affected health care worldwide. Patients with cancer and other comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this infection. CASE: In this case report we present a 75-year-old patient with a localized gastric adenocarcinoma, currently treated by perioperative chemotherapy regimen, who had an rT-PCR proven novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed in order to assess disease severity; however, the findings were not altered in accordance with the findings associated with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS: On the first hospital day the patient had a low grade fever with chills. Subsequently a pharmacological therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was started. After pharmacologic and symptomatic treatment, the patient was reassessed for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results. At discharge, the patient was ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine. After 57 days of follow-up, the patient underwent a new rapid antibody test by Acro Biotech inc., which gave negative results for IgM and IgG. CONCLUSION: An infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a more severe disease in patients with comorbidities and cancer; however, this case patient had a mild course of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this case report is to share the information on the clinical course and outcomes of a patient with malignancy.

To comprehensively define the cell types, mechanisms, and mediators driving fibrotic remodeling in lungs with PF, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of single-cell suspensions from 10 nonfibrotic control and 20 PF lungs. Analysis of 114,396 cells identified 31 distinct cell subsets/states. We report that a remarkable shift in epithelial cell phenotypes occurs in the peripheral lung in PF and identify several previously unrecognized epithelial cell phenotypes, including a KRT5- /KRT17 + pathologic, ECM-producing epithelial cell population that was highly enriched in PF lungs. Multiple fibroblast subtypes were observed to contribute to ECM expansion in a spatially discrete manner. Together, these data provide high-resolution insights into the complexity and plasticity of the distal lung epithelium in human disease and indicate a diversity of epithelial and mesenchymal cells contribute to pathologic lung fibrosis.","Habermann, Arun C; Gutierrez, Austin J; Bui, Linh T; Yahn, Stephanie L; Winters, Nichelle I; Calvi, Carla L; Peter, Lance; Chung, Mei-I; Taylor, Chase J; Jetter, Christopher; Raju, Latha; Roberson, Jamie; Ding, Guixiao; Wood, Lori; Sucre, Jennifer M S; Richmond, Bradley W; Serezani, Ana P; McDonnell, Wyatt J; Mallal, Simon B; Bacchetta, Matthew J; Loyd, James E; Shaver, Ciara M; Ware, Lorraine B; Bremner, Ross; Walia, Rajat; Blackwell, Timothy S; Banovich, Nicholas E; Kropski, Jonathan A",Sci.

341379,Few insights on the post-COVID-19 problem,2021,"Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus disease, named COVID-19, has become a great global public health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Yet, there is no specific vaccine or treatment for this COVID-19 where anti-disease measures rely on preventing or slowing the transmission of infection from one person to another. In particularly, there is a growing effort to prevent or reduce transmission to frontline healthcare professionals. However, it is becoming an increasingly international concern respecting the shortage in the supply chain of critical single-use personal protective equipment (PPE). To that scope, we aim in the present work to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest 3D printing efforts against COVID-19, including professional additive manufacturing (AM) providers, makers and designers in the 3D printing community. Through this review paper, the response to several questions and inquiries regarding the following issues are addressed: technical factors connected with AM processes; recommendations for testing and characterizing medical devices that additively manufactured; AM materials that can be used for medical devices; biological concerns of final 3D printed medical parts, comprising biocompatibility, cleaning and sterility; and limitations of AM technology.","Tarfaoui, Mostapha; Nachtane, Mourad; Goda, Ibrahim; Qureshi, Yumna; Benyahia, Hamza",Mater.,,176
341665,This Article Corrects: “Identifying Patients at Greatest Risk of Mortality due to COVID-19: A New England Perspective”,2020,"Several adamantanes have established actions against coronaviruses. Amantadine, rimantadine, bananins and the structurally related memantine are effective against human respiratory coronavirus HCoV-OC43, bovine coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and a spiroadamantane amine is effective against the coronavirus strain 229E. Molecular docking studies suggest that amantadine may block the viral E protein channel, leading to impaired viral propagation. Additionally, amantadine analogues may inhibit entry of the virus into the host cell by increasing the pH of the endosomes and thus inhibiting the action of host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L. High-throughput drug screen gene expression analysis identified compounds able to down-regulate Cathepsin L expression where the fifth most potent agent of 466 candidates was amantadine. Amantadine inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 replication in vitro but does not inhibit the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Adamantanes also may act against coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via antagonism of glutamate (NMDA) and the &#945;-7 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor located on bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. As an NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine has the potential to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into these cell populations. Amantadine and memantine are widely employed for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and a pathophysiologic link between the antiviral and anti-Parkinson actions of amantadine has been entertained. Case reports involving 23 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a range of co-morbidities including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and severe cognitive impairment reveal significant potential benefits of amantadine and memantine for the prevention and/or treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 and its neurological complications.","Butterworth, Roger F",Drugs R D,,176

A new (temporary) standard operating procedure was developed in conjunction with Cancer Alliance South West to introduce the quantitative faecal immunochemical test (qFIT) as an indicator for diagnostic testing after the majority of diagnostic services were suspended or drastically reduced. Patients would then have their investigation(s) deferred on the basis of a negative result (<10 mcg Hb/g). This cohort (n=120) were revisited once diagnostic services were resumed and referred for CT examination.

We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation model for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating policies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is loaded with an 8M+ synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study to fit ride-hail services and bike-share. The road network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual daily traffic for a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed differences of 7.2% on freeways and 17.1% on arterials, leading to average difference of +1.8% from the East River screenline. Validation against transit stations shows an 8% difference from observed counts and median difference of 29% for select road link counts. The model was used to evaluate a congestion pricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggested a much higher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing policy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan differently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan: benefits from congestion reduction benefit the former by about 50% more than the latter, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing revenues. These results and open-source tool will help policymakers in New York City and support the need for multi-agent simulation in travel demand modeling of emerging transportation technologies and policies.","He, Brian Yueshuai; Zhou, Jinkai; Ma, Ziyi; Wang, Ding; Sha, Di; Lee, Mina; Chow, Joseph Y.

Pillars of the plan include crisis management, enhancing surveillance systems and contact tracing, case and hospital management, raising community awareness, and quarantine and entry points. To identify the impact of the implementation of the plan on epidemic mitigation, a literature review was performed of studies published from Egypt in the early stage of the pandemic. In addition, data for patients with COVID-19 from February to July 2020 were obtained from the National Egyptian Surveillance system and studied to describe the situation in the early stage of the epidemic in Egypt. The lessons learned indicated that the single most important key to success in early-stage epidemic containment is the commitment of all partners to a predeveloped and agreed-upon preparedness plan. This information could be useful for other countries in the region and worldwide in mitigating future anticipated ARI epidemics and pandemics.

Currently, severe and nonsevere COVID-19 types are differentiated by only a few features, which do not comprehensively characterize the complicated pathological, physiological, and immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different disease types. In addition, these type-defining features may not be readily testable at the time of diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to use a machine learning approach to understand COVID-19 more comprehensively, accurately differentiate severe and nonsevere COVID-19 clinical types based on multiple medical features, and provide reliable predictions of the clinical type of the disease. METHODS: For this study, we recruited 214 confirmed patients with nonsevere COVID-19 and 148 patients with severe COVID-19. The clinical characteristics (26 features) and laboratory test results (26 features) upon admission were acquired as two input modalities. Exploratory analyses demonstrated that these features differed substantially between two clinical types. Machine learning random forest models based on all the features in each modality as well as on the top 5 features in each modality combined were developed and validated to differentiate COVID-19 clinical types. RESULTS: Using clinical and laboratory results independently as input, the random forest models achieved >90% and >95% predictive accuracy, respectively. The importance scores of the input features were further evaluated, and the top 5 features from each modality were identified (age, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, gender, and diabetes for the clinical features modality, and dimerized plasmin fragment D, high sensitivity troponin I, absolute neutrophil count, interleukin 6, and lactate dehydrogenase for the laboratory testing modality, in descending order). Using these top 10 multimodal features as the only input instead of all 52 features combined, the random forest model was able to achieve 97% predictive accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on how the human body reacts to SARS-CoV-2 infection as a unit and provide insights on effectively evaluating the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 based on more common medical features when gold standard features are not available. We suggest that clinical information can be used as an initial screening tool for self-evaluation and triage, while laboratory test results should be applied when accuracy is the priority.","Chen, Yuanfang; Ouyang, Liu; Bao, Forrest S; Li, Qian; Han, Lei; Zhang, Hengdong; Zhu, Baoli; Ge, Yaorong; Robinson, Patrick; Xu, Ming; Liu, Jie; Chen, Shi",J Med Internet Res,,176

348520,Hypertension associated risks during the COVID-19 pandemic: The patients' perception,2021,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern whose detection in recovered asymptomatic patients is dependent on accurate diagnosis as it enables the estimation of the susceptibility of the population to the infection. This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. METHODS: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The choice of antigen is an important aspect in optimizing the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of rNP ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies seems promising, but comparison of the results with those of WVA ELISA is crucial for accurate test development prior to commercialization. IgG serology using several assays, and with the spectral patterns of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in confusing information that must be clarified before the establishment of diagnostic serology criteria.","Meireles, Luciana Regina; da Silva, Angélica Moura Freixeira; Carvalho, Camila Aparecida; Kesper, Norival; Galisteo, Andrés Jimenez; Soares, Camila Pereira; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Morganti, Lígia; Chura-Chambi, Rosa Maria; de Andrade, Heitor Franco",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,176

But there is huge neglect of the guidelines by people which is resulting in daily increase in an infected patient. It is very difficult to monitor the people manually in these areas. So, in this paper, we propose an idea to monitor people using the automation process to identify the people who are wearing the mask and who are not. Many new trained models are being devised using pre-existing datasets to make the algorithm as accurate as possible. These models have made it possible to extract even the pixel details.

DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional comparative study. METHODS: Setting: institutional. PATIENTS: 232 patients and their caregivers. Four groups were created based on better eye characteristics: blind (best-corrected distance visual acuity [BCDVA] <3/60 or visual field <10 central degrees); severe VI (BCDVA &#8804;3/60 to <6/60; vertical cup-to-disc ratio &#8805;0.85 or neuroretinal rim width &#8804;0.1); moderate VI (BCDVA &#8804;6/60 to <6/18); or no or mild VI (controls: BCDVA &#8805;6/18) based on International Classification of Diseases-10 criteria and Foster and Quigley's consensus definition of glaucoma. PROCEDURE: telephone questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: differences in perceptions and implications of COVID-19 infection across various levels of VI. Caregiver perceptions were a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 232 participants, with 58 participants in each VI group. Mean age was 58.9 ± 13.2 years old. Greater degrees of VI were associated with older age (P = .008) and lower education level (P = .046). Blind participants more commonly perceived vision as a risk factor for contracting COVID-19 (P = .045), were concerned about access to health care (P <.001), obtained news through word of mouth (P <.001), and less commonly wore masks (P = .003). Controls more commonly performed frequent handwashing (P = .001), were aware of telemedicine (P = .029), and had fewer concerns about social interactions (P = .020) than groups with substantial VI. All caregivers reported more frequent patient care since the COVID-19 pandemic began. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic might have had a disproportionate impact on the visually impaired, and evidence-based assessments of COVID-19 health outcomes in this population are warranted.","Shalaby, Wesam S; Odayappan, Annamalai; Venkatesh, Rengaraj; Swenor, Bonnielin K; Ramulu, Pradeep Y; Robin, Alan L; Srinivasan, Kavitha; Shukla, Aakriti Garg",Am J Ophthalmol,,176
351838,[Guidelines for restarting elective orthopaedic surgery post Covid-19 in Mexico],2020,"Estimating the lengths-of-stay (LoS) of hospitalised COVID-19 patients is key for predicting the hospital beds' demand and planning mitigation strategies, as overwhelming the healthcare systems has critical consequences for disease mortality. However, accurately mapping the time-to-event of hospital outcomes, such as the LoS in the intensive care unit (ICU), requires understanding patient trajectories while adjusting for covariates and observation bias, such as incomplete data. Standard methods, such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator, require prior assumptions that are untenable given current knowledge. Using real-time surveillance data from the first weeks of the COVID-19 epidemic in Galicia (Spain), we aimed to model the time-to-event and event probabilities of patients' hospitalised, without parametric priors and adjusting for individual covariates. We applied a non-parametric mixture cure model and compared its performance in estimating hospital ward (HW)/ICU LoS to the performances of commonly used methods to estimate survival. We showed that the proposed model outperformed standard approaches, providing more accurate ICU and HW LoS estimates. Finally, we applied our model estimates to simulate COVID-19 hospital demand using a Monte Carlo algorithm. We provided evidence that adjusting for sex, generally overlooked in prediction models, together with age is key for accurately forecasting HW and ICU occupancy, as well as discharge or death outcomes.","López-Cheda, Ana; Jácome, María-Amalia; Cao, Ricardo; De Salazar, Pablo M",Epidemiol Infect,,176

Just four months later, more than 100,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, the resulting disease. The genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is a new Betacoronavirus, closely related to bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses. Clinical data from hospitals in China have revealed that approximately 10% of the infected patients have severe disease requiring intensive care. Since containment of the outbreak may have partially failed due to asymptomatic transmission, it is imperative to accelerate the development of rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapeutics for the COVID-19 epidemic.","Kikuchi, Toshiaki",Respir Investig,,176

Processing medical images from different collaborators is an example of such applications, in which chest X-ray data are processed to extract knowledge. It is not easy to process data and get the required information in real time using central processing techniques when data get very large in size. In this paper, real-time data are filtered and forwarded to the right processing node by using the proposed topic-based hierarchical publish/subscribe messaging middleware in the distributed scalable network of collaborating computation nodes instead of classical approaches of centralized computation. This enables processing streaming medical data in near real time and makes a warning system possible. End users have the capability of filtering/searching. The returned search results can be images (COVID-19 or non-COVID-19) and their meta-data are gender and age. Here, COVID-19 is detected using a novel capsule network-based model from chest X-ray images. This middleware allows for a smaller search space as well as shorter times for obtaining search results.","Eken, Süleyman",Soft comput,,176

We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland in the spring of 2020 to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.AimOur objective was to determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.MethodsA pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study comprised samples from 3,500 blood donors collected in Scotland between 17 March and 18 May 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.ResultsAll samples collected on 17 March 2020 (n = 500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in six of 500 donors from 23 to 26 March. The number of samples containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after 5-6 April until the end of the study on 18 May. We found that infections were concentrated in certain postcodes, indicating that outbreaks of infection were extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remained comparatively untouched by the epidemic.ConclusionAlthough blood donors are not representative of the overall population, we demonstrated that serosurveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Thompson, Craig P; Grayson, Nicholas E; Paton, Robert S; Bolton, Jai S; Lourenço, José; Penman, Bridget S; Lee, Lian N; Odon, Valerie; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Chinnakannan, Senthil; Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Edmans, Matthew; Fyfe, Alex; Imlach, Carol; Kooblall, Kreepa; Lim, Nicholas; Liu, Chang; López-Camacho, César; McInally, Carol; McNaughton, Anna L; Ramamurthy, Narayan; Ratcliff, Jeremy; Supasa, Piyada; Sampson, Oliver; Wang, Beibei; Mentzer, Alexander J; Turner, Marc; Semple, Malcolm G; Baillie, Kenneth; Harvala, Heli; Screaton, Gavin R; Temperton, Nigel; Klenerman, Paul; Jarvis, Lisa M; Gupta, Sunetra; Simmonds, Peter",Euro surveill,,176

356571,OCD during COVID-19: Understanding clinical and non-clinical anxiety in the community,2021,"Dehydrocorydaline (DHC), one of the main active components of Corydalis yanhusuo, is an important remedy for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Our previous study revealed a higher unbound concentration of DHC in the heart than plasma of mice after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or DHC, but the underlying uptake mechanism remains unelucidated. In our investigations, we studied the transport mechanism of DHC in transgenic cells, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and animal experiments. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, we found that uptake transporters expressed in the mouse heart include organic cation transporter 1/3 (OCT1/3) and carnitine/organic cation transporter 1/2 (OCTN1/2). The accumulation experiments in transfected cells showed that DHC was a substrate of OCT1 and OCT3, with Km of 11.29 {plus minus} 2.0 and 8.96 {plus minus} 3.3 µM, respectively, but not a substrate of OCTN1/2. Additionally, a higher efflux level (1.71-fold of MDCK-mock) of DHC was observed in MDCK-MDR1 cells than in MDCK-mock cells. Therefore, DHC is a weak substrate for MDR1. Studies using primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed that OCT1/3 inhibitors (quinidine, decynium-22, and levo-tetrahydropalmatine) prevented the accumulation of DHC, while OCTN2 inhibitors (mildronate and l-carnitine) did not affect its accumulation. Moreover, the co-administration of OCT1/3 inhibitors (levo-tetrahydropalmatine, THP) decreased the concentration of DHC in the mouse heart. Based on these findings, DHC may be accumulated partly by OCT1/3 transporters and excreted by MDR1 in the heart. THP could alter the distribution of DHC in the mouse heart. Significance Statement We reported the cardiac transport mechanism of dehydrocorydaline, highly distributed to the heart after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or dehydrocorydaline only. Dehydrocorydaline (an OCT1/3 and MDR1 substrate) accumulation in primary cardiomyocytes may be related to the transport activity of OCT1/3. This ability, hampered by selective inhibitors (THP, an inhibitor of OCT1/3), causes nearly 40% reduction in exposure of the heart to dehydrocorydaline. These results suggest that OCT1/3 may contribute to the uptake of dehydrocorydaline in the heart.","Chen, Yingchun; Li, Cui; Yi, Yaodong; Du, Weijuan; Jiang, Huidi; Zeng, Su; Zhou, Hui",Drug metab. dispos,,176
356584,The management of hematologic malignancies during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Biomarkers to prognosticate the outcomes and guide the treatment of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are currently required. We aimed to investigate whether the dynamic variation of cytokines was associated with the survival of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 40 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU in Wuhan, China. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected, and serum cytokines were kinetically assessed. A multivariable-adjusted generalized linear regression model was used to analyze the differences in serum cytokine levels between survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Among the 40 patients included, we found a positive correlation between multiple cytokines. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) in non-survivors were consistently elevated compared to those in the survivors. Kinetic variations in IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were associated with a fatal outcome in patients with severe COVID-19, independent of sex, age, absolute lymphocyte count, direct bilirubin, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer as well as the use of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes in serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 levels were associated with survival in patients in the ICU, and could serve as a predictive biomarker to determine the therapeutic options for patients with severe COVID-19.","Li, Jia; Rong, Liu; Cui, Ran; Feng, Jiaqi; Jin, Yuyang; Chen, Xiaoxiang; Xu, Renying",Ann. palliat. med.

As pandemics such as COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) progress there is an increasing need for effective virtual care and RMT to support patient care while they are at home. METHODS: The authors describe their work in conducting literature reviews by searching PubMed.gov and the grey literature for articles, and government websites with guidelines describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the progression of the disease. The reviews focused on identifying gaps where RMT could be applied in novel ways and formed the basis for the subsequent modelling of use cases for applying RMT described in this paper. RESULTS: The work was conducted in the context of a new Home of the Future laboratory which has been set up at the University of Victoria. The literature review led to the development of a number of object-oriented models for deploying RMT. This modeling is being used for a number of purposes, including for education of students in health infomatics as well as testing of new use cases for RMT with industrial collaborators and projects within the smart home of the future laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Object-oriented modeling, based on analysis of gaps in the literature, was found to be a useful approach for describing, communicating and teaching about potential new uses of RMT.","Borycki, Elizabeth M; Kushniruk, Andre W; Kletke, Ryan; Vimarlund, Vivian; Senathirajah, Yalini; Quintana, Yuri",Yearb. med. inform.

In total, the number of deaths is almost 3 million, but continuously rising. Although COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, SARS-CoV-2 infects also endothelial cells in the pulmonary capillaries. This affects the integrity of the endothelium and increases vascular permeability. In addition, there are serious indirect consequences, like disruption of endothelial cells' junctions leading to micro-bleeds and uncontrolled blood clotting. The impact of COVID-19 in people with rare chronic cardiovascular diseases is unknown so far, and interesting to assess, because the virus may cause additional complications in these patients. The aim of the present work was to study the COVID-19 infection among the patients with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). A retrospective study was carried out in a 138 HHT patients' sample attending an Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) reference consult.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between chest CT findings and the clinical conditions of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Data on 101 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively collected from four institutions in Hunan, China. Basic clinical characteristics and detailed imaging features were evaluated and compared between two groups on the basis of clinical status: nonemergency (mild or common disease) and emergency (severe or fatal disease). RESULTS. Patients 21-50 years old accounted for most (70.2%) of the cohort, and five (5.0%) patients had disease associated with a family outbreak. Most patients (78.2%) had fever as the onset symptom. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had typical imaging features, such as ground-glass opacities (GGO) (87 [86.1%]) or mixed GGO and consolidation (65 [64.4%]), vascular enlargement in the lesion (72 [71.3%]), and traction bronchiectasis (53 [52.5%]). Lesions present on CT images were more likely to have a peripheral distribution (88 [87.1%]) and bilateral involvement (83 [82.2%]) and be lower lung predominant (55 [54.5%]) and multifocal (55 [54.5%]). Patients in the emergency group were older than those in the non-emergency group. Architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and CT involvement score aided in evaluation of the severity and extent of the disease. CONCLUSION. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia have typical imaging features that can be helpful in early screening of highly suspected cases and in evaluation of the severity and extent of disease. Most patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have GGO or mixed GGO and consolidation and vascular enlargement in the lesion. Lesions are more likely to have peripheral distribution and bilateral involvement and be lower lung predominant and multifocal.

357776,COVID-19 control in China during mass population movements at New Year,2020,"Fertilization of freshwater fish occurs in the environment which negatively affects a lifespan of gametes mostly due to the osmotic shock; therefore, male gametes should reach the female gamete, as soon as possible. The existence of mechanisms controlling the encounter of gametes would be highly expedient in this case. By analogy with other species for which guidance was demonstrated, it is likely that this control may be performed by ovarian fluid or substances released by eggs. The aim was to study the effect of ovarian fluid and egg-released substances on spermatozoa behavior in sterlet. It was found that the presence of a particular concentration of ovarian fluid (30% solution in water) had an inhibiting effect on spermatozoa motility initiation. Lower concentrations of the ovarian fluid improved the longevity of spermatozoa and did not affect their trajectories. Test of chemotactic response (using a microcapillary injection of fluids into the suspension of motile spermatozoa) showed no effect of ovarian fluid on spermatozoa behavior, while at the same time, the attracting effect of the egg-conditioned medium was evident (i.e., due to some substances released from the eggs during their contact with freshwater). The results of the fertilization test showed that the presence of ovarian fluid prevented the eggs from losing the fertilizing ability due to the contact with water, as well as promoted the spermatozoa to fertilize the eggs during a longer period of time. Thus, the combined physicochemical action of ""female factors"" affects sterlet gametes during fertilization and may be involved in the guidance and selection mechanisms.","Kholodnyy, Vitaliy; Dzyuba, Borys; Gadêlha, Hermes; Cosson, Jacky; Boryshpolets, Sergii",,,176
357998,CT chest - A rapid screening tool in COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The outbreak of the unprecedented Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic calls for innovative risk assessment and mapping approaches to prompt public messaging. Most of the existing approaches aim to present population risks associated with geographic areas (e.g., county), thus providing limited values to guide individuals to take proactive measures against COVID-19. To better facilitate the general public to make informed decisions on daily activity plans, we propose an activity-based spatiotemporal risk mapping approach to capture and represent exposure risk at a personal level. This approach leverages the classical space-time representations to capture personal activity space and measures exposure risk in such activity space. This approach further implements geovisualization designs to communicate measured exposure information. To illustrate the usability of the approach, we have conducted a case study in Denver, Colorado with COVID-19 data from October 2020 and four representative travel profiles.

The prevalence and risk factors of MRSA infection is not homogenous across the globe. Objective: To find the risk factors of MRSA infection among hospitalized patients. Methods: Cross-sectional case control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in India. The risk factors were collected using checklist from 130 MRSA and 130 Methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infected patients. The pathogens were isolated from the wound swabs according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results: Both the groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, diabetic status, undergoing invasive procedures, urinary catheterization and smoking (p>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed surgical treatment (OR 4.355; CI 1.03, 18.328; p=0.045), prolonged hospitalization (OR 0.307; CI 0.11, 0.832; p=0.020), tracheostomy (OR 5.298, CI 1.16, 24.298; p=0.032), pressure/venous ulcer (OR 7.205; CI 1.75, 29.606; p=0.006) and previous hospitalization (OR 2.883; CI 1.25, 6.631; p=0.013) as significant risk factors for MRSA infection. Conclusion: Surgical treatment, prolonged and history of hospitalization, having tracheostomy for ventilation and pressure/venous ulcer were the key risk factors. Therefore, special attention has to be given to the preventable risk factors while caring for hospitalized patients to prevent MRSA infection.","Thimmappa, Latha; Bhat, Anil; Hande, Manjunatha; Mukhopadhyay, Chiranjay; Devi, Elsa; Nayak, Baby; George, Anice",Afr Health Sci,,176

SETTING: Province of Granada (Spain). POPULATION: COVID-19 patients hospitalized, admitted to ICU, recovered and died from March 15 to September 22, 2020. STUDY VARIABLES: The number of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalized or admitted to ICU for COVID-19. RESULTS: The data reported by hospitals was used to develop a mathematical model that reflects the flow of the population among the different interest groups in relation to COVID-19. This tool allows to analyse different scenarios based on socio-health restriction measures, and to forecast the number of people infected, hospitalized and admitted to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The mathematical model is capable of providing predictions on the evolution of the COVID-19 sufficiently in advance as to anticipate the peaks of prevalence and hospital and ICU care demands, and also the appearance of periods in which the care for non-COVID patients could be intensified.","Garrido, J M; Martínez-Rodríguez, D; Rodríguez-Serrano, F; Pérez-Villares, J M; Ferreiro-Marzal, A; Jiménez-Quintana, M M; Villanueva, R J","Med. intensiva (Madr., Ed. impr.)",,176
358836,COVID-19 Cardiac Injury: An Important Cause of COVID-19 Related Morbidityand Mortality,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. More evidence concerning extrapulmonary transmission routes such as the eyes is urgently needed. Although the humoral immune response is important in the viral containment, the local response in tears has not yet been studied. The aim of our study was twofold: to assess the prevalence of both SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in tear fluid. In a first series, nasopharyngeal sampling and tear sampling by Schirmer test strips were performed in 26 acutely ill patients with COVID-19 to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription PCR. In a second series, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum and tear fluid of convalescent individuals (n=22) were compared with control individuals (n=15) by ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in tears of 7/26 (26.9%) patients with COVID-19. None of them had ocular symptoms. Convalescent individuals displayed a significant higher ratio of IgG (p&lt;0.0001) and IgA (p=0.0068) in tears compared with control individuals. A sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 93.3% was observed for IgG, and 59.1% and 100% for IgA. Our results demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and a local IgG and IgA immune response in tear fluid. These data confirm the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through tear fluid and the importance of the eye as a first defence against SARS-CoV-2, indicating the potential of tears as a non-invasive surrogate for serum in monitoring the host immune response. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

359486,The rationale for current pharmacotherapy of covid-19,2020,"The emergence and quick spread of SARS-CoV-2 has pointed at a low capacity response for testing large populations in many countries, in line of material, technical and staff limitations. The traditional RT-qPCR diagnostic test remains the reference method and is by far the most widely used test. These assays are limited to a few probe sets, require large sample PCR reaction volumes, along with an expensive and time-consuming RNA extraction step. Here we describe a quantitative nanofluidic assay that overcomes some of these shortcomings, based on the BiomarkTM instrument from Fluidigm. This system offers the possibility of performing 4608 qPCR end-points in a single run, equivalent to 192 clinical samples combined with 12 pairs of primers/probe sets in duplicate, thus allowing the monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 including the detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as the detection other pathogens and/or host cellular responses (virus receptors, response markers, microRNAs). The 10 nL-range volume of BiomarkTM reactions is compatible with sensitive and reproducible reactions that can be easily and cost-effectively adapted to various RT-qPCR configurations and sets of primers/probe. Finally, we also evaluated the use of inactivating lysis buffers composed of various detergents in the presence or absence of proteinase K to assess the compatibility of these buffers with a direct reverse transcription enzymatic step and we propose several protocols, bypassing the need for RNA purification. We advocate that the combined utilization of an optimized processing buffer and a high-throughput real-time PCR device would contribute to improve the turn-around-time to deliver the test results to patients and increase the SARS-CoV-2 testing capacities.","Fassy, Julien; Lacoux, Caroline; Leroy, Sylvie; Noussair, Latifa; Hubac, Sylvain; Degoutte, Aurélien; Vassaux, Georges; Leclercq, Vianney; Rouquié, David; Marquette, Charles-Hugo; Rottman, Martin; Touron, Patrick; Lemoine, Antoinette; Herrmann, Jean-Louis; Barbry, Pascal; Nahon, Jean-Louis; Zaragosi, Laure-Emmanuelle; Mari, Bernard",PLoS One,,176
360678,"COVID-19 era of misinformation: When your family does not trust you, will your patients?",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had a major impact on child abuse and neglect (CAN) in the U.S. leading to a change in the number of reported screened-in CAN investigations, missed prevention cases, and missed CAN cases. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the deficit number of CAN investigations and resultant estimated number of missed prevention and CAN cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. from March 2020 to December 2020. METHODS: Secondary data analyses of administrative child welfare data from January 2013 to December 2020 from New York City, Florida, New Jersey and Wisconsin were conducted. Spline regression modeling controlling for autocorrelation was utilized to explore any significant changes once the pandemic began in March 2020 in the number of screened-in CAN investigations. The seven-year monthly average of screen-in CAN investigations for March through December from 2013 to 2019 was calculated and compared to the numbers of CAN investigations for March 2020 to December 2020. The resultant number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases was estimated for the four jurisdictions and used to approximate the number of missed prevention cases and CAN cases in the U.S., as well as the projected estimation of national lifetime economic costs. RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, there were insignificant monthly increases of 0.7 CAN investigations in NYC and 6.2 CAN investigations in Florida, a significant monthly increase 4.2 CAN investigations in New Jersey and an insignificant monthly decrease in 0.6 CAN investigations in Wisconsin. Once the pandemic began, there were significant monthly decreases (p < .001) in each of the four jurisdictions, including 1425.6 fewer CAN investigations in NYC, 3548.0 fewer CAN investigations in Florida, 963.0 fewer CAN investigations in New Jersey and 529.1 fewer CAN investigations in Wisconsin. There were an estimated 60,791 fewer CAN investigations in these four jurisdictions from March 2020 to December 2020 of which there were approximately 18,540 missed prevention and CAN cases suggesting up to $4.2 billion in lifetime economic costs. It was estimated that were 623,137 children not investigated for CAN in the U.S. during the same 10-month period. This suggests that there were an estimated 85,993 children were missed for prevention services and about 104,040 children were missed for CAN with a potential lifetime economic impact of up to $48.1 billion in the U.S. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a precipitous drop in CAN investigations where almost 200,000 children are estimated to have been missed for prevention services and CAN in a 10-month period. There are opportunities for the child welfare jurisdictions to work with partner education, public health, social service and other providers to strategically approach this very grave issue in order to mitigate its impact on this very vulnerable population.","Nguyen, Loc H",Child Abuse Negl,,176

This infection has been spreading alarmingly by causing huge social and economic disruption. In order to response quickly, the inhibitors already designed against different targets of previous human coronavirus infections will be a great starting point for anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this study, our approach integrates different ligand based drug design strategies of some in-house chemicals. The study design was composed of some major aspects: (a) classification QSAR based data mining of diverse SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLpro) inhibitors, (b) QSAR based virtual screening (VS) to identify in-house molecules that could be effective against putative target SARS-CoV PLpro and (c) finally validation of hits through receptor-ligand interaction analysis. This approach could be used to aid in the process of COVID-19 drug discovery. It will introduce key concepts, set the stage for QSAR based screening of active molecules against putative SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme. Moreover, the QSAR models reported here would be of further use to screen large database. This study will assume that the reader is approaching the field of QSAR and molecular docking based drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with little prior knowledge.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We analysed the abrupt reduction in fishing pressure of the mixed small-scale and industrial fisheries in the Catalan Sea, Spanish Mediterranean, and resulting ecological and economic impacts during the first half of 2020. We used detailed fisheries data on fishing effort, landings, revenues, landings per unit of effort (LPUE) and revenues per unit of effort from January to June 2020, and complemented it with the outcomes of a marine ecosystem model. We analysed data from 2017-2019 and compared these to 2020 to characterise changes in the fishing activity from before (January-February) to during (March-May) the lockdown. Fishing effort during the lockdown dropped by 34%, landings were down by 49% and revenues declined by 39% in comparison with the same period in 2017-2019. LPUEs did not show significant changes during the lockdown, with the exception of shrimp species, especially the deep-water rose shrimp, which significantly increased in LPUE during March-May. These increases may reflect positive effects of reduced fishing on fast-growing species. Positive effects mostly disappeared in June 2020 with the relaxation of the lockdown. In agreement, the ecological simulations projected slight short-term increases of biomass for fast-growing, small-sized organisms during 2020, which quickly vanished when fishing resumed, and which had no detectable ecosystem effects. Three additional alternative ecological simulations illustrated that to substantially recover commercial species and ensure ecosystem sustainability in the study area, a sustained and notable reduction of fishing activity would be needed.","Coll, M; Ortega-Cerdà, M; Mascarell-Rocher, Y",Biol Conserv,,176

362289,Endocrine and metabolic aspects of Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma has been used for numerous viral diseases including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus; however, evidence to support its use is weak. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus responsible for the 2019 global pandemic of COVID-19 community acquired pneumonia. We have undertaken a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: CONCOR-1 is an open-label, multicentre, randomized trial. Inclusion criteria include the following: patients > 16 years, admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen for respiratory complications of COVID-19, and availability of blood group compatible CCP. Exclusion criteria are : onset of respiratory symptoms more than 12 days prior to randomization, intubated or imminent plan for intubation, and previous severe reactions to plasma. Consenting patients are randomized 2:1 to receive either approximately 500 mL of CCP or standard of care. CCP is collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and who have detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies quantified serologically. The primary outcome is intubation or death at day 30. Secondary outcomes include ventilator-free days, length of stay in intensive care or hospital, transfusion reactions, serious adverse events, and reduction in SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Exploratory analyses include patients who received CCP containing high titre antibodies. A sample size of 1200 patients gives 80% power to detect a 25% relative risk reduction assuming a 30% baseline risk of intubation or death at 30 days (two-sided test; &#945; = 0.05). An interim analysis and sample size re-estimation will be done by an unblinded independent biostatistician after primary outcome data are available for 50% of the target recruitment (n = 600). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether CCP will reduce intubation or death non-intubated adults with COVID-19. The trial will also provide information on the role of and thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and neutralization assays for donor qualification.

362332,Innovation During COVID-19: Improving Addiction Treatment Access,2020,"The oxidative-stress-responsive kinase 1 (OSR1) and the STE20/SPS1-related proline-alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) are physiological substrates of the with-no-lysine (WNK) kinase. They are the master regulators of cation Cl- cotransporters that could be targeted for discovering novel antihypertensive agents. Both kinases have a conserved carboxy-terminal (CCT) domain that recognizes a unique peptide motif (Arg-Phe-Xaa-Val) present in their upstream kinases and downstream substrates. Here, we have combined molecular docking with molecular dynamics simulations and free-energy calculations to identify potential inhibitors that can bind to the allosteric pocket of the OSR1-CCT domain and impede its interaction with the WNK peptide. Our study revealed that STOCK1S-14279 and Closantel bound strongly to the allosteric pocket of OSR1 and displaced the WNK peptide from the primary pocket of OSR1. We showed that primarily Arg1004 and Gln1006 of the WNK4-peptide motif were involved in strong H-bond interactions with Glu453 and Arg451 of OSR1. Besides, our study revealed that atoms of Arg1004 were solvent-exposed in cases of STOCK1S-14279 and Closantel, implying that the WNK4 peptide was moved out of the pocket. Overall, the predicted potential inhibitors altogether abolish the OSR1-WNK4-peptide interaction, suggesting their potency as a prospective allosteric inhibitor against OSR1.","Jonniya, Nisha Amarnath; Zhang, Jinwei; Kar, Parimal",J. phys. chem.

Specifically, core metabolites, such as adenosine are uniquely linked to energy homeostasis (ATP), used as building blocks of biomolecules (RNA, including poly-A tails of mRNAs), coupled to transmethylation reactions (DNA and histone methylation), and act as receptor ligands (adenosine receptors) (Boison, 2013;Boison and Yegutkin, 2019).

363118,"School closure, COVID-19 and influenza A",2020,"Intelligent systems are transforming the world, as well as our healthcare system. We propose a deep learning-based cough sound classification model that can distinguish between children with healthy versus pathological coughs such as asthma, upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). In order to train a deep neural network model, we collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician's diagnosis. The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM) based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology), reaches accuracy exceeding 84\% when classifying cough to the label provided by the physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy the same feature space making it harder to differentiate only using MFCC features.","BalamuraliB, T; Hee, Hwan Ing; Kapoor, Saumitra; Teoh, Oon Hoe; Teng, Sung Shin; Lee, Khai Pin; Herremans, Dorien; Chen, Jer Ming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12174v1.pdf,176
363194,Clinical Significance of Plasma D-Dimer in COVID-19 Mortality,2021,"BACKGROUND: One of the main symptoms of severe infection with the new coronavirus­2 (SARS-CoV-2) is hypoxemic respiratory failure because of viral pneumonia with the need for mechanical ventilation. Prolonged mechanical ventilation may require a tracheostomy, but the increased risk for contamination is a matter of considerable debate. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of safety and effects of surgical tracheostomy on ventilation parameters and outcome in patients with COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study between March 27 and May 18, 2020, in a single-center coronavirus disease-designated ICU at a tertiary care German hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with COVID-19 were treated with open surgical tracheostomy due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and ventilation data were obtained from medical records in a retrospective manner. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV­2 infection and surgical tracheostomy were analyzed. The age range was 42-87 years. All patients received open tracheostomy between 2-16 days after admission. Ventilation after tracheostomy was less invasive (reduction in PEAK and positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) and lung compliance increased over time after tracheostomy. Also, sedative drugs could be reduced, and patients had a reduced need of norepinephrine to maintain hemodynamic stability. Six of 18 patients died. All surgical staff were equipped with N99-masks and facial shields or with powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that open surgical tracheostomy can be performed without severe complications in patients with COVID-19. Tracheostomy may reduce invasiveness of mechanical ventilation and the need for sedative drugs and norepinehprine. Recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) for surgical staff should be followed when PPE is available to avoid contamination of the personnel.","Schuler, Patrick J; Greve, Jens; Hoffmann, Thomas K; Hahn, Janina; Boehm, Felix; Bock, Bastian; Reins, Johannes; Ehrmann, Ulrich; Barth, Eberhard; Traeger, Karl; Jungwirth, Bettina; Wepler, Martin",HNO,,176

A total of 744 pregnant women registered at the Peking University International Hospital between March 2017 and March 2019 were included in this study. Data on personal characteristics and biochemical indicators of the pregnant women were collected during the first trimester. The International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups has adopted specific diagnostic criteria as the gold standard for the diagnosis of GDM. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve statistics were used to assess the predictive value of first-trimester HbA1c levels in the diagnosis of GDM. HbA1c levels in the first trimester were significantly higher in the GDM group than in the non-GDM group (5.23% ± 0.29% vs. 5.06 ± 0.28%, P < 0.05). The first-trimester HbA1c level was an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of HbA1c for GDM was 0.655 (95% confidence interval 0.620-0.689, P < 0.001). The positive likelihood ratio was the highest at HbA1c = 5.9%, sensitivity was 2.78, and specificity was 99.83%. There was no statistical difference in AUC between fasting blood glucose and HbA1c (P = 0.407). First-trimester HbA1c levels can be used to predict GDM. The risk of GDM was significantly increased in pregnant women with first-trimester HbA1c levels > 5.9%. There was no statistical difference between first-trimester HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels in predicting GDM.","Sun, Jianbin; Chai, Sanbao; Zhao, Xin; Yuan, Ning; Du, Jing; Liu, Yufang; Li, Zhi; Zhang, Xiaomei",J Diabetes Res,,176

This virus causes respiratory disease (for instance, flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and, in severe cases, pneumonia. The test to detect the presence of this virus in humans is performed on sputum or blood samples and the outcome is generally available within a few hours or, at most, days. Analysing biomedical imaging the patient shows signs of pneumonia. In this paper, with the aim of providing a fully automatic and faster diagnosis, we propose the adoption of deep learning for COVID-19 detection from X-rays. METHOD: In particular, we propose an approach composed by three phases: the first one to detect if in a chest X-ray there is the presence of a pneumonia. The second one to discern between COVID-19 and pneumonia. The last step is aimed to localise the areas in the X-ray symptomatic of the COVID-19 presence. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Experimental analysis on 6,523 chest X-rays belonging to different institutions demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with an average time for COVID-19 detection of approximately 2.5 seconds and an average accuracy equal to 0.97.","Brunese, Luca; Mercaldo, Francesco; Reginelli, Alfonso; Santone, Antonella",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,,176

364837,Does conservative management in upper gi bleeding during covid-19 lead on to adverse outcomes?,2021,"Epidemiological simulations as a method are used to better understand and predict the spreading of infectious diseases, for example of COVID-19. This paper presents an approach that combines person-centric data-driven human mobility modelling with a mechanistic infection model and a person-centric disease progression model. The model includes the consequences of disease import, of changed activity participation rates over time (coming from mobility data), of masks, of indoors vs.\ outdoors leisure activities, and of contact tracing. Results show that the model is able to credibly track the infection dynamics in Berlin (Germany). The model can be used to understand the contributions of different activity types to the infection dynamics over time. The model clearly shows the effects of contact reductions, school closures/vacations, or the effect of moving leisure activities from outdoors to indoors in fall. Sensitivity tests show that all ingredients of the model are necessary to track the current infection dynamics. One interesting result from the mobility data is that behavioral changes of the population mostly happened \textit{before} the government-initiated so-called contact ban came into effect. Similarly, people started drifting back to their normal activity patterns \emph{before} the government officially reduced the contact ban. Our work shows that is is possible to build detailed epidemiological simulations from microscopic mobility models relatively quickly. They can be used to investigate mechanical aspects of the dynamics, such as the transmission from political decisions via human behavior to infections, consequences of different lockdown measures, consequences of wearing masks in certain situations, or contact tracing.","Muller, Sebastian A.; Balmer, Michael; Charlton, William; Ewert, Ricardo; Neumann, Andreas; Rakow, Christian; Schlenther, Tilmann; Nagel, Kai",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11453v1.pdf,176

366183,The role of Korean Medicine in the post-COVID-19 era: an online panel discussion part 1 - Clinical research,2020,"BACKGROUND: As the landscape of medical education evolves with emerging technologies and the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning platforms continue to gain popularity. Orthopaedic podcasts, a burgeoning e-learning platform, continue to gain traction; however, there is a paucity of information regarding their coverage of topics and their distribution over time. Therefore, our analysis sought to (1) characterize podcast content related to orthopaedic surgery, and (2) evaluate the changes in the prevalence of orthopaedic podcasts over the past 15 years. METHODS: Three common podcasting platforms (Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, and Spotify) were queried using the key terms ""orthopaedic,"" ""orthopedic,"" and ""ortho"" in order to identify a list of podcasts that are related to orthopaedic surgery. For each unique orthopaedic podcast, the title, the show description, the number of episodes, the date of the first episode, the date of the most recent episode, and episode frequency were collected. Podcasts were then classified based on a predetermined list of podcast domains. The number of existing active (released within the last 3 months) orthopaedic podcasts was then trended on a monthly basis from 2011 to 2020. RESULTS: Ninety-four unique podcasts met inclusion criteria, 62 of which remained active as of October 25, 2020. The most common podcast domains were ""general"" (38 [40.4%]) and ""clinical knowledge"" (20 [21.3%]). Among the assessed podcasts, 90 (95.7%) utilized an exclusively audio format. The majority of podcasts were based in the United States (89.4%), included introductory music (72.3%), and included interviews (63.8%). Most podcast hosts were practicing orthopaedic surgeons (52.1%). Between January 2016 and October 2020, the number of active orthopaedic surgery podcasts grew more than twelvefold (1,240%) at an average rate of roughly 1 new podcast each month (average, 1.0 podcast; standard deviation, 1.8). DISCUSSION: The past decade has seen sizable growth in the number of readily available podcasts related to orthopaedic surgery. Additional research is required to independently assess the quality of these resources and their implications for remote trainee education.","Jella, Tarun K; Cwalina, Thomas B; Acuña, Alexander J; Samuel, Linsen T; Kamath, Atul F",J Bone Joint Surg Am,,176

A 55-year-old male COVID-19-positive patient with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), diabetes, and obesity presented with cough and shortness of breath, escalating to requiring high-flow oxygen therapy by high-velocity nasal insufflation. The patient's flow rate and oxygen fraction remained labile throughout much of the hospitalization. This lability required frequent clinician interactions and use of personal protective equipment. The patient was alert and oriented and was instructed on the operation of the high-flow system, specifically the adjustment of both flow rate and oxygen percentage. The patient was instructed to modify oxygen to maintain an SpO 2(peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) target range, and flow rate to address dyspnoea as well as reduction of flow as tolerated when other staff entered the room. The patient was successfully self-regulated for 10 days and was discharged on 2 L/min nasal cannula on day 14 of his illness.","Ciment, Ari J.; Ciment, Lawrence M.",Respirology Case Rep.,,176

367593,COVID-19 Disproportionately Impacts Students in High-Risk Populations,2021,"PURPOSE: Depression, one of the most common mental disorders, is up-surging worldwide amid the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially among the older population. This study aims to measure prevalent depressive symptoms and its associates among older adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out among 1032 older Bangladeshi adults, aged 60 years and above, through telephone interviews in October 2020. We used a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19-related information. Meanwhile, depressive symptoms were measured using the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Two-in-five participants showed depressive symptoms on the GDS-15 scale. Poor socioeconomic characteristic such as low family income, dependency on the family for living, recipient of financial support during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions had 91% higher odds of depressive symptoms. Social isolation, captured in terms of living alone (aOR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.11-4.01), less frequent communication during pandemic (aOR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.07-2.26), perceived loneliness (aOR = 2.25, 95% CI 1.47-3.45), and isolation from others (aOR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.62-3.70) were associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms.

STUDY DESIGN: This is a descriptive study design. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature was performed and described. RESULTS: Historically, the EU has played only a small role in Member States' public health systems and delivery. The EU's policies primarily affect trade and overall economic decisions pertaining to Member States, with limited emphasis on the complex but essential interplay between economies and public health. In recent years, the public health challenges facing the EU, such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, migrant health and now COVID-19, have become increasingly apparent.

We aimed to determine if poorer outcomes were specifically related to chronic immunosuppression or underlying comorbidities. We used a 1:1 propensity score-matching method to compare survival and severe disease-free survival (defined as death and/or need for intensive care unit (ICU)) incidence in hospitalized KTRs and non-transplant control patients between 26 February and 22 May 2020. Patients were matched for risk factors of severe COVID-19: age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, preexisting cardiopathy, chronic lung disease and basal renal function. We included 100 KTRs (median age [interquartile range (IQR)]) 64.7 years (55.3-73.1) in 3 French transplant centers. After a median follow-up of 13 days (7-30), transfer to ICU was required for 34 patients (34%) and death occurred in 26 patients (26%). Overall, 43 patients (43%) developed a severe disease during a median follow-up of 8.5 days (2-14). Propensity score matching to a large French cohort of 2017 patients hospitalized in 24 centers, revealed that survival was similar between KTRs and matched non-transplant patients with respective 30-days survival of 62.9% and 71% (p=0.38) and severe disease-free 30-days survival of 50.6% and 47.5% (p=0.91).

A total of 1980 participants in Japan completed a survey for this study from 9 to 11 May 2020, when the state of emergency covered all prefectures in the country. Self-reported behavior in terms of staying at home, the perceived severity of the pandemic, vulnerability to the pandemic, response efficacy, and self-efficacy based on protection motivation theory were assessed. Multiple regression analysis showed that perceived severity (standardized ß = 0.11, p < 0.001) and self-efficacy (standardized ß = 0.32, p < 0.001) significantly predicted greater levels of staying at home, after controlling for socio-demographics.

This meta-analysis aimed to address the current interest of whether the administration of PPI could increase the susceptibility and risk of poor outcome in COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed, Embase, EBSCOhost, and EuropePMC databases up until 3 December 2020. The main outcome was composite poor outcome which comprised of mortality and severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 in this study was defined as patients with COVID-19 that fulfill the criteria for severe CAP, including the need for intensive unit care or mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was susceptibility, based on cohort comparing COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative participants. RESULTS: There were a total of 290,455 patients from 12 studies in this meta-analysis. PPI use was associated with increased composite poor outcome (OR 1.85 [1.13, 3.03], p = 0.014; I2 90.26%).

However, no study to date has examined the association between CRF and COVID-19. The objectives of this study were to determine whether CRF is independently associated with testing positive with or dying from COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of 2,690 adults from the UK Biobank Study that were followed from March 16th, 2020 to July 26th, 2020. Participants who were tested for COVID-19 and had undergone CRF assessment were examined. CRF was estimated (eCRF) and categorized as low (<20th percentile), moderate (20th to 80th percentile) and high (&#8805;80th percentile) within sex and ten-year age groups (e.g. 50-60 years). Participants were classified as having COVID-19 if they tested positive (primarily PCR tests) at an in-patient or out-patient setting as of July 26, 2020. Participants were classified as having died from COVID-19 if the primary or underlying cause of death was listed ICD-10 codes U071 or U072 by June 30th, 2020. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated and a forward model building approach used to identify covariates. FINDINGS: There was no significant association between eCRF and testing positive for COVID-19. Conversely, individuals with moderate (aRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.75) and high fitness (aRR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.85) had a significantly lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than those with low fitness. CONCLUSIONS: While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus.","Christensen, Rebecca A G; Arneja, Jasleen; St Cyr, Kate; Sturrock, Shelby L; Brooks, Jennifer D",PLoS One,,176

CONCLUSIONS: While eCRF was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19, we observed a significant dose-response between having higher eCRF and a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19. This suggests that prior gains in CRF could be protective against dying from COVID-19 should someone develop the virus.","Christensen, Rebecca A G; Arneja, Jasleen; St Cyr, Kate; Sturrock, Shelby L; Brooks, Jennifer D",PLoS One,,176

371031,The nose can be the focus of treatment and prophylactic approaches against COVID-19,2021,"Recent studies have shown that online users tend to select information adhering to their system of beliefs, ignore information that does not, and join groups - i.e., echo chambers - around a shared narrative. Although a quantitative methodology for their identification is still missing, the phenomenon of echo chambers is widely debated both at scientific and political level. To shed light on this issue, we introduce an operational definition of echo chambers and perform a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces of contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Gab. We infer the leaning of users about controversial topics - ranging from vaccines to abortion - and reconstruct their interaction networks by analyzing different features, such as shared links domain, followed pages, follower relationship and commented posts. Our method quantifies the existence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the interaction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded peers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook and Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit and Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news consumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook. Again, we find support for the hypothesis that platforms implementing news feed algorithms like Facebook may elicit the emergence of echo-chambers.","Cinelli, Matteo; Morales, Gianmarco De Francisci; Galeazzi, Alessandro; Quattrociocchi, Walter; Starnini, Michele",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09603v1.pdf,176

Later, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the causal agent of pneumonia. This virus has since spread to more than 180 countries and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Herein, we aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of symptomatic patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the relationship between the influenza vaccine with a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection in the state of Sinaloa. We collected demographic and clinical data of 4,040 patients with acute respiratory infections across Sinaloa state hospitals from February 28 to May 15, 2020. The prevalence of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms in Sinaloa showed 45.2% of men were more affected than women (p < 0.001), and people aged 40-49 years were the most affected. The main symptoms of COVID-19 infection were cough and fever (p < 0.001), while hypertension, obesity, and type 2 diabetes were the chronic diseases associated with COVID-19 than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.003). Healthcare workers were most likely to be infected compared to other occupations (p < 0.001). The general lethality rate was 14.1%, and males >62 years were the ones who had a higher lethality rate (p < 0.001); the aforementioned chronic diseases were related to higher lethality of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Likewise, higher lethality was seen in housewives and patient retirees/pensioners compared with other occupations (p < 0.001). Finally, we found there was a relationship between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality (p < 0.001). These findings showed that healthcare workers, men >62 years with chronic diseases, and retired people were most affected. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine could decrease the severeness of COVID-19 cases.","Angulo-Zamudio, Uriel A; Martínez-Villa, Francisco M; Leon-Sicairos, Nidia; Flores-Villaseñor, Hector; Velazquez-Roman, Jorge; Campos-Romero, Abraham; Alcántar-Fernández, Jonathan; Urrea, Francisco; Muro-Amador, Secundino; Medina-Serrano, Julio; Martinez-Garcia, Jesus J; Sanchez-Cuen, Jaime; Angulo-Rocha, Jorge; Canizalez-Roman, Adrian",Front Public Health,,176

373836,Covid-19 Vaccine Is Here!!!,2020,"The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been related to uncontrolled inflammatory innate responses and impaired adaptive immune responses mostly due to exhausted T lymphocytes and lymphopenia. In this work we have characterized the nature of the lymphopenia and demonstrate a set of factors that hinder the effective control of virus infection and the activation and arming of effector cytotoxic T CD8 cells and showing signatures defining a high-risk population. We performed immune profiling of the T helper (Th) CD4+ and T CD8+ cell compartments in peripheral blood of 144 COVID-19 patients using multiparametric flow cytometry analysis. On the one hand, there was a consistent lymphopenia with an overrepresentation of non-functional T cells, with an increased percentage of naive Th cells (CD45RA+, CXCR3-, CCR4-, CCR6-, CCR10-) and persistently low frequency of markers associated with Th1, Th17, and Th1/Th17 memory-effector T cells compared to healthy donors. On the other hand, the most profound alteration affected the Th1 subset, which may explain the poor T cells responses and the persistent blood virus load. Finally, the decrease in Th1 cells may also explain the low frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that express the HLA-DR and CD38 activation markers observed in numerous patients who showed minimal or no lymphocyte activation response. We also identified the percentage of HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells, PD-1+CD+4/CD8+ T cells in blood, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio as useful factors for predicting critical illness and fatal outcome in patients with confirmed COVID-19.","Gutiérrez-Bautista, Juan Francisco; Rodriguez-Nicolas, Antonio; Rosales-Castillo, Antonio; Jiménez, Pilar; Garrido, Federico; Anderson, Per; Ruiz-Cabello, Francisco; López-Ruz, Miguel Ángel",Front Immunol,,176

METHODS: The mixed methods design included a subset of cancer patients who responded to a cross-sectional survey in May 2020. Data were collected through telephone interviews. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT), and Connor-Davidson-Resilience Scale (CD-RISC2) were used to measure distress and resilience. Data were analysed by thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Forty patients with lung, breast, colorectal and skin (melanoma) cancer were included; 65% were women. Mean age was 62.2 years (standard deviation [SD], 13.2). Most patients had curable disease (65%); 50% were in treatment and 50% in post-treatment follow up. The interviews revealed four themes: 1) the cost of living with cancer during COVID-19, 2) changes in cancer care delivery, 3) particularly vulnerable, and 4) importance of family support. Mean NCCN DT score was 2.3 (SD, 2.6) while the mean CD-RISC2 score was 7.25 (SD, 1.1). CONCLUSION: Despite drastic changes in daily life imposed by COVID-19 restrictions, Danish cancer patients had remarkably low levels of distress and high levels of resilience.

Here we first review the historical development of mathematical models to understand HIV and HCV infections and the effects of treatment by fitting the models to clinical data. We then focus on recent efforts and contributions of applying these models towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight outstanding questions where modeling can provide crucial insights and help to optimize nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 Items. Professional quality of life was measured by the Professional Quality of Life measure. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief-COPE, resilience by the Brief Resilience Scale, and optimism by the Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R).ResultOf the 640 medical residents contacted, 127 (20%) responded. A considerable proportion of residents reported symptoms of depression (42.5%), anxiety (41.7%) and stress (30.7%). Multivariate analysis of variance showed significant effects of seniority in residency, with junior residents having poorer outcomes. In addition, there was a statistically significant interaction effect with moderate effect sizes between gender and working on the front line, as well as gender, working on the front line and seniority, on mental health outcomes. The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The least reported coping strategies were substance use and denial. Avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (p = .032) and non-COVID-19 frontliners (p = .039). Optimism LOT-R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (p &lt; .001). Another important finding is that optimism and resilience were associated with better mental health outcomes. In addition, we find that avoidant coping style is highly associated with depression.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on junior residents’ mental health. Preventive measures to reduce stress levels and easy access to professional mental health services are crucial. This study also raises awareness among residency programs on the psychological and coping responses and strategies of medical residents.","Mohamed Adil Shah, Khoodoruth Ouanes Sami Smida Malek Al-Salihy Zerak Saleem Al Nuaimi Widaad Nuzhah Chut-kai Khoodoruth Ghaffar Adeel Hamad Mohammed Mohammed Faisal",BJPsych Open,,176

Neurosurgery in the storm of COVID-19: suggestions from the Lombardy region, Italy (ex malo bonum)",2020,"Survey respondents employ different response styles when they use the categories of the Likert scale differently despite having the same true score on the construct of interest. For example, respondents may be more likely to use the extremes of the response scale independent of their true score. Research already shows that differing response styles can create a construct-irrelevant source of bias that distorts fundamental inferences made based on survey data. While some initial studies examine the effect of response styles on survey scores in longitudinal analyses, the issue of how response styles affect estimates of growth is underexamined. In this study, we conducted empirical and simulation analyses in which we scored surveys using item response theory (IRT) models that do and do not account for response styles, and then used those different scores in growth models and compared results. Generally, we found that response styles can affect estimates of growth parameters including the slope, but that the effects vary by psychological construct, response style, and IRT model used.","Soland, James; Kuhfeld, Megan",Multivariate Behav Res,,176

In aquaculture this frequently manifests in an animal welfare crisis, with fish increasingly farmed under high production, high stress conditions. These intense environments can result in fish stocks having a high susceptibility to infection, with parasites and associated disease one of the main factors limiting industry growth. Prediction of infection dynamics is key to preventative treatment and mitigation. Considering the climatic and technology driven changes facing aquaculture, an understanding of how parasites react across a spectrum of conditions is required. Here we assessed the impact of temperature, infection density and host species on the life history traits of Argulus foliaceus, a common palearctic fish louse, representative of a parasite group problematic in freshwater aquaculture and fisheries worldwide. Temperature significantly affected development, growth and survival; parasites hatched and developed faster at higher temperatures, but also experienced shorter lifespans when maintained off the host. At high temperatures, these parasites will likely experience a short generation time as their life history traits are completed more rapidly.

We planned this study aiming to assess the anxiety levels of PLHIV and the sources of their anxiety. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sent the web-based questionnaire to PLHIV with the help of a virtual snowball sampling method. Questionnaire included questions about sociodemographic status, information about HIV infection, and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Besides, some opinions of the participants about COVID-19 were asked. RESULTS: 307 respondents with the median age of 33, from 32 different cities participated in the study. More than half of the respondents were thinking that COVID-19 is not medically known enough and nearly 45% were thinking that they would have more complication if they acquire COVID-19. One fourth of the participants were anxious. Having a pre-existing psychiatric disorder, perceiving insufficient the preventive measures they are practicing, not being sure about the presence of any patient with COVID-19 in their environment, and living with a household member with a chronic disease were found to be the risk factors of PLHIV for being anxious during this pandemic. BAI scores were correlated with the patient-reported anxiety levels about the spread of COVID-19 in Turkey, acquiring coronavirus, transmitting coronavirus to another person and transmitting HIV to another person. Among the stated conditions, the most exciting one was the spread of the virus all over the country and the least exciting condition was about transmitting HIV to someone else. CONCLUSION: Our results reveals that a significant proportion of the sample is anxious, and our findings are essential for developing evidence-based strategies for decreasing the anxiety of PLHIV especially for the ones who have risk factors and serving better health care to them during this pandemic or other pandemic-like crisis.","Kuman TunÇel, Özlem; PullukÇu, HÜsnÜ; Erdem, HÜseyIn AytaÇ; Kurtaran, BehIce; TaSbakan, SelIn Ece; TaSbakan, Meltem",,,176
377776,"Assessment of Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizers for Long-Term Use, Formulated with Addition of Natural Ingredients in Comparison to WHO Formulation 1",2021,"A common writing style for statistical results are the recommendations of the American Psychology Association, known as APA-style. However, in practice, writing styles vary as reports are not 100% following APA-style or parameters are not reported despite being mandatory. In addition, the statistics are not reported in isolation but in context of experimental conditions investigated and the general topic. We address these challenges by proposing a flexible pipeline STEREO based on active wrapper induction and unsupervised aspect extraction. We applied our pipeline to the over 100,000 documents in the CORD-19 dataset. It required only 0.25% of the corpus (about 500 documents) to learn statistics extraction rules that cover 95% of the sentences in CORD-19. The statistic extraction has nearly 100% precision on APA-conform and 95% precision on non-APA writing styles. In total, we were able to extract 113k reported statistics, of which only<1% is APA conform. We could extract in 46% the correct conditions from APA-conform reports (30% for non-APA). The best model for topic extraction achieves a precision of 75% on statistics reported in APA style (73% for non-APA conform). We conclude that STEREO is a good foundation for automatic statistic extraction and future developments for scientific paper analysis. Particularly the extraction of non-APA conform reports is important and allows applications such as giving feedback to authors about what is missing and could be changed.","Epp, Steffen; Hoffmann, Marcel; Lell, Nicolas; Mohr, Michael; Scherp, Ansgar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14124v1.pdf,176

378830,Covid-19 vaccination during Ramadan,2021,"BACKGROUND: Multiple large outbreaks of COVID-19 have been documented in prisons and jails across regions of the world, with hazardous environmental conditions amplify the risks of exposure for both incarcerated people and correctional staff. The objectives of this study are to estimate the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases among U.S. prison staff over time and compare it to the prison inmate population and the general U.S. population, overall, and to examine risk of COVID-19 infection among prison staff across jurisdictions. METHODS: We use publicly available data (April 22, 2020 to January 15, 2021) to estimate COVID-19 crude case rates per 1000 with 95% confidence intervals over the study period for prison staff, incarcerated population, and general population. We also compare COVID-19 case rates between prison staff and the general population within jurisdictions. RESULTS: Over the study period, prison staff have reported consistently higher rates of COVID-19 compared to the general population, with prison staff case rates more closely mirroring the incarcerated population case rates. The rolling 7-day average case rates for prison staff, prison population, and general population on January 15, 2021 were 196.04 per 1000 (95%CI 194.81, 197.26), 219.16 (95%CI 218.45, 219.86), and 69.80 (95%CI 69.78, 69.83), respectively. There was substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions, yet in 87% of study jurisdictions, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly greater among prison staff than the general state population. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting staff for COVID-19 mitigation strategies is essential to protect the health of people who intersect with the correctional system and to flatten the curve in the surrounding communities.","Nowotny, Kathryn M; Seide, Kapriske; Brinkley-Rubinstein, Lauren",BMC Public Health,,176

Under the Coalition Avenir Québec government that has been in power since 2018, immigration has been reduced, which has negatively impacted a provincial immigration program that was previously open to international students graduating from Québecs universities and colleges (Shingler, 2019).The effect of political changes in these provinces may not have decreased the flow of international students, but they have affected how this group are perceived by universities and colleges and the likelihood that they can make longer-term economic and social contributions to Canada. [...]the objective of this special issue is to fill this gap through articles that engage with under-researched aspects of internationalization and examine higher education internationalization through alternative lenses and viewpoints.

379597,Dermatology and COVID-19,2020,"On any given day, tens of millions of people find themselves trapped in instances of modern slavery. The terms""human trafficking,""""trafficking in persons,""and""modern slavery""are sometimes used interchangeably to refer to both sex trafficking and forced labor. Human trafficking occurs when a trafficker compels someone to provide labor or services through the use of force, fraud, and/or coercion. The wide range of stakeholders in human trafficking presents major challenges. Direct stakeholders are law enforcement, NGOs and INGOs, businesses, local/planning government authorities, and survivors. Viewed from a very high level, all stakeholders share in a rich network of interactions that produce and consume enormous amounts of information. The problems of making efficient use of such information for the purposes of fighting trafficking while at the same time adhering to community standards of privacy and ethics are formidable. At the same time they help us, technologies that increase surveillance of populations can also undermine basic human rights. In early March 2020, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), in collaboration with the Code 8.7 Initiative, brought together over fifty members of the computing research community along with anti-slavery practitioners and survivors to lay out a research roadmap. The primary goal was to explore ways in which long-range research in artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to the fight against human trafficking. Building on the kickoff Code 8.7 conference held at the headquarters of the United Nations in February 2019, the focus for this workshop was to link the ambitious goals outlined in the A 20-Year Community Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the US (AI Roadmap) to challenges vital in achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7, the elimination of modern slavery.","Bliss, Nadya; Briers, Mark; Eckstein, Alice; Goulding, James; Lopresti, Daniel P.; Mazumder, Anjali; Smith, Gavin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13186v1.pdf,176

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of IIV3 in children during the 2017-2018 season. METHODS: Children aged 6-59 months who were tested for influenza for their acute respiratory illness in four hospitals during the 2017-2018 influenza season were included. We estimated the VE of IIV3 by test-negative case-control design based on the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results. RESULTS: A total of 4738 children were included in this study. The number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases was 845 (17.8%), and there were 478 cases of influenza A and 362 cases of influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RT-PCR was 53.4% (95% CI, 25.3-70.5) against any influenza, 68.8% (95% CI, 38.7-84.1) against influenza A, and 29.7% (95% CI, -35.1 to 61.8) for influenza B. The adjusted VE based on RIDT was 14.8% (95% CI, -4.4 to 30.0) against any influenza, 24.2% (95% CI, 3.1-40.2) against influenza A, and -5.1% (95% CI, -42.6 to 21.4) against influenza B. Age-specific VE based on RT-PCR against any influenza was 44.1% (95% CI, -0.2 to 67.8) in children aged 6 months to 2 years and 59.3% (95% CI, 8.8-81.9) in children aged 3-<5 years. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest moderate protection (53.4%) of IIV3 against RT-PCR laboratory-confirmed influenza in children in the 2017-2018 influenza season. However, the RIDT hampered the validity to assess VE during influenza season. Caution is needed when interpreting an RIDT-based test negative design influenza VE study.","Sohn, Young Joo; Choi, Jae Hong; Choi, Youn Young; Choe, Young June; Kim, Kyungmin; Kim, Ye Kyung; Ahn, Bin; Song, Seung Ha; Han, Mi Seon; Park, Ji Young; Lee, Joon Kee; Choi, Eun Hwa",Int J Infect Dis,,176

380539,Initial Impact of COVID-19 on Radiology Practices: An ACR/RBMA Survey,2020,"After a major outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) starting in late December 2019, there were no new cases reported in mainland China for the first time on March 18, 2020, and no new cases reported in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on April 20, 2020. However, these places had reported new cases and experienced a second wave since June 11, 2020. Here we develop a stochastic discrete-Time epidemic model to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 resurgence by analyzing the data from the beginning of the outbreak to the second wave in these three places. In the model, we use an input parameter to represent a few potential risks that may cause a second wave, including asymptomatic infection, imported cases from other places, and virus from the environment such as frozen food packages. The e_ect of physical distancing restrictions imposed at di_erent stages of the outbreak is also included in the model. Model simulations show that the magnitude of the input and the time between the initial entry and subsequent case confirmation significantly a_ect the probability of the second wave occurrence. Although the susceptible population size does not change the probability of resurgence, it can influence the severity of the outbreak when a second wave occurs. Therefore, to prevent the occurrence of a future wave, timely screening and detection are needed to identify infected cases in the early stage of infection. When infected cases appear, various measures such as contact tracing and quarantine should be followed to reduce the size of susceptible population in order to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

However, there is a growing body of evidence pointing to a broad and more complex disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-viral responses with disturbed interferon signaling in COVID-19. METHODS: In this prospective single-center registry, we included SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and patients with similar symptoms and severity of disease but negative for SARS-CoV-2 admitted to the emergency department and compared their serum protein expression profiles. RESULTS: Interleukin-6 abundance was similar in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (n = 24) compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative control (n = 61). In contrast, we observed a specific upregulation of the immunomodulatory protein progranulin (GRN). High GRN abundance was associated with adverse outcomes and increased expression of interleukin-6 in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The data from this registry reveals that GRN is specifically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients while interleukin-6 may serve as marker for disease severity. The potential of GRN as a biomarker and a possible impact of increased GRN expression on interferon signaling, virus elimination, and virus-induced lung tissue damage in COVID-19 should be further explored.","Rieder, Marina; Wirth, Luisa; Pollmeier, Luisa; Jeserich, Maren; Goller, Isabella; Baldus, Niklas; Schmid, Bonaventura; Busch, Hans-Joerg; Hofmann, Maike; Thimme, Robert; Rieg, Siegbert; Kern, Winfried; Bode, Christoph; Duerschmied, Daniel; Lother, Achim",,,176

We sought to (1) risk-stratify hematology/oncology patients using general medicine and cancer-specific methods to identify those at high risk for acute care utilization, (2) measure the correlation between two risk stratification methods, and (3) perform a telephone-based needs assessment with intervention for high-risk patients. METHODS: Patients were risk-stratified using a general medical health composite score (HCS) and a cancer-specific risk (CSR) stratification based on disease and treatment characteristics. The correlation between HCS and CSR was measured using Spearman's correlation. A multi-disciplinary team developed a focused needs assessment script with recommended interventions for patients categorized as high-risk by either method. The number of patient needs identified and referrals for services made in the first month of outreach are reported. RESULTS: A total of 1697 patients were risk-stratified, with 17% high-risk using HCS and 22% high-risk using CSR. Correlation between HCS and CSR was modest (&#961; = 0.41). During the first month of the pilot, 286 patients were called for outreach with 245 contacted (86%). Commonly identified needs were financial difficulties (17%), uncontrolled symptoms (15%), and interest in advance care planning (13%), resulting in referral for supportive services for 33% of patients. CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of unmet medical and psychosocial needs in hematology/oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A telephone-based outreach program results in the identification of and intervention for these needs; however, additional cancer-specific risk models are needed to improve targeting to high-risk patients.","Osterman, Chelsea K; Triglianos, Tammy; Winzelberg, Gary S; Nichols, Angela D; Rodriguez-O039,; Donnell, Julia; Bigelow, Sharon M; van Deventer, Hendrik; Sanoff, Hanna K; Ray, Emily M",Support. care cancer,,176

Though suspended 2D channel material has the potential to overcome scattering effects from the substrates but achieving reliability and selectivity, have been limiting the using of this biosensor technology. Here, we have demonstrated nanogap electrodes fabrication by using the self-assembly technique, which provides suspension to the 2D-MoS2. These nano-spacing electrodes not only give suspension but also provide robustness strength to the atomic layer, which remains freestanding after coating of the Hafnium oxide (HfO2) as well as linkers and antibodies. For evaluating the electrical characteristics of suspended MoS2 FET, gating potential was applied through an electrolyte on the suspended MoS2 transistor. This helped in achieved a lower subthreshold swing 70 mV/dec and ON/OFF ratio 107. Later, pH detection was conducted at room temperature, which showed an impressive sensitivity of ~880 by changing 1 unit of pH. We have also successfully shown Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria sensing from the suspended MoS2 transistor by functionalizing dielectric layer with E. coli antibodies. The reported biosensor has shown the ~9% of conductance changes with a lower concentration of E. coli (10 CFU/mL; colony-forming unit per mL) as well as maintain the constant sensitivity in three fabricated devices. The obtained enhancement in the sensitivity of devices and its effect on biomolecules detection can be extened to other biomolecules and this type of architecture has the potential to detect COVID-19 viruses based biomolecules.","Masurkar, Nirul; Thangavel, Naresh Kumar; Yurgelevic, Sally; Varma, Sundeep; Auner, Gregory W; Reddy Arava, Leela Mohana",Biosens Bioelectron,,176

Although the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with the PMs, the mechanism by which exposure to DEP increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under discussion. However, diesel fine PM (dPM) elevate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it coincides with the increase in the number of ACE2 receptors. Expression of ACE2 and its colocalized activator, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar epithelial cells exposed to dPM. Thus, the coexistence of PM and SARS-CoV-2 in the environment augments inflammation and exacerbates lung damage. Increased TGF-ß1 expression due to DEP accompanies the proliferation of the extracellular matrix. In this case, ""multifocal ground-glass opacity"" (GGO) in a CT scan is an indication of a cytokine storm and severe pneumonia in COVID-19.","Poyraz, Baris Mustafa; Engin, Evren Doruk; Engin, Ayse Basak; Engin, Atilla",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,,176

385701,"Risk Categories in COVID-19 Based on Degrees of Inflammation: Data on More Than 17,000 Patients from the Spanish SEMI-COVID-19 Registry",2021,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: To investigate the association between the parameters used in nutritional screening assessment (body mass index [BMI], unintentional weight loss [WL] and reduced food intake) and clinical outcomes in non-critically ill, hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This was a prospective multicenter real-life study carried out during the first pandemic wave in 11 Italian Hospitals. In total, 1391 patients were included. The primary end-point was a composite of in-hospital mortality or admission to ICU, whichever came first. The key secondary end-point was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Multivariable models were based on 1183 patients with complete data. Reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and/or expected by physicians in the next days since admission was found to have a negative prognostic impact for both the primary and secondary end-point (P < .001 for both). No association with BMI and WL was observed. Other predictors of outcomes were age and presence of multiple comorbidities. A significant interaction between obesity and multi-morbidity (&#8805;2) was detected. Obesity was found to be a risk factor for composite end-point (HR = 1.36 [95%CI, 1.03-1.80]; P = .031) and a protective factor against in-hospital mortality (HR = 0.32 [95%CI, 0.20-0.51]; P < .001) in patients with and without multiple comorbidities, respectively. Secondary analysis (patients, N = 829), further adjusted for high C-reactive protein (>21 mg/dL) and LDH (>430 mU/mL) levels yielded consistent findings. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced self-reported food intake before hospitalization and/or expected by physicians in the next days since admission was associated with negative clinical outcomes in non-critically ill, hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This simple and easily obtainable parameter may be useful to identify patients at highest risk of poor prognosis, who may benefit from prompt nutritional support. The presence of comorbidities could be the key factor, which may determine the protective or harmful role of a high body mass index in COVID-19.","Caccialanza, Riccardo; Formisano, Elena; Klersy, Catherine; Ferretti, Virginia; Ferrari, Alessandra; Demontis, Stefania; Mascheroni, Annalisa; Masi, Sara; Crotti, Silvia; Lobascio, Federica; Cerutti, Nadia; Orlandoni, Paolo; Dalla Costa, Cloè; Redaelli, Elena; Fabbri, Alessandra; Malesci, Alberto; Corrao, Salvatore; Bordandini, Lorella; Cereda, Emanuele",Clin. nutr.

A large linked administrative dataset was utilised. Women were grouped into socioeconomic quintiles using an area-based measure of socioeconomic status. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the distribution of number of services, out of pocket fees, and government funding by socioeconomic quintile. Needs-adjusted concentration indices (CINA) were utilised to quantify inequity. The mean out of pocket fees for women of least socioeconomic advantage was $1,026 and for women of most socioeconomic advantage the mean was $2,432 (CINA 0.093, 95% CI: 0.088 - 0.098). However, use of many services were higher for women of most socioeconomic advantage: private obstetrician (CINA: 0.035, 95% CI: 0.032 - 0.038), other specialist services (CINA: 0.089, 95%CI: 0.083 - 0.094), and diagnostic and pathology tests (CINA: 0.027, 95%CI: 0.025 - 0.030). Federal government funding through Medicare was distributed towards women of most socioeconomic advantage (CINA: 0.036, 95%CI: 0.033 - 0.039); whereas government public hospital funding was skewed towards women of least socioeconomic advantage (CINA: -0.05, 95%CI: -0.057 - -0.046).

Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients.","Saguil, Aaron; Fargo, Matthew V",Am Fam Physician,,176

Here, the classic BiLSTM + attention + CRF model is used to obtain full use of the interaction relationship between tasks, and it simultaneously solves the two tasks of emotional dictionary expansion and sentiment classification. The proposed method divides text sentiment classification and emotional dictionary expansion into primary task and subtask, and it adopts the Enhanced Language Representation with Informative Entities (ERNIE) model as the text representation learning model for the primary task. Then, through the maximum pooling layer and the fully connected layer, the text sentiment classification task is completed. Meanwhile, the classical BiLSTM + attention + CRF model is used to extract emotional words from the text in the subtask. In addition, the multitask information interaction mechanism is used, and the prediction information on the autonomous subtask is fed back into the potential representation of the two tasks. After iterative training, the performance of the two tasks is further optimized. Micro-blogs with COVID-19 are used here as the subject to form the experimental data set. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other approaches, and they further verify the superiority of ERNIE over BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet for the sentiment classification of Chinese text.","Zhang, Han; Sun, Shaoqi; Hu, Yongjin; Liu, Junxiu; Guo, Yuanbo",IEEE Access,,176

387568,Usual and Unusual Musculoskeletal Sequalae of COVID 19!,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infected diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) complicated with calcaneal osteomyelitis are a real challenge for limb preservation. Very few alternatives to amputation are available, mainly the resection of a part or the totality of the calcaneal bone. Calcanectomies were advanced as limb-sparing procedures in patients with heel osteomyelitis. However, there is a lack of pooled quantitative evidence on their efficacy and complications. OBJECTIVES: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the primary outcome of healing rates following partial (PC) and total calcanectomies (TC) in treating calcaneal osteomyelitis due to diabetic heel ulcers. Additionally, secondary outcomes such as secondary TC following PC, secondary below knee amputation (BKA), mortality and the change in the ambulation status were analyzed. METHODS: Medline, Scopus, Web of science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched since inception. All types of study design were included. Single case report studies and studies reporting osteomyelitis due to other etiologies than DFU were excluded. RESULTS: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria comprising 295 patients with 300 calcanectomies (270 PC and 30 TC). With a mean follow-up period of 29.3±17.7 months, the weighted results were as follows: a) the osteomyelitis healing rate was of 80% (95% CI=0.728 to 0.861, I2=48.3%), b) the rate of secondary total calcanectomy was of 5.4% (95% CI=0.022 to 0.097, I2=7.5%), c) the rate of secondary BKA was of 17.1% (95% CI=0.111 to 0.241, I2=50.6%) with no difference between subgroups of TC and PC, and d) the combined mortality rate of both calcanectomies was of 13.4% (95% CI=0.064 to 0.224, I2=73.6%); however, significant higher mortality was found following TC compared to PC (p<0.0001).

387859,COVID-19: The Positive and Endemic News,2021,"BACKGROUND: As the outbreak of COVID-19, traditional face-to-face psychological intervention are difficult to achieve, so hotline becomes available and recommended strategies. The callers' characteristic could help us to study their experiences of emotional distress, as well as the reasons for calling during the pandemic, which can be used to inform future service design and delivery. METHODS: The information of 1558 callers called our hospital' s hotline for help from February 3, 2020, to March 16, 2020 were collected in the form of Tick-box and Free text, and the inductive content analysis was undertaken focusing on the reasons for caller engagement. RESULTS: It was indicated that more than half of the callers are female (59.7%), mostly between the age of 18-59 (76.5%). The average age was 37.13 ± 13.76 years old. The average duration of a call to the hotline was 10.03 ± 9.84 min. The most frequent description emotional state were anxious (45.1%) and calm (30.3%), with the sub-sequence of scared (18.2%), sad (11.9%), and angry (6.9%). All callers displayed a wide range of reasons for calling, with needing support around their emotion (64.6%), seeking practical help (44.0%), and sleep problems (20.3%) constituting the majority of calls. Among the subthemes, 314 callers thought the epidemic has made them upset, 198 asked questions about the epidemic, and 119 reported their life routines were disrupted. The prevalence of key reasons does not appear to differ over time. Through their feedback, 79.1% agreed that they felt emotionally better after calling, and 95.0% agreed that hotline had helped them. CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, the most concern of the public is still related to epidemics and its adverse effects. Fortunately, the hotline can be an active and effective rescue measure after an emergency happened.","Du, Na; Ouyang, Yingjie; He, Zongling; Huang, Juan; Zhou, Die; Yuan, Yin; Li, Yunge; He, Manxi; Chen, Yong; Wang, Hongming; Yue, Yuchuan; Xiong, Maoxiang; Pan, Keliang",BMC Public Health,,176
387874,The Distancing of Surgeon From Patient in the Era of COVID-19: Bring on the Innovation,2020,"The U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, Internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey - over 20 million responses in its first year of operation - allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems. Significance statementThe U.S. COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) has operated continuously since April 6, 2020, collecting over 20 million responses. The largest public health survey ever conducted in the United States, CTIS was designed to facilitate detailed demographic and geographic analyses, track trends over time, and accommodate rapid response to emerging priorities. Using examples of CTIS results illuminating trends in symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, testing and vaccination in relation to evolving high-priority policy questions over 12 months of the pandemic, we illustrate the value of online surveys for tracking patterns and trends in COVID outcomes as an adjunct to official reporting, and showcase unique insights that would not be visible through traditional public health reporting.","Salomon, Joshua A; Reinhart, Alex; Bilinski, Alyssa; Chua, Eu Jing; Motte-Kerr, Wichida La; Rönn, Minttu; Reitsma, Marissa B; Morris, Katherine Ann; LaRocca, Sarah; Farag, Tamer; Kreuter, Frauke; Rosenfeld, Roni; Tibshirani, Ryan",,,176

389374,Considerations for outpatient clinical management of mild COVID-19,2020,"The emergence of novel pathogens and zoonotic diseases like the SARS-CoV-2 have underlined the need for developing novel diagnosis and intervention pipelines that can learn rapidly from small amounts of labeled data. Combined with technological advances in next-generation sequencing, metagenome-based diagnostic tools hold much promise to revolutionize rapid point-of-care diagnosis. However, there are significant challenges in developing such an approach, the chief among which is to learn self-supervised representations that can help detect novel pathogen signatures with very low amounts of labeled data. This is particularly a difficult task given that closely related pathogens can share more than 90% of their genome structure. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing MG-Net, a self-supervised representation learning framework that leverages multi-modal context using pseudo-imaging data derived from clinical metagenome sequences. We show that the proposed framework can learn robust representations from unlabeled data that can be used for downstream tasks such as metagenome sequence classification with limited access to labeled data. Extensive experiments show that the learned features outperform current baseline metagenome representations, given only 1000 samples per class.","Aakur, Sathyanarayanan N.; Narayanan, Sai; Indla, Vineela; Bagavathi, Arunkumar; Ramnath, Vishalini Laguduva; Ramachandran, Akhilesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09883v1.pdf,176
389561,Alcohol Consumption is Associated with Poor Prognosis in Obese Patients with COVID-19: a Mendelian Randomization Study using UK Biobank,2020,"ABSTRACT: As of August 23, 2020, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has infected more than 23,518,340 people and caused more than 810,492 deaths worldwide including 4,717 deaths in China. We present a case of a 53-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital because of dry coughs and high fever on January 26, 2020, in Wuhan, China. She was not tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA until on hospital day 11 (illness day 21) because of a significant shortage of test kits at the local hospital. Then, her test was positive for COVID-19 on hospital day 20. Despite intensive medical treatments, she developed respiratory failure with secondary bacterial infection and expired on hospital day 23 (3 days after she was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA). A systemic autopsy examination, including immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural studies, demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect multiple organs with profound adverse effect on the immune system, and the lung pathology is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage. Extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in several organs postmortem. The detailed pathological features are described. In addition, this report highlights the value of forensic autopsy in studying SARS-CoV-2 infection and the importance of clinicopathological correlation in better understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Ren, Liang; Liu, Qian; Wang, Rongshuai; Chen, Rong; Ao, Qilin; Wang, Xi; Zhang, Jie; Deng, Fei; Feng, Yan; Wang, Guoping; Zhou, Yiwu; Li, Ling; Liu, Liang",Am. j. forensic med. pathol,,176
389613,COVID-19 monoclonal antibody infusions: A multidisciplinary initiative to operationalize EUA novel treatment options,2021,"AIM: This review examined how applicable national and regional clinical practice guidelines and recommendations for managing neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 mothers were to the evolving pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search and review identified 20 guidelines and recommendations that had been published by May 25, 2020. We analysed documents from 17 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the United States. RESULTS: The documents were based on expert consensus with limited evidence and were of variable, low methodological rigour. Most did not provide recommendations for delivery methods or managing symptomatic infants. None provided recommendations for post-discharge assimilation of potentially infected infants into the community. The majority encouraged keeping mothers and infants together, subject to infection control measures, but one-third recommended separation. Although breastfeeding or using breastmilk was widely encouraged, two countries specifically prohibited this. CONCLUSION: The guidelines and recommendations for managing infants affected by COVID-19 were of low, variable quality and may be unsustainable. It is important that transmission risks are not increased when new information is incorporated into clinical recommendations. Practice guidelines should emphasise the extent of uncertainty and clearly define gaps in the evidence.","Yeo, Kee Thai; Oei, Ju Lee; De Luca, Daniele; Schmölzer, Georg M; Guaran, Robert; Palasanthiran, Pamela; Kumar, Kishore; Buonocore, Giuseppe; Cheong, Jeanie; Owen, Louise S; Kusuda, Satoshi; James, Jennifer; Lim, Gina; Sharma, Ankur; Uthaya, Sabita; Gale, Christopher; Whittaker, Elizabeth; Battersby, Cheryl; Modi, Neena; Norman, Mikael; Naver, Lars; Giannoni, Eric; Diambomba, Yenge; Shah, Prakeshkumar S; Gagliardi, Luigi; Harrison, Michael; Pillay, Shakti; Alburaey, Abdullah; Yuan, Yuan; Zhang, Huayan",Acta paediatr. scand,,176
389712,"COVID-19 Lockdown: A Study on Behavioural Pattern A Systematic Review in DELHI-NCR, India",2020,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare personnel (HCP) are at increased risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the aetiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIM: To estimate the costs related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection among HCP in Greece. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the national database of SARS-CoV-2 infections and from the database of HCP exposed to patients with COVID-19. A cost-of-illness analysis was performed to estimate total, direct and indirect costs. RESULTS: In total, 254 HCP with COVID-19 and 3332 HCP exposed to patients with COVID-19 during the first epidemic wave were studied. Of the 254 HCP with COVID-19, 49 (19.3%) were hospitalized (mean length of hospitalization 11.6 days) and four were admitted to intensive care units (mean duration 10.8 days). Overall, 1332 (40%) exposed HCP had a mean duration of absenteeism of 7.5 days, and 252 (99.2%) HCP with COVID-19 had a mean duration of absenteeism of 25.8 days. The total costs for the management of the two groups were estimated at 1,735,830 (772,890 Euros for HCP with COVID-19 and 962,940 for exposed HCP). Absenteeism accounted for a large proportion of the total costs (80.4% of all expenditures), followed by costs for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and hospitalization (10.2% and 6.5% of all expenditures, respectively). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with increased rates and duration of absenteeism among HCP. Indirect costs, particularly absenteeism, are the major driver of total costs among exposed HCP and HCP with COVID-19. The estimated total costs are conservative. Studies are needed to explore the impact of COVID-19 vaccination of HCP on absenteeism and COVID-19-associated costs.","Maltezou, H C; Giannouchos, T V; Pavli, A; Tsonou, P; Dedoukou, X; Tseroni, M; Papadima, K; Hatzigeorgiou, D; Sipsas, N V; Souliotis, K",J Hosp Infect,,176

METHODS: From April 4 to July 3, 2020, in a single university hospital in Denmark, all parturient women and their partners were invited to participate in the study, along with their newborns. Participating women and partners had a pharyngeal swab and a blood sample taken at admission; immediately after delivery, a blood sample was drawn from the umbilical cord. The swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Full medical history and obstetric and neonatal information were available. RESULTS: A total of 1,313 parturient women (72.5.% of all women admitted for delivery at the hospital in the study period), 1,188 partners, and 1,206 newborns participated in the study. The adjusted serologic prevalence was 2.6% in women and 3.5% in partners. Seventeen newborns had SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, and none had immunoglobulin M antibodies. No associations between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and obstetric or neonatal complications were found (eg, preterm birth, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, Apgar score, low birth weight, umbilical arterial pH, need for continuous positive airway pressure, or neonatal admission), but statistical power to detect such differences was low. Full serologic data from 1,051 families showed an absolute risk of maternal infection of 39% if the partner had antibodies. CONCLUSION: We found no association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and obstetric or neonatal complications. Sixty-seven percent of newborns delivered by mothers with antibodies had SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. A limitation of our study is that we lacked statistical power to detect small but potentially meaningful differences between those with and without evidence of infection.","Egerup, Pia; Fich Olsen, Line; Christiansen, Ann-Marie Hellerung; Westergaard, David; Severinsen, Elin Rosenbek; Hviid, Kathrine Vauvert Römmelmayer; Kolte, Astrid Marie; Boje, Amalie Dyhrberg; Bertelsen, Marie-Louise Mathilde Friis; Prætorius, Lisbeth; Zedeler, Anne; Nielsen, Josefine Reinhardt; Bang, Didi; Berntsen, Sine; Ethelberg-Findsen, Jeppe; Storm, Ditte Marie; Bello-Rodríguez, Judith; Ingham, Andreas; Ollé-López, Joaquim; Hoffmann, Eva R; Wilken-Jensen, Charlotte; Krebs, Lone; Jørgensen, Finn Stener; Westh, Henrik; Jørgensen, Henrik Løvendahl; la Cour Freiesleben, Nina; Nielsen, Henriette Svarre",Obstet. gynecol,,176

As known, with the development of modern-day technology, Internet usage has become a part of everyday life. However, this situation often brings about the problem of Internet addiction. A positive relationship is known to exist between Internet addiction and psychological problems. This study aims to examine the moderator effect of COVID-19 fear on the ""mediating role of boredom proneness in relationship between internet addiction and DASS-21."" Materials/methods-In the current study, the effect of boredom proneness in this relationship was examined through the mediator effect of boredom proneness in the relationship between Internet addiction and the ""Depression, stress and anxiety scale"" DASS-21. Then, the moderator effect of the fear of COVID-19 was examined on the mediator role, which constitutes the main purpose of this research. For these purposes, 560 students studying at the undergraduate level at state universities in Turkey were reached as a sample. In the analysis of the collected data;parametric tests, correlation test, structural equation model, and moderator analysis were employed. Results-In the model in which the moderator effect of COVID-19 fear was examined;it appears that fear of COVID-19 increases the relationship between Internet addiction and boredom proneness. It also increases the relationship between boredom proneness and DASS-21. However, no significant moderator effect was found to exist in the relationship between Internet addiction and DASS-21. Conclusion-This study shows that the fear of COVID-19 has a significant effect on Internet addiction, boredom proneness, and psychological problems.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of RiTe to our year 2 students was moved to an online format using Microsoft Teams and Blackboard Collaborate and focused on a key area of current practice - COVID-19 and chest X-ray imaging. Within RiTe students are placed into collaborative enquiry-based learning (CEBL) groups to share tasks, but to also support and learn from one another. METHODS: An online survey was used to explore the year 2 student cohort task value and self-efficacy of this online version of RiTe. RESULTS: A 73% (32/44) response rate was achieved. Students found the online version of RiTe to be a positive learning and development experience. There was strong agreement that they not only found it relevant to their area of practice (task-value), but also strongly agreed that they understood and could master the skills taught (self-efficacy). CONCLUSION: This online version of RiTe was effectively structured to help scaffold student learning and development of research data analysis skills despite the lack of face-to-face teaching. The students also valued the topic area (COVID-19 and chest X-ray imaging). A blended learning approach with RiTe will be used next year with a combination of collaborative online teaching and physical data collection and analysis in the university-based X-ray imaging laboratory. Further evaluation and data collection will also be undertaken. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: University-based empirical work in groups to learn about research can be replaced by an online mechanism whilst still maintaining task-value and acceptable self-efficacy.","Higgins, R; Murphy, F; Hogg, P",,,176

The laser scribed graphene (LSG) on the thin polyimide film was functionalized using pyrenebutanoic acid, succinimide ester (PBSE) to improve the electrochemical activity of the biosensors. The LSG was further decorated with platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) to promote the electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of UA. Glucose oxidase was immobilized on the PtNPs modified surface for selective detection of glucose. The fabricated biosensors were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electrochemical methods (cyclic voltammetry and amperometry measurements). Outstanding electrocatalytic activities toward oxidation of UA and glucose were demonstrated. A wide detection range of 5 µM to 480 µM UA with a high sensitivity of 156.56â µA/mMcm2 and a calculated detection limit (LOD) of 0.018 µM (S/N = 3) were achieved for the UA biosensor.

Few information on clinical features and immunological profile of COVID-19 in paediatrics. The clinical features and treatment outcomes of twelve paediatric patients confirmed as COVID-19 were analyzed. The immunological features of children patients was investigated and compared with twenty adult patients. The median age was 14.5-years (range from 0.64 to 17), and six of the patients were male. The average incubation period was 8 days. Clinically, cough (9/12, 75%) and fever (7/12, 58.3%) were the most common symptoms. Four patients (33.3%) had diarrhea during the disease. As to the immune profile, children had higher amount of total T cell, CD8+ T cell and B cell but lower CRP levels than adults (P < 0.05). Ground-glass opacity (GGO) and local patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest CT scan. All patients received antiviral and symptomatic treatment and the symptom relieved in 3-4 days after admitted to hospital. The paediatric patients showed mild symptom but with longer incubation period. Children infected with SARS-CoV-2 had different immune profile with higher T cell amount and low inflammatory factors level, which might ascribed to the mild clinical symptom. We advise that nucleic acid test or examination of serum IgM/IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 should be taken for children with exposure history regardless of clinical symptom.","Chen, Juan; Zhang, Zhen-Zhen; Chen, Yao-Kai; Long, Quan-Xin; Tian, Wen-Guang; Deng, Hai-Jun; Hu, Jie-Li; Zhang, Xian-Xiang; Xiang, Jiang-Lin; Wang, Dao-Xin; Hu, Peng; Zhou, Fa-Chun; Li, Zhi-Jie; Xu, Hong-Mei; Cai, Xue-Fei; Wang, De-Qiang; Hu, Yuan; Tang, Ni; Liu, Bei-Zhong; Wu, Gui-Cheng; Huang, Ai-Long",,,176

There are widespread reports of dwindling supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE), particularly N95-type filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), which are paramount to protect frontline medical/nursing staff, and to minimize further spread of the virus. We carried out a rapid review to summarize the existing literature on the viability of SARS-CoV-2, the efficacy of key potential disinfection procedures against the virus (specifically ultraviolet light and heat), and the impact of these procedures on FFR performance, material integrity, and/or fit. In light of the recent discovery of SARS-CoV-2 and limited associated research, our review also focused on the closely related SARS-CoV-1. We propose a possible whole-of-PPE disinfection solution for potential reuse that could be rapidly instituted in many health care settings, without significant investments in equipment.","Derraik, José G B; Anderson, William A; Connelly, Elizabeth A; Anderson, Yvonne C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,176

393676,From Bench to Bedside: Patience is a Virtue-A Time to Reflect and Reevaluate Surgical Indications,2020,"Strict infection control measures in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic are expected to remain for an extended period. In aesthetic clinics, most procedures are provided on one to one basis by the physician or therapist. In such a scenario, guidelines detailing the infection control measures for aesthetic clinics are of particular importance. An online meeting of an international group of experts in the field of aesthetic medicine, with experience in administration of an aesthetic clinic, was convened. The meeting aimed to provide a set of consensus guidelines to protect clinic staff and patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Consensus guidelines for ""preferred practices"" were provided for scheduling of patients, patient evaluation and triaging, and for safety precautions about the different procedures. Procedures were categorized into low-risk, moderate risk, and high-risk based on the likelihood of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the patient to the treating physician or therapist. While not intended to be complete or exhaustive, these guidelines provide sound infection control measures for aesthetic practices. Since guidelines regarding safety measures and use of PPEs may vary from country to country, the local guidelines should also be followed to prevent COVID-19 infection in aesthetic clinics.","Kapoor, Krishan M; Chatrath, Vandana; Boxley, Sarah G; Nurlin, Iman; Snozzi, Philippe; Demosthenous, Nestor; Belo, Victoria; Chan, Wai M; Kanaris, Nicole; Kapoor, Puneet",Dermatol Ther,,176

The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 required an equally rapid response from health-care organizations to find innovative ways to utilize the existing workforce to care for people with COVID-19. Using an evaluative case study, a unique insight into the collaborative allied health and nursing professions' response to COVID-19 at a specialist cardiothoracic hospital in the United Kingdom is presented. The aim of the case study was to evaluate how an interprofessional workforce from the wider organization could be supported to work in critical care as part of a crisis response. In identifying the key enablers to setting up an interprofessional Essential Care Team and learning from the lived experiences of those involved, this case study has demonstrated that, in supported, interprofessional teams the wider organizational workforce can be facilitated to effectively and safely provide critical care services. The lessons learned from this study will support future pandemic responses and aid the identification of further opportunities for interprofessional learning and practice. Ultimately, the study highlights that by identifying and investing in the key enablers, health-care organizations can be better prepared to respond to a global crisis.","Hales, Pippa; White, Anne; Eden, Allaina; Hurst, Rhys; Moore, Siobhan; Riotto, Cheryl; Achour, Nebil",J Interprof Care,,176

395449,Pediatric Otolaryngology in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"ABSTRACT: Dysphagia is the difficulty in swallowing because of the presence of certain diseases; it particularly compromises the oral and/or pharyngeal stages. In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, neuromuscular complications, prolonged bed rest, and endotracheal intubation target different levels of the swallowing network. Thus, critically ill patients are prone to dysphagia and aspiration pneumonia. In this review, we first discuss the possible cause and pathophysiology underlying dysphagia associated with coronavirus disease 2019, including cerebrovascular events, such as stroke, encephalomyelitis, encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and myositis, that may lead to the dysphagia reported as a complication associated with the coronavirus disease 2019. Next, we present some recommendations for dysphagia evaluation with modifications that would allow a safe and comprehensive assessment based on available evidence to date, including critical considerations of the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and optimization individual's noninstrumental swallowing tasks evaluation, while preserving instrumental assessments for urgent cases only. Finally, we discuss a practical managing strategy for dysphagia rehabilitation to ensure safe and efficient practice in the risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure, in which swallowing therapy using newer technology, such as telerehabilitation system or wearable device, would be considered as a useful option.","Aoyagi, Yoichiro; Inamoto, Yoko; Shibata, Seiko; Kagaya, Hitoshi; Otaka, Yohei; Saitoh, Eiichi",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center, randomized, clinical trial was conducted with 52 patients (36 female, 16 male) who expected severe postoperative sequelae as a result of the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. The patients were randomized into three groups. In the preoperative submucosal corticosteroid injection group (n = 16), 8 mg/2 ml dexamethasone 21-phosphate was administered near operated sites. In the postoperative therapeutic elastic bandage application group (n = 19), Kinesio tapes were applied to operated sites. Paracetamol 500 mg was prescribed for the patients in the corticosteroid and elastic bandage application groups. In the postoperative non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug group (n = 17), 25 mg dexketoprofen trometamol was prescribed. Maximal mouth opening, swelling, pain, and Oral Health Impaction Profile scores were quantified preoperatively and postoperatively on the second and seventh days. Additionally, all patients were asked to evaluate the postoperative period by the Postoperative Symptom Severity Scale. RESULTS: Analysis of the obtained data revealed that on the second postoperative day, postoperative edema and trismus were significantly lower in the submucosal corticosteroid (p = 0.025, p = 0.03) and therapeutic elastic bandage (p = 0.032, p = 0.014) groups, and the patients in these groups had a more comfortable postoperative period than the group prescribed a postoperative non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (p = 0.016). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In oral surgery, postoperative elastic bandage application can provide results similar to those of preoperative submucosal corticosteroid injection with respect to inflammatory symptoms and quality of life.

It is therefore prudent to use the existing resources and control strategies in an optimal way to contain the virus spread and provide the best possible treatments to the infected individuals. Use of the repurposing drugs along with the non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies may be the right way for fighting against the ongoing pandemic. It is the objective of this work to demonstrate through mathematical modelling and analysis how and to what extent such control strategies can improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden. The criteria for disease elimination & persistence were established through the basic reproduction number. A case study with the Indian Covid-19 epidemic data is presented to visualize and illustrate the effects of lockdown, maintaining personal hygiene & safe distancing, and repurposing drugs. It is shown that India can significantly improve the overall Covid-19 epidemic burden through the combined use of NPIs and repurposing drugs though containment of spreading is difficult without serious community participation.","Mondal, Chittaranjan; Adak, Debadatta; Majumder, Abhijit; Bairagi, Nandadulal",ISA Trans,,176

PURPOSE: To evaluate the technical and clinical success of percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in restoring patency of acutely and chronically thrombosed covered TIPS using the Aspirex®S and Rotarex®S system. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated mechanical thrombectomy-assisted revisions in five patients between January 2012 and April 2021. Two patients had to be revised twice due to recurrent occlusion. We designated thrombosis within 10 days after shunt creation or revision as acute. Insidious deterioration of portal hypertension related symptoms for at least 6-8 weeks was recorded in chronic cases. We treated four acute and three chronic occlusions. After transjugular lesion crossing, we performed two mechanical thrombectomy device passages. If indicated, balloon dilatation, covered stent placement, or variceal embolization were added. RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. No procedure-related complications occurred. In one patient with acute decompensation of Budd-Chiari syndrome and acute-on-chronic liver failure, early re-thrombosis occurred twice with patency intervals of up to eight days. In contrast, stable patency was achieved in the other four patients with documented patency intervals of at least five months and improvement of portal hypertension-related symptoms, resulting in a patient based clinical success rate of 80%. CONCLUSION: In five patients, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy assisted TIPS recanalization of four acute and three chronic occlusions proved to be technically feasible and safe with a high clinical success rate.","Thurner, Annette; Augustin, Anne Marie; Götze, Oliver; Bley, Thorsten A; Kickuth, Ralph",Acta Radiol,,176

Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7)/Mas axis downregulation; increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. Because angiotensin II receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease; thus, they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, it has been hypothesized that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.","Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey",J Am Coll Cardiol,,176

Anthropogenic activity is very high in these regions. Restriction of human activity near river basins due to the prolonged COVID-19 lockdown has brought remarkable changes in the environment. A comparison of the pre-lockdown period and the lockdown period was done. The study covered the years from March 2019 to May 2020. Results demonstrate improvement in surface water quality of River Ganga, during the lock-down period as there was less anthropogenic activity. The water quality test revealed that tur-bidity has reduced to &lt;94% during the lockdown. River Ganga was one of the polluted rivers, unfit for a bath but physicochemical properties like turbidity, total suspended solids, and total dissolved solids have improved enormously during the lockdown. The chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand has changed from 12 and 3 mg/L to &lt;6 and 1.2 mg/L, respectively. Consecutively, dissolved oxygen level has increased from 6 to 12 mg/L. Low total coliform and fecal coliform counts indicated improvement in the bacteriological quality of water. The results of the present investigation establish a significant improvement in water quality. © 2021 Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.","Roy, M. B.; Ghosh, M.; Roy, P.

Hence, we investigated the feasibility of telesimulation for neonatal resuscitation training, assessed participants' attitudes towards telesimulation as well as its effect on neonatal resuscitation knowledge, and compared results between medical students and neonatal nurses. Methods: For this prospective observational pilot study, medical students and neonatal nursing staff were recruited on a voluntary basis. Pre- and post-training knowledge was assessed using a 20-question questionnaire. Following the educational intervention, participants further answered a six-item questionnaire on their perception of telesimulation. For the telesimulation session, participants received a simulation package including a low-fidelity mannequin and medical equipment. The one-hour telesimulation session was delivered by an experienced instructor and broadcasted via Cisco Webex for groups of 2-3 participants, covering all elements of the neonatal resuscitation algorithm and including deliberate technical skills practice. Results: Nine medical students and nine neonatal nurses participated in a total of seven telesimulation sessions. In general, participants enjoyed the telesimulation session, acknowledged a positive learning effect and found telesimulation suitable for neonatal resuscitation training, but were critical of potential technical issues, training logistics, and the quality of supervision and feedback. Neonatal resuscitation knowledge scores increased significantly after the educational intervention both for medical students and nurses. Conclusions: Telesimulation is feasible for neonatal resuscitation training and associated with significant improvements in knowledge of current resuscitation guidelines, without differences between medical students and neonatal nurses.","Mileder, Lukas P; Bereiter, Michael; Wegscheider, Thomas",Med Educ Online,,176

On February 29, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) denoted it in a high-risk category, and on March 11, 2020, this virus was designated pandemic, after its declaration being a Public Health International Emergency on January 30, 2020. World over high efforts are being made to counter and contain this virus. The COVID-19 outbreak once again proves the potential of the animal-human interface to act as the primary source of emerging zoonotic diseases. Even though the circumstantial evidence suggests the possibility of an initial zoonotic emergence, it is too early to confirm the role of intermediate hosts such as snakes, pangolins, turtles, and other wild animals in the origin of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to bats, the natural hosts of multiple coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The lessons learned from past episodes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are being exploited to retort this virus. Best efforts are being taken up by worldwide nations to implement effective diagnosis, strict vigilance, heightened surveillance, and monitoring, along with adopting appropriate preventive and control strategies. Identifying the possible zoonotic emergence and the exact mechanism responsible for its initial transmission will help us to design and implement appropriate preventive barriers against the further transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This review discusses in brief about the COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 with a particular focus on the role of animals, the veterinary and associated zoonotic links along with prevention and control strategies based on One-health approaches.","Tiwari, Ruchi; Dhama, Kuldeep; Sharun, Khan; Iqbal Yatoo, Mohd; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Singh, Rajendra; Michalak, Izabela; Sah, Ranjit; Bonilla-Aldana, D Katterine; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Vet Q,,176

There is no data on COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma or patients with asthma who are treated with monoclonal antibodies.Case Study: Here, we present the case of a severe eosinophilic asthmatic in whom benralizumab treatment, an anti-IL-5R monoclonal antibody, was initiated 2 years ago. Prior to benralizumab treatment, every viral infection had resulted in a prolonged course of oral corticosteroids (OCS). Since initiation of benralizumab, the patient has had good asthma control. Mid-March 2020, the patient developed high fever.Results: A SARS-CoV-2-PCR (nasopharyngeal swab) was positive. The patient's symptoms subsided after few days. No OCS was needed. The asthma control questionnaire 6-item scale worsened moderately in the week of the infection and returned to normal levels thereafter. The asthma control test, measuring longer term asthma control, showed no decline.Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 was very mild in this particular patient with severe eosinophilic asthma. So far, there is no evidence that would suggest a more severe course of COVID-19 in patients with asthma. It is worth noting, that prior to the initiation of benralizumab this patient had multiple exacerbations per year triggered by viral infections (4/year), which all required OCS. Whilst only anecdotal, this case study provides the first evidence to support the current recommendation of continuing monoclonal antibodies in patients with severe asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Renner, Andreas; Marth, Katharina; Patocka, Karin; Pohl, Wolfgang",J Asthma,,176

Its chitinous membrane, embedding small radular teeth, is moved by the set of muscles resulting in an interaction with the ingesta, tearing it and collecting loosened particles. Radulae and their teeth can be quite distinct in their morphology and had been of high research interest, but only few studies have examined the basic functional principles of this organ, the movement and motion during feeding action. Here, the radular motion of 20 representative species, belonging to four major gastropod lineages (Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda, Heterobranchia) and Polyplacophora, were recorded and classified. Comparisons of the video footage with the SEM images of the radula resulted in the recognition of functional tooth rows and the correct position of the teeth during feeding. We identified six different types of radular movements, including rotations and bending of the radula itself. In each movement type, different structures act as counter bearings enabling the animals to grab and tear food.","Scheel, Carolin; Gorb, Stanislav N; Glaubrecht, Matthias; Krings, Wencke",,,176

DESIGN: Rapid scoping review. Literature review with fixed search terms, up to 1 April 2020. Central tendency and variation of the parameter estimates for infectious period in (A) asymptomatic and (B) symptomatic cases from (1) virological studies (repeated testing), (2) tracing studies and (3) modelling studies were gathered. Narrative review of viral dynamics. INFORMATION SOURCES: Search strategies developed and the following searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Additionally, the Health Information Quality Authority (Ireland) viral load synthesis was used, which screened literature from PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect, NHS evidence, Cochrane, medRxiv and bioRxiv, and HRB open databases. RESULTS: There was substantial variation in the estimates, and how infectious period was inferred. One study provided approximate median infectious period for asymptomatic cases of 6.5-9.5 days. Median presymptomatic infectious period across studies varied over <1-4 days. Estimated mean time from symptom onset to two negative RT-PCR tests was 13.4 days (95% CI 10.9 to 15.8) but was shorter when studies included children or less severe cases. Estimated mean duration from symptom onset to hospital discharge or death (potential maximal infectious period) was 18.1 days (95% CI 15.1 to 21.0); time to discharge was on average 4 days shorter than time to death. Viral dynamic data and model infectious parameters were often shorter than repeated diagnostic data. CONCLUSIONS: There are limitations of inferring infectiousness from repeated diagnosis, viral loads and viral replication data alone and also potential patient recall bias relevant to estimating exposure and symptom onset times. Despite this, available data provide a preliminary evidence base to inform models of central tendency for key parameters and variation for exploring parameter space and sensitivity analysis.","Byrne, Andrew William; McEvoy, David; Collins, Aine B; Hunt, Kevin; Casey, Miriam; Barber, Ann; Butler, Francis; Griffin, John; Lane, Elizabeth A; McAloon, Conor; O039,; Brien, Kirsty; Wall, Patrick; Walsh, Kieran A; More, Simon J",BMJ Open,,176

Here, the authors describe an algorithm for testing and triage in a large psychiatric facility designed to prevent local COVID-19 transmission. The algorithm is based on expert opinion and clinical experience between March and April of 2020, during which the institution cared for 47 COVID-19 positive psychiatric inpatients. The implementation of the algorithm is designed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, preserve the safest and least restrictive treatment environment for psychiatric inpatients, and provide a model adaptable to other institutional settings.","Brody, Benjamin D; Parish, Sharon J; Kanellopoulos, Dora; Russ, Mark J",Psychiatry Res,,176
411929,Practical exploration of paperless medical records for COVID-19 : Tongji Hospital as an example/ 中华医院管理杂志,2020,"Portfolio optimization has been a central problem in finance, often approached with two steps: calibrating the parameters and then solving an optimization problem. Yet, the two-step procedure sometimes encounter the""error maximization""problem where inaccuracy in parameter estimation translates to unwise allocation decisions. In this paper, we combine the prediction and optimization tasks in a single feed-forward neural network and implement an end-to-end approach, where we learn the portfolio allocation directly from the input features. Two end-to-end portfolio constructions are included: a model-free network and a model-based network. The model-free approach is seen as a black-box, whereas in the model-based approach, we learn the optimal risk contribution on the assets and solve the allocation with an implicit optimization layer embedded in the neural network. The model-based end-to-end framework provides robust performance in the out-of-sample (2017-2021) tests when maximizing Sharpe ratio is used as the training objective function, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 1.16 when nominal risk parity yields 0.79 and equal-weight fix-mix yields 0.83. Noticing that risk-based portfolios can be sensitive to the underlying asset universe, we develop an asset selection mechanism embedded in the neural network with stochastic gates, in order to prevent the portfolio being hurt by the low-volatility assets with low returns. The gated end-to-end with filter outperforms the nominal risk-parity benchmarks with naive filtering mechanism, boosting the Sharpe ratio of the out-of-sample period (2017-2021) to 1.24 in the market data.","Uysal, Ayse Sinem; Li, Xiaoyue; Mulvey, John M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04636v1.pdf,176
412449,Sheltering in Place in a Xenophobic Climate: COVID-19 and Children in Immigrant Families,2020,"The high rate of thrombotic complications associated with COVID-19 seems likely to reflect viral infection of vascular endothelial cells, which express the ACE2 protein that enables SARS-CoV-2 to invade cells. Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. When single-stranded RNA viruses are taken up into cellular endosomes, they stimulate endosomal formation and activation of NADPH oxidase complexes via RNA-responsive toll-like receptor 7. It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation. If this hypothesis is correct, hydroxychloroquine, spirulina (more specifically, its chromophore phycocyanobilin) and high-dose glycine may have practical potential for mitigating the elevated thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19.","DiNicolantonio, James J; McCarty, Mark",,,176

Our hypothesis was that the renal blood flow could be more compromised in SARS-CoV-2 patients than in patients with ""classical"" ARDS. We compared the renal resistivity index (RRI) and the renal venous flow (RVF) in ARDS patients with SARS-CoV-2 and in ARDS patients due to other etiologies. Prospective, observational pilot study performed on 30 mechanically ventilated patients (15 with SARS-COV-2 ARDS and 15 with ARDS). Mechanical ventilation settings included constant-flow controlled ventilation, a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight and the PEEP level titrated to the lowest driving pressure. Ultrasound Doppler measurements of RRI and RVF pattern were performed in each patient. Patients with SARS-COV-2 ARDS had higher RRI than patients with ARDS (0.71[0.67-0.78] vs 0.64[0.60-0.74], p = 0.04). RVF was not-continuous in 9/15 patients (71%) in the SARS-COV-2 ARDS group and in and 5/15 (33%) in the ARDS group (p = 0.27). A linear correlation was found between PEEP and RRI in patients with SARS-COV-2 ARDS (r2 = 0.31; p = 0.03) but not in patients with ARDS. Occurrence of AKI was 53% in patients with SARS-COV-2 ARDS and 33% in patients with ARDS (p = 0.46).

413217,What is the Trend in Representation of Women and Under-represented Minorities in Orthopaedic Surgery Residency?,2021,"In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was officially declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. Given the novelty of the virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment strategies, individual countries opted for different containment approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony, Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom followed an initially lenient, herd-immunity approach with strict lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same health-care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner, despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as political situation and societal compliance could account for the discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success of COVID-19 containment.","Allaham, Shereen; Demel, Isabel-Cathérine; Nur, Intesar; Abu Salim, Faizul Nizam; Manikam, Logan",,,176
413427,Host or pathogen-related factors in COVID-19 severity?,2020,"In this paper, we study a novel contact tracing query (CTQ) that finds users who have been in $direct$ $contact$ with the query user or $in$ $contact$ $with$ $the$ $already$ $contacted$ $users$ in subsequent timestamps from a large spatio-temporal database. The CTQ is of paramount importance in the era of new COVID-19 pandemic world for finding possible list of potential COVID-19 exposed patients. A straightforward way to answer the CTQ is using traditional spatio-temporal indexes. However, these indexes cannot serve the purpose as each user covers a large area within the time-span of potential disease spreading and thus they can hardly use efficient pruning techniques. We propose a multi-level index, namely QR-tree, that consider both space coverage and the co-visiting patterns to group users so that users who are likely to meet the query user are grouped together. More specifically, we use a quadtree to partition user movement traces w.r.t. space and time, and then exploit these space-time mapping of user traces to group users using an R-tree. The QR-tree facilitates efficient pruning and enables accessing only potential sets of user who can be the candidate answers for the CTQ. Experiments with real datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.","Ali, Mohammed Eunus; Eusuf, Shadman Saqib; Islam, Kazi Ashik",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12812v2.pdf,176

After decades of efforts on the studies of nanomaterials, researchers have applied nanomaterials-based strategies to combat the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First, nanomaterials facilitate the development of easy, fast, and low-cost diagnostic assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers. Second, nanomaterials enable the efficient delivery of viral antigens to antigen-presenting cells or serve as adjuvants in the host, leading to vaccine development at an unprecedented pace. Lastly, nanomaterials-based treatments may inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and reduce inflammation. Overall, nanomaterials have played important roles in controlling this COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide a brief overview of the representative examples of nanomaterials-based diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics in the fight against COVID-19.","Zeng, Chunxi Hou Xucheng Bohmer Margaret Dong Yizhou",VIEW,,176
413693,Hiv patients are more prone to covid-19: Fact or myth?,2020,"COVID-19 school closures have seen the homeplace become a school-place for students and their families in Ireland. This paper presents research on the resources and supports available for students to engage with learning in their home environments. Evidence from a nationally representative survey comprising one third of second-level school leaders, conducted during the first school closures in 2020, shows that attendance and engagement appears to be influenced by the educational level of parents/guardians. The association between parental education and student engagement was stronger for Junior Certificate students but was not statistically evidenced for Leaving Certificate students. Qualitative evidence sheds further light on inequalities which characterised students’ experiences of online and remote learning. Viewing these developments through a social reproduction framework, this study argues that unequal home learning environments may magnify existing inequalities. To prevent a return to the classroom with more classed outcomes, it is imperative that policy, planning and investment strive to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on educational inequality.

In this paper, we propose a multi-region SEIR model based on stochastic differential game theory, aiming to formulate optimal regional policies for infectious diseases. Specifically, we enhance the standard epidemic SEIR model by taking into account the social and health policies issued by multiple region planners. This enhancement makes the model more realistic and powerful. However, it also introduces a formidable computational challenge due to the high dimensionality of the solution space brought by the presence of multiple regions. This significant numerical difficulty of the model structure motivates us to generalize the deep fictitious algorithm introduced in [Han and Hu, MSML2020, pp.221--245, PMLR, 2020] and develop an improved algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality. We apply the proposed model and algorithm to study the COVID-19 pandemic in three states: New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The model parameters are estimated from real data posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We are able to show the effects of the lockdown/travel ban policy on the spread of COVID-19 for each state and how their policies affect each other.","Xuan, Yao; Balkin, Robert; Han, Jiequn; Hu, Ruimeng; Ceniceros, Hector D.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06745v1.pdf,176

417340,COVID-19 Pandemic: Changes in Care for a Community Academic Breast Center and Patient Perception of Those Changes,2021,"BACKGROUND: Orthopaedic surgery training programs have lagged behind other surgical specialties in increasing their representation of women and people from under-represented minority (URM) groups. Comparative data between orthopaedic surgery and other specialties are needed to help identify solutions to closing the diversity gap. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which surgical specialties have the greatest representation of women residents and residents from URM groups? (2) How have the proportions of women residents and residents from URM groups changed across the surgical specialties during the past decade? METHODS: This was a retrospective evaluation of a large, longitudinally maintained survey database. Resident data by gender and ethnicity were retrieved from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Data Resource Books for the 2011 to 2012 through 2019 to 2020 academic years. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education database is updated annually; thus, it is the most up-to-date and complete database available for gender and ethnicity data for all surgical residents. Data were obtained and analyzed for seven different surgical specialties: orthopaedic surgery, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, plastic surgery, general surgery, and urology. No sampling was necessary, and thus descriptive statistics of the data were completed. Because the entire population of residents was included for the period of time in question, no statistical comparisons were made, and the reported differences represent absolute differences between the groups for these periods. Linear regression analyses were performed to estimate the annual growth rates of women residents and residents from URM groups in each specialty. RESULTS: Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of women residents increased from 28% (4640 of 16,854) or residents in 2012 to 33% (6879 of 20,788) in 2020. Orthopaedic surgery had the lowest representation of women residents every year, with women residents comprising 16% of residents (700 of 4342) in 2020. Among the seven surgical specialties, representation of residents from URM groups increased from 8.1% (1362 of 16,854) in 2012 to 9.7% (2013 of 20,788) in 2020. In 2020, the representation of residents from URM groups in orthopaedic surgery was 7.7% (333 of 4342). In 2020, general surgery had the highest representation of women residents (42%; 3696 of 8809) as well as residents from URM groups (12%; 1065 of 8809). Plastic surgery (1.46% per year) and general surgery (0.95% per year) had larger annual growth rates of women residents than the other specialties did. In each surgical specialty, the annual growth rate of residents from URM groups was insignificant. CONCLUSION: During the past decade, there was only a small increase in the representation of women in orthopaedic surgery, while the representation of people from URM groups did not change. In contrast, by 2020, general surgery had become the most diverse among the seven surgical specialties. To increase diversity in our field, we need to evaluate and implement some of the effective interventions that have helped general surgery become the diverse surgical specialty that it is today. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: General surgery has substantially reduced gender and ethnic disparities that existed in the past, while those in orthopaedic surgery still persist. General surgery residencies have implemented a holistic review of resident applications and longitudinal mentoring programs to successfully address these disparities. Orthopaedic surgery programs should consider placing less emphasis on United States Medical Licensing Examination score thresholds and more weight on applicants' non-academic attributes, and put more efforts into targeted longitudinal mentorship programs, some of which should be led by non-minority faculty.","Haffner, Max R; Van, Benjamin W; Wick, Joseph B; Le, Hai V",,,176

419219,Practical laboratory considerations amidst the COVID-19 outbreak: early experience from Singapore,2020,"Nowadays, social network platforms have been the prime source for people to experience news and events due to their capacities to spread information rapidly, which inevitably provides a fertile ground for the dissemination of fake news. Thus, it is significant to detect fake news otherwise it could cause public misleading and panic. Existing deep learning models have achieved great progress to tackle the problem of fake news detection. However, training an effective deep learning model usually requires a large amount of labeled news, while it is expensive and time-consuming to provide sufficient labeled news in actual applications. To improve the detection performance of fake news, we take advantage of the event correlations of news and propose an event correlation filtering method (ECFM) for fake news detection, mainly consisting of the news characterizer, the pseudo label annotator, the event credibility updater, and the news entropy selector. The news characterizer is responsible for extracting textual features from news, which cooperates with the pseudo label annotator to assign pseudo labels for unlabeled news by fully exploiting the event correlations of news. In addition, the event credibility updater employs adaptive Kalman filter to weaken the credibility fluctuations of events. To further improve the detection performance, the news entropy selector automatically discovers high-quality samples from pseudo labeled news by quantifying their news entropy. Finally, ECFM is proposed to integrate them to detect fake news in an event correlation filtering manner. Extensive experiments prove that the explainable introduction of the event correlations of news is beneficial to improve the detection performance of fake news.","Li, Hao; Wang, Huan; Informatics, Guanghua Liu College of; University, Huazhong Agricultural; Science, Department of Computer; Engineering,; Buffalo, University at; York, The State University of New",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05491v2.pdf,176
419285,New onset neurologic events in people with COVID-19 in 3 regions in China,2020,"PURPOSE: With the widespread prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), cancer patients are suggested to wear a surgical mask during radiation treatment. In this study, cone beam CT (CBCT) was used to investigate the effect of surgical mask on setup errors in head and neck radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 91 patients with head and neck tumors were selected. CBCT was performed to localize target volume after patient set up. The images obtained by CBCT before treatment were automatically registered with CT images and manually fine-tuned. The setup errors of patients in 6 directions of Vrt, Lng, Lat, Pitch, Roll and Rotation were recorded. The patients were divided into groups according to whether they wore the surgical mask, the type of immobilization mask used and the location of the isocenter. The setup errors of patients were calculated. A t-test was performed to detect whether it was statistically significant. RESULTS: In the 4 groups, the standard deviation in the directions of Lng and Pitch of the with surgical mask group were all higher than that in the without surgical mask group. In the head-neck-shoulder mask group, the mean in the Lng direction of the with surgical mask group was larger than that of the without surgical mask group. In the lateral isocenter group, the mean in the Lng and Pitch directions of the with surgical mask group were larger than that of the without surgical mask group. The t-test results showed that there was significant difference in the setup error between the 2 groups (p = 0.043 and p = 0.013, respectively) only in the Lng and Pitch directions of the head-neck-shoulder mask group. In addition, the setup error of 6 patients with immobilization open masks exhibited no distinguished difference from that of the patients with regular immobilization masks. CONCLUSION: In the head and neck radiotherapy patients, the setup error was affected by wearing surgical mask. It is recommended that the immobilization open mask should be used when the patient cannot finish the whole treatment with a surgical mask.","Ding, Yi; Ma, Pingping; Li, Wei; Wei, Xueyan; Qiu, Xiaoping; Hu, Desheng; Wu, Yuan; Wei, Wei; Zeng, Fanyu; Wang, Xiaohong; Wang, Xiao",Technol Cancer Res Treat,,176

420760,“Won’t You Be My Doctor?”: Four Keys to a Satisfying Relationship in an Increasingly Virtual World,2020,"Introduction: Due to the COVID-19 crisis or any other mass casualty situation it might be necessary to give artificial ventilation to many affected patients. Contrarily, the worldwide availability of emergency ventilators is still a shortage, especially in developing countries. Methods: Modes of artificial ventilation were compared and the most safe, easy to use, and lung protecting principle was optimized to fit all requirements of both emergency ventilation and cost-effective mass production. Results: The presented research results describe a simplified device for a pressure-controlled ventilation which works without electricity according to a known principle. Just pressurized gas and a patient connection is required. The device enables the control of basic ventilator parameters such as peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure and the ventilation frequency. Further, the device is semiadaptive to the patient's lung stiffness and automatically maintains minute volume through frequency adjustment. The machine can be manufactured by turning, milling and drilling and needs purchased components with costs less than 100 USD. A sterilization and thus a reuse is possible. Discussion: The presented development does not describe a ready-to-purchase ventilator, it rather outlines a refined working principle for emergency ventilation and its easiest methods of production with a minimum of requirements. The presented research aims on providing an open-source guideline for production of an emergency ventilator using worldwide available methods and thus should inspire local researchers to do a reverse engineering and eventually to put it into operation following country-specific regulations. For long-term ventilation exceeding emergency purposes, a monitoring of alarms for disconnection and violation of desired ventilator parameters should be established. The ventilator is limited to a fixed ratio between PIP and PEEP. Moreover, the ventilation frequency depends on two parameters, which needs some training. Nevertheless, the ventilator provides basic features to enable an emergency ventilation with minimal prerequisites.","Szlosarek, R; Teichert, R; Wetzel, A; Fichtner, A; Reuter, F; Kröger, M",,,176

Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. The candidate vaccines in this study were OZG-3861 version 1 (V1), an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1), a GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine. The candidate vaccines were applied intradermally to BALB/c mice to assess toxicity and immunogenicity. Preliminary results in vaccinated mice are reported in this study. Especially, the vaccine models containing GM-CSF caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature, when considered in terms of T and B cell responses. Another important finding was that the presence of adjuvant was more important in T cell in comparison with B cell response. Vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study shows that the vaccines are effective and leads us to start the challenge test to investigate the gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates for infective SARS-CoV-2 virus in humanized ACE2 + mice.","Sir Karakus, Gozde; Tastan, Cihan; Dilek Kancagi, Derya; Yurtsever, Bulut; Tumentemur, Gamze; Demir, Sevda; Turan, Raife Dilek; Abanuz, Selen; Cakirsoy, Didem; Seyis, Utku; Ozer, Samed; Elibol, Omer; Elek, Muhammer; Ertop, Gurcan; Arbak, Serap; Acikel Elmas, Merve; Hemsinlioglu, Cansu; Kocagoz, Ayse Sesin; Hatirnaz Ng, Ozden; Akyoney, Sezer; Sahin, Ilayda; Ozbek, Ugur; Telci, Dilek; Sahin, Fikrettin; Yalcin, Koray; Ratip, Siret; Ovali, Ercument",Sci Rep,,176
421550,Direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized polystyrene column for COVID-19,2020,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged as the causative agent behind the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Treatment efforts have been severely impeded due to the lack of specific effective antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-associated pathologies. In the present research endeavour the inhibitory prospects of cyanobacterial metabolites were assessed at the active binding pockets of the two vital SARS-CoV-2 proteases namely, main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro) that proteolytically process viral polyproteins and facilitate viral replication, employing an in silico molecular interaction-based approach. It was evident from our analysis based on the binding energy scores that the metabolites cylindrospermopsin, deoxycylindrospermopsin, carrageenan, cryptophycin 52, eucapsitrione, tjipanazole, tolyporphin and apratoxin A exhibited promising inhibitory potential against the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The compounds cryptophycin 1, cryptophycin 52 and deoxycylindrospermopsin were observed to display encouraging binding energy scores with the PLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Subsequent estimation of physicochemical properties and potential toxicity of the metabolites followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of MM-PBSA energy scoring function established deoxycylindrospermopsin as the most promising inhibitory candidate against both SARS-CoV-2 proteases. Present research findings bestow ample scopes to further exploit the potential of deoxycylindrospermopsin as a successful inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo and pave the foundation for the development of novel effective therapeutics against COVID-19.

421612,Parental access to hospitalised children during infectious disease pandemics such as COVID-19,2021,"COVID-19 is characterized by a severe pulmonary disease due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection. For clinicians involved in the management of patients with chronic autoimmune diseases the risk linked to the conditions itself and to drug-induced immunosuppression during the COVID-19 pandemic is a major topic. Pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disease (AIBD) of the skin and mucous membranes caused by autoantibodies to desmosomal components, desmoglein 1 and 3. Among immunosuppressant therapies, rituximab (RTX) is considered a highly effective treatment with a favorable safety profile, but it induces a prolonged B-cell depletion that can lead to higher susceptibility to infections. For this reason, concerns about its use during the pandemic have been raised. We describe a case of a pemphigus patient in which RTX-induced B cell depletion led to the severe inflammatory phase, whereas corticosteroid treatment allowed a favorable outcome.","Sinagra, Jo Linda; Vedovelli, Claudio; Binazzi, Raffaella; Salemme, Adele; Moro, Francesco; Mazzanti, Cinzia; Didona, Biagio; Di Zenzo, Giovanni",Front Immunol,,176

The objective of this study was to explore the role of cytological diagnosis in EBUS-TBNAs. METHODS: Eight hundred and thirteen consecutive cases performed EBUS-TBNA with both cytological and histological diagnoses were retrospectively reviewed. All patients were followed up for clinical data. RESULTS: Before immunohistochemical examination, the cytological sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNAs were 92.9% (421/453), 98.9% (348/352), 95.5% (769/805), respectively. After immunohistochemical examination, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 93.0% (423/455), 99.4% (348/350), 95.8% (771/805), respectively. The majority of false-negative were cases whose cytological diagnosis was ""atypical"" or the cytological diagnosis suggested ""inadequate."" ""Neoplastic"" were also prone to false-negative cytology. The diagnostic accordance rate of cytological subtyping was 90.3% for squamous-cell carcinoma, 99.2% for adenocarcinoma, and 98.1% for small-cell carcinoma before immunohistochemical examination, and became 85.9%, 98.5%, and 98.2% after immunohistochemical examination, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cytological diagnosis in EBUS-TBNAs had a good sensitivity and high specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of cytological diagnosis were proved to be higher after the immunohistochemical examination. At the same time, cytology had high accordance rate in subtype diagnosis. False-negative results occurred more commonly in cases whose cytological diagnosis was ""atypical"" or the cytological diagnosis suggested ""inadequate"" or the corresponding histological diagnosis was ""Neoplastic.""","Ren, Wen-Hao; Zou, Shuang-Mei; Zhang, Yue-Ming; Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Lin-Lin; Lu, Ning; Cao, Jian",Diagn. cytopathol,,176

Objective: To evaluate host endothelial, epithelial and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19Methods: We prospectively enrolled 169 ICU patients with suspicion of COVID-19 infection, including 78 (46%) patients positive and 91 (54%) negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection from April to September, 2020. We compared 22 plasma biomarkers in blood collected within 24 hours and 3 days after ICU admission. Measurement and Main Results: ICU patients with and without COVID-19 had similar rates of severe acute kidney injury, shock, thromboembolism and in-hospital mortality. Rates of ARDS were higher in COVID-19 (aRR = 5.9, 95% CI: 3.2-11.0). While concentrations of interleukin 6 and 8 were not different between groups, markers of epithelial cell injury (soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products, sRAGE) and acute phase proteins (serum amyloid A, SAA) were significantly higher in COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19, adjusting for demographics and APACHE III scores (Figure 1). In contrast, angiopoietin 2:1 (Ang-2:1 ratio) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR-1), markers of endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, were significantly lower in COVID-19 (Bonferroni corrected p&lt;0.002). Ang-2:1 ratio and SAA were associated with mortality only in non-COVID-19 patients.Conclusions: These studies demonstrate that, unlike other well-studied causes of critical illness, endothelial dysfunction is not characteristic of severe COVID-19 early after ICU admission. Pathways resulting in elaboration of acute phase proteins and inducing epithelial cell injury may be promising targets for therapeutics. 2 (Table Presented).","Bhatraju, P.; Morrell, E.

The demographic, clinical, laboratory, and chest imaging data of patients admitted to the ICU of Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10 to April 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Student's t-test and Chi-square test were used to compare the continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The logistic regression model was employed to ascertain the risk factors of mortality. This retrospective study involved 123 patients, including 64 dead and 59 survivors. Among them, 57 people were tested for interleukin-6 (IL-6) (20 died and 37 survived). In all included patients, the oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) was identified as an independent risk factor (odd ratio [OR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.928-0.994, p = 0.021). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.895 (95% CI: 0.826-0.943, p < 0.0001). Among the patients tested for IL-6, the PaO2/FiO2 (OR = 0.955, 95%CI: 0.915-0.996, p = 0.032) and IL-6 (OR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.001-1.025, p = 0.028) were identified as independent risk factors. The AUC was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.791-0.964, p < 0.0001) for IL-6 and 0.865 (95% CI: 0.748-0.941, p < 0.0001) for PaO2/FiO2. PaO2/FiO2 and IL-6 could potentially serve as independent risk factors for predicting death in COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care.","Gu, Yanli; Wang, Donghui; Chen, Cen; Lu, Wanjun; Liu, Hongbing; Lv, Tangfeng; Song, Yong; Zhang, Fang",Sci Rep,,176
425484,The Use of the Anticoagulant Heparin and Corticosteroid Dexamethasone as Prominent Treatments for COVID-19,2021,"Human coronaviruses, especially COVID-19, is an emerging pandemic infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality. Coronaviruses are associated with comorbidities, along with the symptoms of it. SARS-CoV-2 is one of the highly pathogenic coronaviruses that causes a high death rate compared to the SARS-CoV and MERS. In this review, we focused on the mechanism of coronavirus with comorbidities and impairment in multi-organ function. The main dysfunction upon coronavirus infection is damage to alveolar and acute respiratory failure. It is associated with the other organ damage such as cardiovascular risk via an increased level of hypertension through ACE2, gastrointestinal dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risks such as chemosis, conjunctivitis, and conjunctival hyperemia, cancer risk, venous thromboembolism, tuberculosis, aging, and cardiovascular dysfunction and reproductive risk. Along with this, we have discussed the immunopathology and coronaviruses at a molecular level and therapeutic approaches for the coronavirus infection. The comorbidities and multi-organ failure of COVID-19 have been explained at a molecular level along with the base of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This review would help us to understand the comorbidities associated with the coronaviruses with multi-organ damage.","Renu, Kaviyarasi; Prasanna, Pureti Lakshmi; Valsala Gopalakrishnan, Abilash",Life Sci,,176

Healthcare workers are at constant risk of infection. The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in Colombia. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study focused on estimating the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers from 65 hospitals in 10 cities of Colombia during the second semester of 2020. The seroprevalence was determined using an automated immunoassay (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 CLIA IgG). The study included a survey to establish the sociodemographic variables and the risk of infection. Results: The global seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was 35% (95% Bayesian Confidence Interval 33%-37%). All the personnel reported the use of protective equipment. General services personnel and nurses presented the highest rates of seroprevalence among the healthcare workers. Low socioeconomic strata have shown a strong association with seropositivity. Conclusion: This study shows the occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. Even though, all the personnel reported the use of protective equipment, the seroprevalence in the general services personnel and nurses was high. Also, it was observed a significant difference by city. The results could be used to perform prevention and control in this exposed population.

Studies that evaluated the CT manifestations of common and severe COVID-19 pneumonia were included. Among the 9736 searched results, 15 articles describing 1453 common patients and 697 severe patients met the inclusion criteria. Based on the CT images, the common patients were less frequent to exhibit consolidation (odds ratio [OR] = 0.31), pleural effusion (OR = 0.19), lymphadenopathy (OR = 0.17), crazy-paving pattern (OR = 0.22), interlobular septal thickening (OR = 0.27), reticulation (OR = 0.20), traction bronchiectasis (OR = 0.40) with over two lobes involved (OR = 0.07) and central distribution (OR = 0.18) while more frequent to bear unilateral pneumonia (OR = 4.65) involving one lobe (OR = 13.84) or two lobes (OR = 6.95) when compared with severe patients.

427209,Teleophthalmology and COVID-19: the patient perspective,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic that has affected all countries in the world. The aim of this study is to examine the potential advantages of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19, which are the three main variables of interest. This paper contributes to the literature on forecasting COVID-19 pandemic in several ways. Firstly, an algorithm is proposed to calculate the optimal parameters of SSA including window length and the number of leading components. Secondly, the results of two forecasting approaches in the SSA, namely vector and recurrent forecasting, are compared to those from other commonly used time series forecasting techniques. These include Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Fractional ARIMA (ARFIMA), Exponential Smoothing, TBATS, and Neural Network Autoregression (NNAR). Thirdly, the best forecasting model is chosen based on the accuracy measure Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and it is applied to forecast 40 days ahead. These forecasts can help us to predict the future behaviour of this disease and make better decisions. The dataset of Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University is adopted to forecast the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for top ten affected countries until October 29, 2020. The findings of this investigation show that no single model can provide the best model for any of the countries and forecasting horizons considered here. However, the SSA technique is found to be viable option for forecasting the number of daily confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries caused by COVID-19 based on the number of times that it outperforms the competing models.","Kalantari, Mahdi",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,176

In this unprecedented crisis, educators, managers and families had to deal with unpredictability and look for new ways of learning and teaching. Based on the paradigm of transmission of mass distribution, remotely teaching has gained strength, with the teacher as the protagonist of the education process. Instead of interactivity, content is emphasized to the detriment of more participatory, dialogic, and collaborative methodologies. It is necessary to prepare teachers and students for the online education modality to face this critical moment. Thus, this article suggests online pedagogical actions supported by the multireferential research-formation and everyday school methodologies, which promote the teachers' and students' participation in an interactive and collaborative way.","Rossini, Tatiana Stofella Sodré; do Amaral, Miriam Maia; Santos, Edméa",Prospects (Paris),,176

A more stringent, curfew regulation was imposed on April 3, 2020. Under these measures, the activities of businesses, transportation, and industrial sectors were reduced or temporally closed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level in the whole of Thailand and specifically in the Bangkok metropolitan area. The concentrations of tropospheric NO2 were extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite data. The Google Earth Engine JavaScript API was used to retrieve and calculate the NO2 data. Python was also used to extract NO2 values from the output raster data. The results showed that the level of NO2 increased by 47.4% during the COVID-19 pandemic in the whole of Thailand;NO2 declined by 4.8% in the Bangkok metropolitan area, but there was no significant difference compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. NO2 level during curfew regulation declined by 9.5% in the whole of Thailand and decreased by 20.1% in the Bangkok metropolitan area. After comparing the same time duration in 2019 and 2020 on a monthly basis, the results revealed that NO2 level in 2020 declined by 9.1% and 9.8% for the whole of Thailand and Bangkok metropolitan area, respectively. Our findings support that these measures can temporarily reduce NO2 levels. Once all sectors resume as normal, we concern that the NO2 emissions will rebound. Hence, the challenge after the COVID-19 pandemic is how to improve and protect our environment while restoring the economy, which is a crucial issue that policymakers should fully address.","Oo, T.

429426,Covid-19 in children,2020,"PURPOSE: The MAIA trial found that addition of daratumumab to lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd) significantly prolonged progression-free survival in transplant-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, compared with lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone (Rd). However, daratumumab is a costly treatment and is administered indefinitely until disease progression. Therefore, it is unclear whether it is cost-effective to use daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with reserving its use until later lines of therapy. METHODS: We created a Markov model to compare healthcare costs and clinical outcomes of transplant-ineligible patients treated with daratumumab in the first-line setting compared with a strategy of reserving daratumumab until the second-line. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for first-line daratumumab versus second-line daratumumab from a US payer perspective. RESULTS: First-line daratumumab was associated with an improvement of 0.52 QALYs and 0.66 discounted life-years compared with second-line daratumumab. While both treatment strategies were associated with considerable lifetime expenditures ($1,434,937 v $1,112,101 in US dollars), an incremental cost of $322,836 for first-line daratumumab led to an ICER of $618,018 per QALY. The cost of daratumumab would need to be decreased by 67% for first-line daratumumab to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Using daratumumab in the first-line setting for transplant-ineligible patients may not be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying daratumumab until subsequent lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without significantly compromising clinical outcomes. Mature overall survival data are necessary to more fully evaluate cost-effectiveness in this setting.","Patel, Kishan K; Giri, Smith; Parker, Terri L; Bar, Noffar; Neparidze, Natalia; Huntington, Scott F",J Clin Oncol,,176

A loop disordered in the D614 S trimer wedges between domains within a protomer in the G614 spike. This added interaction appears to prevent premature dissociation of the G614 trimer-effectively increasing the number of functional spikes and enhancing infectivity-and to modulate structural rearrangements for membrane fusion. These findings extend our understanding of viral entry and suggest an improved immunogen for vaccine development.","Zhang, Jun; Cai, Yongfei; Xiao, Tianshu; Lu, Jianming; Peng, Hanqin; Sterling, Sarah M; Walsh, Richard M; Rits-Volloch, Sophia; Zhu, Haisun; Woosley, Alec N; Yang, Wei; Sliz, Piotr; Chen, Bing",Science,,176
432357,Perspectives on COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 has attracted global attention due to its rapid spread around the world with substantial morbidity and associated mortality Severe COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock leading to death These complications are thought to result from an overactivation of the immune system, leading to a cytokine storm syndrome associated with multiple organ failure Here, we report that high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a prototypical damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and a central mediator of lethal inflammation, could be a potential target for innovative therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 Serum HMGB1 in severe COVID-19 patients is elevated (189 40 ± 140 88 ng/ml) Exogenous HMGB1 induces the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 in alveolar epithelial cells in an AGER-dependent manner Importantly, genetic (using AGER siRNA) or pharmacological (using glycyrrhizin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and FPS-ZM1) inhibition of the HMGB1-AGER pathway blocks ACE2 expression Thus, HMGB1 inhibitors are likewise promising drug candidates for the treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19","Chen, Ruochan Huang Yan Quan Jun Liu Jiao Wang Haichao Billiar Timothy R.; Lotze, Michael T.; Zeh, Herbert J.; Kang, Rui Tang Daolin",Heliyon,,176
432672,Breast Cancer Management during the COVID 19 Pandemic: French Guidelines,2020,"BACKGROUND: The treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 disease remains a dilemma so far, because there is no approved therapy for it. This study aimed to estimate the therapeutic efficacy of tocilizumab and its role in reducing the need for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, mortality rate for these cases. METHOD: The study included 25 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 infection. Treatment of all patients followed Egyptian Ministry of Health COVID-19 protocol in addition to tocilizumab IV (400-800 mg) as a single dose and then the dose was repeated after at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours from the previous dose. All laboratory and clinical parameters were assessed before and within 24 hours after tocilizumab administration. RESULTS: After receiving TCZ, all patients showed significantly lower median IL 6, LDH, CRP, ferritin , TLC at P < .001, and D-Dimer at P = .223 than their baseline levels. Also, the number of patients who required mechanical ventilation decreased from 11 to 8. Only five patients died after TCZ treatment. A moderate correlation was found between therapeutic failure and death outcomes and mechanical ventilation need at baseline. The median days of hospitalisation (IQR) were 10 (6-16). CONCLUSION: Tocilizumab treatment in patients with severe COVID-19 is safe and has significant therapeutic effects and a significant role in the improvement of all laboratory parameters. Also TCZ plays a significant role in the reduction of the length of stay in hospital and ICU, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rate.What's known IL-6 plays the main role in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with severe COVID-19 infection. Consequently, serum IL-6 can be considered as an important target in therapeutic management of severe COVID-19 patients. What's new Prospective study, carried on 25 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 infection using tocilizumab, showed significant improvement in their case. Tocilizumab, as an IL-6 inhibitor, not only lowered IL-6 level put also showed a significant reduction on median LDH, CRP, ferritin , TLC at P < .001 and D-Dimer at P = .223 than their baseline levels. Improvement of all laboratory parameters using TCZ was reflected in the reduction of the length of stay in hospital and ICU, need for mechanical ventilation and mortality rate.","Sarhan, Rania M; Madney, Yasmin M; Abou Warda, Ahmed E; Boshra, Marian S",Int J Clin Pract,,176

432748,At the 'heart' of the COVID-19 outbreak: early cardiac implications and mitigating strategies,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage the human population; therefore, multiple prevention and intervention protocols are being rapidly developed. The aim of our study was to develop a new chemo-prophylactic/-therapeutic strategy that effectively prevents COVID-19 and related complications. METHODS: In in vitro studies, COVID-19 infection-sensitive cells were incubated with human oropharyngeal fluids containing high SARS-CoV-2 loads. Levels of infection were determined via intra-cellular virus loads using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Efficacies for infection prevention were determined using several antiviral treatments: lipid-encapsulated ozonized oil (HOO), water-soluble HOO (HOOws), UV, and hydrogen peroxide. In in vivo studies, safety and efficacy of HOO in fighting COVID-19 infection was evaluated in human subjects. RESULTS: HOO in combination with HOOws was the only treatment able to fully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as well as its capacity to penetrate and reproduce inside sensitive cells. Accordingly, the feasibility of using HOO/HOOws was tested in vivo. Analysis of expired gas in healthy subjects indicates that HOO administration increases oxygen availability in the lung. For our human studies, HOO/HOOws was administered to 52 cancer patients and 21 healthy subjects at high risk for COVID-19 infection, and all of them showed clinical safety. None of them developed COVID-19 infection, although an incidence of at least 11 cases was expected. Efficacy of HOO/HOOws was tested in four COVID-19 patients obtaining recovery and qPCR negativization in less than 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, the HOO/HOOws treatment can be administered at standard doses (three pills per day) for chemo-prophylactic purposes to healthy subjects for COVID-19 prevention and at high doses (up to eight pills per day) for therapeutic purposes to infected patients. This combined prevention strategy can provide a novel protocol to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Izzotti, Alberto; Fracchia, Enzo; Au, William; Colombo, Monica; Pfeffer, Ulrich; Emionite, Laura; Pavan, Simone; Miotto, Daniele; Lova, Paola; Grasselli, Elena; Faelli, Emanuela; Piero, Ruggeri; Tiso, Micaela; Pulliero, Alessandra",,,176
433128,COVID-19 and obesity: fighting two pandemics with intermittent fasting,2021,"A group of patients with pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported from China in December 2019. Although several antiviral drugs are widely tested, none of them has been approved as specific antiviral therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Accumulating evidence established a hyperinflammatory states or cytokine storm in COVID-19. Among these cytokines, IL-6 plays a key role in cytokine storm and can predict the adverse clinical outcomes and fatality in these patients. Based on the evidence of the significant role of IL-6 in cytokine storm, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases as principal comorbidities, it seems that anti-cytokine therapy may be useful in patients with severe COVID-19 to reduce mortality. Recent studies demonstrated that herbal-derived natural products had immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties and exhibited exceptional act on mediators of inflammation. Parthenolide is the principal sesquiterpene lactones and the main biologically active constituent Tanacetum parthenium (commonly known as feverfew) which has could significantly reduce IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-&#945; production pathways established in several human cell line models in vitro and in vivo studies.

Materials and Methods: This US retrospective analysis used the Premier Perspectives Database. We investigated changes in operative volume through March 2020. Baseline operative volume for urologic surgery was calculated using data from the preceding 12 months and compared on a total and by procedure basis. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify hospital-level predictors of change in response to the pandemic. Results: At baseline, we captured 23,788 urologic procedural encounters per month as compared with 19,071 during March 2020- a 19.9% decrease. Urologic oncology-related cases were relatively preserved as compared to others (average change in March 2020: +1.1% versus -32.2%). Northeastern (beta = -5.66, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.2 to -1.18, p = 0.013) and Midwestern hospitals (beta = -4.17, 95% CI: -7.89 to -0.45, p = 0.027;both with South as reference region), and those with an increasing percentage of patients insured by Medicaid (beta= -0.17 per percentage point, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.01, p = 0.04) experienced a significantly larger decrease in volume. Conclusions: There was a 20% decline in urologic operative volume in March 2020, compared with baseline, that preferentially affected hospitals serving Medicaid patients, and those in Northeast and Midwest. In the face of varying mandates on elective surgery, widespread declines in operative volume may also represent hesitancy on behalf of patients to interface with healthcare during the pandemic.","Lewicki, P.; Arenas-Gallo, C.; Basourakos, S.

But its role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, frequencies of total and multiple subsets of lymphocytes in peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals were analyzed using a multicolor flow cytometry assay. Plasma concentration of IL-10 was measured using a microsphere-based immunoassay kit. Comparing to healthy controls, the frequencies of total lymphocytes and T cells decreased significantly in both acutely infected COVID-19 patients and discharged individuals. The frequencies of total lymphocytes correlated negatively with the frequencies of CD3- CD56+ NK cells. The frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells correlated with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios positively, while the frequencies of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ CD127- T cells correlated negatively with CD4+ /CD8+ T cell ratios. Ratios of CD4+ /CD8+ T cells increased significantly in patients beyond age of 45 years. And accordingly, the frequencies of regulatory CD8+ CD25+ T cells were also found significantly increased in these patients. Collectively, the results suggest that regulatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may play distinct roles in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Moreover, the data indicate that NK cells might contribute to the COVID-19 associated lymphopenia.","Gao, Menglu; Liu, Yili; Guo, Mingquan; Wang, Qianying; Wang, Yan; Fan, Jian; Shen, Yinzhong; Hou, Junjie; Wan, Yanmin; Zhu, Zhaoqin",J Leukoc Biol,,176

Coronavirus has infected over 38.3 million people and caused millions of deaths worldwide. The COVID-19 outbreak has accentuated the need for additional efforts to develop broad-spectrum therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the current investigation, an attempt was made to design potential SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors containing naphthalene and 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moieties connected via -NHCO- linker. The ligands obeyed Lipinski's rule and were found to have good drug-likeness and ADMET properties. Docking simulations confirmed strong binding affinity and inhibition potential of the designed ligands against the receptor SARS CoV-2 Papain-like protease (PLpro). LigandL10 incorporating the oxadiazole ring system displayed better binding affinity than the control 5-acetamido-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide. Further, the docked complex of LigandL10 was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to examine the molecular mechanisms of protein-ligand interactions. The results of the present study are encouraging. Ligand L10 emerged as the most potent ligand in the series and could be considered for further research for the development of potential therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.","Bhati, Shipra",Heliyon,,176

436332,COVID-19-Associated Candidiasis (CAC): An Underestimated Complication in the Absence of Immunological Predispositions?,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has subsequently spread worldwide. In the absence of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapies, the disease is spreading at an alarming rate. A possibility of a resurgence of COVID-19 in places where lockdowns have already worked is also developing. Thus, for controlling COVID-19, vaccines may be a better option than drugs. An mRNA-based anti-COVID-19 candidate vaccine has entered a phase 1 clinical trial. However, its efficacy and potency have to be evaluated and validated. Since vaccines have high failure rates, as an alternative, we are presenting a new, designed multi-peptide subunit-based epitope vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant vaccine construct comprises an adjuvant, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), helper T-lymphocyte (HTL), and B-cell epitopes joined by linkers. The computational data suggest that the vaccine is non-toxic, non-allergenic, thermostable, with the capability to elicit a humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The stabilization of the vaccine construct is validated with molecular dynamics simulation studies. This unique vaccine is made up of 33 highly antigenic epitopes from three proteins that have a prominent role in host-receptor recognition, viral entry, and pathogenicity. We advocate this vaccine must be synthesized and tested urgently as a public health priority.","Kalita, Parismita; Padhi, Aditya K; Zhang, Kam Y J; Tripathi, Timir",Microb Pathog,,176

We compared the clinical characteristics between younger patients (aged &lt;60 years) and older patients (aged ≥60 years) with COVID-19, detected the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital stay, and examined the treatments commonly used with a particular focus on antiviral therapies. Methods : This retrospective study was conducted at the West Campus, Union Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The sample consisted of 123 patients admitted to the hospital between February 9, 2020, and March 3, 2020. The data related to the demographics, laboratory findings, and treatment were analyzed to identify discrepancies between younger and older patients and those with and without primary diseases. The risk factors that contribute to a prolonged hospital stay were subsequently identified. Results : Patients aged ≥60 years required longer hospital stay than younger patients (P = 0.021 and P = 0.001, respectively). The percentage of lymphocytes was significantly lower in older patients and those with primary diseases (P = 0.016 and P = 0.042, respectively). The findings revealed that the risk factors that contributed to the length of hospital stay were age, the number of days of illness before hospitalization, white blood cell (WBC) count and albumin levels at admission, a neutrophil fraction at discharge, and antibiotic treatment. Analysis using a model that consisted of the above five risk factors for predicting prolonged hospital stay (i.e., &gt;14 days) yielded an area under the ROC (AuROC) curve of 0.716. Antiviral and antibiotic treatments were administered to 97.6% and 39.0% of patients, respectively. The antiviral drugs most commonly administered were traditional Chinese medicine (83.7%) and arbidol (75.6%). Conclusions : In this study, older patients and those with primary diseases were at a higher risk of worse clinical manifestations. The physicians who treat the patients should pay close attention to the risk factors that contribute to the length of hospital stay, which could be used for predicting prolonged hospital stay. Traditional Chinese medicine and arbidol were the most frequently used antiviral drugs. Nevertheless, the extent to which these medications can effectively treat COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Peng, Qian-Yi Ma Xin-Hua Liu Zhi-Yong Zhao Chun-Guang Zhang Lei Qian Zhao-Xin Zhang Li-Na",Journal of Intensive Medicine,,176

438056,Fundus evaluation in COVID-19 positives with non-severe disease,2021,"Venezuela remains in a deep crisis under the authoritarian rule of Nicolas Maduro of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Maduro, narrowly elected in 2013 after the death of Hugo Chavez (president, 1999-2013), began a second term on January 10, 2019, that is widely considered illegitimate. Since January 2019, Juan Guaido, president of Venezuela's democratically elected, opposition-controlled National Assembly, has sought to form a transition government to serve until internationally observed elections can be held. The United States and 57 other countries recognize Guaido as interim president, but he has been unable to harness that diplomatic support to wrest Maduro from power. Venezuela's economy has collapsed. The country is plagued by hyperinflation, severe shortages of food and medicine, and a dire humanitarian crisis that has further deteriorated in 2020 as a result of gasoline shortages, an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and strengthened U.S. sanctions. Maduro has blamed U.S. sanctions for the economic crisis, but many observers cite economic mismanagement and corruption as the main factors. U.N. agencies estimate that 5.1 million Venezuelans have fled the country as of August 2020, primarily to neighboring countries. U.S. Policy Since recognizing the Guaido government in January 2019, the United States has coordinated its efforts with Interim President Guaido. U.S. strategy has emphasized diplomatic efforts to bolster support for Guaido;targeted sanctions and visa revocations to increase pressure on Maduro officials;broader sanctions on the state oil company, other state-controlled companies and institutions, and the government;and humanitarian aid ($534 million to countries sheltering Venezuelans and $76 million for Venezuela from FY2017 through May 2020). In October 2019, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) signed an agreement with the Guaido government enabling the provision of development assistance and increased democracy assistance. In 2020, the Administration has sanctioned companies that have transported Venezuelan oil and seized Venezuela-bound ships carrying Iranian petroleum products in violation of sanctions. U.S. officials have vowed to keep ""maximum pressure"" on Maduro and his foreign backers until he agrees to allow a transition government to convene free and fair legislative and presidential elections. Congressional Action Congress has supported the Administration's efforts to support a restoration of democracy in Venezuela without U.S. military intervention in the country and to provide humanitarian support to Venezuelans, although some Members have expressed concerns about the humanitarian impact of sanctions. In December 2019, Congress enacted P.L. 116-94, which appropriates $30 million in FY2020 assistance for democracy programs in Venezuela and incorporates the Senate-reported version of the VERDAD Act (S. 1025), a comprehensive bill to address the crisis in Venezuela. The VERDAD Act incorporated House-passed measures authorizing FY2020 humanitarian aid to Venezuela (H.R. 854), restricting the export of defense articles to Venezuela (H.R. 920), and requiring a U.S. strategy to counter Russian influence in Venezuela (H.R. 1477). In December 2019, Congress also enacted P.L. 116-92, which prohibits federal contracting with persons who do business with the Maduro government. In July 2019, the House passed H.R. 549, designating Venezuela as a beneficiary country for temporary protected status;however, a Senate effort to pass H.R. 549 by unanimous consent failed. For FY2021, the Administration requested $200 million in democracy aid aimed to support a democratic transition in Venezuela and $5 million in global health assistance;the House-passed version of the measure (H.R. 7608, H. Rept. 116-444) would provide $30 in democracy aid for Venezuela and support the provision of additional aid if a democratic transition occurs.

We found high diagnostic sensitivities (%, 95% confidence interval [CI]) for the Roche Test (97.4%, 93.4-99.0%), Abbott Test (94.0%, 89.1-96.8%), Wondfo Test (91.4%, 85.8-94.9%), ASK Test (97.4%, 93.4-99.0%), and Dynamiker Test (90.1%, 84.3-94.0%) after >21 days of symptom onset. Meanwhile, the diagnostic specificity was 99.0% (95% CI, 96.3-99.7%) for the Roche Test, 97.9% (95% CI, 94.8-99.2%) for the Abbott Test, and 100.0% (95% CI, 98.1-100.0%) for the three LFIAs. Cross-reactivity was observed in sera containing anti-cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG/IgM antibodies and autoantibodies. No difference was observed in the time to seroconversion detection of the five serological tests. Specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia demonstrated a shorter seroconversion time and higher chemiluminescent signal than those without pneumonia. Our data suggested that understanding the dynamic antibody response after COVID-19 infection and performance characteristics of different serological test are crucial for the appropriate interpretation of serological test result for the diagnosis and risk assessment of patient with COVID-19 infection.","Chen, Shey-Ying; Lee, Yu-Lin; Lin, Yi-Chun; Lee, Nan-Yao; Liao, Chia-Hung; Hung, Yuan-Pin; Lu, Min-Chi; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Tseng, Wen-Pin; Lin, Chien-Hao; Chung, Ming-Yi; Kang, Chun-Min; Lee, Ya-Fan; Lee, Tai-Fen; Cheng, Chien-Yu; Chen, Cheng-Pin; Huang, Chien-Hua; Liu, Chun-Eng; Cheng, Shu-Hsing; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Chen, Shyr-Chyr",Emerg Microbes Infect,,176

438421,The Dermatologist's Perspective: Why is COVID-19 mortality lower in females than males?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Human to human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the respiratory route but little is known about the pattern and quantity of virus output from exhaled breath. We have previously shown that face-mask sampling (FMS) can detect exhaled tubercle bacilli and have adapted its use to quantify exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients admitted to hospital with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Between May and December 2020, we took two concomitant FMS and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) over two days, starting within 24 h of a routine virus positive NPS in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK. Participants were asked to wear a modified duckbilled facemask for 30 min, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, as well as International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) mortality and deterioration scores were obtained. Exposed masks were processed by removal, dissolution and analysis of sampling matrix strips fixed within the mask by RT-qPCR. Viral genome copy numbers were determined and results classified as Negative; Low: &#8804;999 copies; Medium: 1000-99,999 copies and High &#8805; 100,000 copies per strip for FMS or per 100â¯µl for NPS. RESULTS: 102 FMS and NPS were collected from 66 routinely positive patients; median age: 61 (IQR 49 - 77), of which FMS was positive in 38% of individuals and concomitant NPS was positive in 50%. Positive FMS viral loads varied over five orders of magnitude (<10-3.3 x 106 genome copies/strip); 21 (32%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. High FMS viral load was associated with respiratory symptoms at time of sampling and shorter interval between sampling and symptom onset (FMS High: median (IQR) 2 days (2-3) vs FMS Negative: 7 days (7-10), pâ¯=â¯0.002). On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher FMS viral loads were associated with higher ISARIC mortality (Medium FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 15.7, 95% CI 3.7-27.7, pâ¯=â¯0.01) and deterioration scores (High FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 37.6, 95% CI 14.0 to 61.3, pâ¯=â¯0.002), while NPS viral loads showed no significant association. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a simple and effective method for detecting and quantifying exhaled SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Higher FMS viral loads were more likely to be associated with developing severe disease compared to NPS viral loads. Similar to NPS, FMS viral load was highest in early disease and in those with active respiratory symptoms, highlighting the potential role of FMS in understanding infectivity.","Williams, Caroline M; Pan, Daniel; Decker, Jonathan; Wisniewska, Anika; Fletcher, Eve; Sze, Shirley; Assadi, Sara; Haigh, Richard; Abdulwhhab, Mohamad; Bird, Paul; Holmes, Christopher W; Al-Taie, Alaa; Saleem, Baber; Pan, Jingzhe; Garton, Natalie J; Pareek, Manish; Barer, Michael R",J Infect,,176
438564,COVID-19 Pandemic in India: What Lies Ahead-Letter to the Editor,2020,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), a lethal respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in the end of 2019 and has since spread aggressively across the globe. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular infection by coronaviruses is therefore of utmost importance. A critical stage in infection is the fusion between viral and host membranes. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the role of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, and the influence of calcium and cholesterol, in this fusion process. Structural information from specular neutron reflectometry and small angle neutron scattering, complemented by dynamics information from quasi-elastic and spin-echo neutron spectroscopy, revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the Spike fusion domain. Calcium drives the N-terminal of the Spike fusion domain to fully cross the host plasma membrane. Removing calcium however re-orients the protein to the lipid leaflet in contact with the virus, leading to significant changes in lipid fluidity and rigidity. In conjunction with other regions of the fusion domain which are also positioned to bridge and dehydrate viral and host membranes, the molecular events leading to cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 are proposed. SIGNIFICANCEWe have recreated here important elements of the critical membrane fusion mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by simplifying the system down to its core elements, amenable to experimental analysis by neutron scattering. Neutrons are well suited for the study of protein - membrane interactions under physiological conditions, since they allow structural and dynamics characterization at room temperature. Our results revealed strikingly different functions encoded in the viral Spike fusion domain and thereby provide a potential calcium-dependent cell entry mechanism for SARS-CoV-2. In particular, calcium drives the proteins N-terminal to harpoon through the host membrane, while removing calcium re-orients the protein so that it is able to bridge and dehydrate lipid membranes, facilitating their fusion.","Santamaria, Andreas; Batchu, Krishna Chaithanya; Matsarskaia, Olga; Prevost, Sylvain F; Russo, Daniela; Natali, Francesca; Seydel, Tilo; Hoffmann, Ingo; Laux, Valerie; Haertlein, Michael; Darwish, Tamim A; Russell, Robert A; Corucci, Giacomo; Fragneto, Giovanna; Maestro, Armando; Zaccai, Nathan Richard",,,176

438878,Reflections on the Collaborative Fight Against COVID-19,2020,"Ten years ago we presented a modified version of Okun law for the biggest developed economies and reported its excellent predictive power. In this study, we revisit the original models using the estimates of real GDP per capita and unemployment rate between 2010 and 2019. The initial results show that the change in unemployment rate can be accurately predicted by variations in the rate of real economic growth. There is a discrete version of the model which is represented by a piece wise linear dependence of the annual increment in unemployment rate on the annual rate of change in real GDP per capita. The lengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP measurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and GDP deflator (dGDP). The difference between the CPI and dGDP indices since the beginning of measurements reveals the years of such breaks. Statistically, the link between the studied variables in the revised models is characterized by the coefficient of determination in the range from R2=0.866 (Australia) to R2=0.977 (France). The residual errors can be likely associated with the measurement errors, e.g. the estimates of real GDP per capita from various sources differ by tens of percent. The obtained results confirm the original finding on the absence of structural unemployment in the studied developed countries.","Kitov, Ivan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04595v1.pdf,176

439520,Pyoderma Gangrenosum with an Underlying Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency Type 1 (LAD-1) and Pregnancy in the Shade of COVID-19 Epidemic: A Patient and Physician Experience,2021,"Rationale: SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with increased risk for thrombotic disease and respiratory failure. Therapeutic or intermediate dose anticoagulation has been associated with decreased thrombotic events and potentially improved hospital outcomes. It is not known whether this potential benefit of anticoagulation is unique to SARS-CoV-2, or if this is shared with other respiratory viruses. Our study compared chronic therapeutic anticoagulation use to non-chronic anticoagulation in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. Methods: This was a retrospective single center study with IRB approval. Patients were included if they were &gt;18 years old and admitted to the University of Rochester Medical Center or affiliate with either a SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza (A/B) positive test between September 1 2019 and September 1 2020. Patients were identified using medical records and manually validated for accuracy. Chronic therapeutic anticoagulation was defined as anticoagulation &gt;30 days prior to infection diagnosis. Baseline characteristics, reason for hospitalization, laboratory, degree of hypoxia, ICU admission, ICU management strategies, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, in hospital, and 90 day mortality were collected. Parametric and non-parametric t-test were used. Results:A total of 495 patients were admitted with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR with 65 patients (13.1%) on chronic therapeutic anticoagulation. During hospitalization, 60 patients continued full dose anticoagulation and five received enhanced prophylaxis. 103 of the non-chronically anticoagulated received enhanced prophylaxis and the remaining received standard dosing. 429 patients were admitted with a positive influenza PCR with 56 (13.1%) on chronic therapeutic anticoagulation. Chronically anticoagulated patients in the SARS-CoV-2 and influenza group were significantly older, 75 (67,84) vs 65 (50, 76) and 73 (60,78) vs 60 (40, 71) respectively. Despite being older, there was no difference in inflammatory markers, respiratory failure, intubation, ICU admission, shock, or acute renal failure requiring renal replacement (Table 1). Chronically anticoagulated SARS-CoV-2 patients had 1 venous thrombotic event while the non-chronically anticoagulated patients, including enhanced prophylaxis, had 27 events (Table 1). Conclusion We found that chronic therapeutic anticoagulation may decrease severity of illness in both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection. In both groups the chronically anticoagulated patients were significantly older with increased comorbidities and despite that they did not have more significant disease. Our hospital system was not overwhelmed during this time and a significant number of COVID deaths were patients who opted for limited interventions. Further studies are warranted on the impact of anticoagulation with respiratory viruses.

439625,Incidence of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Women with COVID-19,2021,"This article aims to identify the methods used to assess household food availability in studies on food and nutritional security and to discuss its methodological aspects. Systematic review elaborated according to the PRISMA method. We searched at PubMed; Scielo and Lilacs databases, and studies that used methods of assessing the availability of food at home were included. In the end, 19 papers composed the review. Food availability was predominantly assessed for a seven days period and from a single data measurement. Other variables were also observed in the studies, such as socio-demographic data and expenditure on food. Among the limitations to assess the food availability at home, we can highlight the difficulty in measuring the food distribution among family members and the lack of information on the variability of this availability. Such assessment can be improved by investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the instruments for greater detail and accuracy of the information. We recommend the development and validation of specific instruments capable of effectively measure the food availability at the household level.","Schott, Eloise; Rezende, Fabiane Aparecida Canaan; Priore, Silvia Eloiza; Ribeiro, Andréia Queiroz; Franceschini, Sylvia do Carmo Castro",Cien Saude Colet,,176

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 infection is transmitted predominately by respiratory droplets generated when people breathe, talk, cough, or sneeze. Wearing a mask is the primary, effective, and convenient method of blocking 80% of all respiratory infections. Therefore, many face mask detection and monitoring systems have been developed to provide effective supervision for hospitals, airports, publication transportation, sports venues, and retail locations. However, the current commercial face mask detection systems are typically bundled with specific software or hardware, impeding public accessibility. In this paper, we propose an in-browser serverless edge-computing based face mask detection solution, called Web-based efficient AI recognition of masks (WearMask), which can be deployed on any common devices (e.g., cell phones, tablets, computers) that have internet connections using web browsers, without installing any software. The serverless edge-computing design minimizes the extra hardware costs (e.g., specific devices or cloud computing servers). The contribution of the proposed method is to provide a holistic edge-computing framework of integrating (1) deep learning models (YOLO), (2) high-performance neural network inference computing framework (NCNN), and (3) a stack-based virtual machine (WebAssembly). For end-users, our web-based solution has advantages of (1) serverless edge-computing design with minimal device limitation and privacy risk, (2) installation free deployment, (3) low computing requirements, and (4) high detection speed.

We aimed to analyze the characteristics and severity of patients with myocardial damage in NCIP. Methods: We enrolled 215 adult patients with NCIP from January 2020 to February 2020. Outcomes were followed up until March 1st, 2020. Results: 28.37% of the total patients showed increased level of TnI (> 0.040â¯ng/ml). Patients were older and had more cardiovascular complications in increased TnI group. Higher CRP, NT-proBNP, lower immune CD3, CD4 and CD8 cell account and more involved lobes detected by CT scan in the lung were observed in increased TnI group. Patients with elevated TnI had higher CURB-65 scores and were more likely given glucocorticoid therapy and mechanical ventilation than patients in normal TnI group. Conclusions: Markers of cardiomyocyte injury were elevated not least in elderly males with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Patients with elevated TnI presented more severe situation, leading to multiple organ dysfunctions, which appeared as a pivotal feature of patients with NCIP that requires attention by clinicians in order to provide necessary treatment as soon as possible and improve patients' outcomes.","Liu, Dong; Yang, Qingyuan; Chen, Wei; Chen, Hong; Feng, Yun; Hu, Weiping; Xie, Yusang; Lin, Huihuang; Yan, Jiayang; Qu, Jieming",Clin Infect Pract,,176

While numerous seroprevalence reports have been published by blood operators during the COVID-19 pandemic, details on the assay used has not been well documented. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diversity of assays being used by blood operators and assess how this may affect seroprevalence estimates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed 49 blood component providers from 39 countries. Questionnaire included information on the number and identity of assays used, the detected immunoglobulin(s) and target antigen, and performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: Thirty-eight of the 49 contacted blood suppliers provided at least partial responses. The results indicate that 19 commercial and five in-house serology assays have been used by surveyed blood operators. The Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was the most commonly used kit and utilized by 15 blood suppliers. Two assays did not detect IgG, but detected either IgM/IgA or IgM. 68·2% of assays targeted the spike protein and 50% the nucleocapsid protein, while 18·2% targeted both viral proteins. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG-specific assays ranged from 71·9% to 100% and from 96·2% to 100%, respectively. As of 18 October 2020, the seroprevalence was below 5% in 10 of 14 countries reporting. CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the diversity of assays being used. Analyses comparing blood donor seroprevalence across countries should consider assay characteristics with optimization of signal/cut-off ratios and consistent methodology to adjust for waning antibody.","Lewin, Antoine; Drews, Steven J; Lieshout-Krikke, Ryanne; Erikstrup, Christian; Saeed, Sahar; Fady, Helen; Uzicanin, Samra; Custer, Brian; O039,; Brien, Sheila F",Vox sang,,176
444236,Surviving COVID-19 in Bergamo province: a post-acute outpatient re-evaluation,2021,"Background: Although the default mode network (DMN) is a core network essential for brain functioning, little is known about its developmental trajectory, particularly on factors associated with its coherence into a functional network. In light of adult studies indicating DMN's susceptibility to stress-related conditions, we examined links between variability on oxytocin-pathway genes and DMN connectivity in youth exposed to chronic war-related trauma Methods: Following a cohort of war-exposed children from early childhood, we imaged the brains of 74 preadolescents (age 11-13 years; 39 war-exposed) during rest using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A cumulative risk index on oxytocin-pathway genes was constructed by combining single nucleotide polymorphisms on five genes previously linked with social deficits and psychopathology; OXTR rs1042778, OXTR rs2254298, OXTRrs53576, CD38 rs3796863, and AVPR1A RS3. Avoidant response to trauma reminders in early childhood and anxiety disorders in late childhood were assessed as predictors of disruptions to DMN theta connectivity. Results: Higher vulnerability on oxytocin-pathway genes predicted greater disruptions to DMN theta connectivity. Avoidant symptoms in early childhood and generalized anxiety disorder in later childhood were related to impaired DMN connectivity. In combination, stress exposure, oxytocin-pathway genes, and stress-related symptoms explained 24.6% of the variance in DMN connectivity, highlighting the significant effect of stress on the maturing brain. Conclusions: Findings are the first to link the oxytocin system and maturation of the DMN, a core system sustaining autobiographical memories, alteration of intrinsic and extrinsic attention, mentalization, and sense of self.

Is there an answer?,2020,"Most invasive Brain Computer Interfaces (iBCIs) use spike and Local Field Potentials (LFPs) from the motor or parietal cortices to decode movement intentions. It has been debated whether harvesting signals from other brain areas that encode global cognitive variables, such as the allocation of attention and eye movement goals in a variety of spatial reference frames, may improve the outcome of iBCIs. Here, we explore the ability of LFP signals, sampled from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of macaque monkeys, to encode eye-movement intention during the pre-movement fixation period of a delayed saccade task. We use spectral dimensionality reduction to examine the spatiotemporal properties of the extracted non-rhythmic broadband activity and explore its usefulness in decoding saccade goals. The dynamics of the broadband signal in low spatial dimensions across the pre-movement fixation period uncovered saccade target separation; its discriminative potential was confirmed using support vector machine classifications. These findings reveal that broadband LFP from the LPFC can be used to decode intended saccade target location during pre-movement periods. We further provide a general workflow that can be implemented in iBCIs and it is relatively robust to the loss of spikes in individual electrodes.","Johnston, Renée; Doucet, Guillaume; Boulay, Chadwick; Miller, Kai; Martinez-Trujillo, Julio; Sachs, Adam",Int J Neural Syst,,176

Hence, 172 orfs of unknown function from the emerging viruses SARS-Coronavirus, MERS-Coronavirus, influenza, Ebola, Zika (ZIKV), Chikungunya and Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) were de novo synthesized, validated and tested in a functional screen of p53 signaling. This screen revealed novel mechanisms of p53 virus interactions and two viral proteins KSHV orf10 and ZIKV NS2A binding to p53. Originally identified as the target of small DNA tumor viruses, these experiments reinforce the notion that all viruses, including RNA viruses, interfere with p53 functions. These results validate this resource for analogous systems biology approaches to identify functional properties of uncharacterized viral proteins, long non-coding RNAs and micro RNAs.","Alzhanova, Dina; Corcoran, Kathleen; Bailey, Aubrey G; Long, Kristin; Taft-Benz, Sharon; Graham, Rachel L; Broussard, Grant S; Heise, Mark; Neumann, Gabriele; Halfmann, Peter; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Baric, Ralph S; Damania, Blossom; Dittmer, Dirk P",PLoS Pathog,,176

OBJECTIVE: To describe patients with COVID-19 who are undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and their rehabilitation outcomes. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of all inpatients from a rehabilitation hospital between March 1 and September 30, 2020. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation hospital. PATIENTS: Among all inpatients, inclusion criteria are: &#8805;18 years of age and admission and discharge within the study time frame. The initial search yielded 920 patients; 896 met the inclusion criteria. Subjects were stratified by COVID-19 status and rehabilitation impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS), discharge location, and functional ability in self-care and mobility (FA-SC, FA-Mob). One-sample t-tests were used to assess the difference of age, BMI, LOS, FA-SC, FA-Mob, and FA efficiency between COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients. RESULTS: COVID-19+ patients were younger (59.4 years vs 62.9 years; t[894] = -2.05, p = .04) with a higher mean BMI (32 vs 28; t[894] = 3.51, p < .01) than COVID-19- patients. COVID-19+ patients had equivalent or superior improvements in FA-SC and FA-Mob, functional change efficiency, and LOS relative to COVID-19- patients. When medically complex patients were compared, those with COVID-19 had greater FA-SC and FA-Mob efficiencies than COVID-19- patients. COVID-19+ patients had similar rates of return to the community. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 who meet the admission criteria for inpatient rehabilitation can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation similarly to their non-COVID-19 counterparts with similar rehabilitation-specific diagnoses.","Groah, Suzanne L; Pham, Cynthia T; Rounds, Amanda K; Semel, Jennifer J",PM &amp; R (Online),,176

Acute myocardial injury is common in this population and is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The focus of this review centers on the recent applications of multimodality imaging in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19-related cardiovascular conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: In addition to standard cardiac imaging techniques such as transthoracic echocardiography, other modalities including computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging have emerged as useful adjuncts in select patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with suspected ischemic and nonischemic myocardial injury. Data have also emerged suggesting lasting COVID-19 subclinical cardiac effects, which may have long-term prognostic implications. With the spectrum of COVID-19 cardiovascular manifestations observed thus far, it is important for clinicians to recognize the role, strengths, and limitations of multimodality imaging techniques in this patient population.","Goerlich, Erin; Minhas, Anum S; Mukherjee, Monica; Sheikh, Farooq H; Gilotra, Nisha A; Sharma, Garima; Michos, Erin D; Hays, Allison G",Curr Cardiol Rep,,176
448844,Reduction in new cardiac electronic device implantations in Catalonia during COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Studies to examine whether HIV predisposes to a higher incidence of COVID-19 or more severe disease are accumulating. Initial studies from New York City suggested more severe disease among people living with HIV (PLWH), but this was during a time when hospitals were over-capacity and health systems stretched. This report presents the incidence and outcomes among PLWH with COVID-19 in San Francisco over the first 6 months of the pandemic. METHODS: Community transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in San Francisco on March 5, 2020. This report examines the match of the San Francisco Department of Public Health COVID-19 testing database and the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV Surveillance case registry from March 24, 2020, to September 3, 2020. RESULTS: Among 4252 COVID-19 tests performed among PLWH, 4.5% (N = 193) were positive for COVID-19, compared with a 3.5% (N = 9626) positivity rate among the 272,555 people without HIV tested for COVID-19 (P < 0.001). The mean age of those infected with HIV/COVID-19 was 48 years (20-76), 38.9% White, 38.3% Latinx, 11.9% Black, and 91.2% were men. Only 54.6% of coinfected PLWH were housed, with the remainder marginally housed. The rate of severe illness with COVID-19 was not increased among PLWH. DISCUSSION: In San Francisco, susceptibility to COVID-19 was increased among PLWH over the first 6 months of the pandemic, although clinical outcomes were similar to those without HIV. Homelessness and higher rates of congregate living situations among PLWH likely accounted for this disparity. Special efforts to house patients with marginal housing during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Sachdev, Darpun; Mara, Elise; Hsu, Ling; Scheer, Susan; Rutherford, George; Enanoria, Wayne; Gandhi, Monica",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,176

449444,COVID-19 and the role of imaging: early experiences in Central Switzerland,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. RESULTS: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. CONCLUSIONS: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","El-Hage, W; Hingray, C; Lemogne, C; Yrondi, A; Brunault, P; Bienvenu, T; Etain, B; Paquet, C; Gohier, B; Bennabi, D; Birmes, P; Sauvaget, A; Fakra, E; Prieto, N; Bulteau, S; Vidailhet, P; Camus, V; Leboyer, M; Krebs, M-O; Aouizerate, B",Encephale,,176
449613,Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Response to COVID-19,2020,"RATIONALE: Health outcomes of people with COVID-19 range from no symptoms to severe illness and death. Asthma, a common chronic lung disease, has been considered likely to increase the severity of COVID-19, although data addressing this hypothesis have been scarce until very recently. OBJECTIVES: To review the epidemiologic literature related to asthma's potential role in COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Studies were identified through the PubMed and medRxiv databases using the search-terms ""asthma,"" ""SARS-Cov-2,"" and ""COVID-19,"" and by cross-referencing citations in identified studies that were available in print or online before December 22, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: Asthma prevalence data were obtained from studies of people with COVID-19 and regional health statistics. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 147 studies worldwide that allowed us to compare the prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19 by region, disease severity and mortality. The results of our analyses do not provide clear evidence of increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization or severity, due to asthma. CONCLUSIONS: These findings could provide some reassurance to people with asthma regarding its potential to increase their risk of severe morbidity from COVID-19.

In this paper, we present a novel framework to understand the different types of information support needed during a pandemic crisis. Adapting phases from the pandemic crisis management lifecycle, we propose five different overlapping phases of our proposed Pandemic Information Support Lifecycle (PISL): awareness information support, preventive care information support, active information support, confidence-building information support and evaluation information support. To validate the proposed PISL, we examine the evolution of new mobile apps during the current COVID-19 pandemic by developing a taxonomy for mobile app-based information support. The proposed lifecycle presents future phases of information support for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while identifying specific areas that need additional research and mobile-based information support development.","Kalgotra, Pankush Gupta Ashish Sharda Ramesh",Journal of Business Research,,176
449729,"Can a liveable city be a healthy city, now and into the future?",2020,"The COVID pandemic very quickly became the world's most serious social and economic problem. This paper's focus is on the spatial aspect of its spread, with the aims being to point to spatial conditioning underpinning development of the pandemic, and to identify and assess possible socio-economic features exerting an impact on that. Particular attention has been paid to the percentage of positive tests for the presence of the coronavirus, as well as mortality due to the disease it causes. The statistics used relate to 102 countries, with the research for each extending from the time first cases of COVID-19 were reported through to 18 November 2020. The focus of investigation has been the stochastic co-occurrence of both a morbidity index and a mortality index, with intentionally selected socio-economic variables. Results have then been summarized through the classification of countries in relation to the two indices. Highest values relate to Latin America. A significant co-occurrence of morbidity and mortality with GDP per capita has been identified, as values for the indices are found to be lower in wealthier countries. The basic conclusion is that the dependency of the pandemic on environmental and socio-economic conditioning became more complex and ambiguous, while also being displaced gradually as concrete political decisions came to be taken.","Banski, Jerzy; Mazur, Marcin; Kaminska, Wioletta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,176

Active testing of initial case's households enabled estimation of household prevalence. RESULTS: During March in New York State, outside of New York City, a total of 47â 326 persons tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, out of 141â 495 tests (33% test-positive), with the highest number of cases located in the metropolitan region counties. Among 229 initial cases diagnosed through 12 March, by 30 March 13% were hospitalized and 2% died. Testing conducted among 498 members of these case's households found prevalent infection among 57%, excluding first-reported cases 38%. In these homes, we found a significant age gradient in prevalence, from 23% among thoseâ <â 5 years to 68% among thoseâ &#8805;â 65 years (Pâ <â .0001). CONCLUSIONS: New York State faced a substantial and increasing COVID-19 outbreak during March 2020. The earliest cases had high levels of infection in their households and by the end of the month, the risks of hospitalization and death were high.","Rosenberg, Eli S; Dufort, Elizabeth M; Blog, Debra S; Hall, Eric W; Hoefer, Dina; Backenson, Bryon P; Muse, Alison T; Kirkwood, James N; St George, Kirsten; Holtgrave, David R; Hutton, Brad J; Zucker, Howard A",Clin Infect Dis,,176
450112,The Changing Acceptance of COVID-19 Vaccination in Different Epidemic Phases in China: A Longitudinal Study,2021,"Development of a chromatographic method in bioanalysis is a challenging and complex procedure with many pitfalls and often unexpected reversals that can require several months to accomplish. Even an experienced analytical team must contend many limitations mainly in connection with the strict requirements imposed on current clinical research. These restrictions typically persist throughout the whole development process, from clinical trial assignment, across optimization of extraction of biological materials and chromatographic separation, to validation and data interpretation. This paper describes questions and their possible answers raised during the pre-analytical phase such as use of modern sample preparation techniques in clinical methods, application of internal standards, as well as selection of stationary phases and detection techniques in the analytical phase. Validation problems and interpretation of results are demonstrated with three typical examples of characteristics to be considered, i.e. recovery, matrix effect, and limit of detection vs. lower limit of quantification.","Krcmová, Lenka Kujovská; Melichar, Bohuslav; Svec, Frantisek",Clin. chem. lab. med,,176

MethodsThe hospital costs of 2 IVIG vs. non-IVIG COVID-19 patient groups were compared. The first cohort was a case-control analysis of 10 non-ventilated moderately to severely hypoxic COVID-19 patients who received IVIG (Privigen) matched 1:2 with 20 control patients of similar age, body mass index (BMI), degree of hypoxemia, and co-morbidities. The second cohort consisted of patients enrolled in a previously published randomized open-label prospective study of 14 COVID-19 patients receiving standard of care (SOC) versus 13 patients who received SOC plus IVIG (Octagam 10%). ResultsAmong the first case control population, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $21,982 per IVIG-treated case versus $42,431 per case for matched non-IVIG receiving controls, representing a net cost reduction of $20,449 (48%) per case. For the second (randomized) group, mean total direct costs including IVIG for the treatment group was $28,268 per case versus $62,707 per case for untreated controls, representing a net cost reduction of $34,439 (55%) per case. 24% of the non-IVIG patients had hospital costs exceeded $80,000, as compared to none of the IVIG patient host (p=0.016, Fisher exact test). ConclusionWhen allocated to the appropriate patient type (moderate to severe illness without end-organ comorbidities and age <70 years), IVIG can significantly reduce hospital costs in COVID-19 care. More importantly, it may reduce the demand on scare critical care resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Poremba, Matthew; Dehner, Matthew; Perreiter, Alexandra; Semma, Ashley; Mills, Kimbery; Sakoulas, George",,,176
451916,"Guardians at the Gate: Early Adversity, Neurocognitive Development, and the Role of the Pediatrician in the Era of COVID-19",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread around the world with significant morbidity and mortality in a subset of patients including the elderly. The poorer outcomes are associated with 'cytokine storm-like' immune responses, otherwise referred to as 'hyperinflammation'. While most of the infected individuals show minimal or no symptoms and recover spontaneously, a small proportion of the patients exhibit severe symptoms characterized by extreme dyspnea and low tissue oxygen levels, with extensive damage to the lungs referred to as acute respiratory distress symptom (ARDS). The consensus is that the hyperinflammatory response of the host is akin to the cytokine storm observed during sepsis and is the major cause of death. Uncertainties remain on the factors that lead to hyperinflammatory response in some but not all individuals. Hyperinflammation is a common feature in different viral infections such as dengue where existing low-titer antibodies to the virus enhances the infection in immune cells through a process called antibody-dependent enhancement or ADE. ADE has been reported following vaccination or secondary infections with other corona, Ebola and dengue virus. Detailed analysis has shown that antibodies to any viral epitope can induce ADE when present in sub-optimal titers or is of low affinity. In this review we will discuss ADE in the context of dengue and coronavirus infections including Covid-19.","Cloutier, Maryse; Nandi, Madhuparna; Ihsan, Awais Ullah; Chamard, Hugues Allard; Ilangumaran, Subburaj; Ramanathan, Sheela",Cytokine,,176

452606,Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality in Patients with Cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporotic hip fracture is a common general health problem with a significant impact on human life because it debilitates the patients and largely decreases their quality of life. Early prevention of fractures has become essential in recent decades. This can be achieved by evaluating the related risk factors, as a reference for further intervention. This is especially useful for the vulnerable patient group with comorbidities. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a major complication of liver cirrhosis, may increase the rate of falls and weaken the bone. This study evaluated the correlation between hepatic encephalopathy and osteoporotic hip fracture in the aged population using a national database. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2012. We included people who were older than 50 years with hepatic encephalopathy or other common chronic illnesses. Patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy were matched at a ratio of 1:4 for age, sex, and index year. The incidence and hazard ratios of osteoporotic hip fracture between the both cohorts were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: The mean age of the enrolled patients was 66.5 years. The incidence ratio of osteoporotic hip fracture in the HE group was significantly higher than that in the non-HE group (68/2496 [2.7%] vs 98/9984 [0.98%]). Patients with HE were 2.15-times more likely to develop osteoporotic hip fractures than patients without HE in the whole group. The risk ratio was also significantly higher in female and older individuals. The results were also similar in the comorbidity subgroups of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, senile cataract, gastric ulcer, and depression. Alcohol-related illnesses seemed to not confound the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS: HE is significantly associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic hip fractures, and the significance is not affected by the comorbidities in people aged more than 50 years. The cumulative risk of fracture increases with age.","Yeh, Kuang-Ting; Yu, Tzai-Chiu; Lee, Ru-Ping; Wang, Jen-Hung; Liu, Kuan-Lin; Peng, Cheng-Huan; Chen, Hao-Wen; Chen, Ing-Ho; Hsu, Chung-Yi; Wu, Wen-Tien",BMC Musculoskelet Disord,,176

453482,Occupational exposure of pharmacy technicians and cleaning staff to cytotoxic drugs in Dutch hospitals,2020,"We argue that frequent sampling of the fraction of infected people (either by random testing or by analysis of sewage water), is central to managing the COVID-19 pandemic because it both measures in real time the key variable controlled by restrictive measures, and anticipates the load on the healthcare system due to progression of the disease. Knowledge of random testing outcomes will (i) significantly improve the predictability of the pandemic, (ii) allow informed and optimized decisions on how to modify restrictive measures, with much shorter delay times than the present ones, and (iii) enable the real-time assessment of the efficiency of new means to reduce transmission rates. Here we suggest, irrespective of the size of a suitably homogeneous population, a conservative estimate of 15000 for the number of randomly tested people per day which will suffice to obtain reliable data about the current fraction of infections and its evolution in time, thus enabling close to real-time assessment of the quantitative effect of restrictive measures. Still higher testing capacity permits detection of geographical differences in spreading rates. Furthermore and most importantly, with daily sampling in place, a reboot could be attempted while the fraction of infected people is still an order of magnitude higher than the level required for a relaxation of restrictions with testing focused on symptomatic individuals. This is demonstrated by considering a feedback and control model of mitigation where the feed-back is derived from noisy sampling data.","Muller, Markus; Derlet, Peter M.; Mudry, Christopher; Aeppli, Gabriel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04614v2.pdf,176

Our objectives were: i) to assess malnutrition in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ii) to investigate the links between malnutrition and disease severity at admission, iii) to study the impact of malnutrition on clinical outcomes such as transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) or death. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized in a medicine ward at a university hospital were included from March 21st to April 24th 2020 (n = 114, 60.5% males, age: 59.9 ± 15.9 years). Nutritional status was defined using Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Clinical, radiological and biological characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to the presence of malnutrition. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between nutritional parameters and unfavourable outcomes such as transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 42.1% (moderate: 23.7%, severe: 18.4%). The prevalence of malnutrition reached 66.7% in patients admitted from ICU. No significant association was found between nutritional status and clinical signs of COVID-19. Lower albumin levels were associated with a higher risk of transfer to ICU (for 10 g/l of albumin, OR [95%CI]: 0.31 [0.1; 0.7]; p < 0.01) and this association was independent of age and CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in medical units dedicated to non-intensive care is associated with a high prevalence of malnutrition, especially for patients transferred from ICU.

With shipping being responsible for 80% of global trade, the article addresses issues relating to the response of the maritime industry, governments and international organizations to the pandemic. It also addresses the impact of the pandemic on the world’s almost 2 million seafarers who as key workers enable global trade. The article examines the serious challenges seafarers have faced relating to quarantine requirements, restrictions on border crossings with border closures, repatriation and crew changeovers, abandonment, renewals of certificates and licencing of seafarers, resupply and ship surveys. The article includes the response of governments and that of United Nations agencies and in particular the World Health Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the International Labour Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization. The significant role played by the maritime industry in providing substantive guidance is commended. The article concludes that COVID-19 will continue to have a huge impact on the maritime industry and on world trade for the foreseeable future. The expectation is that the industry will hopefully emerge stronger and become more robust to enable world trade to be efficient and sustainable.

We intended to analyze whether these perceptions may differ between patients from waves 1 and 2 of the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study at two time periods (May to June, sample 1) and September to November 2020 (sample 2) with standardized questionnaires (i.e. WHO-5, MLQ, PCQ-12). RESULTS: Patients from sample 1 (n = 292) and sample 2 (n = 221) did not differ with respect to gender, age, partner or tumor status. Most are still ""irritated by statements about danger and course of the infection"" (58%) and are ""worrying to be infected and to have complicated course of disease"" (55%). Neither their well-being nor meaning in life nor fears and worries were significantly different. In sample 2 patients, Worrying reflections and loneliness scored significantly lower, while their Perception of nature and silence was lower in trend only; more intense relationships are still relevant. Moments of wondering awe and religious trust were perceived less often during wave 2. Particularly religious patients scored stronger for Perception of nature and silence and Worrying reflections and loneliness. CONCLUSION: Oncologists/psychologist have to know that patients' situation has not changed within the time of pandemic and that they still require information, close support and encouragement to rely on their resources to cope. Perceived changes are reflecting coping strategies that could be trained to increase patients' resilience during further pandemic waves.","Büssing, Arndt; Recchia, Daniela Rodrigues; Hübner, Jutta; Walter, Stefanie; Büntzel, Judith; Büntzel, Jens",J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,,176
457275,Possible radiologic renal signs of COVID-19,2020,"Sepsis is one of the most common causes of death in ICU and especially is a harmful and a life-threatened disease to pediatrics in the world. It has been demonstrated that IL-3 plays an essential role in the processing of sepsis and the inhibition of IL-3 may alleviate sepsis progress. In our previous study, we selected a novel CD123 aptamer successfully which could inhibit the interaction of CD123 and IL-3. The aim of this study is to explore the protection ability of the first thioaptamer SS30 against sepsis in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rat model. Serum IL-3 level of sepsis patients was assessed by ELISA. CLP rat model was applied in all experimental groups. CD123 thioaptamer SS30 and CD123 antibody were used to block the recognition between IL-3 and CD123. Body weight, temperature, blood gas, MAP, and serum cytokines of four grouped rats were assessed. Flow cytometry was utilized to evaluate JAK2 and STAT5 proteins. After the administration of SS30 or CD123 antibody, the rats in SS30 and CD123 antibody group had lower cytokines values(lactate, TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, and IL-6), whereas exhibited higher value of core temperature, MAP, PO2/FiO2, and ETCO2 than those in the CLP group. The expression level of phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT5 was declined and the survival rate of rats was increased. In addition, the protection ability of SS30 was better than CD123 antibody. Therefore, CD123 thioaptamer SS30 could reduce mortality by down-regulating the phosphorylated JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway, and reduce serum cytokines which involving in sepsis development in CLP rat model.","Zhao, Jiangang; Wang, Meng; Yang, Ying; Wang, Guoxia; Che, Fengyu; Li, Qiao; Zhang, Liyu",Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,,176

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-85% of lung cancer cases. microRNAs (miRs) serve multiple roles in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. The current study investigated the lower level of miR-200a in tumor tissues compared with healthy tissue. Overexpression of miR-200a inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis. miR-200a was identified to target Rhophilin Rho GTPase binding protein 2 (RHPN2) and higher levels of RHPN2 were observed in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The current study proposes that miR-200a exhibits a tumor suppressive role in NSCLC and suggests that miR-200a could target RHPN2.,"Huang, Yan; Bao, Ting; Li, Zhenzhen; Ji, Guiyi; Zhang, Li",Oncol Lett,,176

The aim of this study was to assess four commercial serological tests from EUROIMMUN, DiaSorin, Abbott, and Roche as well as an in-house immunofluorescence and neutralization test for their capability to identify SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals in a high-prevalence setting. Therefore, 42 social and working contacts of a German super-spreader were tested. Consistent with a high-prevalence setting, 26 of 42 were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive by neutralization test (NT), and immunofluorescence test (IFT) confirmed 23 of these 26 positive test results (NT 61.9% and IFT 54.8% seroprevalence). Four commercial assays detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 33.3-40.5% individuals. Besides an overall discrepancy between the NT and the commercial assays regarding their sensitivity, this study revealed that commercial SARS-CoV-2 spike-based assays are better to predict the neutralization titer than nucleoprotein-based assays are.","Müller, Lisa; Ostermann, Philipp Niklas; Walker, Andreas; Wienemann, Tobias; Mertens, Alexander; Adams, Ortwin; Andree, Marcel; Hauka, Sandra; Lübke, Nadine; Keitel, Verena; Drexler, Ingo; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Hermsen, Derik Franz; Kaiser, Rolf; Boege, Friedrich; Klein, Florian; Schaal, Heiner; Timm, Jörg; Senff, Tina",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,176

A series of chi-square analyses, a t-test, a logistic regression model, and a multiple linear regression model were employed. Four key findings emerged: (1) most cases converted to teletherapy; (2) Hispanic ethnicity was the only demographic characteristic to significantly predict conversion to teletherapy; (3) individual cases were significantly more likely to convert to teletherapy than relational cases; and (4) the number of prior in-person sessions attended significantly predicted conversion to teletherapy. Teletherapy conversion implications are discussed across four systemic levels: client, student trainee, supervision, and larger systems.","Morgan, Amy A; Landers, Ashley L; Simpson, Jessica E; Russon, Jody M; Case Pease, Jenene; Dolbin-MacNab, Megan L; Bland, Krista N; Jackson, Jeffrey B",J Marital Fam Ther,,176
458833,Second COVID-19 Surge: Challenges and Handling,2021,"Respiratory pathogens, such as novel influenza A viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are of particular concern because of their high transmissibility and history of global spread (1). Clusters of severe respiratory disease are challenging to investigate, especially in resource-limited settings, and disease etiology often is not well understood. In 2014, endorsed by the Group of Seven (G7),* the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) was established to help build country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. GHSA is a multinational, multisectoral collaboration to support countries towards full implementation of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations (IHR).§ Initially, 11 technical areas for collaborator participation were identified to meet GHSA goals. CDC developed the Detection and Response to Respiratory Events (DaRRE) strategy in 2014 to enhance country capacity to identify and control respiratory disease outbreaks. DaRRE initiatives support the four of 11 GHSA technical areas that CDC focuses on: surveillance, laboratory capacity, emergency operations, and workforce development.¶ In 2016, Kenya was selected to pilot DaRRE because of its existing respiratory disease surveillance and laboratory platforms and well-developed Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP) (2). During 2016-2020, Kenya's DaRRE partners (CDC, the Kenya Ministry of Health [MoH], and Kenya's county public health officials) conceptualized, planned, and implemented key components of DaRRE. Activities were selected based on existing capacity and determined by the Kenya MoH and included 1) expansion of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance sites; 2) piloting of community event-based surveillance; 3) expansion of laboratory diagnostic capacity; 4) training of public health practitioners in detection, investigation, and response to respiratory threats; and 5) improvement of response capacity by the national emergency operations center (EOC). Progress on DaRRE activity implementation was assessed throughout the process. This pilot in Kenya demonstrated that DaRRE can support IHR requirements and can capitalize on a country's existing resources by tailoring tools to improve public health preparedness based on countries' needs.","Idubor, Osatohamwen I; Kobayashi, Miwako; Ndegwa, Linus; Okeyo, Mary; Galgalo, Tura; Kalani, Rosalia; Githii, Susan; Hunsperger, Elizabeth; Balajee, Arunmozhi; Verani, Jennifer R; da Gloria Carvalho, Maria; Winchell, Jonas; Van Beneden, Chris A; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Makayotto, Lyndah; Chaves, Sandra S",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,176

459473,COVID-19 in a Patient Presenting with Syncope and a Normal Chest X-ray,2020,"PURPOSE: Many adult orthodontic patients suffer from periodontitis, which is caused by oral pathogens such as the gram-negative Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Agac). Like orthodontic tooth movement, periodontitis is associated with inflammation and alveolar bone remodelling thereby affecting orthodontic treatment. Interactions of both processes, however, are not sufficiently explored, particularly with regard to oxidative stress. METHODS: After preincubation with Agac lysate for 24 h periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF) were either stretched or compressed for further 48 h simulating orthodontic forces in vitro. We analysed the expression of genes and proteins involved in the formation of reactive oxygen species (NOX-4, ROS) and nitric oxide (NOS-2), inflammation (TNF, IL-6, PTGS-2) and bone remodelling (OPG, RANKL). RESULTS: Agac lysate elevated the expression of NOX-4, NOS-2, inflammatory IL-6 and PTGS-2 and the bone-remodelling RANKL/OPG ratio during compressive, but not tensile mechanical strain. Agac lysate stimulated pressure-induced inflammatory signalling, whereas surprisingly ROS formation was reduced. Pressure-induced downregulation of OPG expression was inhibited by Agac lysate. CONCLUSIONS: Agac lysate impact on the expression of genes and proteins involved in inflammation and bone remodelling as well as ROS formation, when PDLF were subjected to mechanical forces occurring during orthodontic tooth movement.","Schröder, Agnes; Stumpf, Julia; Paddenberg, Eva; Neubert, Patrick; Schatz, Valentin; Köstler, Josef; Jantsch, Jonathan; Deschner, James; Proff, Peter; Kirschneck, Christian",BMC Oral Health,,176

RESULTS: The Task Force made consensus suggestions to treat patients with acute COVID-19 pneumonia with remdesivir and dexamethasone but suggested against hydroxychloroquine except in the context of a clinical trial; these are revisions of prior suggestions resulting from the interim publication of several randomised trials. It also suggested that COVID-19 patients with a venous thromboembolic event be treated with therapeutic anticoagulant therapy for 3â months.

Nevertheless, the strong perception in the research and clinical application environment is that AI in radiology is like a hammer in search of a nail. Notable developments and opportunities do not seem to be combined, now, in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a stable, effective, and concrete use in clinical routine; the use of AI often seems limited to use in research applications. This study considers the future perceived integration of AI with digital radiology after the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes a methodology that, by means of a wide interaction of the involved actors, allows a positioning exercise for acceptance evaluation using a general purpose electronic survey. The methodology was tested on a first category of professionals, the medical radiology technicians (MRT), and allowed to (i) collect their impressions on the issue in a structured way, and (ii) collect their suggestions and their comments in order to create a specific tool for this professional figure to be used in scientific societies. This study is useful for the stakeholders in the field, and yielded several noteworthy observations, among them (iii) the perception of great development in thoracic radiography and CT, but a loss of opportunity in integration with non-radiological technologies; (iv) the belief that it is appropriate to invest in training and infrastructure dedicated to AI; and (v) the widespread idea that AI can become a strong complementary tool to human activity. From a general point of view, the study is a clear invitation to face the last yard of AI in digital radiology, a last yard that depends a lot on the opinion and the ability to accept these technologies by the operators of digital radiology.","Giansanti, Daniele; Rossi, Ivano; Monoscalco, Lisa",,,176

As an indirect marker of thrombin and plasmin activation, D-dimer has been suggested to guide anticoagulant treat in COVID-19 patients [2, 3]. However, D-dimer may not be able to reflect accurate fibrinolysis status of COVID-19 patients, and therefore can't guide the possible antifibrinolysis or thrombolytic therapy in different stages of COVID-19, as Professor Robert L.

Hence, we speculated that measuring direct markers of thrombin, plasmin and so on, may provide more therapeutic targets in COVID-19 patients with coagulopathy.","Tang, Ning; Bai, Huan; Xiong, Dongsheng; Sun, Ziyong",J. thromb. haemost,,176

Some of these same groups (older people, BAME communities, those with some non-communicable diseases (NCDs)) may be particularly vulnerable to risk of exposure and severe COVID-19 outcomes due to co-morbidities, structural vulnerabilities, and public-facing or health and social care jobs among other factors. Additionally, some of the restrictions designed to reduce SARS-CoV-2 spread impact specifically on these same groups by limiting their activity and access to preventive or health promotion services. Greenspaces, accessed with social distancing, may mitigate some of the predicted negative health effects of COVID-19 restrictions. Maintaining or increasing publicly accessible urban greenspaces, particularly for marginalised groups, is reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals, and its importance amplified in the COVID-19 pandemic. Urban greenspaces should be considered a public health and social investment and a chance to rebalance our relationship with nature to protect against future pandemics. By investing in urban public greenspaces, additional benefits (job/food creation, biodiversity promotion, carbon sequestration) may coincide with health benefits. Realising these requires a shift in the balance of decision making to place weight on protecting, enhancing and providing more appropriate greenspaces designed with local communities. The current pandemic is a reminder that humanity placing too many pressures on nature has damaging consequences.

We evaluated bevacizumab with a widely used carboplatin-paclitaxel backbone. METHODS: Patients with metastatic/recurrent/persistent cervical cancer not amenable to curative surgery and/or radiotherapy received 3-weekly bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, and carboplatin AUC 5 until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Maintenance bevacizumab was allowed. Patients with ongoing bladder/rectal involvement, prior cobalt radiotherapy, a history of fistula/gastrointestinal perforation, or recent bowel resection/chemoradiation were excluded. The primary objective was to determine incidences of gastrointestinal perforation/fistula, gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula, and genitourinary fistula. RESULTS: Among 150 treated patients, disease at study entry was persistent in 21%, recurrent in 56%, and newly diagnosed metastatic in 23%. After 27.8 months' median follow-up, median bevacizumab duration was 6.7 months; 57% received maintenance bevacizumab. Seventeen patients (11.3%; 95% CI: 6.7-17.5%) experienced &#8805;1 perforation/fistula event: gastrointestinal perforation/fistula in 4.7% (1.9-9.4%), gastrointestinal-vaginal fistula in 4.0% (1.5-8.5%), and genitourinary fistula in 4.7% (1.9-9.4%). Of these, 16 were previously irradiated, several with ongoing radiation effects. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (25%), anemia (19%), and hypertension (14%). Five patients (3%) had fatal adverse events. Objective response rate was 61% (95% CI: 52-69%), median progression-free survival was 10.9 (10.1-13.7) months, and median overall survival was 25.0 (20.9-30.4) months. CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab can be combined with carboplatin-paclitaxel in the CECILIA study population. The fistula/gastrointestinal perforation incidence is in line with GOG-0240; efficacy results are encouraging.

461229,European Surgical Association (ESA) During the COVID-19 Time,2020,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, COVID-19 appeared as a unique disease with unconventional tissue and systemic immune features. Here we show a COVID-19 immune signature associated with severity by integrating single-cell RNA-seq analysis from blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. This signature is characterized by lung accumulation of naïve lymphoid cells associated with a systemic expansion and activation of myeloid cells. Myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution, highlighting arginase-1 expression with immune regulatory features of monocytes. Monocyte-dependent and neutrophil-dependent immune suppression loss is associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe patients. Additionally, our analysis shows a lung CXCR6+ effector memory T cell subset is associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19-induced myeloid dysregulation and lymphoid impairment establish a condition of 'immune silence' in patients with critical COVID-19.","Bost, Pierre; De Sanctis, Francesco; Canè, Stefania; Ugel, Stefano; Donadello, Katia; Castellucci, Monica; Eyal, David; Fiore, Alessandra; Anselmi, Cristina; Barouni, Roza Maria; Trovato, Rosalinda; Caligola, Simone; Lamolinara, Alessia; Iezzi, Manuela; Facciotti, Federica; Mazzariol, Annarita; Gibellini, Davide; De Nardo, Pasquale; Tacconelli, Evelina; Gottin, Leonardo; Polati, Enrico; Schwikowski, Benno; Amit, Ido; Bronte, Vincenzo",Nat Commun,,176

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The meta-analysis was used to study the literatures on the psychology of pregnant women in four databases until Sep 27, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 19 articles were included in the final meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of anxiety was 42 % (95 %CI 26 %-57 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2â¯=â¯99.6 %). The overall prevalence of depression was 25 % (95 %CI 20 %-31 %) with substantial heterogeneity (I2â¯=â¯97.9 %). Age, family economic status, social support, and physical activity seem to correlate with the mental health status of pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women increased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. Pregnant women are more concerned about others than themselves during COVID-19, and younger pregnant women seem to be more prone to anxiety, while social support and physical activity can reduce the likelihood of anxiety and depression. It is necessary to take some psychological intervention measures for pregnant women to help them go through this special period safely and smoothly.","Fan, Si; Guan, Jianping; Cao, Li; Wang, Manli; Zhao, Hua; Chen, Lili; Yan, Lei",Asian J Psychiatr,,176

The study was carried out as a case study of qualitative research methods. The study group comprised pre-service teachers receiving education in the faculty of education in a state university in Turkey during the spring term of the 2019-2020 academic year. In order to collect data, the researcher created an interview form. Then the form was applied to the pre-service teachers on a volunteer basis and online. The content analysis method was used in the data analysis. The data were coded by two researchers. Miles and Huberman's (1994) formula was used for a consensus between the coders. At the end of the study the problems experienced by the pre-service teachers were collected under the themes of implementation, student, impossibility, technical and instructor. The pre-service teachers stated that they mainly faced problems such as the lack of time spared for live courses regarding ""implementation"";failure of establishing communication with friends regarding ""student"";absence of internet regarding ""impossibility"", sound problems regarding ""technical"" and lack of communication regarding ""instructor"".

462701,The land of the Lotus-eaters in the COVID-19 epidemic,2021,"Ovarian cancer is a type of gynecological cancer with the highest mortality rate worldwide. Due to a lack of effective screening methods, most cases are diagnosed at later stages where the survival rates are poor. Thus, it is termed a 'silent killer' and is the most lethal of all the malignancies in women. IQ motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the oncogenic functions and mechanisms of IQGAP3 on the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Therefore, the expression levels of IQGAP3 in HGSOC and normal tissue samples were compared, and IQGAP3 knockdown was performed to examine its functional role using various in vitro and in vivo experiments. It was demonstrated that the expression of IQGAP3 was upregulated in HGSOC tissues compared with the healthy tissues; this differential expression was also observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional experimental results suggested that IQGAP3 silencing significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, in vivo experimental findings validated the in vitro results, where the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of IQGAP3-silenced cells were significantly lower in the nude mice compared with the mice implanted with the control cells. Furthermore, knockdown of IQGAP3 resulted in increased apoptosis, and the effects of IQGAP3 expression on various epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were identified, suggesting a possible mechanism associated with the role of IQGAP3 in metastasis. The effect of IQGAP3 silencing on chemosensitivity towards olaparib was also assessed. Collectively, the present results indicated that IQGAP3 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker, and a putative therapeutic target of HGSOC.","Dongol, Samina; Zhang, Qing; Qiu, Chunping; Sun, Chenggong; Zhang, Zhiwei; Wu, Huan; Kong, Beihua",Oncol Lett,,176

PURPOSE: Pharmacy departments across the country are problem-solving the growing issue of drug shortages. We aim to change the drug shortage management strategy from a reactive process to a more proactive approach using predictive data analytics. By doing so, we can drive our decision-making to more efficiently manage drug shortages. METHODS: Internal purchasing, formulary, and drug shortage data were reviewed to identify drugs subject to a high shortage risk (""shortage drugs"") or not subject to a high shortage risk (""nonshortage drugs""). Potential candidate predictors of drug shortage risk were collected from previous literature. The dataset was trained and tested using 2 methods, including k-fold cross-validation and a 70/30 partition into a training dataset and a testing dataset, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1,517 shortage and nonshortage drugs were included. The following candidate predictors were used to build the dataset: dosage form, therapeutic class, controlled substance schedule (Schedule II or Schedules III-V), orphan drug status, generic versus branded status, and number of manufacturers. Predictors that positively predicted shortages included classification of drugs as intravenous-only, both oral and intravenous, antimicrobials, analgesics, electrolytes, anesthetics, and cardiovascular agents. Predictors that negatively predicted a shortage included classification as an oral-only agent, branded-only agent, antipsychotic, Schedule II agent, or orphan drug, as well as the total number of manufacturers. The calculated sensitivity was 0.71; the specificity, 0.93; the accuracy, 0.87; and the C statistic, 0.93. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the use of predictive analytics to create a drug shortage model using drug characteristics and manufacturing variables.","Liu, Ina; Colmenares, Evan; Tak, Casey; Vest, Mary-Haston; Clark, Henry; Oertel, Maryann; Pappas, Ashley",Am. j. health system pharm,,176

Many studies published recently have shown that many cytokines (interleukin (IL) IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TNF and IFN-) are significantly increased in COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, and especially IL-6 in combination with other cytokines has shown to be the main cause of the cytokine storm. Since IL-6 level is associated with clinical worsening in COVID-19 patients, anti-IL-6 therapy is seen as a promising treatment. Tocilizumab, a widely used IL-6 antagonist, was approved by the FDA in 2017 for Cytokine Storm Syndrome (CSS).

For the evaluation of parenchymal heterogeneity, CT texture analysis was performed using dedicated software (Olea Medical, France). The texture analysis of each case consisted of 15 first-order intensity-based features, 17 gray level co-occurrence matrix-based features, and 9 gray level run length matrix-based features. RESULTS: A total of 91 patients (45 males, 46 females) with a mean age of 54.31±16.33 years (range: 18?81) were included in the study. A statistically significant decrease in spleen size was seen in the follow-up CT examinations (p < 0.001) whereas no statistically significant difference was found between the Hounsfield unit (HU) values. The radiomics consisted of first-order intensity-based features such as 90th percentile, maximum, interquartile range, range, mean absolute deviation, standard deviation, and variance, all of which showed statistically significant differences (p-values: < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.001, 0.003, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.004, respectively). ?Correlation? as a gray level co-occurrence matrix-based feature and ?gray level non-uniformity? as a gray level run length matrix-based feature showed statistically differences (p-values: 0.033 and < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although COVID-19 manifests with lung involvement in the early stage, it can also cause systemic involvement, and the spleen may be one of its target organs. A decrease in the spleen size and parenchymal microstructure changes can be observed in the short follow-up time. It is hoped that the changes in the parenchymal microstructure will be demonstrated by a non-invasive method: texture analysis.","Batur, Abdussamet; KilinÇer, AbIdIn; AteS, FatIh; AktuG DemIr, Nazlim; ErgÜn, RecaI",,,176
463796,A new framework to identify dental emergencies in the COVID-19 era,2020,"BACKGROUND: This study presents the methods and results of the investigation into a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a professional community. Due to the limited testing capacity available in France at the time, we elaborated a testing strategy according to pre-test probability. METHODS: The investigation design combined active case finding and contact tracing around each confirmed case with testing of at-risk contact persons who had any evocative symptoms (n = 88). One month later, we performed serology testing to test and screen symptomatic and asymptomatic cases again (n = 79). RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were confirmed (14 with RT-PCR and 10 with serology). The attack rate was 29% (24/83). Median age was 40 (24 to 59), and the sex ratio was 15/12. Only three cases were asymptomatic (= no symptoms at all, 13%, 95% CI, 3-32). Nineteen symptomatic cases (79%, 95% CI, 63-95) presented a respiratory infection, two of which were severe. All the RT-PCR confirmed cases acquired protective antibodies. Median incubation was 4 days (from 1 to 13 days), and the median serial interval was 3 days (0 to 15). We identified pre-symptomatic transmission in 40% of this cluster, but no transmission from asymptomatic to symptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: We report the effective use of targeted testing according to pre-test probability, specifically prioritizing symptomatic COVID-19 diagnosis and contact tracing. The asymptomatic rate raises questions about the real role of asymptomatic infected people in transmission. Conversely, pre-symptomatic contamination occurred frequently in this cluster, highlighting the need to identify, test, and quarantine asymptomatic at-risk contact persons (= contact tracing). The local lockdown imposed helped reduce transmission during the investigation period.","de Laval, Franck; Grosset-Janin, Anaïs; Delon, François; Allonneau, Alexandre; Tong, Christelle; Letois, Flavie; Couderc, Anne; Sanchez, Marc-Antoine; Destanque, César; Biot, Fabrice; Raynaud, Françoise; Bigaillon, Christine; Ferraris, Olivier; Simon-Loriere, Etienne; Enouf, Vincent; Andriamanantena, Dinaherisoa; de Santi, Vincent Pommier; Javelle, Emilie; Mérens, Audrey",BMC Infect Dis,,176

The intent of this document is to provide a balance of how much was ceased to be done for patients with aortic disease, to assess the mortality of these patients, and to show what happened to those who became COVID-19 positive during their hospitalization. METHODS: From April 1st to July 31st 2020, the worst period of the pandemic in São Paulo, Brazil, the Institute's aortic surgical patients operated on were evaluated and those were compared with patients operated during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: In 2019, 88 surgeries were performed; most of them were elective (66 [75%]), 10 were urgent, and 12 were emergency surgeries. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we operated on only 31 patients, being 74.2% non-elective surgeries (P<0,001). There was a higher mortality for patients operated on during the pandemic surge of COVID-19 (P<0,001), but it was not specifically related to infected patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on surgical volume and outcome of patients with aortic disease, although it did not directly increase mortality.","Dias, Ricardo R; Santiago, José Augusto Duncan; Madrini, Vagner; Mady, Charles; Jatene, Fabio B",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,,176
465438,Peritonsillar Phlegmon: An Addition to the Spectrum of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused a global public health crisis affecting most countries, including Ethiopia, in various ways. This study maps the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death from COVID-19 in Ethiopia. METHODS: Thirty-eight potential indicators of vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, case severity and likelihood of death, identified based on a literature review and the availability of nationally representative data at a low geographic scale, were assembled from multiple sources for geospatial analysis. Geospatial analysis techniques were applied to produce maps showing the vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death in Ethiopia at a spatial resolution of 1 km×1 km. RESULTS: This study showed that vulnerability to COVID-19 infection is likely to be high across most parts of Ethiopia, particularly in the Somali, Afar, Amhara, Oromia and Tigray regions. The number of severe cases of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalisation and intensive care unit admission is likely to be high across Amhara, most parts of Oromia and some parts of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region. The risk of COVID-19-related death is high in the country's border regions, where public health preparedness for responding to COVID-19 is limited. CONCLUSION: This study revealed geographical differences in vulnerability to infection, case severity and likelihood of death from COVID-19 in Ethiopia. The study offers maps that can guide the targeted interventions necessary to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Ethiopia.","Alene, Kefyalew Addis; Gelaw, Yalemzewod Assefa; Fetene, Dagnachew Muluye; Koye, Digsu N; Melaku, Yohannes Adama; Gesesew, Hailay; Birhanu, Mulugeta Molla; Adane, Akilew Awoke; Muluneh, Muluken Dessalegn; Dachew, Berihun Assefa; Abrha, Solomon; Aregay, Atsede; Ayele, Asnakew Achaw; Bezabhe, Woldesellassie M; Gebremariam, Kidane Tadesse; Gebremedhin, Tesfaye; Gebremedhin, Amanuel Tesfay; Gebremichael, Lemlem; Geleto, Ayele Bali; Kassahun, Habtamu Tilahun; Kibret, Getiye Dejenu; Leshargie, Cheru Tesema; Mekonnen, Alemayehu; Mirkuzie, Alemnesh H; Mohammed, Hassen; Tegegn, Henok Getachew; Tesema, Azeb Gebresilassie; Tesfay, Fisaha Haile; Wubishet, Befikadu Legesse; Kinfu, Yohannes",BMJ Open,,176

In the context of machine learning, previous studies have explored supervised algorithms to predict and support diagnosis based on several clinical parameters from patients diagnosed with and without COVID-19. However, in most of them the decision is based on a ""black-box"" method, making it impossible to discover the variable relevance in decision making. Hence, in this study, we introduce a non-supervised clustering analysis with neural network self-organizing maps (SOM) as a strategy of decision-making. We propose to identify potential variables in routine blood tests that can support clinician decision-making during COVID-19 diagnosis at hospital admission, facilitating rapid medical intervention. Based on SOM features (visual relationships between clusters and identification of patterns and behaviors), and using linear discriminant analysis , it was possible to detect a group of units of the map with a discrimination power around 83% to SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. In addition, we identified some variables in admission blood tests (Leukocytes, Basophils, Eosinophils, and Red cell Distribution Width) that, in combination had strong influence in the clustering performance, which could assist a possible clinical decision. Thus, although with limitations, we believe that SOM can be used as a soft-computing approach to support clinician decision-making in the context of COVID-19.","Souza, Alexandra A de; Almeida, Danilo Candido de; Barcelos, Thiago S; Bortoletto, Rodrigo Campos; Munoz, Roberto; Waldman, Helio; Goes, Miguel Angelo; Silva, Leandro A",Soft comput,,176

466888,Impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) is a common complication after esophagectomy which can cause severe pulmonary complications. However, bilateral RLNP has been rarely reported in esophagectomy patients. The objective of our study is to investigate the clinical significance of patients who had bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent esophagectomy at a single center from 1994 to 2018. Among these, patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 3217 patients were reviewed and 400 (12.4%) patients had RLNP, including 56 patients with bilateral RLNP identified by laryngoscopic examination. During the postoperative managements, 10 of the 56 patients (17.9%) required tracheostomy. Among them, two died of acute respiratory distress syndrome and the other eight patients were discharged after removing the tracheostomy tube. The median lengths of hospital and intensive care unit stay were 19.5 (range 8-157) and 2 (range 1-46) days, respectively. Forty-six patients (83.6%) were discharged with oral feeding after swallowing therapy including tongue holding maneuver and head tilt exercise. The other five patients (8.9%) were discharged with alternative enteral feeding via jejunostomy, but they were able to achieve oral diet 2-3 months after surgery. CONCLUSION: Bilateral RLNP following esophagectomy was rare, but it required great attention to prevent severe respiratory complications. However, only a few patients required tracheostomy and the majority achieved oral ingestion after intensive rehabilitation. Feeding education and respiratory rehabilitation are critical during the management of patients with bilateral RLNP.","Jeon, Yeong Jeong; Cho, Jong Ho; Lee, Hong Kyu; Kim, Hong Kwan; Choi, Yong Soo; Zo, Jae Ill; Shim, Young Mog",Thorac cancer (Online),,176
467248,Ophthalmology and COVID-19,2020,"Objective: The present study aimed at investigating the clinical risk factors for COVID-19 patients developing from moderate condition to severe condition, and providing reference for early intervention and prognosis. Methods: We collected the clinical data of 24 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were admitted to the isolation ward of the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College from January, 2020 to February 20, 2020, and evaluated the data of clinical characteristics, blood test results, inflammatory index, chest CT imaging characteristics, and antiviral treatment, comparing this with the clinical data of 41 patients with moderate condition in the same period. From this comparison we thus summarized the current knowledge of potential risk factors for COVID-19 patients developing from moderate to severe condition. Results: (1) Clinical characteristics: The moderate-to-severe group and the moderate group in terms of combined common underlying diseases and respiratory frequency showed significant difference statistically (t-value were 13.32, 6.17, respectively, P < 0.05), while no significant difference between the two groups in gender, age, or clinical symptoms was statistically observed(P > 0.05). (2) Analysis of blood test results: The lymphocyte count and plasma albumin of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly lower than those of the moderate group (t-values were 4.16, 4.11, respectively, P < 0.05), and the blood glucose and urea of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-value were 3.27, 4.19, respectively, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in terms of white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) (P > 0.05). (3) Comparison of inflammatory indicators: The level of IL-6 and CRP of the moderate-to-severe group were significantly higher than those of the moderate group (t-values were 2.84, 4.88, respectively, P < 0.05). (4) Imaging comparison: As for patients with moderate COVID-19, the imaging manifestations were the concurrence of ground-glass opacity, patchy shadow, and consolidation shadow in both lungs, diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lungs accompanied by air bronchogram, and large area consolidation of both lungs with pulmonary interstitial changes. The possibility for these patients to develop into severe condition increased, and the differences were statistically significant (t = 10.92, P < 0.05). (5) Clinical antiviral treatment: There was no statistically significant difference in the combination of two or three antiviral drugs between the two groups (&#967;2 = 0.05, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Current evidence suggested that the combination of common underlying diseases, respiratory frequency, lymphocyte count, blood glucose, albumin, urea level, inflammatory factors (CRP, IL-6), and imaging manifestations collectively contributed to the potential risk factors for the development of COVID-19 from moderate condition to severe condition. Particular attention should be paid to early detection and intervention during clinical work, which will be of vital significance to the ascent of the recovery rate as well as the reduction of mortality.","Li, Dianming; Liu, Chuanmiao; Liu, Jiahui; Hu, Junfeng; Yang, Yanli; Zhou, Yufu",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,,176

One of the main reasons is that there is a lack of suitable reporting standard to guide it. Low-quality reports impede the presentation of the guidelines' content even if the guidelines are well projected and developed, thereby hindering the user's integration and evaluation of guidelines and even misleading clinical decisions [1,2]. In response to this long-standing problem, the Reporting Items for practice Guidelines in HealThcare (RIGHT) Working Group has organized a group of TCM clinical experts, methodologists, and epidemiology, through a multi-staged development process, including systematic review, reporting quality evaluation and online Delphi expert consensus, developed the RIGHT Extension Statement for TCM (RIGHT-TCM). The RIGHT-TCM extends two sections of the RIGHT Statement, includes basic information and recommendations section. Seven strong recommendation sub-items were added on the basis of RIGHT Statement and formed the RIGHT-TCM finally. The group hopes that the RIGHT-TCM can assist TCM guideline developers in reporting guidelines, support journal editors and peer reviewers when considering TCM guideline reports, and help health care practitioners understand and implement a TCM guideline.

The disease has now become a global pandemic. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between COVID-19 and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. METHODS: We collected and analyzed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 by high-throughput sequencing or reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We reviewed electronic medical records of 405 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Third Hospital of Wuhan. RESULTS: Among the 405 confirmed patients, 210 had no GI symptoms, 195 had GI symptoms, and the first symptom of 155 patients was GI. The prevalence of vascular and digestive diseases in the group with GI symptoms was significantly higher than in the group without GI symptoms. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with fever, cough, dysphoria, chest tightness, poor appetite, chest pain, and pharyngeal pain was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. There was no significant difference in imaging between the 2 groups. In patients with GI symptoms, the proportion with increased procalcitonin (PCT) level and decreased lymphocyte count was significantly higher than in those without GI symptoms. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms had significantly more vascular and digestive system diseases and were more likely to have clinical manifestations of fever, cough, poor appetite, chest tightness, chest pain, insomnia, and pharyngeal pain. There were more patients with diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Patients with GI symptoms were more likely to have increased PCT and decreased lymphocyte count.","Zhan, Ting; Tang, Yalin; Han, Zheng; Zhu, Qingxi; Tan, Jie; Liu, Meng; Cai, Yisan; Huang, Min; Chen, Xiaoli; Cheng, Xueting; Deng, Junsheng; Huang, Xiaodong; Tian, Xia",Turk J Gastroenterol,,176

The SARS-Co-2 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. There have been about 6.5 million reported cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and about 350 000 reported deaths throughout the world within the last 6 months from the onset of the epidemic. The virus is primarily transmitted by inhalation or contact with infected droplets. The COVID-19 patient usually presents with fever, cough, sore throat and breathlessness. Currently, available data indicate that the majority of people with the disease have mild symptoms, while about 20% present with moderate-to-severe disease. About 5% of these may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction. To date, there is no recommended medical treatment, and supportive measures are a crucial part of management.

However, they are tested for certification using a variety of standardized test methods, creating challenges for the comparison of differently certified products. We have performed systematic experiments to quantify and understand the differences between standardized test methods for N95 respirators (NIOSH TEB-APR-STP-0059 under US 42 CFR 84), medical face masks (ASTM F2299/F2100), and COVID-19-related barrier face coverings (ASTM F3502-21). Our experiments demonstrate the role of face velocity, particle properties (mean size, size variability, electric charge, density, and shape), measurement techniques, and environmental preconditioning. The measured filtration efficiency was most sensitive to changes in face velocity and particle charge. Relative to the NIOSH method, users of the ASTM F2299/F2100 method have commonly used non-neutralized (highly charged) aerosols as well as smaller face velocities, each of which may result in approximately 10% higher measured filtration efficiencies. In the NIOSH method, environmental conditioning at elevated humidity increased filtration efficiency in some commercial samples while decreasing it in others, indicating that measurement should be performed both with and without conditioning. More generally, our results provide an experimental basis for the comparison of respirators certified under various international methods, including FFP2, KN95, P2, Korea 1st Class, and DS2.","Corbin, Joel C.; Smallwood, Greg J.; Leroux, Ian; Oliaee, Jalal Norooz; Liu, Fengshan; Sipkens, Timothy A.; Green, Richard G.; Murnaghan, Nathan F.; Koukoulas, Triantafillos; Lobo, Prem",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04059v2.pdf,176

We perform direct numerical simulations of the turbulent transport of potentially infectious aerosols in short conversations. It is shown that a two-way conversation significantly reduces the aerosol exposure compared to a relative monologue by one person and relative silence of the other. This is because the interaction of the jets ejected from the mouth of each speaker produce a""canceling""effect. Unequal conversation is shown to significantly increase the risk of infection to the person who talks less. Interestingly, a small height difference is worse for infection spread, due to reduced interference between the two speech jets, than two faces at the same level! For small axial separation, speech jets show large oscillations and reach the other person intermittently. We suggest a range of lateral separations between two people to minimize transmission risk. A realistic estimate of the infection probability is provided by including exposure through eyes and mouth, in addition to the more common method of using inhaled virions alone. We expect that our results will provide useful inputs to epidemiological models and to disease management.","Singhal, Rohit; Ravichandran, S.; Govindarajan, Rama; Diwan, Sourabh S.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16415v2.pdf,176

However, these changes, hinder them from performing COVID-19 diagnosis. We constructed a machine learning predictive model for COVID-19 diagnosis. The model was based and cross-validated on the routine blood tests of 5,333 patients with various bacterial and viral infections, and 160 COVID-19-positive patients. We selected operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool. All patients with a positive COVID-19 prediction would then undergo standard RT-PCR studies to confirm the diagnosis.

But the broader agri-food system also expands, and the scope for agriculture-related job creation shifts beyond the farm. Historically, technological revolutions have shaped, and have been shaped by, these dynamics. Today, a digital revolution is taking hold. In this process of structural transformation, societies evolve from having a surplus to a shortage of domestic farm labor, typically met by foreign agricultural wage workers. Yet anti-immigration sentiments are flying high in migrant-destination countries, and agricultural trade may be similarly challenged. Robots in the fields and packing plants offer an alternative to a diminishing labor supply. COVID-19 will reinforce trends of digitization and anti-globalization (including in food trade), while slowing economic growth and structural transformation. In the world's poorest countries, particularly in Africa, labor productivity in agriculture remains at historically low levels. So, what role can the agri-food system play as a source of employment in the future? This viewpoint elaborates on these trends and reviews several policy options, including inclusive value chain development, better immigration policies, social insurance schemes, and ramp up in agricultural education and extension.","Christiaensen, Luc; Rutledge, Zachariah; Taylor, J Edward",Food Policy,,176

474365,Role of combining anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents in COVID-19 treatment: a rapid review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since its emergence in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has disseminated across many other countries worldwide. In this report, we firstly presented a patient with mild COVID-19 disease who developed paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) due to CRAO. CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old male patient who reported a contact with a COVID-19 patient applied to the hospital and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polimerase chain reaction testing. He had no significant past medical history. Chest computed tomography was not notable. He had a mild COVID-19 course during hospitalization. Two weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis, he reported profund vision loss (counting fingers) in his right eye where central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) was detected on fundoscopic examination. Coagulation profile was within normal limits. Hypercoagulable work up was also not notable. Treatment was given for CRAO. Visual acuity was counting fingers at 30 cm. Five days following treatment. Optical coherence tomography analysis showed increased diffuse reflectance and thickening at the level of inner nuclear layer consistent with PAMM. Fluorescein angiography illustrated no perfusion defect. CONCLUSION: This is the first case that reports PAMM in the setting of CRAO following COVID-19 diagnosis. Viral induced microangiopathy may involve in the development of CRAO in our patient without a hypercoagulable state and additional risk factors. Physicians should be vigilant to seek for retinal evaluation in patients with significant visual loss even after a mild COVID-19 history.","Turedi, Neslihan; Onal Gunay, Betul",Eur J Ophthalmol,,176

475644,Expert consensus on rational drug use in clinical practice for COVID-19,2020,"AIMS: Inhaled nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) has a strong scientific and biological rationale that warrants urgent investigation of its therapeutic potential in patients with COVID-19. UFH has antiviral effects and prevents the SARS-CoV-2 virus' entry into mammalian cells. In addition, UFH has significant anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties, which limit progression of lung injury and vascular pulmonary thrombosis. METHODS: The INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP) metatrial is a prospective individual patient data analysis of on-going randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies are being conducted in multiple countries. Participating studies randomise adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who do not require immediate mechanical ventilation, to inhaled nebulised UFH or standard care. All studies collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the metatrial is intubation (or death, for patients who died before intubation) at day 28. The secondary outcomes are oxygenation, clinical worsening and mortality, assessed in time-to-event analyses. Individual studies may have additional outcomes. ANALYSIS: We use a Bayesian approach to monitoring, followed by analysing individual patient data, outcomes and adverse events. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, considering all participants in the treatment group to which they were assigned, except for cases lost to follow-up or withdrawn. TRIAL REGISTRATION, ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The metatrial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04635241. Each contributing study is individually registered and has received approval of the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. Results of this study will be shared with the World Health Organisation, published in scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.","van Haren, Frank M P; Richardson, Alice; Yoon, Hwan-Jin; Artigas, Antonio; Laffey, John G; Dixon, Barry; Smith, Roger; Vilaseca, Alicia B; Barbera, Ruben A; Ismail, Tarek I; Mahrous, Rabab S; Badr, Mohamed; De Nucci, Gilberto; Sverdloff, Carlos; van Loon, Lex M; Camprubi-Rimblas, Marta; Cosgrave, David W; Smoot, Thomas L; Staas, Sabrina; Sann, Khine; Sas, Caitlin; Belani, Anusha; Hillman, Christopher; Shute, Janis; Carroll, Mary; Wilkinson, Tom; Carroll, Miles; Singh, Dave; Page, Clive",,,176

The aim of our study was to compare the number of acute appendicitis cases and the proportion of complicated appendicitis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all data collected from a multi-center database of patients presenting to the emergency department for acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 12 to June 6, 2020, and compared these data with those from the same periods in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The number of acute appendicitis cases, proportion of complicated appendicitis, and pre- and postoperative patient characteristics were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were included in this evaluation. Sixty-five patients presented during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (group A), and 241 patients in previous years (group B: 2017-2019). The number of consultations for acute appendicitis decreased by almost 20 percent during the pandemic compared with previous periods, with a significant increase in complicated appendicitis (52% in group A versus 20% in group B, p < 0,001.). Comparing the two groups, significant differences were also noted in the duration of symptoms (symptoms > 48h in 61% and 26%, p < 0,001), the intervention time (77 vs 61 minutes, p = 0,002), length of hospital stay (hospitalization of > 2 days in 63% and 32%, p < 0.001) and duration of antibiotic treatment (antibiotics > 3 days in 36% and 24% p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decreased number of consultations for acute appendicitis, with a higher proportion of complicated appendicitis, most likely due to patient delay in consulting the emergency department at symptom onset. Patients and general practitioners should be aware of this problem to avoid a time delay from initial symptoms to consultation.","Burgard, Marie; Cherbanyk, Floryn; Nassiopoulos, Konstantinos; Malekzadeh, Sonaz; Pugin, François; Egger, Bernhard",PLoS One,,176

Esta puede conducir al síndrome distrés respiratorio agudo (SDRA). Frente a su sintomatología severa, la ventilación mecánica (VM), y sus valores de mecánica ventilatoria aparecen como una herramienta fundamental. Un complemento, para analizar el estado de avance de esta patología es la radiografía de tórax (RT), aunque en ocasiones esta depende de la experiencia del equipo de salud. Así el objetivo de esta investigación fue explorar la relación de las medidas de mecánica ventilatoria y radiográficas con el tiempo de conexión a VM en pacientes COVID-19. Estudio retrospectivo, que incluyó a 23 pacientes en VM. Se recolectó información de variables de mecánica ventilatoria; PEEP, presión plateau, presión de distensión y compliance estática. Desde la RT se midió, altura y ancho pulmonar, ángulo costodiafragmático y espacio intercostal. Los resultados indicaron que las variables de mecánica ventilatoria tales como el PEEP y el plateau se relacionaron significativamente con el tiempo de conexión a VM (r=0,449; p=0,035 y r=0,472; p=0,026), mientras que las variables radiográficas construidas en base al ángulo costodiafragmático y el espacio intercostal presentaron similares comportamientos (r= 0,462; p=0,046 y r=-0,543; p=0,009). En conclusión, la presión resultante de la programación del ventilador mecánico junto a cambios estructurales observados en la RT, se relacionan con el tiempo de conexión a VM.","Muñoz-Cofré, Rodrigo; Araneda-Madrid, Patricio; del Sol, Mariano; Álvarez-Pérez, Felipe; Pérez-Riquelme, Camilo; Escobar-Cabello, Máximo; Valenzuela-Vásquez, Jorge",Int. j. morphol,,176

Globally, the number of confirmed cases and mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have risen dramatically. Currently, there are no FDA-approved antiviral drugs and there is an urgency to develop treatment strategies that can effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storms, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sepsis. As symptoms progress in patients with SARS-CoV-2 sepsis, elevated amounts of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) are produced, which in turn induce multiple organ failure in these patients. Furthermore, plasma levels of DNase-1 are markedly reduced in SARS-CoV-2 sepsis patients. In this study, we generated recombinant DNase-1-coated polydopamine-poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticulates (named long-acting DNase-1), and hypothesized that exogenous administration of long-acting DNase-1 may suppress SARS-CoV-2-mediated neutrophil activities and the cytokine storm. Our findings suggest that exogenously administered long-acting nanoparticulate DNase-1 can effectively reduce cfDNA levels and neutrophil activities and may be used as a potential therapeutic intervention for life-threatening SARS-CoV-2-mediated illnesses.","Lee, Yun Young; Park, Hee Ho; Park, Wooram; Kim, Hyelim; Jang, Jong Geol; Hong, Kyung Soo; Lee, Jae-Young; Seo, Hee Seung; Na, Dong Hee; Kim, Tae-Hyung; Choy, Young Bin; Ahn, June Hong; Lee, Wonhwa; Park, Chun Gwon",Biomaterials,,176
480989,Nowcasting fatal COVID-19 infections on a regional level in Germany,2020,"Purpose: This paper aims to question the capacity of firms embedded in global value chains to manage their natural resources in a sustainable way. Thus, it offers guidelines for more sustainable value chains. Design/methodology/approach: While business strategies have focused on optimizing natural resource exploitation and on constructing global value chains to face sustainability issues, this study first explains why these strategies are not effective in preventing natural resource depletion. Second, it offers a model for anticipating resource depletion. The cut flower industry constitutes a central case to explain the model. Two other industry cases complement the demonstration. Findings: To anticipate natural resource depletion and thus improve industry sustainability, firms must shift from the exploitation of endangered natural resources to the use of alternative local ones. This shift, however, encourages firms to reconstruct value chains and rethink how they create value within these new value chains. It also has an impact on firms’ growth strategy: they must replicate value chains on a local scale instead of taking part in global value chains. Research limitations/implications: The findings rely on illustrations from the cut flower, fishing and textile fiber industries. Generalization to other industries may strengthen the argument. Originality/value: This study offers a model of sustainable growth for firms willing to anticipate natural resource depletion by offering a shift in value chains. It consists of exploiting alternative natural resources and of rethinking the value offered to consumers. Thus, it goes against current models that merely focus on optimizing natural resource exploitation within global value chains. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carton, G.; Parigot, J.",Journal of Business Strategy,,176

Similar and different characteristics between KD and MIS-C have been reported in a variety of literature. We aimed to focus on reviewing clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of KD and MIS-C. METHODS: We searched articles in the electronic databases, including the Cochrane Library database, EMBASE, and MEDLINE with the keywords ""multiple inflammatory syndrome"" and/or ""COVID-19"" and/or ""Kawasaki disease"" and ""children"". RESULTS: Main presentations of MIS-C and KD include fever, rashes, mucous membrane involvement, conjunctivitis, hands and feet erythema/edema, and cervical lymphadenopathy. However, compared with the highest incidence of KD among some Asian countries, MIS-C is common among Black and Hispanic children. MIS-C is common in older children and teenagers, whereas classic KD is common in children under five years of age. Gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and coagulopathy are common in MIS-C patients but are not common in classic KD. Cardiac manifestations are more common than KD, including myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction and coronary artery dilation or aneurysms. Severe cases in MIS-C present with vasodilated or cardiogenic shock that requires fluid resuscitation, muscular support, and even mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), whereas KD rarely presents with these manifestations and requires these treatments. Increased serum ferritin, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia are common in MIS-C. However, thrombocytosis is a characteristic feature of KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and moderate-high dose aspirin are still a standard recommended treatment for KD. In addition to the above-mentioned medications, steroids and biological drugs are frequently used in patients with MIS-C. Most of the children with KD have a good prognosis; however, the long-term clinical outcomes of MIS-C are not clear. CONCLUSIONS: The overall presentation and treatment of MIS-C appear to overlap with KD. However, there are still great differences between the syndromes, and it is controversial to say whether MIS-C is a new entity or is a ""severe type"" of KD.","Zhang, Qing-You; Xu, Bo-Wen; Du, Jun-Bao",World j. pediatr,,176

First, we examine the multivariate time series of cumulative cases and deaths, particularly regarding their changing structure over time. We reveal similarities between the case and death time series, and key dates that the structure of the time series changed. Next, we classify new case time series, demonstrate five characteristic classes of trajectories, and quantify discrepancy between them with respect to the behavior of waves of the disease. Finally, we show there is no relationship between countries' equity market performance and their success in managing COVID-19. Each country's equity index has been unresponsive to the domestic or global state of the pandemic. Instead, these indices have been highly uniform, with most movement in March.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11660v1.pdf,176
482651,Functional respiratory imaging repurposed for COVID-19,2020,"Purpose This study aimed to explore older adults' perceptions of their hearing health during the stay-at-home order issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A 24-item survey was completed by 150 community-dwelling older adults in the United States. Participants were asked about their self-reported hearing status, use of hearing aids and difficulty wearing masks while wearing hearing aids, relative importance of their hearing health, priority of their hearing health during the COVID-19 pandemic, difficulty communicating with masks, and utilization of telepractice services. Results The majority of participants did not wear hearing aids despite reporting that they had at least a little trouble hearing. Most participants reported that their hearing health was important and indicated that they were likely to visit their audiologist for an in-person or virtual visit during the pandemic. Conclusion Audiologists should consider telepractice or remote service delivery options during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to meet the needs of their patients.","Gaeta, Laura",Am J Audiol,,176

The aim of this study is a mid-term review of the sequelae on plain chest radiography (CXR) in patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, assessing the persistence of residual lesions in the control CXR and analysing their possible relationship with epidemiological factors, risk factors, treatments received and initial radiological patterns. RESULTS: A total of 143 patients (52 women and 91 men) were analysed. Mean age was 64 years. Radiological complete resolution (CR) was observed in 104 (73%) and partial resolution (PR) in 39 (27%). Of the risk factors only age was significantly related to persistence of residual lesions (OR 1.06 CI 95% (1.02,1.10). In relation to treatments, significant differences were found with tocilizumab and glucocorticoids, where treated patients had a higher risk of residual lesions (OR 2.44 (1.03,5.80) and 3.05(1.43,6.51) respectively. In the analysis of radiological patterns, significant differences were observed in patients with peripheral condensations in the acute course and a pattern of early radiological worsening. A clinical-radiological dissociation was evident: 83% of patients with residual lesions had no respiratory symptoms. DISCUSSION: COVID19 pneumonias may have a slower radiological resolution in older patients with certain initial radiological patterns, but the development of pulmonary fibrosis in these patients is still questionable.","Gómez Herrero, Helena; Galbete, Arkaitz; Álvarez Galván, Begoña; Caballero García, Pilar; Vicaría Fernández, Iván",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,176

485419,Weight-Based Dosing of Pembrolizumab Every 6 Weeks in the Time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has disrupted structures and communities across the globe. Numerous regions of the world have had varying responses in their attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Factors such as public health policies, governance, and sociopolitical climate have led to differential levels of success at controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, a more advanced surveillance metric for COVID-19 transmission is necessary to help government systems and national leaders understand which responses have been effective and gauge where outbreaks occur. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced COVID-19 surveillance metrics for Canada at the country, province, and territory level that account for shifts in the pandemic including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Enhanced surveillance identifies risks for explosive growth and regions that have controlled outbreaks successfully. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from Canadian public health registries for 13 provinces and territories. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Canada as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: We compare the week of February 7-13, 2021, with the week of February 14-20, 2021. Canada, as a whole, had a decrease in speed from 8.4 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 7.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population. The persistence of new cases during the week of February 14-20 reported 7.5 cases that are a result of COVID-19 transmissions 7 days earlier. The two most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec both experienced decreases in speed from 7.9 and 11.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population for the week of February 7-13 to speeds of 6.9 and 9.3 for the week of February 14-20, respectively. Nunavut experienced a significant increase in speed during this time, from 3.3 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 10.9 daily new cases per 100,000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Canada excelled at COVID-19 control early on in the pandemic, especially during the first COVID-19 shutdown. The second wave at the end of 2020 resulted in a resurgence of the outbreak, which has since been controlled. Enhanced surveillance identifies outbreaks and where there is the potential for explosive growth, which informs proactive health policy.","Post, Lori; Boctor, Michael J; Issa, Tariq Z; Moss, Charles B; Murphy, Robert Leo; Achenbach, Chad J; Ison, Michael G; Resnick, Danielle; Singh, Lauren; White, Janine; Welch, Sarah B; Oehmke, James F",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,176

Both models can be fitted to real data as they include parameters that can be estimated from the data. SEPIR deploys an additional pre-symptomatic (also called asymptomatic) infectious stage not in SEIR but known to exist in COVID-19. This stage can also be fitted to data. We focus on how to fit SEPIR to a first wave. Both SEPIR and the existing SEIR model assume a homogeneous mixing population with parameters fixed. Moreover neither includes dynamically varying control strategies deployed against the virus. If either model is to represent more than just a single wave of the epidemic, then the parameters of the model would have to be time dependent. In view of this we also consider how reproduction numbers can be calculated to investigate the longer term overall result of an epidemic. © 2021 SW 2021.

485783,"Symptom Persistence Despite Improvement in Cardiopulmonary Health - Insights from longitudinal CMR, CPET and lung function testing post-COVID-19",2021,"Background Road traffic accident (RTA) fatalities account for a significant number of unnatural deaths in Pakistan. Hence, it is necessary to investigate RTA fatalities in order to implement measures to reduce them. In the present study, we aimed to assess the detailed epidemiological characteristics of RTA fatalities by analyzing the data obtained from medico-legal autopsies performed at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in 2019 and 2020. We assessed age- and gender-based variations in the pattern of RTA fatalities and determined the anatomical cause of death and sites of fractures among the fatalities. Moreover, we assessed the monthly distribution of cases in 2019 and 2020 to determine the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the number of RTA fatalities reported each month. Methodology In this retrospective study, data obtained from medico-legal autopsies of all RTA victims in 2019 and 2020 (n = 246) were collected from the Forensic Department of JPMC, Karachi. The data were then entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) for analysis. Results The highest number of fatalities was recorded in the age group of 18-40 years (54.5%), while the lowest number was recorded in the age group of &gt;=60 years (8.5%). The male:female autopsy ratio was 6.03:1. Most fatalities were recorded from 6:00 am to 11:59 am (41.9%), followed by 12:00 pm to 5:59 pm (37.4%). Moreover, most victims (76.8%) died instantaneously within seconds to minutes of the incident. The number of RTA fatalities reported in 2019 (50.4%) was similar to that reported in 2020 (49.6%). However, the number of RTA fatalities reported in March-July 2020 was 35.6% lower than that reported in the same period in 2019, possibly because of the restrictions (such as lockdowns) that were imposed to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of RTA fatalities reported in March-July 2020 and that reported in the remaining months of 2019 and 2020 (p = 0.006). The cause of death was head injury in 159 (64.6%) cases and multiple traumatic injuries in 65 (26.4%) cases. Injury to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis caused death in 11 (4.5%), nine (3.7%), and two (0.8%) cases, respectively. Assessment of the site of fractures revealed skull fractures to be the most common type of fractures (53%), followed by rib/sternal fractures (19%). Upper limb and lower limb fractures occurred in 10% and 9% of the cases, respectively, while pelvic and neck fractures occurred in 6% and 3% of the cases, respectively. Conclusions Efforts need to be made at both government and individual levels to reduce RTA fatalities. Strict implementation of traffic laws is necessary. Although we noted a male preponderance, the reluctance to get females autopsied should not be disregarded. The significant decrease in RTA fatalities during March-July 2020 could be attributed to the reduced traffic burden due to the restrictions imposed to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventive measures taken, such as staying at home, to avoid contracting the virus.","Khurshid, A.; Sohail, A.; Khurshid, M.; Shah, M.

Medical school administrators faced the challenge of protecting learners while also minimizing harm to their medical education. This balancing act raised critical questions in medical education as institutions reacted to changing guidelines. COVID-19 has punctuated already contentious areas of medical education and has forced institutions and organizations to take quick action. From the perspectives of a recent medical school graduate and current resident (ES) and a practicing clinician-educator (SHG), we examine the pandemic's impact on undergraduate medical education through an ethical lens. First, we explore the value of medical education, what drives this value, and how COVID-19 may alter it. We next consider student choice and how shifts toward utilitarianism in healthcare during a pandemic may affect learning and career exploration. Then, we inquire how access to technology may impact the experience of medical students from diverse backgrounds and varied institutions during a rapid shift to socially distanced learning. We identify vulnerabilities for students at several phases of the journey: premedical, preclinical, clinical, and preparation for residency. Finally, we address the hidden curriculum of COVID-19, its potential erosion of empathy among current medical students, and possible long-term consequences for future physicians and patients.","Southworth, Elizabeth; Gleason, Sara H",HEC forum,,176

Our results revealed high serum SP-D levels in severe pandemic influenza but not COVID-19 patients. This finding was validated in a separate cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients who also showed low plasma SP-D levels. However, plasma SP-D levels did not distinguish seasonal influenza from COVID-19 in mild-to-moderate disease. Finally, we found that high serum SP-D levels were associated with mortality and renal failure among severe pandemic influenza cases. Thus, our studies have identified SP-D as a unique biomarker expressed during severe pandemic influenza but not COVID-19.","Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Thapa, Mahima; Fernández-López, Luis Alejandro; Carnalla-Cortés, Martha; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo M; Mena-Hernández, Lourdes; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Hernández-Montiel, Erika Mariana; Hernández-García, Diana Lizzeth; Ramírez-Noyola, Jazmín Ariadna; Reyes-López, Cynthia Estefania; Domínguez-Faure, Andrea; Zamudio-López, Guillermo Yamil; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Moncada-Morales, Angélica; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; Cervántes-Rosete, Diana; Muñoz-Torrico, Marcela; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Guadarrama-Ortíz, Parménides; Ávila-Moreno, Federico; Domínguez-Cherit, Guillermo; Rodríguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofía; Mudd, Philip A; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen Margarita; Khader, Shabaana A; Zúñiga, Joaquín",J. infect. dis,,176

487364,The COVID-19 post-pandemic scenario to Oral Radiology at Dental Schools,2020,"BACKGROUND: The population in Mexico has high prevalence rates of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients in the countries most affected by the pandemic has been associated to chronic comorbidities. OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of NCDs in patients with COVID-19 in Mexico and analyze the increased risk due to comorbidities and risk factors on hospitalization, utilization of intensive care units and death. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from 212,802 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by the Ministry of Health up to June 27, 2020. Odds ratios were performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: Up to 47.40% of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were also reported with a comorbidity, with hypertension being the most frequent (20.12%). The report of at least one NCD significantly increased the risk of death with respect to patients without such diagnoses. Chronic kidney disease increased the risk of death the most (OR 2.31), followed by diabetes (OR 1.69), immunosuppression (OR 1.62), obesity (OR 1.42), hypertension (OR 1.24), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.20). The comorbidities that most increased the risk of ICU and of intubation were diabetes, immunosuppression and obesity. CONCLUSION: NCD comorbidities increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Given high NCD prevalence rates among the Mexican population, the pandemic poses a special threat to the health system and to society. Special prevention measures need to be strengthened for persons with NCD diagnoses in the short-term. In the mid-term, disease control strategies need to be improved to protect these patients against COVID-19 severity.","Hernández-Galdamez, Diego Rolando; González-Block, Miguel Ángel; Romo-Dueñas, Daniela Karola; Lima-Morales, René; Hernández-Vicente, Irma Alejandra; Lumbreras-Guzmán, Marivel; Méndez-Hernández, Pablo",Arch Med Res,,176

487952,Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Management During One Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) covered with the heterotrimeric Replication Protein A (RPA) complex is a central intermediate of DNA replication and repair. How RPA is regulated to ensure the fidelity of DNA replication and repair remains poorly understood. Yeast Rtt105 is an RPA-interacting protein required for RPA nuclear import and efficient ssDNA binding. Here, we describe an important role of Rtt105 in high-fidelity DNA replication and recombination and demonstrate that these functions of Rtt105 primarily depend on its regulation of RPA. The deletion of RTT105 causes elevated spontaneous DNA mutations with large duplications or deletions mediated by microhomologies. Rtt105 is recruited to DNA double-stranded break (DSB) ends where it promotes RPA assembly and homologous recombination repair by gene conversion or break-induced replication. In contrast, Rtt105 attenuates DSB repair by the mutagenic single-strand annealing or alternative end joining pathway. Thus, Rtt105-mediated regulation of RPA promotes high-fidelity replication and recombination while suppressing repair by deleterious pathways. Finally, we show that the human RPA-interacting protein hRIP-&#945;, a putative functional homolog of Rtt105, also stimulates RPA assembly on ssDNA, suggesting the conservation of an Rtt105-mediated mechanism.","Wang, Xuejie; Dong, Yang; Zhao, Xiaocong; Li, Jinbao; Lee, Jordan; Yan, Zhenxin; Yang, Shuangshuang; Wu, Wenqiang; Hou, Ximiao; Liu, Guangxue; Zhang, Yueyue; Song, Lun; Cai, Gang; Li, Qing; Ira, Grzegorz; Zhang, Xinghua; Chen, Xuefeng",Proc.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A phenomenological approach was adopted to the qualitative study of 14 COVID-19 survivors selected through purposive sampling. FINDINGS: Two themes extracted as the psychological reactions of the patients to the COVID-19-induced stress included ""self-moderating effect of stress"" and ""psychological maladaptation."" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The present findings appear effective in laying the foundations for performing interventions to improve constructive psychological reactions such as using self-moderating mechanisms of the COVID-19-induced stress and reducing or eliminating maladaptive psychological reactions such as depression, anger, self-blaming, and regret.","Moradi, Yaser; Mollazadeh, Farzin; Karimi, Parivash; Hosseingholipour, Keyvan; Baghaei, Rahim",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,176
488516,Chronicle of Jails and Prisons COVID-19 Deaths Foretold,2021,"We use two cohorts from the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLSY79 and NLSY97), which are large, nationally representative samples of U.S. adults, to investigate consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) by SES, using nine surveys fielded between 2008 and 2016. Previous studies used income and education to measure SES, the NLS enables us to include wealth as well. Previous studies also used cross-sectional data, whereas the NLS allows us to examine whether changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake. The results indicate an inverse gradient in SSB consumption with respect to both income and wealth, controlling for education. However, we do not find evidence that changes in income and wealth correlate with changes in SSB intake. This finding suggests that SES influences the development of SSB consumption patterns, but changes in income and wealth generally do not alter them in adulthood.","Zagorsky, Jay L; Smith, Patricia K",Econ Hum Biol,,176

We describe the study protocol of GeroCovid Observational, a multi-purpose, multi-setting and multicenter initiative that aims at investigating: risk factors, clinical presentation and outcomes of individuals affected by COVID-19 in acute and residential care settings; best strategies to prevent infection in long-term care facilities; and, impact of the pandemic on neuropsychologic, functional and physical health, and on medical management in outpatients and home care patients at risk of COVID-19, with a special focus on individuals with dementia. METHODS: GeroCovid involves individuals aged &#8805;60 years, at risk of or affected by COVID-19, prospectively or retrospectively observed since March 1st, 2020. Data are collected in multiple investigational sites across Italy, Spain and Norway, and recorded in a de-identified clinical e-Registry. A common framework was adapted to different care settings: acute wards, long-term care facilities, geriatric outpatient and home care, and outpatient memory clinics. RESULTS: At September 16th, 2020, 66 investigational sites obtained their Ethical Committee approval and 1618 cases (mean age 80.6 [SD=9.0] years; 45% men) have been recorded in the e-Registry.

Here, we review recent insights into the functions of non-coding regulatory elements and their protein interactors during transcription control. A picture emerges in which the topological environment constraints enhancer-promoter interactions and specific enhancer-bound proteins with distinct promoter-compatibilities refine target promoter choice. Such compatibilities are encoded within the sequences of enhancers and promoters and realized by diverse transcription factors and cofactors with distinct biochemical activities. An emerging property of transcription factors and cofactors is the formation of nuclear microenvironments or membraneless compartments that can have properties of phase-separated liquids. These environments are able to selectively enrich certain proteins and small molecules over others. Further investigation into the interaction of transcriptional regulators with themselves and regulatory DNA elements will help reveal the complexities of gene regulation within the context of the nucleus.","Serebreni, Leonid; Stark, Alexander",Curr Opin Cell Biol,,176
489765,"COVID-19: Current understanding of its Pathophysiology, Clinical presentation and Treatment",2020,"Understanding how antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 evolve during infection may provide important insight into therapeutic approaches and vaccination for COVID-19. Here we profile the antibody responses of 162 COVID-19 symptomatic patients in the COVID-BioB cohort followed longitudinally for up to eight months from symptom onset to find SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, as well as antibodies either recognizing SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens and nucleoprotein, or specific for S2 antigen of seasonal beta-coronaviruses and hemagglutinin of the H1N1 flu virus. The presence of neutralizing antibodies within the first weeks from symptoms onset correlates with time to a negative swab result (p = 0.002), while the lack of neutralizing capacity correlates with an increased risk of a fatal outcome (p = 0.008). Neutralizing antibody titers progressively drop after 5-8 weeks but are still detectable up to 8 months in the majority of recovered patients regardless of age or co-morbidities, with IgG to spike antigens providing the best correlate of neutralization. Antibody responses to seasonal coronaviruses are temporarily boosted, and parallel those to SARS-CoV-2 without dampening the specific response or worsening disease progression. Our results thus suggest compromised immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 spike to be a major trait of COVID-19 patients with critical conditions, and thereby inform on the planning of COVID-19 patient care and therapy prioritization.","Dispinseri, Stefania; Secchi, Massimiliano; Pirillo, Maria Franca; Tolazzi, Monica; Borghi, Martina; Brigatti, Cristina; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Baratella, Marco; Bazzigaluppi, Elena; Venturi, Giulietta; Sironi, Francesca; Canitano, Andrea; Marzinotto, Ilaria; Tresoldi, Cristina; Ciceri, Fabio; Piemonti, Lorenzo; Negri, Donatella; Cara, Andrea; Lampasona, Vito; Scarlatti, Gabriella",Nat Commun,,176

Social distancing is a key approach to slowing disease transmission. However, more evidence is needed on its efficacy, and little is known on the types of areas where it is more or less effective. We obtained county-level data on COVID-19 incidence and mortality during the first wave, smartphone-based average social distancing (0-5, where higher numbers indicate more social distancing), and census data on demographics and socioeconomic status. Using generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution, we modeled associations between social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality, and multiplicative interaction terms to assess effect modification. In multivariable models, each unit increase in social distancing was associated with a 26% decrease (p &lt; 0.0001) in COVID-19 incidence and a 31% decrease (p &lt; 0.0001) in COVID-19 mortality. Percent crowding, minority population, and median household income were all statistically significant effect modifiers. County-level increases in social distancing led to reductions in COVID-19 incidence and mortality but were most effective in counties with lower percentages of black residents, higher median household incomes, and with lower levels of household crowding.","VoPham, T.; Weaver, M.

METHODS: Senior Medical Officer's observations and description of the evolution of the pandemic, impact to the crew of the USS Harry S Truman, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and the public health principles and outbreak prevention protocols used to prevent an outbreak at sea. RESULTS: The USS Harry S Truman Carrier Strike Group was composed of 4,810 personnel from Carrier Strike Group 8, Harry S Truman, Destroyer Squadron 28, and Carrier Air Wing One. The medical department of 52 personnel was made up of doctors, physician assistants, nurses, independent duty corpsman, and hospital corpsman. Our escorts were one destroyer, crew size 308 and one cruiser, crew size 343, each with one independent duty corpsman and one hospital corpsman for medical staff. The total number of personnel was 5,461, all of whom returned to home port with no cases of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Outbreak with a respiratory pathogen in the shipboard environment could debilitate a crew and decrease mission effectiveness of a US Navy warship with implications to national security. Prevention of an outbreak at sea requires identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities, testing capability for identification of the pathogen, preparation for quarantine and isolation for immediate containment, and commitment from the entire crew for success.","Bigornia, Veronica E",Mil. med,,176

These sensors would continually monitor the manhole's wastewater, and whenever virus remnants are detected, transmit an alert signal. In a recent paper, we described two new algorithms, each sequentially opening and testing successive manholes for genetic remnants, each algorithm homing in on a neighborhood where the infected person or persons are located. This paper extends that work in six important ways: (1) we introduce the concept of in-manhole sensors, as these sensors will reduce the number of manholes requiring on-site testing; (2) we present a realistic tree network depicting the topology of the sewer pipeline network; (3) for simulations, we present a method to create random tree networks exhibiting key attributes of a given community; (4) using the simulations, we empirically demonstrate that the mean and median number of manholes to be opened in a search follows a well-known logarithmic function; (5) we develop procedures for determining the number of sensors to deploy; (6) we formulate the sensor location problem as an integer nonlinear optimization and develop heuristics to solve it. Our sensor-manhole system, to be implemented, would require at least three additional steps in R&D: (a) an accurate, inexpensive and fast SARS-Cov-2 genetic-remnants test that can be done at the manhole; (b) design, test and manufacture of the sensors; (c) in-the-field testing and fine tuning of an implemented system.","Nourinejad, Mehdi; Berman, Oded; Larson, Richard C",PLoS One,,176
492279,Elevated Extracellular Volume Fraction and Reduced Global Longitudinal Strains in Participants Recovered from COVID-19 without Clinical Cardiac Findings,2021,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a complex genetic system that encodes proteins which predominantly regulate immune/inflammatory processes. It can be involved in a variety of immuno-inflammatory disorders ranging from infections to autoimmunity and cancers. The HLA system is also suggested to be involved in neurodevelopment and neuroplasticity, especially through microglia regulation and synaptic pruning. Consequently, this highly polymorphic gene region has recently emerged as a major player in the etiology of several major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder and bipolar disorder and with less evidence for major depressive disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. We thus review here the role of HLA genes in particular subgroups of psychiatric disorders and foresee their potential implication in future research. In particular, given the prominent role that the HLA system plays in the regulation of viral infection, this review is particularly timely in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.","Tamouza, Ryad; Krishnamoorthy, Rajagopal; Leboyer, Marion",Brain behav. immun,,176

Depending on the heterogeneity test, we used either random or fixed-effect models to analyze the appropriateness of the pooled results. Study has been registered in the PROSPERO database (ID 176106). RESULT: Overall 114 articles included in this study; 52 251 COVID-19 confirmed patients (20 studies), 10 037 SARS (51 studies), and 8139 MERS patients (43 studies) were included. The most common symptom was fever; COVID-19 (85.6%, P < .001), SARS (96%, P < .001), and MERS (74%, P < .001), respectively. Analysis showed that 84% of Covid-19 patients, 86% of SARS patients, and 74.7% of MERS patients had an abnormal chest X-ray. The mortality rate in COVID-19 (5.6%, P < .001) was lower than SARS (13%, P < .001) and MERS (35%, P < .001) between all confirmed patients.

METHODS: From January 23 to April 30, 2020, we performed ATAAD repair for 33 patients, including three with pregnancy-related TAADs. Confirmation of COVID-19 depended on the results of two nucleic acid tests and pulmonary computed tomography scan. Based on testing results and hemodynamic stability, patients were triaged to an isolated intensive care unit or negative pressure operating room for emergency surgery. RESULTS: Mean age 50.2 ± 13.3 years and 20 were male (60.1%) and 8 patients were febrile (>37.3°C; 24.2%) and 17 were lymphopenic (51.5%). No patient was excluded from COVID-19 infection preoperatively. Extensive aortic repair with total arch replacement (TAR) was performed in 24 (72.7%), and limited proximal repair in 9 patients (27.3%). Cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times averaged 177 ± 34 and 88 ± 20 min for TAR, and 150 ± 30 and 83 ± 18 min for hemiarch, respectively. The mean operation time was 410 ± 68.3 min. Operative mortality was 6.1% (2/33). Complications included reintubation in four (12.1%), acute kidney failure in two (6.1%), and cerebral infarction in one (3.0%). No paraplegia nor re-exploration for bleeding occurred. COVID-19 was excluded in 100% eventually. No nosocomial infection occurred. Nor did any patient/surgical staff develop fever or test positive during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that our management protocol based on testing results and hemodynamic stability in patients with ATAAD during the COVID-19 pandemic was effective and achieved favorable early surgical outcomes.","Zhang, Chen-Han; Ma, Wei-Guo; Zhong, Yong-Liang; Ge, Yi-Peng; Li, Cheng-Nan; Qiao, Zhi-Yu; Liu, Yong-Min; Zhu, Jun-Ming; Sun, Li-Zhong",J. card. surg,,176

As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of inflammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely benefit from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted anti-inflammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-inflammatory interleukins, tyrosine kinase modulation, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, and other non-targeted approaches including corticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation of these therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic inflammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.","Dettorre, G M; Patel, M; Gennari, A; Pentheroudakis, G; Romano, E; Cortellini, A; Pinato, D J",ESMO Open,,176

Therefore, phototherapy is a promising treatment modality, which needs to be validated further for COVID-19 by robust and rigorous randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials to evaluate its impartial outcomes and safety.","Hanna, Reem; Dalvi, Snehal; Salagean, Tudor; Bordea, Ioana Roxana; Benedicenti, Stefano",,,176
494427,COVID-19 and elective joint arthroplasty: Patient perspectives and considerations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Sinonasal symptoms were usually reported to appear initially, yielding the symptoms important for the early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study was conducted retrospectively to investigate the detailed sinonasal manifestations and dynamic profile of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 patients longitudinally. METHODS: This retrospective study included 11 consecutive patients. The prevalence, timing and severity of sinonasal manifestations were analyzed. Oropharyngeal, nasal, sputum and stool specimens were collected to detect RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over COVID-19 period. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, 6 (54.5%) were female, and the median age was 51 (IQR, 36-62) years. Seven patients (63.6%) experienced sinonasal symptoms, with 6 (54.5%) exhibiting sinonasal symptoms on the onset day. Seven patients (63.6%) demonstrated nasal obstruction, 5 (45.5%) had rhinorrhea, and 4 (36.4%) exhibited olfactory dysfunction. All six patients with sinonasal symptoms on the onset day had non-severe infections. Most patients (85.7%) with sinonasal symptoms had non-severe infections. Sinonasal symptoms commonly appeared early. The positive RT-PCR rate for SARS-CoV-2 in various specimens was highest in the first week (73.3%), then gradually decreased over the disease course, but 3 patients (27.3%) had experienced a long-lasting fluctuated positive RT-PCR results since 29 days of illness in both groups, especially for two patients with airway comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Sinonasal symptoms were more prevalent in patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 and usually appeared early. In addition, regular nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered for COVID-19 patients with certain airway comorbidities.","Jia, Xiaoqing; Shao, Shan; Ren, Hong; Xu, Yuan; Zhao, Jinming; Zhao, Yan; Wang, Yue; Bao, Shiping; Yan, Junping; Wang, Xiangdong; Zhang, Luo",Ann Palliat Med,,176
495241,Disease Severity Affects Ventricular Repolarization Parameters in Patients With COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Little is known about the neutralizing (nAb) and binding antibody kinetics in COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors, especially during the first 100 days after disease onset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of previously RT-PCR positive (detected by nasopharyngeal swab during the acute phase), male convalescent patients, all with mild symptoms, were enrolled in serial blood sample collection for a longitudinal nAb titers and anti-nucleocapsid (NP) antibodies (IgM, IgG and IgA) evaluation. NAbs were detected by a cytopathic effect-based virus neutralization test (CPE-based VNT), carried out with SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MT350282). RESULTS: A total of 78 male volunteers provided 316 samples, spanning a total of 4820 days of study. Although only 25% of donors kept nAb titers &#8805;160 within 100 days after the onset of disease, there was >75% probability of sustaining nAb titers &#8805;160 in volunteers whose initial nAb titer was &#8805;1280, weight &#8805; 90 kg or obese, according to their body mass index (BMI), as evidenced by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox hazard regression (all p < .02). There was no correlation between the ABO group, ABO antibody titers and persistent high nAb titers. High IgG anti-NP (S/CO &#8805;5.0) is a good surrogate for detecting nAb &#8805; 160, defined by the ROC curve (sensitivity = 90.5%; CI95%: 84.5%-94.7%). CONCLUSION: Selection of CCP donors for multiple collections based on initial high nAb titers (&#8805;1280) or BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 provides a simple strategy to achieve higher quality in CCP programs. High IgG anti-NP levels can also be used as surrogate markers for high nAb screening.","Wendel, Silvano; Fontão-Wendel, Rita; Fachini, Roberta; Candelaria, Gabriela; Scuracchio, Patricia; Achkar, Ruth; Brito, Mayra; Reis, Luiz Fernando; Camargo, Anamaria; Amano, Mariane; Machado, Rafael; Araujo, Danielle; Soares, Camila; Durigon, Edison",Transfusion,,176

495433,Impact of covid-19 lockdown on adult cardiac surgery in a public hospital,2021,"South Korea's response is considered by many as one the most effective models against COVID-19. The average number of new cases per day fell to 6.4 in the first week of May and currently 90% of all confirmed cases have fully recovered after a massive outbreak in February 29. First, South Korea has flattened the curve of COVID-19 by combining testing, early isolation, and free treatment of positive cases combined with digital technologies without taking to “lockdown” measures. Second, South Korea has been holding press briefings twice a day and disclosed all information on COVID-19 to the public in an open and transparent manner. Third, South Korea has worked to secure the civic participation and voluntary engagement of citizens and businesses. The South Korean approach to COVID-19 may be difficult to emulate even for countries like the U.S. and U.K., but provides important policy implications for developing countries and needs for strengthening three core competencies against the outbreak of an epidemic: digital technology, efficient health governance, and civic partnership. It is a great challenge for developing countries to fight alone against COVID-19. As such, the international community should work to strengthen these core competencies accordingly.","Lee, Daejoong; Heo, Kyungmoo; Seo, Yongseok",World Dev.,,176

496783,Managing Pediatric Cancer Patients in COVID19 Pandemic,2020,"On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the spread of the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, as a pandemic on the basis of “alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.” Hence, it is urgent and imperative to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 for as many global locations as possible. This study calculates the relative risk of the importation and exportation of the COVID-19 virus. The study's most important contribution is the calculation of the overall relative risk of the importation and exportation of COVID-19 from every airport in local municipalities around the world, based on global spatial and mapping information. Three scenarios of air travel restriction are considered, and the change in the risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 is calculated. The relative risk of importation and exportation of COVID-19 clearly shows that not only China, Europe, Middle East, and East Asia, but also the U.S., Australia, and countries in northeast Asia and Latin America are subject to risk. Further, a larger reduction in air travel through airports in a large part of the cumulative incidence area would lead to a gradual decrease in the risk flow. Importantly, the exportation risk of the disease from some airports in China, Iran, and European countries has a higher global spread than the importation risk during the pandemic stage. Therefore, every airport, or government with airports in their jurisdiction, should implement strict countermeasures. It is also indispensable for these countries to undertake countermeasures for COVID-19, such as home quarantine within each country and restricting infected or suspected individuals from flying on airplanes.","Nakamura, Hiroki; Managi, Shunsuke",Transp.

METHOD: A convenience sampling of people living in the UAE was used to conduct an online descriptive cross-sectional study. Respondents were solicited using the social media platforms WhatsApp and Facebook, whereby they were asked to fill in a validated web-based questionnaire. The number of people buying medications from online pharmacies was calculated using a percentage with 95% CIs. RESULTS: 131 respondents (31.2%) [95% CI: 26.7-35.6] stated that they purchased medication via the Internet after Covid-19 was classed as a pandemic. It was found that those respondents most likely to have purchased medication via the Internet were male, single, and older and with a high school education.

A unique finding on colonic histology which may shed light on the pathogenesis of MIS-C was identified. The patient improved significantly following several anti-inflammatory treatments. The lag between the presentation of MIS-C and initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which may often be asymptomatic, together with the young age of our patient, make this a challenging diagnosis.

498555,COVID-19 Testing in the Era of Modern Neurosurgery: Mitigating Risk in Our Vulnerable Patient Populations,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The novel SARS-CoV-2 has been rattling the world since its outbreak in December 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. The learning curve of this new virus has been steep, with a global scientific community desperate to learn how the virus is transmitted, how it replicates, why it causes such a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, resulting in none or few symptoms in some. Others are burdened by an intense immune response that resembles the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which leads to severe disease manifestations, often complicated by fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Research efforts have been focusing on finding effective cures and vaccinations for this virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, represented by several GI manifestations, has led to its investigation as a target for the virus and as an indicator of disease severity. The response of the microbiome (which is heavily linked to immunity) to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its role in igniting the exaggerated immune response has therefore become a focus of interest. The objective of our study was to gather the data connecting between the microbiome, the GI tract and COVID-19 and to investigate whether these reported alterations in the gut microbiome bear any resemblance to those seen in lupus, the prototypical autoimmune disease. Confirming such changes may become the steppingstone to potential therapies that may prevent transmission, progression and immune related manifestations of COVID-19, via manipulation of the gut microbiota. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature review, utilizing the Pubmed search engine and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the microbiome in COVID-19 patients and compared results with studies evaluating the microbiome in lupus. We searched for the terms: microbiome, dysbiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal as well as lupus and autoimmune. While there were hundreds of articles which referred to gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, to date only 4 studies investigated the gastrointestinal microbiome in this setting. We compared the similarities between microbiome of COVID-19 patients and lupus patients. RESULTS: We found that there are several similar processes of immune dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 and in those with lupus, with several other alterations seen in other pathological states. Some of these similarities include loss of microbiota biodiversity, increased representation of pathobionts, which are microbes associated with inflammation and disease (i.e Proteobacteria) and a relative decrease of symbionts, which are protective microbes, associated with anti-inflammatory properties (i.e Lactobacillus). Compromise to the intestinal barrier has also been reported in both. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the disease manifestations in COVID-19. Whether gastrointestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of gastrointestinal manifestations and several severe systemic manifestations, which may be the response to an increased pro-inflammatory environment, is still debatable and warrants further investigation. Given the resemblance of the microbiome in COVID-19 patients to that seen in lupus patients, it becomes clearer why several therapies used in autoimmune conditions are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these findings should promote further investigating the utility of manipulation of the microbiome, via nutritional supplementation or even fecal transplantations, interventions that may alter the course of the disease, and potentially prevent disease transmission at low cost and low risk.","Katz-Agranov, Nurit; Zandman-Goddard, Gisele",Autoimmun Rev,,176

RESULTS: Many laboratory indicators, such as neutrophils, AST, Î³-GT, ALP, LDH, NT-proBNP, Hs-cTnT, PT, APTT, D-dimer, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-&#945;, CRP, ferritin and procalcitonin, were all significantly increased in deceased patients compared with recovered patients on admission. In contrast, other indicators such as lymphocytes, platelets, total protein and albumin were significantly decreased in deceased patients on admission. Some indicators such as neutrophils and procalcitonin, others such as lymphocytes and platelets, continuously increased or decreased from admission to death in deceased patients respectively. Using these indicators alone had moderate performance in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A model based on combination of four indicators (P = 1/[1 + e-(-2.658+0.587×neutrophils - 2.087×lymphocytes - 0.01×platelets+0.004×IL-2R)]) showed good performance in predicting the death of COVID-19 patients. When cutoff value of 0.572 was used, the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction model were 90.74% and 94.44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Using the current indicators alone is of modest value in differentiating between recovered and deceased COVID-19 patients. A prediction model based on combination of neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets and IL-2R shows good performance in predicting the outcome of COVID-19.","Wang, Feng; Hou, Hongyan; Wang, Ting; Luo, Ying; Tang, Guoxing; Wu, Shiji; Zhou, Hongmin; Sun, Ziyong",Travel Med Infect Dis,,176

502394,Pneumolysis and “Silent Hypoxemia” in COVID-19,2021,"Protein structural families are groups of homologous proteins defined by the organization of secondary structure elements (SSEs). Nowadays, many families contain vast numbers of structures, and the SSEs can help to orient within them. Communities around specific protein families have even developed specialized SSE annotations, always assigning the same name to the equivalent SSEs in homologous proteins. A detailed analysis of the groups of equivalent SSEs provides an overview of the studied family and enriches the analysis of any particular protein at hand. We developed a workflow for the analysis of the secondary structure anatomy of a protein family. We applied this analysis to the model family of cytochromes P450 (CYPs)-a family of important biotransformation enzymes with a community-wide used SSE annotation. We report the occurrence, typical length and amino acid sequence for the equivalent SSE groups, the conservation/variability of these properties and relationship to the substrate recognition sites. We also suggest a generic residue numbering scheme for the CYP family. Comparing the bacterial and eukaryotic part of the family highlights the significant differences and reveals a well-known anomalous group of bacterial CYPs with some typically eukaryotic features. Our workflow for SSE annotation for CYP and other families can be freely used at address https://sestra.ncbr.muni.cz .","Midlik, Adam; Navrátilová, Veronika; Moturu, Taraka Ramji; Koca, Jaroslav; Svobodová, Radka; Berka, Karel",Sci Rep,,176

However, the association between COVID-19-associated mortality in patients with immunosuppression and therapeutic use of convalescent plasma is unknown. We review 75 reports, including one large matched-control registry study of 143 COVID-19 patients with hematological malignancies, and 51 case reports and 23 case series representing 238 COVID-19 patients with immunosuppression. We review clinical features and treatment protocols of COVID-19 patients with immunosuppression after treatment with human convalescent plasma. We also discuss the time course and clinical features of recovery. The available data from case reports and case series provide evidence suggesting a mortality benefit and rapid clinical improvement in patients with several forms of immunosuppression following COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. The utility of convalescent plasma or other forms of antibody therapy in immune-deficient and immune-suppressed patients with COVID-19 warrants further investigation.","Senefeld, Jonathon W; Klassen, Stephen A; Ford, Shane K; Senese, Katherine A; Wiggins, Chad C; Bostrom, Bruce C; Thompson, Michael A; Baker, Sarah E; Nicholson, Wayne T; Johnson, Patrick W; Carter, Rickey E; Henderson, Jeffrey P; Hartman, William R; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Wright, R Scott; Fairweather, De Lisa; Bruno, Katelyn A; Paneth, Nigel S; Casadevall, Arturo; Joyner, Michael J",Transfusion,,176

As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.","Popescu, Saskia",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,176

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 56-year-old and a 70-year-old men with fever, cough, and respiratory fatigue were admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated for respiratory distress. DIAGNOSIS: The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for COVID-19 and the chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed the presence of peripheral and bilateral ground-glass opacities. INTERVENTIONS: Both patients developed pneumothoraces after intubation and was managed with chest tube. Due to persistent air leak, thoracoscopies with blebs resection and pleurectomies were performed on 23rd and 16th days from symptoms onset. OUTCOMES: The procedures were successful with no evidence of postoperative air-leak, with respiratory improvement. Pathological specimens were analyzed with evidence of diffuse alveolar septum disruption, interstitium thickness, and infiltration of inflammatory cells with diffuse endothelial dysfunction and hemorrhagic thrombosis. LESSONS: Despite well-known pulmonary damages induced by the COVID-19, the late-phase histological changes include diffused peripheral vessels endothelial hyperplasia, in toto muscular wall thickening, and intravascular hemorrhagic thrombosis.","Aiolfi, Alberto; Bruni, Barbara; Biraghi, Tullio; Montisci, Andrea; Miceli, Antonio; Baronio, Barbara; Khor, Desmond; Cirri, Silvia; Donatelli, Francesco; Clemente, Claudio; Bona, Davide",Medicine (Baltimore),,176

Material and Methods: We obtained 247,807 tweets ranging from 2012 to 2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We annotated biomedical entities and relations on 2,000 randomly selected tweets. For the concept extraction task, we compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and LSTM-CRF classifiers to BERT models. For the relation extraction task, we compared GloVe vectors with CNN classifiers to BERT models. We chose the best performing models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS knowledge base (i.e., iDISK). Results: In both tasks, the BERT-based models outperformed traditional word embeddings. The best performing concept extraction model is the BioBERT model that can identify supplement, symptom, and body organ entities with F1-scores of 0.8646, 0.8497, and 0.7104, respectively. The best performing relation extraction model is the BERT model that can identify purpose and AE relations with F1-scores of 0.8335 and 0.7538, respectively. The end-to-end pipeline was able to extract DS indication and DS AEs with an F1-score of 0.7459 and 0,7414, respectively. Comparing to the iDISK, we could find both known and novel DS-AEs. Conclusion: We have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting DS AE signals from Twitter with a BioBERT-based deep learning pipeline.","Wang, Yefeng; Zhao, Yunpeng; Bian, Jiang; Zhang, Rui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.11403v1.pdf,176

This is the assumption of stationarity. The health impacts of environmental factors, however, may vary not only over space and time but also over the value ranges of the environmental factors under investigation. Few studies to date have examined how often the stationarity assumption is violated and when violated, to what extent findings might be misleading. Using selected studies as examples, this paper explores how the stationarity assumption can lead to misleading conclusions about health-environment relationships that may in turn have serious health consequences or policy implications. It encourages researchers to embrace nonstationarity and recognize its meaning because it helps direct our attention to the ignored factors or processes that may enhance our understanding of the phenomena under investigation.","Kwan, Mei-Po",Health Place,,176

Three papers deal with statistics; estimating delay to death from surges of cases, demonstrating the second wave globally and by continent, and finally estimating the risk of rare and severe hypothetical adverse events after a vaccine has undergone standard testing and compares this to estimated death rate/s from COVID-19. The results of an influenza and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy questionnaire in Malta's healthcare workers are also depicted.

506021,Corticosteroids and COVID-19: What Could Be the Best Bet in Treating Active Glomerular Diseases in Patients With Concomitant Early COVID-19?,2020,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Compared with adults, children with SARS-CoV-2 infection may have fewer and less severe symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly reported in children, sometimes as the only manifestation of the disease, and most often manifest as anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, or abdominal pain. Although most children have asymptomatic or mild disease, 10 % of those infected may experience serious or critical disease, or even death. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a rare but serious condition recently reported in children with COVID-19. Studies indicate that children with obesity are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19, and inflammation associated with obesity could be one of the factors that worsens COVID-19 symptoms due to an increased inflammatory response involving molecules such as interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein. On the other hand, evidence has been reported of a higher protein expression of ACE2 in the visceral adipose tissue of obese and malnourished humans, and this could be associated with complications and severity of COVID-19. Therefore, regulation of the intake of macronutrients or micronutrients could be used as a strategy to reduce the consequences of COVID-19. Diet in general and bioactive compounds could play an important role in the prevention of the inflammatory cascade. The micronutrients with the most evidence suggesting a role in immune support are vitamins C and D, zinc, and polyphenols.","León-Lara, Ximena; Vargas-Castillo, Ariana; Ávila-Nava, Azalia; Guevara-Cruz, Martha; Serralde Zúñiga, Aurora E; Medina-Vera, Isabel",Nutr Hosp,,176

We aimed to prospectively evaluate the attitudes, concerns, and health behavior of IBD patients during COVID-19. METHODS: An online survey was sent to patients from a tertiary IBD Service. The survey included demographic information and questions about the impact of COVID-19, levels of concern caused by COVID-19, perceived risk of IBD medications, medication cessation, and care delivery preferences. RESULTS: Of 97 respondents (39%), 95 (98%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19 on their health, and 43% felt their risk of contracting COVID-19 was above average; 62% reported concern about medication-induced COVID-19 risk, and 11% stopped medications because of COVID-19. Patients considered all medications to increase the risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity; 45% preferred telehealth while 16% preferred face-to-face clinic reviews. Preference for IBD monitoring tools in decreasing order was blood testing, stool collection, gastrointestinal ultrasound, magnetic resonance enterography, and then colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD are demonstrated to experience concern related to their diagnosis and medications. The insights provided by the survey are informative for a possible ""second-wave"" of COVID-19 and routine care, including acceptance of telemedicine, preference for non-invasive investigations, and a need for dissemination of information and education.","Goodsall, Thomas M; Han, Sangwoo; Bryant, Robert V",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,176

However, cardiac injury is defined mainly by troponin elevation without description of associated structural abnormalities and its time course has not been studied. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the ECG and echocardiographic abnormalities as well as their time course in critically ill COVID-19 patients? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The cardiac function of 43 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to two ICUs was assessed prospectively and repeatedly, combining ECG, cardiac biomarker, and transthoracic echocardiographic analyses from ICU admission to ICU discharge or death or to a maximum follow-up of 14 days. Cardiac injury was defined by troponin elevation and newly diagnosed ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities, or both. RESULTS: At baseline, 49% of patients demonstrated a cardiac injury, and 70% of patients experienced cardiac injury within the first 14 days of ICU stay, with a median time of occurrence of 3 days (range, 0-7 days). The most frequent abnormalities were ECG or echocardiographic signs, or both, of left ventricular (LV) abnormalities (87% of patients with cardiac injury), right ventricular (RV) systolic dysfunction (47%), pericardial effusion (43%), new-onset atrial arrhythmias (33%), LV relaxation impairment (33%), and LV systolic dysfunction (13%). Between baseline and day 14, the incidence of pericardial effusion and of new-onset atrial arrhythmias increased and the incidence of ECG or echocardiographic signs, or both, of LV abnormalities as well as the incidence of LV relaxation impairment remained stable, whereas the incidence of RV and LV systolic dysfunction decreased.

Although more and more literature is exploring the impact of the pandemic on non-referred children and families, only a few studies are focused on the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 in chronically ill children and their caregivers. The present study investigates asthma control and children and mothers' psychological functioning (i.e.: psychological well-being, fear of contagion, and mothers' Covid-19 related fears) in 45 asthmatic children aged 7-to-14, compared to a control sample. The subjects were administered an online survey after the lockdown (from 28th May to 23rd August 2020). The analysis shows that asthmatic children presented higher concern in relation to contagion, however, no difference in psychological functioning was displayed between the two cohorts. Mothers reported more Covid-19 related fears, and greater worries according to the resumption of their children's activities. Moreover, they indicated a global worsening of their psychological well-being during the lockdown. Furthermore, regarding the clinical sample, the multivariate regression model showed that a worsening of mothers' psychological and children's physical well-being was associated with a worsening of children's psychological well-being during the lockdown. The results of this study indicate that mothers of asthmatic children can be more prone to experience psychological fatigue in a pandemic scenario. Special programs should be developed to support caregivers of chronically ill children.","Di Riso, Daniela; Spaggiari, Silvia; Cambrisi, Elena; Ferraro, Valentina; Carraro, Silvia; Zanconato, Stefania",Sci Rep,,176

Os dados foram analisados por ANOVA seguido pelo teste de Tukey. O fipronil reduziu significantemente a produção de espermatozoides (P < 0,01) e a vitamina E apresentou efeito protetor sobre esse parâmetro. A atividade da enzima GPx aumentou e a da CAT foi significantemente reduzida pelo fipronil (P < 0,001 e P < 0,05, respectivamente) e a vitamina E reestabeleceu as atividades das enzimas para níveis similares aos do grupo controle. Observou-se uma redução significante na concentração de GSH nos testículos dos ratos tratados com fipronil (P < 0,001) em relação ao grupo controle e a vitamina E apresentou uma proteção parcial deste efeito. Não houve alteração na concentração de grupos tióis de proteínas. Houve um aumento significante na concentração de MDA (P < 0,05), indicador de lipoperoxidação, nos animais tratados com fipronil e esse efeito foi diminuído pela vitamina E.

The diagnosis of MIS-C cases will likely become even more challenging as vaccine uptake and natural immunity in previously infected persons leads to lower circulating rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and will make cases sporadic. Febrile children presenting with cardiac dysfunction, symptoms overlapping Kawasaki disease or significant gastrointestinal complaints warrant a thorough screen in emergency departments, urgent care centers, and outpatient pediatric or family medicine practices.

510726,Spectrum of Covid-19 Severity in Young Adults: a Case Series,2020,"BACKGROUND: Perhaps reflecting that children with COVID-19 rarely exhibit severe respiratory symptoms and often remain asymptomatic, little attention has been paid to explore the immune response in pediatric COVID-19. Here, we analyzed the phenotype and function of circulating neutrophils from children with COVID-19. METHODS: An observational study including 182 children with COVID-19, 21 children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), and 40 healthy children was performed in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Neutrophil phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry in blood samples. Cytokine production, plasma levels of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and citrullinated histone H3 were measured by ELISA. Cell-free DNA was quantified by fluorometry. FINDINGS: Compared with healthy controls, neutrophils from children with COVID-19 showed a lower expression of CD11b, CD66b, and L-selectin but a higher expression of the activation markers HLA-DR, CD64 and PECAM-1 and the inhibitory receptors LAIR-1 and PD-L1. No differences in the production of cytokines and NETs were observed. Interestingly, the expression of CD64 in neutrophils and the serum concentration of IgG antibodies directed to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 distinguished asymptomatic from mild and moderate COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Acute lung injury is a prominent feature of severe COVID-19 in adults. A low expression of adhesion molecules together with a high expression of inhibitory receptors in neutrophils from children with COVID-19 might prevent tissue infiltration by neutrophils preserving lung function. FUNDING: This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (National Agency for Scientific and Technological Promotion, IP-COVID-19-0277 and PMO BID PICT 2018-2548), and University of Buenos Aires from Argentina (20020170100573BA).","Seery, Vanesa; Raiden, Silvina C; Algieri, Silvia C; Grisolía, Nicolás A; Filippo, Daniela; De Carli, Norberto; Di Lalla, Sandra; Cairoli, Héctor; Chiolo, María J; Meregalli, Claudia N; Gimenez, Lorena I; Gregorio, Gabriela; Sarli, Mariam; Alcalde, Ana L; Davenport, Carolina; Bruera, María J; Simaz, Nancy; Pérez, Mariela F; Nivela, Valeria; Bayle, Carola; Tuccillo, Patricia; Agosta, María T; Pérez, Hernán; Villa Nova, Susana; Suárez, Patricia; Takata, Eugenia M; García, Mariela; Lattner, Jorge; Rolón, María J; Coll, Patricia; Sananez, Inés; Holgado, María P; Ferrero, Fernando; Geffner, Jorge; Arruvito, Lourdes",EBioMedicine,,176
511165,Analysis of Austrian COVID-19 deaths by age and sex. (Covid-19 part II.),2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a new pandemic, and its impact by HIV status is unknown. National reporting does not include gender identity; therefore, data are absent on the impact of COVID-19 on transgender people, including those with HIV. Baseline data from the American Cohort to Study HIV Acquisition Among Transgender Women in High Risk Areas (LITE) Study provide an opportunity to examine pre-COVID factors that may increase vulnerability to COVID-19-related harms among transgender women. SETTING: Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Miami, New York City, Washington, DC. METHODS: Baseline data from LITE were analyzed for demographic, psychosocial, and material factors that may affect vulnerability to COVID-related harms. RESULTS: The 1020 participants had high rates of poverty, unemployment, food insecurity, homelessness, and sex work. Transgender women with HIV (n = 273) were older, more likely to be Black, had lower educational attainment, and were more likely to experience material hardship. Mental and behavioral health symptoms were common and did not differ by HIV status. Barriers to health care included being mistreated, provider discomfort serving transgender women, and past negative experiences; as well as material hardships, such as cost and transportation. However, most reported access to material and social support-demonstrating resilience. CONCLUSIONS: Transgender women with HIV may be particularly vulnerable to pandemic harms. Mitigating this harm would benefit everyone, given the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus. Collecting gender identity in COVID-19 data is crucial to inform an effective public health response. Transgender-led organizations' response to this crisis serve as an important model for effective community-led interventions.","Poteat, Tonia C; Reisner, Sari L; Miller, Marissa; Wirtz, Andrea L",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,176
512164,Improving the Residency Application Process with Application and Interview Caps,2021,"In this study, a combination of clinical and hematological information, collected on day of presentation to the hospital with pneumonia, was evaluated for its ability to predict severity and mortality outcomes in COVID-19. Ours is a retrospective, observational study of 203 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. All of them were confirmed RT-PCR positive cases. We used simple hematological parameters (total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ration and platelet to lymphocyte ratio); and a severity classification of pneumonia (mild, moderate and severe) based on a single clinical parameter, the percentage saturation of oxygen at room air, to predict the outcome in these cases. The results show that a high absolute neutrophil count on day of onset of pneumonia symptoms correlated strongly with both severity and survival in COVID-19. In addition, it was the primary driver of an initial high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) observed in patients with severe disease. The effect of low lymphocyte count was not found to be very significant in our cohort. Multivariate logistic regression was done using Python 3.7 to assess whether these parameters can adequately predict survival. We found that clinical severity and a high neutrophil count on day of presentation of pneumonia symptoms could predict the outcome with 86% precision. This model is undergoing further evaluation at our centre for validation using data collected during the second wave of COVID-19. We present the relevance of an elevated neutrophil count in COVID-19 pneumonia and review the advances in research which focus on neutrophils as an important effector cell of COVID-19 inflammation.","Agarwal, Niharika; Dua, Devika; Sud, Ritika; Yadav, Madhur; Agarwal, Aparna; Vijayan, Vijesh",,,176

METHOD: A total of 132 patients with tympanic membrane perforation were randomly divided into two groups: the no tympanomeatal flap approach group (group A, 56 ears) and the tympanomeatal flap approach group (group B, 76 ears). A comparison between the two groups was made. RESULTS: The average operation time of group A was 36.00 ± 5.24 minutes, which was significantly shorter than that of group B, which was 43.89 ± 4.57 minutes (p = 0.002). The blood loss of group A was 5.08 ± 1.83 ml, which was significantly less than that of group B (9.67 ± 2.29 ml; p < 0.001). There were no differences in the degree of hearing improvement, the rate of hearing improvement, the dry ear time (when the external auditory canal and the operating cavity were dry) after operation and the success rate of tympanic membrane repair when compared between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Compared with group B, group A (no tympanomeatal flap approach) can achieve the same effect but has the advantages of a shorter operation time and less blood loss during the operation.","Wang, D; Wang, W",J Laryngol Otol,,176

It has infected about 10,021,401 patients and brought forth mortality rate to about 499,913 among 216 countries as cited by WHO. Drugs including Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine derivatives are being administered in most urgent cases, although probable side effects on people with metabolic disorders. Thus, the unavailability of authorized drugs and treatment for this pandemic demands the research world to discover natural compounds with potency to cure it. This paper assesses the isoflavonoid puerarin from Pueraria lobata as a possible inhibitor of the main protease of SARS-COV-2 (Mpro) via in silico approach, for example, molecular docking, Lipinski's rule of five and toxicity prediction (ADME). Puerarin revealed a high binding affinity with the target site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. This compound slightly meets the criteria of Lipinski's rule. It does not possess properties that could cause adverse effects in humans;thus, making puerarin a potential drug candidate to investigate its usage against COVID-19. © 2021 Malaysian Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

There was an urgent need to look for the remedy and control this deadly disease. A new strain of coronavirus called Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was considered to be responsible for COVID-19. Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the family of coronaviruses crowned with homotrimeric class 1 fusion spike protein (or S protein) on their surfaces. COVID-19 attacks primarily at our throat and lungs epithelial cells. In COVID-19, a stronger adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 can lead to longer recovery time and leads to several complications. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for examining the consequence of adaptive immune responses to the viral mutation to control disease transmission. We consider three populations, namely, the uninfected epithelial cells, infected cells, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also take into account combination drug therapy on the dynamics of COVID-19 and its effect. We present a fractional-order model representing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells. The main aim of our study is to explore the effect of adaptive immune response using fractional order operator to monitor the influence of memory on the cell-biological aspects. Also, we have studied the outcome of an antiviral drug on the system to obstruct the contact between epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2 to restrict the COVID-19 disease. Numerical simulations have been done to illustrate our analytical findings.","Chatterjee, Amar Nath; Ahmad, Bashir",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,176

Despite the high cost and attributable morbidity and mortality of MV patients with pneumonia which approaches 40%, sampling of the distal lung in MV patients suffering from range of lung diseases such as Covid-19 is not standardised, lacks reproducibility and requires expert operators. We propose a robotic bronchoscope that enables repeatable sampling and guidance to distal lung pathologies by overcoming significant challenges that are encountered whilst performing bronchoscopy in MV patients, namely, limited dexterity, large size of the bronchoscope obstructing ventilation, and poor anatomical registration. We have developed a robotic bronchoscope with 7 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), an outer diameter of 4.5 mm and inner working channel of 2 mm. The prototype is a push/pull actuated continuum robot capable of dexterous manipulation inside the lung and visualisation/sampling of the distal airways. A prototype of the robot is engineered and a mechanics-based model of the robotic bronchoscope is developed. Furthermore, we develop a novel numerical solver that improves the computational efficiency of the model and facilitates the deployment of the robot. Experiments are performed to verify the design and evaluate accuracy and computational cost of the model. Results demonstrate that the model can predict the shape of the robot in &lt;0.011s with a mean error of 1.76 cm, enabling the future deployment of a robotic bronchoscope in MV patients.","Mitros, Z.; Thamo, B.; Bergeles, C.; da Cruz, L.; Dhaliwal, K.; Khadem, M.",Frontiers in Robotics &amp; AI,,176

514447,"A prospective cohort of clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients post-discharge in Tehran, Iran (Tele-COVID-19): Research protocol and baseline findings",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created huge damage to society and brought panic around the world. Such panic can be ascribed to the seemingly deceptive features of COVID-19: Compared to other deadly viral outbreaks, it has medium transmission and mortality rates. As a result, the severity of the causative coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was deeply underestimated by society at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on this, in this review, we define the viruses with features similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 as the Panic Zone viruses. To contain those viruses, accurate and fast diagnosis followed by effective isolation and treatment of patients are pivotal at the early stage of virus breakouts. This is especially true when there is no cure or vaccine available for a transmissible disease, which is the case for the current COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 2020, more than 100 kits for COVID-19 diagnosis on the market have been surveyed in this review, while emerging sensing techniques for SARS-CoV-2 are also discussed. It is of critical importance to rationally use these kits for efficient management and control of the Panic Zone viruses. Therefore, we discuss guidelines to select diagnostic kits at different outbreak stages of the Panic Zone viruses, SARS-CoV-2 in particular. While it is of utmost importance to use nucleic acid based detection kits with low false negativity (high sensitivity) at the early stage of an outbreak, the low false positivity (high specificity) gains importance at later stages of the outbreak. When society is set to reopen from the lockdown stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes critical to have immunoassay based kits with high specificity to identify people who can safely return to society after their recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infections. Finally, since a massive attack from a viral pandemic requires a massive defense from the whole society, we urge both government and the private sector to research and develop affordable and reliable point-of-care testing (POCT) kits, which can be used massively by the general public (and therefore called massive POCT) to contain Panic Zone viruses in the future.","Pokhrel, Pravin; Hu, Changpeng; Mao, Hanbin",ACS Sens,,176

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists immunocompromised patients, including those requiring immunosuppression following renal transplantation, as high risk for severe disease from SARS-CoV-2. Treatment for other viral infections in renal transplant recipients often includes a reduction in immunosuppression; however, no current guidelines are available recommending the optimal approach to managing immunosuppression in the patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2. It is currently advised to avoid corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 outside of critically ill patients. Recently published cases describing inpatient care of COVID-19 in renal transplant recipients differ widely in disease severity, time from transplantation, baseline immunosuppressive therapy, and the modifications made to immunosuppression during COVID-19 treatment. This review summarizes and compares inpatient immunosuppressant management strategies of recently published reports in the renal transplant population infected with SARS-CoV-2 and discusses the limitations of corticosteroids in managing immunosuppression in this patient population.","Johnson, Kristen M; Belfer, Julie J; Peterson, Gina R; Boelkins, Mark R; Dumkow, Lisa E",Pharmacotherapy,,176

519440,Electrocardiographic markers of increased risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) are being exposed to infection both at work and in their communities. Determining where HCWs might have been infected is challenging based on epidemiological data alone. At Akershus University Hospital, Norway, several clusters of possible intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission were identified based on routine contact tracing. AIM: To determine whether clusters of suspected intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission could be resolved by combining whole genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 with contact tracing data. METHODS: Epidemiological data were collected during routine contact tracing of polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs. Possible outbreaks were identified as wards with two or more infected HCWs defined as close contacts who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 less than three weeks apart. Viral RNA from naso-/oropharyngeal samples underwent nanopore sequencing in direct compliance to the ARTIC Network protocol. FINDINGS: Five outbreaks were suspected from contact tracing. Viral consensus sequences from 24 HCWs, two patients, and seven anonymous samples were analysed. Two outbreaks were confirmed, one refuted, and two remained undetermined. One new potential outbreak was discovered. CONCLUSION: Combined with epidemiological data, nanopore WGS was a useful tool for investigating intra-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission. WGS helped to resolve questions about possible outbreaks and to guide local infection prevention and control measures.","Løvestad, A H; Jørgensen, S B; Handal, N; Ambur, O H; Aamot, H V",J Hosp Infect,,176

We retrospectively identified all patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA), IS and non-traumatic intracranial haemorrhage (ICH; including intracerebral, subdural and subarachnoid bleeding types) admitted to one of the 11 public hospitals in Styria (covering > 95% of inhospital cerebrovascular events in this region). Information was extracted from the electronic medical documentation network connecting all public Styrian hospitals. We analysed two periods of interest: (1) three peak months of the first COVID-19 wave (March-May 2020), and (2) three recovery months thereafter (June-August 2020), compared to respective periods 4 years prior (2016-2019) using Poisson regression. In the three peak months of the first COVID-19 wave, there was an overall decline in hospital admissions for acute cerebrovascular diseases (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.89, p < 0.001), which was significant for TIA (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.72, p < 0.001) and ICH (0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.91, p = 0.02), but not for IS (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.85-1, p = 0.08). Thrombolysis and thrombectomy numbers were not different compared to respective months 4 years prior. In the recovery period after the first COVID-19 wave, TIA (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.96, p = 0.011) and ICH (RR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.74-0.99, p = 0.045) hospitalizations remained lower, while the frequency of IS and recanalization treatments was unchanged. In this state-wide analysis covering all types of acute cerebrovascular diseases, hospital admissions for TIA and ICH were reduced during and also after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, but hospitalizations and recanalization treatments for IS were not affected in these two periods.","Gattringer, Thomas; Fandler-Höfler, Simon; Kneihsl, Markus; Hofer, Edith; Köle, Wolfgang; Schmidt, Reinhold; Tscheliessnigg, Karl-Heinz; Frank, Almut-Michaela; Enzinger, Christian",J. neurol,,176

This study adds knowledge to the existing literature on contactless shopping and protection motivation theory. Results imply that retailers must invest in contactless shopping and provide an in-store shopping environment that prioritizes the health and safety of shoppers and employees to decrease the threat of virus infection during shopping.

Along with the direct health threats of COVID-19, there are disruptions to social relationships and health services resulting from mitigation efforts instituted by public health authorities. This study examined the relationship between trust in the government and trust in COVID-19 health information from the US CDC, state health departments, and social media on the experience of COVID-19 social and health services-related disruptions. METHODS: People living with HIV (N = 459) recruited through social media advertisements and chain referrals completed confidential surveys delivered through an online platform. RESULTS: Participants experienced high-levels of disruptions to social relationships and health services attributable to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We also observed high-rates of inaccurate information and low-levels of trust in government and sources of COVID-19 information. Greater disruptions to social relationships were predicted by more concern about oneself and others contracting COVID-19, whereas disruptions to health services were predicted by greater concern for oneself contracting COVID-19, greater general medical mistrust, and less trust in information from the CDC. CONCLUSIONS: Findings have implications for the necessity of rebuilding public trust in credible sources of health information and stepping up efforts to counter sources of inaccurate information.","Kalichman, Seth C; Shkembi, Bruno; Kalichman, Moira O; Eaton, Lisa A",BMC Public Health,,176

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a large urban tertiary care medical center. Thirty-two patients undergoing operative procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic were placed into 2 preoperative screening protocols. Early in the pandemic a ""high-risk case protocol"" was utilized to maximize available resources. As information and technology evolved, a ""universal point-of-care protocol"" was implemented. RESULTS: Of 32 patients, 25 were screened prior to surgery. Three (12%) tested positive for COVID-19. In all 3 cases, the procedure was delayed, and patients were admitted for treatment or discharged under home quarantine. During this period, 86% of operative procedures were indicated for treatment of oncologic disease. There was no significant delay in arrival to the operating room for patients undergoing point-of-care screening immediately prior to their procedure (P = .92). DISCUSSION: Currently, few studies address preoperative screening for COVID-19. A substantial proportion of individuals in this cohort tested positive, and both protocols identified positive cases. The major strengths of the point-of-care protocol are ease of administration, avoiding subsequent exposures after testing, and relieving strain on ""COVID-19 clinics"" or other community testing facilities. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Preoperative screening is a critical aspect of safe surgical practice in the midst of the widespread pandemic. Rapid implementation of universal point-of-care screening is possible without major workflow adjustments or operative delays.","Urban, Matthew J; Patel, Tirth R; Raad, Richard; LoSavio, Phillip; Stenson, Kerstin; Al-Khudari, Samer; Nielsen, Thomas; Husain, Inna; Smith, Ryan; Revenaugh, Peter C; Wiet, R Mark; Papagiannopoulos, Peter; Batra, Pete S; Tajudeen, Bobby A",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,176

Methods: We performed a systematic literature search from PubMed and Embase on original articles, research letters, and short reports which have data about the number of fractures, site of fracture, mechanism of injury, location where injury was sustained, percentage of operative intervention, mortality during the pandemic compared to a specified period of time before the pandemic. The search was finalized in October 14, 2020. Results: A total of 11,936 participants from 16 studies were included in our study. The pooled analysis indicated a higher 30-days mortality associated with fractures during the pandemic (9% vs 4%, OR 1.86 [1.05, 3.27], pâ¯=â¯0.03; I2: 36%, pâ¯=â¯0.15). The number of fractures presenting to hospitals has declined 43% (35-50%) compared to pre-pandemic. Hand fracture was fewer during the pandemic (18% vs 23%, OR 0.75 [0.58, 0.97], pâ¯=â¯0.03; I2: 69%, pâ¯=â¯0.002). Work-related traumas, high-energy falls, and domestic accidents were more common during the pandemic, while sports-related traumas were found to be less. Injuries that occurred in the sports area were lower than before the pandemic. Conclusion: The present meta-analysis showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of fractures has decreased, but there is a higher mortality rate associated with fractures.","Lim, Michael Anthonius; Mulyadi Ridia, Ketut Gede; Pranata, Raymond",,,176
523033,Impact of Covid-19 on Cf Foundation Patient Registry Data,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Because of the pandemic, electronic communication between patients and clinicians has taken on increasing significance in the delivery of cancer care. The study explored personal, clinical, and technology factors predicting cancer survivors' electronic communication with clinicians. METHODS: Data for this investigation came from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS5, Cycle 2) that included 593 respondents who previously or currently had cancer. Multivariate regression analyses were used to predict electronic communication with clinicians. Predictors included demographic variables and health status, technology use (online health information-seeking behavior, tracking of health-related data such as using a Fitbit), and quality of past communication experiences with clinicians. RESULTS: In this pre COVID-19 sample, 42 % respondents (N = 252) did not engage in any type of electronic communication (e.g., emailing, texting, data sharing) with providers. In multivariate analyses, predictors of more electronic communication with clinicians included frequency of seeking health-related information online (ß = .267, p < .001) and better communication experiences with clinicians (ß = .028, p = .034), while no demographic variable showed significance. The technology use variables (online health information seeking, health tracking) were significantly higher predictors of electronic communication with clinicians (&#916;R2 = .142, p < .001) than was past experiences with clinicians (&#916;R2 = .029, p = .016). CONCLUSIONS: Access and past experience with interactive media technologies are strong predictors of cancer patients' electronic communication than with clinicians. Adoption of telehealth technology likely depends as much on patients' relationships with technology as it does their relationships with clinicians. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Since Covid-19, cancer care providers have turned to telehealth provide patients with needed cancer care services. Enhancing patients' digital competence and experience with electronic communication will help them more easily navigate telehealth care. Providers can leverage their relationship with patients to facilitate more effective use of telehealth services.","Wu, Qiwei L; Street, Richard L",Patient educ. couns,,176
523103,Utilizing the electronic health records to create a syndromic staff surveillance system during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021,"Objective: This paper gives context on recent literature regarding the development of digital personal health libraries (PHL) and provides insights into the potential application of consumer health informatics in diverse clinical specialties. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here, 2,850 records were retrieved from PubMed and EMBASE in March 2020 using search terms: personal, health, and library. Information related to the health topic, target population, study purpose, library function, data source, data science method, evaluation measure, and status were extracted from each eligible study. In addition, knowledge discovery methods, including co-occurrence analysis and multiple correspondence analysis, were used to explore research trends of PHL. Results: After screening, this systematic review focused on a dozen articles related to PHL. These encompassed health topics such as infectious diseases, congestive heart failure, electronic prescribing. Data science methods included relational database, information retrieval technology, ontology construction technology. Evaluation measures were heterogeneous regarding PHL functions and settings. At the time of writing, only one of the PHLs described in these articles is available for the public while the others are either prototypes or in the pilot stage. Discussion: Although PHL researches have used different methods to address problems in diverse health domains, there is a lack of an effective PHL to meet the needs of older adults. Conclusion: The development of PHLs may create an unprecedented opportunity for promoting the health of older consumers by providing diverse health information.","Ding, Huitong; Zhang, Chi; An, Ning; Zhang, Lingling; Xie, Ning; Alterovitz, Gil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11686v1.pdf,176
523104,Utilizing the electronic health records to create a syndromic staff surveillance system during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: With the growing stress on hospitals caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for home-based solutions has become a necessity to support these overwhelmed hospitals. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO2 and PaCO2, pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

Nanotechnology has been applied to improve performance of biosensors using electrochemical, optical, mechanical and physical modes of transduction, and to allow arrays of biosensors to be constructed for parallel sensing. Biosensors have been proposed for measurement of cancer biomarkers, cardiac biomarkers as well as biomarkers for autoimmune disease, infectious disease and for DNA analysis. Novel applications of biosensors include measurements in alternate sample types, such as saliva. Biosensors based on immobilized whole cells have found new applications, for example to detect the presence of cancer and to monitor the response of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The number of research reports describing new biosensors for analytes of clinical interest continues to increase; however, movement of biosensors from the research laboratory to the clinical laboratory has been slow. The greatest impact of biosensors will be felt at point-of-care testing locations without laboratory support.

LTC spending includes beneficiaries’ copayment and the impact is quantified in terms of output, employment and value added. To this purpose, we use an input–output model of the Spanish economy that allows us to further describe how the value added generated is distributed throughout the economy according to the existing benefit-mix (in kind services, cash benefit for informal care and cash benefit for personal assistance). Additionally, the model provides results on how the return on LTC spending would improve by using only in-kind services instead of the benefit mix currently in place. The 2012 Spanish Input–Output Table at current prices was extracted from the WIOD Database’s 2016 Release. Consumption data for dependent, employed, and unemployed households were collected from the Spanish Household Budget Survey for 2012. The findings reveal that the total annual costs are 7,205.43 million €, with total costs from in-kind services being almost 71% higher than total costs from cash benefits. Each million euros invested in in-kind services and CBPA would create 41.91 jobs (68.41% direct, 9.16% indirect and 22.43% induced). However, each million euros spent on cash benefits would result in 16.88 jobs overall (53.02% direct, 24.53% indirect and 22.45% induced).

We examined COVID-19 related anxiety in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer (CaP). METHOD: This study was conducted between July and September 2020. Sixty participants from a larger prospective, longitudinal study assessing depression, anxiety and health related quality of life in men with localized prostate cancer (DAHCaP) were included. COVID-19 related anxiety was measured at a single time point using, the Corona Virus Anxiety Scale (CAS). In addition, the following, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S), the Connor-Davidson Resilience (CD-RISC) scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) that form part of the DAHCaP study were used in the analysis. We extracted pre-pandemic data for the STAI-S. RESULTS: Twenty-one percent had diabetes, 62.3% had hypertension and 24.6% had cardiac diseases, all known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Only 3% scored ≥9 on the CAS, indicating COVID 19 anxiety dysfunction. Half knew of family or friends that had contracted COVID-19 especially those scoring higher on the CAS (P = 0.042). There was a significant decrease in STAI-S scores pre-pandemic to the pandemic phase (34.7 to 29.8, P = 0.003). No correlation was observed between CAS and STAI-S (rho = 0.08), CD-RISC (rho = −0.06) or MSPSS (rho = −0.15). There was a weak positive correlation between the CAS and monthly income (rho = 0.33; P = 0.010). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 did not induce significant anxiety in men being treated for CaP nor did it place an additional psychological burden, nor was there any correlation with state anxiety, resilience or social support.","Irusen, Hayley; Burger, Henriette; Fernandez, Pedro W.; Esterhuizen, Tonya; Suliman, Sharain; Seedat, Soraya",Cancer Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152224/; https://doi.org/10.1177/10732748211024239,176

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-centre observational study SETTING: Birmingham, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 907 hospitalised patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from a multi-ethnic community, admitted between 1 March 2020 and 31 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary analysis was an evaluation of cardiovascular conditions and diabetes in relation to ethnicity and social deprivation, with the end-point of inpatient death or death within 30 days of discharge. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate HRs while adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: 361/907 (39.8%) died in hospital or within 30 days of discharge. The presence of diabetes and hypertension together appears to confer the greatest mortality risk (OR 2.75; 95% CI 1.80 to 4.21; p<0.001) compared with either condition alone. Age >65 years (OR 3.32; 95% CI 2.15 to 5.11), male sex (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.82), hypertension (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.61) and cerebrovascular disease (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.31 to 2.68) were independently associated with increased risk of death. The mortality risk did not differ between the quintiles of deprivation. High-sensitivity troponin I was the best predictor of mortality among biomarkers (OR 4.43; 95% CI 3.10 to 7.10). Angiotensin-receptor blockers (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96) and ACE inhibitors (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.97) were not associated with adverse outcome. The Charlson Index of Comorbidity scores were significantly higher in non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: The combined prevalence of hypertension and diabetes appears to confer the greatest risk, where diabetes may have a modulating effect. Hypertension and cerebrovascular disease had a significant impact on inpatient mortality.

Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women’s mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (p < 0.001; OR = 19.34 [8.71–43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world.

Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage.","Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Cot, Corentin; Sannino, Francesco",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85875-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758267/,176

592273,Trust and Communication: Responding to Uncertainty,2020-07-15,"Bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) are a new class of antiprotozoal drugs that target calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) in various apicomplexan parasites. A multiple dose regimen of BKI 1369 has been shown to be highly effective against Cystoisospora suis (syn. Isospora suis), the causative agent of neonatal porcine coccidiosis. However, multiple dosing may not be widely applicable in the field. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of reduced treatment frequencies with BKI 1369 against porcine cystoisosporosis in vitro and in vivo. Pre-incubation of sporozoites with BKI 1369 completely failed to inhibit the infection in vitro unless treatment was prolonged post-infection. Notably, a single treatment of infected cell cultures 2 days post-infection (dpi) resulted in a significant reduction of merozoite replication. In an experimental infection model, treatment of suckling piglets experimentally infected with C. suis 2 and 4 dpi with 20 mg BKI 1369/kg body weight completely suppressed oocyst excretion. A single treatment on the day of infection or 2 dpi suppressed oocyst excretion in 50% and 82% of the piglets and reduced the quantitative excretion in those that shed oocysts by 95.2% and 98.4%, respectively. Moreover, a significant increase in body weight gain and reduced number of diarrhea days were observed in BKI 1369 treated piglets compared to the control piglets, irrespective of time points and frequencies of treatment. Given that reduced treatment frequencies with BKI 1369 are comparable in efficacy to repeated applications without any adverse effects, this could be considered as a practical therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis.","Shrestha, Aruna; Ruttkowski, Bärbel; Greber, Patricia; Whitman, Grant R.; Hulverson, Matthew A.; Choi, Ryan; Michaels, Samantha A.; Ojo, Kayode K.; Van Voorhis, Wesley C.; Joachim, Anja",Int J Parasitol Drugs Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpddr.2020.08.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211320720300257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861205/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211320720300257?v=s5,176

The aim of this study was to validate the FAAQ to the Spanish population and to analyze its psychometric properties. Method: Two studies were conducted. In the first study, the sample consisted of 224 undergraduate students who participated in the comprehension of the Spanish version and the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). The second sample consisted of 378 participants from a community sample who completed the refined version of the FAAQ and similar and dissimilar measures. Results: Study (1) The CFA was conducted, showing an inadequate fit of the model (CFI = 0.74, RMSEA = 0.18). Therefore, FAAQ was refined and it was administered to the community sample. Study (2) After an exploratory factor analysis, two factors were obtained as in the original FAAQ, Acceptance (30.92% variance explained) and Willingness (36.05%). The internal consistency was adequate for both subscales (ω = 0.88 and ω = 0.87, respectively). Correlation between the factors was r = 0.07, which provides evidence that Acceptance and Willingness are different constructs. Correlations of Acceptance with similar variables (r between −0.30 and −0.52) were stronger than the dissimilar measures (r between −0.26 and 0.24). This did not occur for the Willingness subscale, since correlations were low in all cases (r between −0.22 and 0.25).

All children between 1 month and 18 years old who were hospitalized during the period of March 11–December 31, 2020, resulting from COVID‐19 were included in the study. Patients were categorized into mild (group 1) and moderate + severe/critically (group 2) severity based on the criteria. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory variables between the two groups were compared. A total of 292 children confirmed to have COVID‐19 infection were included in the study. The most common associated diseases were obesity (5.1%) and asthma bronchiale (4.1%). We observed that disease progressed more severely in patients with underlying diseases, especially obesity and asthma bronchiale (for patients with obesity odds ratio [OR] 9.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.92–43.28, p = 0.005 and for patients with asthma bronchiale OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.04–16.80, p = 0.044). In group 2 patients, presence of lymphopenia and hypoalbuminemia, and also an elevation in serum levels of C‐reactive protein, procalcitonin, and uric acid were detected and these results were statistically significant (p values; p < 0.001, p = 0.046, p = 0.006, p = 0.045, p < 0.001, respectively). The strongest predictor of moderate‐severe COVID‐19 infections in the children was uric acid, with an odds ratio of 1.6 (95% CI 1.14–2.13, p = 0.005) and lymphocytes with an odds ratio of 0.7 (95% CI 0.55–0.88, p = 0.003). Although children are less susceptible to COVID‐19, the pre‐existing comorbid condition can predispose to severe disease. In addition, lymphopenia and high uric acid are indicators that COVID‐19 infection may progress more severely.","Kara, Aybüke A.; Böncüoğlu, Elif; Kıymet, Elif; Arıkan, Kamile Ö.; Şahinkaya, Şahika; Düzgöl, Mine; Cem, Ela; Çelebi, Mİray; Ağın, Hasan; Bayram, Süleyman N.; Özkan, Behzat; Devrim, İlker",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34314067/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.27237,176

593228,The role of T‐cell immunity in COVID‐19 severity amongst people living with type II diabetes,2021-07-31,"Summary. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be an important and growing challenge. As the response rate to FDA‐approved treatment improved over the past decade, we are facing increasing number of difficult‐to‐treat patients such as those who have failed prior anti‐viral therapy. The role of amantadine in the treatment of CHC remains unclear. Studies thus far have produced conflicting results, and type II error could not be excluded. This review summarized results published in the literature from 1997 to 2003, and reviewed the existing questions and controversies regarding the use of amantadine. Current literature suggests that amantadine is ineffective as monotherapy. Amantadine increased the sustained virologic response of certain treatment naïve patients when used in combination with interferon, and may be effective as an adjunct to interferon‐based combination therapy in some patients who have failed or relapsed on prior therapy. Factors such as small sample size, patient characteristics, and differences in treatment protocols including amantadine preparation and duration of therapy might explain the conflicting observations of various studies. Further investigations are needed to define optimal dosing and formulation of amantadine, and its appropriate role in management of CHC infection.","Lim, J. K.; Wooten, D.; Siegel, R.; Cheung, R.

593466,Ignaz Semmelweis—Handwashing Invention and COVID-19,2020-06-06,"SUMMARY: Seven conventional newborn calves were inoculated orally with the coronavirus strain LY‐138, originally recovered from naturally‐infected diarrheic calves. All calves developed diarrhea during the first 24 h after inoculation. The presence and excretion of virus was monitored by electron microscopy. Grossly, the changes were subtle and not striking. The intestinal tract was distended and contained a yellow clear fluid. The small intestinal wall was thin and transparent. Histologic changes were characterized by atrophy and fusion of the villi, decreased height and vacuolation of the intestinal epithelial cells, by a reduced number of goblet cells, crypt hypertrophy and dilatation, and by edema and increased cellularity of the lamina propria mucosae. Ultrastructurally the viral agent infected the intestinal absorptive epithelial cells, undifferentiated epithelial cells and goblet cells of the villi, and occasionally fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the lamina propria mucosae. Morphologic evidence indicated that virus multiplication occurred only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. The rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum became dilated, and electron‐dense, granulo‐fibrillar material filled their cysternae to form smooth membrane‐bounded viral factories in the supranuclear cytoplasm of infected intestinal epithelial cells. Ultrastructural cytologic changes in this viral infection consisted of dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum network, cellular ribosome depletion, extensive endoplasmic vacuolation and vesiculation of Golgi elements of intestinal epithelial cells, swelling and degeneration of mitochondria, loss of normal nuclear polarity with pyknosis and karyolysis of the nuclei, loss of cytoplasmic matrix, and a broad spectrum of pathologic changes involving the microvilli and terminal web. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Lichtmikroskopische und Ultrastrukturelle pathologische Veränderungen bei intestinaler Coronavirusinfektion neugeborener Kälber Sieben konventionelle neugeborene Kälber wurden oral mit dem Coronavirus‐Stamm LY‐138, der ursprünglich von natürlich infizierten Kälbern mit Diarrhoe stammt, infiziert. Alle Kälber entwickelten Durchfall während der ersten 24 Stunden nach Inokulation. Vorhandensein und die Ausscheidung des Virus wurden elektronenoptisch verfolgt. Sichtbare Veränderungen waren gering und wenig auffallend. Der Darmtrakt war erweitert und enthielt eine gelbe, klare Flüssigkeit. Die Dünndarmwand war dünn und durchscheinend. Histologische Veränderungen waren charakterisiert durch Atrophie und Verschmelzung der Zotten, verminderte Höhe und Vakuolisierung der intestinalen Epithelzellen, durch eine reduzierte Anzahl von Gobletzellen, Kryptenhypertrophie und ‐erweiterung, sowie Ödematisierung und erhöhte Zellularität der lamina propria mucusae. Ultrastrukturell infizierte das Virus die intestinalen absorptiven Epithelzellen, nichtdifferenzierte Epithelzellen und Gobletzellen der Zotten, und gelegentlich Fibroblasten sowie Endothelzellen der Lamina propria mucosae. Die morphologischen Veränderungen weisen darauf hin, daß die Virusvermehrung nur im Zytoplasma infizierter Zellen stattfand. Das rauhe und glatte endoplasmatische Retikulum war erweitert, und elektronendichtes, granulo‐fibrilläres Material füllte die Zisternen aus, die feine Membran‐gebundene Virusvermehrungsfabriken in dem supranukleären Zytoplasmabereich infizierter intestinaler Epithelzellen bildeten. Ultrastrukturelle zytologische Veränderungen bestanden bei dieser Virusinfektion aus Erweiterung des endoplasmatischen Retikulumnetzwerks, zellulärem Ribosomenverlust, extensiver endoplasmatischer Vakuolisierung der Golgielemente der intestinalen Epithelzellen, Schwellung und Degeneration von Mitochondrien, Verlust der normalen nukleären Polarität mit Pyknose und Karyolyse der Zellkerne, Verlust der Zytoplasmamatrix, und aus einem breiten Spektrum pathologischer Veränderungen an den Mikrozotten und der terminalen Netzstruktur. RÉSUMÉ: Lésions pathologiques ultrastructurelles et au microscope optique lors d'infection intestinale à Coronavirus chez des veaux nouveau‐nés Sept veaux nouveau‐nés conventionnels ont été infectés oralement par la souche LY‐138 de Coronavirus, isolée précédement chez des veaux naturellement infectés présentant une diarrhée. Tous les veaux développèrent une diarrhée durant les premières 24 heures suivant l'inovulation. La présence et la sécrétion du virus ont été suivies au microscope électronique. Les lésions apparentes furent faibles et peu apparentes. Le tractus digestif fut élargi et contenait un liquide jaune et clair. La paroi de l'intestin grêle était mince et transparente. Les lésions histologiques furent caractérisées par une atrophie et une fusion des villi, une hauteur diminuée et une vacuolisation des cellules épithéliales de l'intestin, par un nombre réduit des cellules caliciformes, une hypertrophie et un élargissement des cryptes ainsi qu'un oedème et un nombre de cellules augmenté de Lamina propria mucosae. Le virus a infecté ultrastructurellement les cellules épithéliales absorbantes de l'intestin, des cellules épithéliales non différenciées et des cellules caliciformes des villi, de temps en temps des fibroblastes et des cellules endothéliales de Lamina propria mucosae. Les lésions morphologiques ont montré que la multiplication du virus n'avait lieu que dans le cytoplasme des cellules infectées. Le Reticulum endoplasmique grossier et fin fut élargi et un matériel granuleux et fibrillaire remplissait les citernes qui formaient de fines régions de réplication virale liées à la membrane dans le voisinage cytoplasmique supranucléaire des cellules épithéliales infectées de l'intestin. Les lésions cytologiques ultrastructurelles lors de cette infection virale consistèrent en un élargissement du réseau endoplasmique, une perte des ribosomes cellulaires, une vacuolisation endoplasmique extensive des éléments de Golgi dans les cellules épithéliales de l'intestin, une enflure et une dégénérescence des mitochondries, une perte de la polarité nucléaire normale avec une picnose et une carylolyse des noyaux cellulaires, une perte de la matrice cytoplasmique et un large éventail de lésions pathologiques des microvilli et des tissus terminaux. RESUMEN: Modificaciones patológicas fotomicroscópicas y ultraestructurales en la infección intestinal de terneros recién nacidos por virus Corona Se infectaron por vía oral siete terneros convencionales con la estirpe de virus Corona LY‐138, la cual es originaria de terneros, infectados naturalmente, con diarrea. Todos los terneros manifestaban diarrea durante las 24 horas primeras después de la inoculación. Se seguía electrónicoópticamente la presencia y eliminación de virus. Las modificaciones visibles eran escasas y se destacaban poco. El tracto intestinal se hallaba dilatado, conteniendo un líquido amarillo claro. La pared del intestino delgado era tenue y translúcida. Las modificaciones histopatológicas se caracterizaban por atrofia y soldadura de las villosidades, altura reducida y vacuolización de las células epiteliales intestinales, por una cantidad reducida de células caliciformes, hipertrofia y ensanchamiento de las criptas, y por edematización y celularidad aumentada de la lámina propia mucosa. El virus infectaba ultraestructuralmente las células epiteliales intestinales absortivas, células epiteliales no diferenciadas y células caliciformes de las villosidades, y, en ocasiones fibroblastos y células endoteliales de la lámina propia mucosa. Las modificaciones morfológicas señalan que la multiplicación de virus solo tuvo lugar en el citoplasma de las células infectadas. El retículo endoplasmático basto y fino se hallaba dilatado y material granulosofibrilar, opaco a los electrones, ocupaba las cisternas, las cuales formaban lugares finos de replicación antiviral, ligados a las membranas en el ámbito citoplasmático supranuclear de células epiteliales intestinales infectadas. Las modificaciones citológicas ultraestructurales consistían en esta infección a virus en dilatación del retículo endoplasmático, pérdida celular de ribosomas, vacuolización endoplasmática extensiva de los elementos de Golgi de las células epiteliales intestinales, tumefacción y degeneración de mitocondrias, pérdida de la polaridad nuclear normal con picnosis y cariolisis de los núcleos celulares, pérdida de la matriz citoplasmática, y en un espectro amplio de modificaciones patológicas en las microvillosidades y tejidos terminales.","Doughri, A.

594253,Impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy trainees: an international survey,2020-06-11,"Neutralizing antibody responses of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients may be low and of short duration. We propose here that coronaviruses employ a structural strategy to avoid strong and enduring antibody responses. Other viruses induce optimal and long-lived neutralizing antibody responses, thanks to 20 or more repetitive, rigid antigenic epitopes, spaced by 5–10 nm, present on the viral surface. Such arrays of repetitive and highly organized structures are recognized by the immune system as pathogen-associated structural patterns (PASPs), which are characteristic for pathogen surfaces. In contrast, coronaviruses are large particles with long spikes (S protein) embedded in a fluid membrane. Therefore, the neutralizing epitopes (which are on the S protein) are loosely “floating” and widely spaced by an average of about 25 nm. Consequently, recruitment of complement is poor and stimulation of B cells remains suboptimal, offering an explanation for the inefficient and short-lived neutralizing antibody responses.","Bachmann, Martin F.; Mohsen, Mona O.; Zha, Lisha; Vogel, Monique; Speiser, Daniel E.",NPJ Vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-00264-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398006/,176

Neurological symptoms were associated with marked lesions of primary demyelination in the white matter of the central nervous system (CNS), and developing after an incubation time of several weeks to months. Many rats survived this infection and recovered completely from this CNS disease. Among 43 survivors of SDE, 9 rats developed a relapse 27–153 days after onset of the first attack. Neuropathological examination of these animals revealed areas of fresh demyelination together with old remyelinated lesions. Viral antigens were detectable in the neighbourhood of fresh lesions and in some cases infectious virus was re-isolated from rats revealing low antibody titers to JHM virus. These results demonstrate that mutants of JHM virus can induce a relapsing demyelinating disease process, associated with a persistent infection, which possesses some similarities to chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.","Wege, Helmut; Watanabe, Rihito; ter Meulen, Volker",Journal of Neuroimmunology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0165572884900225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6086712/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0165572884900225,176
595104,"The potential contribution of traditional, complementary and integrative treatments in acute viral respiratory tract infections: Rapid Reviews in response to the COVID-19 pandemic()",2020-10-30,"Twenty-seven strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were isolated from dead or diseased chickens at different chicken farms in South China during 2004–2008, of which the S1 gene was sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene sequences of the isolated 27 strains together with 29 strains published in Genbank revealed that all IBV strains except for one isolated and one published were clustered into six distinct genotypes I-VI. 26 isolated strains belong to genotypes I, II, and III, forming a big phylogenetic branch without new predominant strains, whereas all five vaccine strains belong to genotype V that is evolutionarily distant from genotypes I, II, and III. The study of the protease cleavage motif within the S1 protein found 12 different cleavage motifs, of which 3 motifs are shared by both isolated and published strains, 2 motifs unique to isolated strains, and 7 motifs unique to published strains, further bolstering the notion of no new predominant strains. Alignment analysis of the S1 amino acid sequences indicated that the amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions are polymorphic and diverse, showing no sign of predominant genetic changes among the isolated strains. Taken together, there was no predominant new strain circulating in South China during 2004–2008. Nonetheless, circulating IBV strains have been continuously evolving with genetic compositions distant from vaccine strains; this explains why there have been constant but infrequent outbreaks in commercial flocks in South China during 2004–2008. Furthermore, in order to safe guard against the sudden emergence of new predominant strains, continuing surveillance of IBV strains circulating in the field is of extreme importance.","Li, Linlin; Xue, Chunyi; Chen, Feng; Qin, Jianping; Xie, Qingmei; Bi, Yingzuo; Cao, Yongchang",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113509005719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022714/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.11.022; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113509005719,176
595215,Death by COVID‐19: An Open Investigation,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the occurrence of disorders of water and sodium balance in COVID-19 in our clinic. METHODS: In this retrospective chart review, patients were included if a polymerase chain test result for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained and if at least one plasma sodium concentration measurement was obtained during the period from March to June 2020. The occurrences of hyponatremia and hypernatremia were compared between 193 SARS-CoV-2-positive and 138 SARS-CoV-2-negative patients. A χ² test was used to determine statistical significance, and the corresponding p-values were calculated. RESULTS: Hypernatremia was significantly more frequently observed in COVID-19 patients, in 38% (74 of 193), versus only 8% in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (11 of 138) (p < 0.01). Hyponatremia was observed in 34% of the included COVID-19 patients (65 of 193) versus 24% of SARS-CoV-2-negative patients (33 of 138). In 12% of all COVID-19 patients (23 of 193), both hyponatremia and hypernatremia were observed at some point during their admission. Among the non-COVID-19 patients, only 4% showed these plasma sodium concentration fluctuations (5 of 138). The mortality rate among the hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 23% (45 of 193). Correcting for double-counting, more than 71% (32 of 45) of the deceased COVID-19 patients developed dysnatremia (hyponatremia, hypernatremia or both) versus 57% (84 out of 148) of the surviving COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Disorders of water and sodium balance—and especially hypernatremia—seem to be a common occurrence in COVID-19 patients.

AIM: To compare the number of patients and isolation rate of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic using the comprehensive national surveillance data. METHODS: We utilized comprehensive surveillance data, collected in the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance program, which included a total of 16.7 million samples of 5.9 million tested patients from >1,300 hospitals. We compared the number of patients and isolation rate of five bacteria between 2019 and 2020, including antimicrobial-susceptible and -resistant bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. FINDINGS: The number of patients and isolation rate of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus decreased slightly; those of S. pneumoniae and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae decreased by 60%; and those of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae increased. The isolation rate of the remaining bacteria apparently increased, although the number of patients decreased. This was due to a substantial decrease in the total number of tested patients (the denominator of the isolation rate), which was larger than that of the number of patients (the numerator of the isolation rate). Consistent results were obtained when the same data were re-aggregated using the procedure of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, demonstrating the general importance of this problem. CONCLUSION: Surveillance data during the COVID-19 pandemic must be carefully interpreted based on examination of the numerator, denominator and background factors that affect the denominator.","Hirabayashi, Aki; Kajihara, Toshiki; Yahara, Koji; Shibayama, Keigo; Sugai, Motoyuki",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670121003352; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670121003352?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34562548/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.09.011,176

Using novel surveillance data from the BioFire® Syndromic Trends (Trend) epidemiology network, we characterize the epidemiological dynamics of EV-D68 and demonstrate strong spatiotemporal association with AFM. Although the recent dominant biennial cycles of EV-D68 dynamics may not be stable, we show that a major EV-D68 epidemic, and hence an AFM outbreak, would still be possible in 2020 under normal epidemiological conditions. Significant social distancing due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could reduce the size of an EV-D68 epidemic in 2020, illustrating the potential broader epidemiological impact of the pandemic.","Park, Sang Woo; Farrar, Jeremy; Messacar, Kevin; Meyers, Lindsay; Pons-Salort, Margarita; Grenfell, Bryan T.",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766605/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.23.20069468v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.23.20069468,176
597406,Using Brain-Breaks(®) as a Technology Tool to Increase Attitude towards Physical Activity among Students in Singapore,2021-06-14,"OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic challenges during the corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced the radiology regulating body to adopt the use of CT Chest as a triage and diagnostic tool, which was subsequently abandoned. The Royal Wolverhampton hospital followed both protocols. Here, we investigate the evidence behind this decision within the context of surgical admissions during the COVID-19 peak in our hospital. METHODS: Retrospective data collection and analysis of all surgical admissions between the 1st of March to the 31st of May. Data were collected from the radiology and electronic portal looking into patients undergoing CT chest to diagnose the presence of COVID-19 as well as swab results. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The scan either confirmed the presence or absence (4, 63 patients) of COVID-19 but was sometimes inconclusive (11 patients). Comparing these to the results of the swabs; CT showed sensitivity 42.86%, Specificity 97.92%, and accuracy 90.91%. In the inconclusive CT report group, chances of having a positive swab result were 45%: None of the scan results changed any of the surgical planning. Lymphocyte count in the context of surgical presentation did not have any statistical significance to predict the presence of COVID-19 (P = .7). Cost implications on our cohort of patients for adding the chest CT is estimated to be around £31 000. CONCLUSION: CT Thorax during the pandemic was a good negative predictor but had limited diagnostic value and did not change patient management. Newer, faster techniques of PCR swabs and antibody testing would be a better and cheaper alternative.","Ismail, Ahmed; Sarkar, Priya; Muthiah, Balasundaram; Yassin, Nuha",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14774; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34510648/,176

However, the mechanism underlying this association is still unexplored. Here, we show that the L412F polymorphism in TLR3 is a marker of severity in COVID-19. This association increases in the sub-cohort of males. Impaired autophagy and reduced TNF production was demonstrated in HEK293 cells transfected with TLR3-L412F plasmid and stimulated with specific agonist poly(I:C). A statistically significant reduced survival at 28 days was shown in L412F COVID-19 patients treated with the autophagy-inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (P=0.038). An increased frequency of autoimmune disorders as co-morbidity was found in L412F COVID-19 males with specific class II HLA haplotypes prone to autoantigen presentation. Our analyses indicate that L412F polymorphism makes males at risk of severe COVID-19 and provides a rationale for reinterpreting clinical trials considering autophagy pathways.","Croci, S.; Venneri, M.

597920,Urological surgery in the COVID-19 era: Patient counselling and informed consent,2020-05-25,"INTRODUCTION: The diaphragm is the main muscle of inspiration, and its dysfunction contributes to adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. We recently reported the infiltration of SARS-CoV-2, and the development of fibrosis, in the diaphragm of critically ill patients with COVID-19. In the current study, we aimed to characterise myofiber structure in the diaphragm of critically ill patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Diaphragm muscle specimens were collected during autopsy from patients who died of COVID-19 in three academic medical centres in the Netherlands in April and May 2020 (n=27). We studied diaphragm myofiber gene expression and structure and compared the findings obtained to those of deceased critically ill patients without COVID-19 (n=10). RESULTS: Myofibers of critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed on average larger cross-sectional area (slow-twitch myofibers: 2441±229 vs 1571±309 µm(2); fast-twitch myofibers: 1966±209 vs 1225±222 µm(2)). Four critically ill patients with COVID-19 showed extremely large myofibers, which were splitting and contained many centralised nuclei. RNA-sequencing data revealed differentially expressed genes involved in muscle regeneration. CONCLUSION: Diaphragm of critically ill patients with COVID-19 has distinct myopathic features compared with critically ill patients without COVID-19, which may contribute to the ongoing dyspnoea and fatigue in the patients surviving COVID-19 infection.","Shi, Zhonghua; Bogaards, Sylvia J P; Conijn, Stefan; Onderwater, Yeszamin; Espinosa, Pedro; Bink, Diewertje I; van den Berg, Marloes; van de Locht, Martijn; Bugiani, Marianna; van der Hoeven, Hans; Boon, Reinier A; Heunks, Leo; Ottenheijm, Coen A C",BMJ Open Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34544735/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-001052,176

The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. METHODS: We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff ≥3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff ≥3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. RESULTS: Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent ≥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending ≥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. CONCLUSIONS: The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","Ni, Michael Y; Yang, Lin; Leung, Candi M C; Li, Na; Yao, Xiaoxin I; Wang, Yishan; Leung, Gabriel M; Cowling, Benjamin J; Liao, Qiuyan",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365044/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19009,176

Indeed, there is no clinical trial evidence that a dietary or pharmacological supplementation of any particular substance will increase the effectiveness of the immune defences. There are however three nutritional issues that deserve special attention under the present circumstances, namely vitamin D deficiency, excess salt intake and inappropriate alcohol consumption. Here is a short review of the current knowledge about the possible role of these factors in the immunity defence system and their potential impact on the modulation of the immune response to SARS-COV2 infection. Data synthesis For all of these factors there is convincing evidence of an impact on the immune defence structure and function. In the absence of RCT demonstration that increased ingestion of any given substance may confer protection against the new enemy, special attention to correction of these three nutritional criticisms is certainly warranted at the time of COVID pandemic. Conclusions We propose that the inappropriate intake of salt and alcohol and the risk of inadequate vitamin D status should be object of screening, in particular in subjects at high mortality risk from SARS-COV 2 infection, such as institutionalised elderly subjects and all those affected by predisposing conditions.","Idelson, Paola Iaccarino; Rendina, Domenico; Strazzullo, Pasquale",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939475320305093?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.12.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0939475320305093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33549427/,176

We systematically selected (i.e. every 100th individual in the central Dubai COVID‐19 database) 256 patients by age, sex, disease severity and month to provide a representative sample of laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 patients (nasopharyngeal swab PCR positive) during the first wave of the UAE outbreak (January to June 2020). Sociodemographic and clinical data were extracted from medical records and full SARS‐CoV‐2 genome sequences extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed. Older age was significantly associated with COVID‐19‐associated hospital admission and mortality. Overweight/obese or diabetic patients were 3–4 times more likely to be admitted to hospital and intensive care unit (ICU). Sequencing data showed multiple independent viral introductions into the UAE from Europe, Iran and Asia (29 January–18 March), and these early strains seeded significant clustering consistent with almost exclusive community‐based transmission between April and June 2020. Majority of sequenced strains (N = 60, 52%) were from the European cluster consistent with the higher infectivity rates associated with the D614G mutation carried by most strains in this cluster. A total of 986 mutations were identified in 115 genomes, 272 were unique (majority were missense, n = 134) and 20/272 mutations were novel. A missense (Q271R) and synonymous (R41R) mutation in the S and N proteins, respectively, were identified in 2/27 patients with severe COVID‐19 but not in patients with mild or moderate disease (0/86; p = .05, Fisher's Exact Test). Both patients were women (51–64 years) with no significant underlying health conditions. The same two mutations were identified in a healthy 37‐year‐old Indian man who was hospitalized in India due to COVID‐19. Our findings provide evidence for continued community‐based transmission of the European strains in the Dubai population and highlight new mutations that might be associated with severe disease in otherwise healthy adults.","Loney, Tom; Khansaheb, Hamda; Ramaswamy, Sathishkumar; Harilal, Divinlal; Deesi, Zulfa Omar; Varghese, Rupa Murthy; Belal Al Ali, Aydah; Khadeeja, Anees; Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Alkhajeh, Abdulmajeed; Mohamed AlDabal, Laila; Uddin, Mohammed; Al Faresi, Mubarak; Joshi, Madhvi; Senok, Abiola; Nowotny, Norbert; Alsheikh‐Ali, Alawi; Abou Tayoun, Ahmad",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.14004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506644/,176

598770,Challenges in Heart Transplantation in the Era of COVID-19,2020-04-21,"BACKGROUND: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are at higher risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). No study has evaluated the relationship between VAP and mortality in this population, or compared this relationship between SARS-CoV-2 patients and other populations. The main objective of our study was to determine the relationship between VAP and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: Planned ancillary analysis of a multicenter retrospective European cohort. VAP was diagnosed using clinical, radiological and quantitative microbiological criteria. Univariable and multivariable marginal Cox’s regression models, with cause-specific hazard for duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, were used to compare outcomes between study groups. Extubation, and ICU discharge alive were considered as events of interest, and mortality as competing event. FINDINGS: Of 1576 included patients, 568 were SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 482 influenza pneumonia, and 526 no evidence of viral infection at ICU admission. VAP was associated with significantly higher risk for 28-day mortality in SARS-CoV-2 (adjusted HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.16–2.47), p = 0.006), and influenza groups (1.75 (1.03–3.02), p = 0.045), but not in the no viral infection group (1.07 (0.64–1.78), p = 0.79). VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation in the SARS-CoV-2 group, but not in the influenza or no viral infection groups. VAP was associated with significantly longer duration of ICU stay in the 3 study groups. No significant difference was found in heterogeneity of outcomes related to VAP between the 3 groups, suggesting that the impact of VAP on mortality was not different between study groups. INTERPRETATION: VAP was associated with significantly increased 28-day mortality rate in SARS-CoV-2 patients. However, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, as compared to influenza pneumonia or no viral infection, did not significantly modify the relationship between VAP and 28-day mortality.

Despite media attention and political concern with this risk, study findings hitherto have been mixed. Voluntary self-exclusion from gambling was introduced on a national level in Sweden as a harm reduction tool in 2019, and this self-exclusion service in Sweden is a rare example of such an official, nationwide, multi-operator system. The present study aimed to evaluate whether short-term self-exclusion patterns were affected by different phases of COVID-19-related impacts on gambling markets in 2020. During the lock-down of sports in the spring months of 2020, three-month self-exclusion was unaffected, and one-month self-exclusion appeared to increase, though not more than in a recent period prior to COVID-19. Despite large differences in sports betting practices between women and men, self-exclusion patterns during COVID-19 were not apparently gender-specific. Altogether, self-exclusion from gambling, to date, does not appear to be affected by COVID-19-related changes in society, in contrast with beliefs about such changes producing greater help-seeking behavior in gamblers. Limitations are discussed, including the fact that in a recently introduced system, seasonality aspects and the autocorrelated nature of the data made substantial statistical measures unfeasible.","Håkansson, Anders; Widinghoff, Carolina; Berge, Jonas",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299817/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147367,176

There is limited available knowledge regarding the natural history of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other factors that are also making this infection spread like a pandemic include global travelers, lack of proven treatment, asymptomatic carriers, potential reinfection, underprepared global health care systems, and lack of public awareness and efforts to prevent further spread. It is understood that certain preexisting medical conditions increase the risk of mortality with COVID-19; however, the outcome of this disease in traditionally vulnerable chronic illnesses such as end-stage renal disease is not well documented.

Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective tool in the screening of COVID‐19. It is of great importance to rapidly and accurately segment COVID‐19 from CT to help diagnostic and patient monitoring. In this paper, we propose a U‐Net based segmentation network using attention mechanism. As not all the features extracted from the encoders are useful for segmentation, we propose to incorporate an attention mechanism including a spatial attention module and a channel attention module, to a U‐Net architecture to re‐weight the feature representation spatially and channel‐wise to capture rich contextual relationships for better feature representation. In addition, the focal Tversky loss is introduced to deal with small lesion segmentation. The experiment results, evaluated on a COVID‐19 CT segmentation dataset where 473 CT slices are available, demonstrate the proposed method can achieve an accurate and rapid segmentation result on COVID‐19. The method takes only 0.29 second to segment a single CT slice.

Past research has not focused on split preparation use and patient perception within OA. We aim to identify differences in bowel preparation (BP) adequacy, adenoma detection rate (ADR), self‐reported compliance, and patient perception between OA and GI providers using split prep. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study using split BP for colonoscopies. Patients completed a survey, and demographics, BP adequacy, and ADR were recorded. BP compliance was self‐reported. Patients were asked three questions qualifying the BP instructions. Data were analyzed using chi square and Mann–Whitney tests by SPSS. RESULTS: BP adequacy was reported for 56 of 60 patients. Twenty‐one participants (38%) were scheduled on OA, and 35 participants (62%) were scheduled after a GI office visit. Adequate BP was more frequent in 86% (18/21) of OA patients compared to 60% (21/35) in the GI group (P = 0.043). OA patients reported better review and explanation of the BP instructions compared to GI patients. There was no statistical difference between the demographics of the OA and GI groups or self‐reported compliance and patient understanding of instructions. CONCLUSION: OA scheduled colonoscopies were associated with more adequate BP. This could be explained by patients' self‐motivation or an explanation of the importance of completing BP. This study supports the use of OA procedures as a standard of care.","Manem, Nihita; Donovan, Katherine; Miller, David; Yodice, Michael; Wang, Katie; Balogun, Khadijat; Kabbach, Ghassan; Feustel, Paul; Tadros, Micheal",JGH Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013055/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jgh3.12532,176

However, a low mortality rate has been reported in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Preclinical evidence suggests that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may have a protective role against severe COVID‐19. METHODS: We conducted a cross‐sectional study of 564 consecutive patients with CML who were tested for anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG/IgM antibodies at their first outpatient visit between May and early November 2020 in five hematologic centers representative of three Italian regions. RESULTS: The estimated serological prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with CML after the first pandemic wave was similar to that in the general population (about 2%), both at national and regional levels. CML patients with positive anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 serology were more frequently male (p = 0.027) and active workers (p = 0.012), while there was no significant association with TKI treatment type. Only 3 out of 11 IgG‐positive patients had previously received a molecular diagnosis of COVID‐19, while the remainders were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the course of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in patients with CML is generally mild and reassure about the safety of continuing TKIs during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Furthermore, we suggest that patients with CML succeed to mount an antibody response after exposure to SARS‐CoV‐2, similar to the general population.","Bonifacio, Massimiliano; Tiribelli, Mario; Miggiano, Maria Cristina; Abruzzese, Elisabetta; Binotto, Gianni; Scaffidi, Luigi; Cordioli, Maddalena; Damiani, Daniela; Di Bona, Eros; Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika; Tanasi, Ilaria; Dubbini, Maria Vittoria; Velotta, Vanessa; Ceccarelli, Giulia; Pierdomenico, Elisabetta; Lo Schirico, Mariella; Semenzato, Gianpietro; Ruggeri, Marco; Fanin, Renato; Tacconelli, Evelina; Pizzolo, Giovanni; Krampera, Mauro",Cancer Med,https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464516/,176

Non-structural proteins (NSPs) and non-coding elements (NCEs) of FMDV play a critical role in these biological processes. The FMDV virion consists of capsid and nucleic acid. The virus genome is a positive single stranded RNA and encodes a single long open reading frame (ORF) flanked by a long structured 5ʹ-untranslated region (5ʹ-UTR) and a short 3ʹ-UTR. The ORF is translated into a polypeptide chain and processed into four structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4), 10 NSPs (L(pro), 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B(1–3), 3C(pro), and 3D(pol)), and some cleavage intermediates. In the past decade, an increasing number of studies have begun to focus on the molecular pathogenesis of FMDV NSPs and NCEs.

As more individuals are vaccinated, the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms needs to be evaluated. METHODS: The ability of 4 commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology platforms to detect previous infection or vaccination were evaluated using a cohort of 53 patients who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, 89 SARS-CoV-2-vaccinated healthcare workers (Pfizer or Moderna), and 127 patients who were SARS-CoV-2 negative. Serology results were compared to a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (PSV) neutralizing antibodies assay. RESULTS: The Roche S-(spike) antibody and Diazyme neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) assays detected adaptive immune response in 100.0% and 90.1% of vaccinated individuals who received 2 doses of vaccine (initial and booster), respectively. The Roche N-(nucleocapsid) antibody assay and Diazyme IgG assay did not detect adaptive immune response in vaccinated individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay correlated with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 median infective dose (ID(50)) neutralization titers (R(2) = 0.70), while correlation of the Roche S-antibody assay was weaker (R(2) = 0.39). Median PSV SARS-CoV-2 ID(50) titers more than doubled in vaccinated individuals who received 2 doses of the Moderna vaccine (ID(50), 597) compared to individuals who received a single dose (ID(50), 284). CONCLUSIONS: The Roche S-antibody and Diazyme NAbs assays robustly detected adaptive immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. The Diazyme NAbs assay strongly correlates with the PSV SARS-CoV-2 NAbs in vaccinated individuals.

Sex hormones, estrogen, and testosterone, seem to play a major role in its pathogenesis, development, spread, severity, and mortalities. Examination of factors such as age, gender, ethnic background, genetic prevalence, and existing co-morbidities, may disclose the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity, and mortality, paving the way for COVID-19 amelioration and substantial flattening of the infection curve. In this mini-review, we focus on the role of testosterone through a discussion of the intricate mechanisms of disease development and deterioration. Accumulated evidence suggests that there are links between high level (normal male level) as well as low level (age-related hypogonadism) testosterone in disease progression and expansion, supporting its role as a double-edged sword.

This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. Methods: Using publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu), Results: Following adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate. Conclusion BCG vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if BCG is protective against severe Covid-19 infection.","Gallagher, J.; Watson, C.; Ledwidge, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121624; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.03.20121624v1?rss=1,176
602045,Estimating the impact of mobility patterns on COVID-19 infection rates in 11 European countries,2020-09-15,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has resulted in many deaths, particularly of very old or obese people. These people are at risk to die in the event of an outbreak, like under one-year old babies were at risk to die one century ago from various diseases. It is argued that mild stress could help people to resist new outbreaks. The people who are obese because of bad feeding habits (snacking, junk food, overfeeding) and inactivity should adopt more healthy behaviours. Because an inactive way of life at old age can increase frailty, physical and mental activities should be kept at the highest possible level in elderly people, particularly if they live in retirement homes. In the event of an outbreak, management staff of these homes should not confine residents in their room for weeks or months, as it can increase inactivity, under-nutrition, sarcopenia, and depressive symptoms. People with or without co-morbidities should be active and one could wonder whether other mild stresses such as sauna bathing could help to better resist infection.","Le Bourg, Eric",Biogerontology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10522-021-09930-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273015/,176

To improve the device, we conducted a clinical trial of total gastrointestinal capsule endoscopy in healthy subjects to ascertain whether our first-generation, self-propelled capsule endoscope was safe and effective for observing the entire human gastrointestinal tract. Patients and methods After adequate gastrointestinal pretreatment, five healthy subjects were instructed to swallow a self-propelling capsule endoscope and the safety of a complete gastrointestinal capsule endoscopy with this device was assessed. We also investigated basic problems associated with complete gastrointestinal capsule endoscopy. Results No adverse effects of the magnetic field were identified in any of the subjects. No mucosal damage was noted in any of the subjects with the use of our first-generation, self-propelling capsule endoscope. We found that it took longer than expected to observe the stomach; the view was compromised by the swallowed saliva. The pylorus was extremely difficult to navigate, and the endoscope’s fin sometimes got caught in the folds of the small intestine and colon. Conclusions To resolve the problems associated with the existing self-propelling capsule endoscope, it may be necessary to not only improve the capsule endoscopes, but also to control the environment within the gastrointestinal tract with medications and other means. Our results could guide other researchers in developing capsule endoscopes controllable from outside the body, thus allowing real-time observation.","Ota, Kazuhiro; Kojima, Yuichi; Kakimoto, Kazuki; Nouda, Sadaharu; Takeuchi, Toshihisa; Shindo, Yasunori; Ohtsuka, Yoshitake; Ohtsuka, Naotake; Higuchi, Kazuhide",Endosc Int Open,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1507-4540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466364/,176

The fast development of vaccines against COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the course of the pandemic. Methods: Global data from Google Trends was analyzed for vaccines against flu, BCG, HPV, pneumococcal disease, polio, and COVID-19. The time frame includes the last five-year period starting from 17 April 2016. Multiple training of time series models with back testing, including Holt–Winters forecasting, Exponential Smoothing State Space, Linear model with trend and seasonal components (tlsm), and ARIMA was conducted. Forecasting according to the best fitting model was performed. Results: Correlation analysis did not reveal a decrease in interest in vaccines during the analyzed period. The prediction models provided a short-term forecast of the dynamics of interest for flu, HPV, pneumococcal and polio vaccines with 5–10% growth in interest for the first quarter of 2022 when compared to the same quarter of 2021. Conclusions: Despite the huge interest in the COVID-19 vaccine, there has not been a detectable decline in the overall interest in the five analyzed vaccines.","Sycinska-Dziarnowska, Magdalena; Paradowska-Stankiewicz, Iwona; Woźniak, Krzysztof",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360134/,176
604206,The Kids Are Not Alright: A Preliminary Report of Post-COVID Syndrome in University Students,2020-11-29,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at elevated risk for psychiatric problems in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic. This risk is due to their high rates of pre‐pandemic psychiatric comorbidities and the pandemic's disruption to routines and access to necessary supports. Prior research has indicated that children with ASD may experience a worsening of specific psychiatric symptoms in response to COVID‐19, though this body of work is limited in scope. The present study expands this literature by examining specific types of psychiatric problems that emerged about 2 months after the onset of the pandemic, and risk factors predicting changes in these psychiatric symptoms. Parents of children with a confirmed ASD diagnosis (N = 257), who enrolled in a clinic registry at an outpatient specialty autism center, were included in this study. All data were gathered online via customized and standardized questionnaires. Results showed that 59% of children experienced either a worsening of their pre‐pandemic psychiatric diagnoses and/or the development of new psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic. Multivariable regression models indicated that risk factors for increased psychiatric problems included child understanding of COVID‐19, COVID‐19 illness in the family, low family income, and elevated parental depression and anxiety symptoms (all p < 0.05). Findings from this study emphasize the urgent need to provide effective and accessible psychiatric services for children with ASD and their families during and after the pandemic. LAY SUMMARY: Children with ASD are at high risk for psychiatric problems during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We found that 59% of children in our clinical sample are experiencing increased psychiatric problems. The child's understanding of COVID‐19, COVID‐19 illness in the family, low family income, and depression and anxiety symptoms in the parent increase the risk for poor mental health during the pandemic. These findings indicate the importance of helping children with ASD access mental health treatment during COVID‐19.","Vasa, Roma A.; Singh, Vini; Holingue, Calliope; Kalb, Luther G.; Jang, Yeon; Keefer, Amy",Autism Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231323/,176
604503,Perils of human remains examination in COVID-19 times,2020-12-13,"BACKGROUND: An epidemic of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by a new coronavirus has spread from the Guangdong province to the rest of China and to the world, with a puzzling contagion behavior. It is important both for predicting the future of the present outbreak and for implementing effective prophylactic measures, to identify the causes of this behavior. RESULTS: In this report, we show first that the standard Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model cannot account for the patterns observed in various regions where the disease spread. We develop a model involving two superimposed epidemics to study the recent spread of the SARS in Hong Kong and in the region. We explore the situation where these epidemics may be caused either by a virus and one or several mutants that changed its tropism, or by two unrelated viruses. This has important consequences for the future: the innocuous epidemic might still be there and generate, from time to time, variants that would have properties similar to those of SARS. CONCLUSION: We find that, in order to reconcile the existing data and the spread of the disease, it is convenient to suggest that a first milder outbreak protected against the SARS. Regions that had not seen the first epidemic, or that were affected simultaneously with the SARS suffered much more, with a very high percentage of persons affected. We also find regions where the data appear to be inconsistent, suggesting that they are incomplete or do not reflect an appropriate identification of SARS patients. Finally, we could, within the framework of the model, fix limits to the future development of the epidemic, allowing us to identify landmarks that may be useful to set up a monitoring system to follow the evolution of the epidemic. The model also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.","Ng, Tuen Wai; Turinici, Gabriel; Danchin, Antoine",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12964944/,176
605727,Use of biologics in the era of COVID-19: Where do we stand?,2020-12-01,"The limited time indorsed to face the COVID-19 emergency and large number of deaths across the globe, poses an unrelenting challenge to find apt therapeutic approaches. However, lead candidate selection to phase III trials of new chemical entity is a time-consuming procedure, and not feasible in pandemic, such as the one we are facing. Drug repositioning, an exploration of existing drug for new therapeutic use, could be an effective alternative as it allows fast-track estimation in phase II-III trials, or even forthright compassionate use. Although, drugs repurposed for COVID-19 pandemic are commercially available, yet the evaluation of their safety and efficacy is tiresome and painstaking. In absence of any specific treatment the easy alternatives such as over the counter products, phytotherapies and home remedies have been largely adopted for prophylaxis and therapy as well. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that several pharmaceutical excipients possess antiviral properties making them prospective candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the mechanism of action of various antiviral excipients and their propensity to act against SARs-CoV2. Though, repurposing of pharmaceutical excipients against COVID-19 has the edge over therapeutic agents in terms of safety, cost and fast-track approval trial burdened, this hypothesis needs to be experimentally verified for COVID-19 patients.","Malani, Manisha; Salunke, Prerana; Kulkarni, Shraddha; Jain, Gaurav K; Sheikh, Afsana; Kesharwani, Prashant; Nirmal, Jayabalan",J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,https://doi.org/10.1080/09205063.2021.1975020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464232/,176

In conventional setups, the classification of the trapped specimen is usually achieved through the acquired image, the scattered signal, or additional information such as Raman spectroscopy. In this work, we propose a solution that uses the temporal data signal from the scattering process of the trapping laser, acquired with a quadrant photodetector. Our methodology rests on a pre-processing strategy that combines Fourier transform and principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the data and perform relevant feature extraction. Testing a wide range of standard machine learning algorithms, it is shown that this methodology allows achieving accuracy performances around 90%, validating the concept of using the temporal dynamics of the scattering signal for the classification task. Achieved with 500 millisecond signals and leveraging on methods of low computational footprint, the results presented pave the way for the deployment of alternative and faster classification methodologies in optical trapping technologies.","Carvalho, Inês Alves; Silva, Nuno Azevedo; Rosa, Carla C; Coelho, Luís C C; Jorge, Pedro A S",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577401/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186181,176
606363,Smooth or Risky Revisit of an Old Malaria Drug for COVID-19?,2020-05-15,"Abstract This study numerically investigates the effect of hygroscopicity on transport and deposition of particles in severe asthmatic lungs with distinct airway structures. The study human subjects were selected from two imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters with one characterized by non-constricted airways and the other by constricted airways in the lower left lobe (LLL). We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1–8 μm) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer. On average, the deposition fraction increased by about 6% due to hygroscopic particle growth in the cluster subjects with constricted airways, while it increased by only about 0.5% in those with non-constricted airways. The effect of particle growth was most significant for particles with an initial diameter of 2 μm in the cluster subjects with constricted airways. The effect diminished with increasing particle size, especially for particles with an initial diameter larger than 4 μm. This suggests the necessity to differentiate asthmatic subjects by cluster in engineering the aerosol size for tailored treatment. Specifically, the treatment of severe asthmatic subjects who have constricted airways with inhalation aerosols may need submicron-sized hygroscopic particles to compensate for particle growth, if one targets for delivering to the peripheral region. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.","Rajaraman, Prathish K.; Choi, Jiwoong; Hoffman, Eric A.; O'Shaughnessy, Patrick T.; Choi, Sanghun; Delvadia, Renishkumar; Babiskin, Andrew; Walenga, Ross; Lin, Ching-Long",J Aerosol Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850220300707; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220300707?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346183/,176

It is unclear if these markers are associated with severe infection in patients with cancer due to underlying tumor related inflammation. We sought to further understand the inflammatory response related to COVID-19 infection in patients with gynecologic cancer. Methods: Patients with a history of gynecologic cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 infection with available laboratory data were identified. Admission laboratory values and clinical outcomes were abstracted from electronic medical records. Severe infection was defined as infection requiring ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or resulting in death. Results: 86 patients with gynecologic cancer were hospitalized with COVID-19 infection with a median age of 68.5 years (interquartile range (IQR), 59.0–74.8). Of the 86 patients, 29 (33.7%) patients required ICU admission and 25 (29.1%) patients died of COVID-19 complications. Fifty (58.1%) patients had active cancer and 36 (41.9%) were in remission. Patients with severe infection had significantly higher ferritin (median 1163.0 vs 624.0 ng/mL, p < 0.01), procalcitonin (median 0.8 vs 0.2 ng/mL, p < 0.01), and C-reactive protein (median 142.0 vs 62.3 mg/L, p = 0.02) levels compared to those with moderate infection. White blood cell count, lactate, and creatinine were also associated with severe infection. D-dimer levels were not significantly associated with severe infection (p = 0.20).

608257,Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) & COVID-19: Clinical Experience from the US Epicenter of the Pandemic,2020-11-05,"The novel corona (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a global pandemic, which motivates researchers to develop reliable and effective methods for screening and detection of SARS-CoV-2. Though there are several methods available for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 such as RT-PCR and ELSIA, nevertheless, these methods are time-consuming and may not apply at the point of care. In this study, we have developed a specific, sensitive, quantitative and fast detection method for SARS-CoV-2 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The total extracellular protease proteolytic activity from the virus has been used as the biomarker. The specific peptide sequences from the library of 115 dipeptides were identified via changes in the fluorescence signal. The fluorogenic dipeptide substrates have the fluorophore and a quencher at the N- and the C- terminals, respectively. When the protease hydrolyzes the peptide bond between the two specific amino acids, it leads to a significant increase in the fluorescence signals. The specific fluorogenic peptide (H-d) produces a high fluorescence signal. A calibration plot was obtained from the changes in the fluorescence intensity against the different concentrations of the viral protease. The lowest limit of detection of this method was 9.7 ± 3 pfu/mL. The cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide was tested against the MERS-CoV which does not affect the fluorescence signal. A significant change in the fluorescence signal with patient samples indicates that this FRET-based assay might be applied for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 patients.

METHODS: In order to analyze clinical features and laboratory findings in infants with pertussis hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms during a seasonal RSV outbreak, we conducted a retrospective single-center study on 19 infants with pertussis (6 boys; median age 72 days) and 19 matched controls (RSV-bronchiolitis), hospitalized from October 2008 to April 2010. B. pertussis and RSV were detected from nasopharyngeal washes with Real Time-PCR. RESULTS: Infants with pertussis were less often breastfeed than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (63.2% vs 89.5%; p <0.06). Clinically, significantly fewer infants with pertussis than controls had more episodes of whooping cough (63.2% vs 0.0%; p < 0.001) and also less frequently fever at admission (15.8% vs 68.4%; p <0.01), apnea (52.6% vs 10.5%; p <0.006), and cyanosis (52.6% vs 10.5%; p < 0.006). Infants with pertussis had more often no abnormal chest sounds on auscultation than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (0% vs 42,1%; p < 0.005). The absolute blood lymphocyte and eosinophil counts were higher in infants with B. pertussis than in controls with bronchiolitis (23886 ± 16945 vs 10725 ± 4126 cells/mm(3), p < 0.0001 and 13.653 ± 10.430 vs 4.730 ± 2.400 cells/mm(3), p < 0.001). The molecular analysis of 2 B. pertussis isolates for ptxA1, ptxP3, and prn2 genes showed the presence of gene variants. CONCLUSIONS: When infants are hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, physicians should suspect a pertussis infection, seek for specific clinical symptoms, investigate lymphocyte and eosinophil counts and thus diagnose infection early enough to allow treatment.","Nicolai, Ambra; Nenna, Raffaella; Stefanelli, Paola; Carannante, Anna; Schiavariello, Concetta; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Scagnolari, Carolina; Moretti, Corrado; Papoff, Paola; Bonci, Enea; Ferrara, Marianna; Papasso, Stefano; Midulla, Fabio",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2334-13-526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24209790/,176

610750,Predictors of fatality including radiographic findings in adults with COVID-19,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic led to a complete renewal of clinical activities of Italian hospitals. During the lockdown, all hospitals in Italy had to suspend non-urgent clinical activities. The prolonged suspension of elective activities could have caused a series of problems. METHODS: A new ad hoc protocol was designed. Single-day fast-imaging protocol with regadenoson-stress 99mTc-tetrofosmin imaging was preferred. Patients were contacted by phone 4 days before the test and answered to a questionnaire which will be repeated on the day of the exam. Body temperature <37.5 degrees C and no Covid-19 symptoms were necessary to enter the unit. Patients wore surgical mask and gloves. Social distancing was maintained throughout the examination. Healthcare professionals wore a personal protective equipment. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients were studied from April 7 to May 15, 2020, before the publication of the recommendations from ASNC and SNMMI. None of the patients experienced complications. Follow-up of patients discharged was carried by phone. No Covid-19 infection symptoms were reported. On May 18, 2020 all the healthcare providers of nuclear cardiology department underwent serological testing IgG and IgM and none were positive. CONCLUSION: Strict ad hoc hygiene protocol for Covid-19 pandemic avoids diagnostic-therapeutic delay and lengthening of waiting lists. Our experience confirms that pursuing WHO recommendations and recent indication of ASNC and SNMMI is safe for both health providers and patients. Moreover, the incidence of significant inducible ischemia rises when correct stratification of patients is performed.

611689,“Cultivating” acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccination program: Lessons from Italy,2020-11-10,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on its own, as well as its risk factors, have been found to be associated with the outcome of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the association between the degree of OSA and COVID-19 severity is unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate whether or not parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and the type of OSA treatment are associated with COVID-19 severity. Patient data from OSA patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were reviewed from outpatients from the Isala Hospital and patients admitted to the Isala Hospital, starting from March until December 2020. Baseline patient data, sleep study parameters, OSA treatment information and hospital admission data were collected. Apnea hypopnea index (AHI), low oxyhemoglobin desaturation (LSAT), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), respiratory disturbance index (RDI), and the type of OSA treatment were regarded as the independent variables. COVID-19 severity–based on hospital or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation days–were regarded as the outcome variables. Multinomial regression analysis, binary logistic regression analysis, and zero-inflated negative binomial regression analysis were used to assess the association between the parameters to clinically evaluate OSA severity and COVID-19 severity. A total of 137 patients were included. Only LSAT was found to be significantly associated with the COVID-19 severity (p<0.05) when COVID-19 severity was dichotomized as non-hospitalized or hospitalized and ICU admission or death. Therefore, our findings showed that LSAT seems to be a significant risk factor for COVID-19 severity. However, the degree of OSA–based on AHI, ODI, and RDI–and OSA treatment were not found to be risk factors for COVID-19 severity when looking at hospital or ICU admission, the number of days of hospitalization, and number of intubation and mechanical ventilation days.","Ho, J.

Pediatric population has been less studied than adult population and prompt diagnosis is challenging due to asymptomatic or mild episodes. Radiology is an important complement to clinical and epidemiological features. OBJECTIVE: To establish the most common CXR patterns in children with COVID-19, evaluate interobserver correlation and to discuss the role of imaging techniques in the management of children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients between 0 and 16 years of age with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection and CXR were selected. Two paediatric radiologists independently evaluated the images and assessed the type of abnormality, distribution and evolution when available. RESULTS: Median age was 79.8 months (ranging from 2 weeks to 16 years of age). Fever was the most common symptom (43.5%). 90% of CXR showed abnormalities. Peribronchial cuffing was the most common finding (86.3%) followed by GGOs (50%). In both cases central distribution was more common than peripheral. Consolidations accounted for 18.1%. Normal CXR, pleural effusion, and altered cardiomediastinal contour were the least common. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of CXR showed abnormalities in children with COVID-19. However, findings are nonspecific. Interobserver correlation was good in describing consolidations, normal x-rays and GGOs. Imaging techniques have a role in the management of children with known or suspected COVID-19, especially in those with moderate or severe symptoms or with underlying risk factors.","Oterino Serrano, C; Alonso, E; Andrés, M; Buitrago, NM; Pérez Vigara, A; Parrón Pajares, M; Cuesta López, E; Garzón Moll, G; Martin Espin, I; Bueno Barriocanal, M; De Ceano-Vivas la Calle, M; Calvo Rey, C; Bret-Zurita, M",Eur J Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2020.109236; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0720048X20304253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932176/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0720048X20304253?v=s5,176

Lung ultrasound of patients was performed in ten zones of the chest walls. The features of the ultrasound images were observed, and a lung ultrasound score (LUS) was recorded. The ultrasound features and scores were compared between the refractory group (PaO2/FiO2≤100 mmHG or on ECMO) and the nonrefractory group. The prediction value of the LUS was studied by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. In total, 7 patients were enrolled in the refractory group and 28 in the nonrefractory group. B-line patterns and shred signs were the most common signs in all patients. Patients in the refractory group had significantly more ground-glass signs (median 6 [interquartile range (IQR), 2.5-6.5] vs median 0 [IQR, 0-3]), consolidation signs (median 1 [IQR, 1-1.5] vs median 0 [IQR, 0-3]) and pleural effusions (median 5 [IQR, 1.5-6] vs median 0 [IQR, 0-0.25]).

611920,Resuming arthroplasty: A well aligned and a balanced approach in the COVID-19 era,2020-06-17,"BACKGROUND: The rapid emergence and the high disease burden of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have created a medical need for readily available drugs that can decrease viral replication or blunt the hyperinflammatory state leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, known for its immunomodulatory properties. It has shown antiviral effect specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. METHODS: DAWn-AZITHRO is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID wards are eligible for study inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e., clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 h through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physician’s discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. The primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. DISCUSSION: The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN consortium will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.

612035,"Understanding a national increase in COVID-19 vaccination intention, the Netherlands, November 2020–March 2021",2021-09-09,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Nucleocapsid protein is one of the essential proteins for viral replication including the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia leading to the ongoing pandemic. Whereas this protein has emerged as a potential drug target, its physicochemical properties and the molecular mechanism of how this protein is involved in viral replication remain unclear. In this review, structural and dynamical aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N(CoV2)), which should play a key role in a new drug development and in the interaction with RNA and other proteins are summarized. The structural feature of N(CoV2) is first described. Next, simulation studies on the interaction between potential drug molecules and N(CoV2) are summarized, which show the importance of molecular flexibility. Then, liquid-liquid phase separation phenomenon involving N(CoV2), which has recently been reported, is described. This phenomenon also suggests the importance of molecular flexibility of N(CoV2). Finally, a promising method using neutron scattering to characterize the structure and structural fluctuation of the droplets, which are formed through this phenomenon, is presented. ABSTRACT: The latest coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia leading to the pandemic, contains 29 proteins. Among them, nucleocapsid protein (N(CoV2)) is one of the abundant proteins and shows multiple functions including packaging the RNA genome during the infection cycle. It has also emerged as a potential drug target. In this review, the current status of the research of N(CoV2) is described in terms of molecular structure and dynamics. N(CoV2) consists of two domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) with a disordered region between them. Recent simulation studies have identified several potential drugs that can bind to NTD or CTD with high affinity. Moreover, it was shown that the degree of flexibility in the disordered region has a large effect on drug binding rate, suggesting the importance of molecular flexibility for the N(CoV2) function. Molecular flexibility has also been shown to be integral to the formation of droplets, where N(CoV2), RNA and/or other viral proteins gather through liquid-liquid phase separation and considered important for viral replication. Finally, as one of the future research directions, a strategy for obtaining the structural and dynamical information on the proteins contained in droplets is presented.","Matsuo, Tatsuhito",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10060454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064163/,176

However, data also indicate increases in reported suicidal ideation and behavior, mental health-related ED visits, and ED visits for suicidal ideation and behavior in youth. Heterogeneity of pandemic effects is noteworthy, with ethnic and racial minority populations suffering the most from COVID-19, COVID-19-related risk factors, and possibly suicide deaths. As vaccinations can prevent severe COVID-19 cases and deaths, we also have demonstrations of effective 'psychological inoculations' such as community-based interventions for reducing suicide attempts and deaths. During COVID-19, we mobilized to provide clinical care through telehealth and digital interventions. The challenge now is to continue to put our science to work to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on suicide and suicide risk factors, our children's mental health, and enhance mental health and well-being in our communities.","Asarnow, Joan R; Chung, Bowen",J Child Psychol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402061/,176
612513,Abdominal gastrointestinal imaging findings on computed tomography in patients with COVID-19 and correlation with clinical outcomes,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Substantial limitations have been imposed on passenger air travel to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between regions and countries. However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks elsewhere. METHODS: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future COVID-19 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. RESULTS: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe, and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities create a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.","Daon, Yair; Thompson, Robin N; Obolski, Uri",J Travel Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jtm/taaa093; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32502274/,176
613259,Online consultation and emergency management in paediatric dentistry during the COVID‐19 epidemic in Wuhan: A retrospective study,2020-09-30,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. It rapidly spread due to human-to-human transmission, resulting in a global pandemic. Nearly every country, including Qatar, has established guidelines and regulations to limit the spread of the virus and to preserve public health. However, these procedures have been associated with negative effects on the psychological and intellectual well-being of individuals, including children and adolescents. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the psychological influence of home isolation and social distancing on children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, and the strategies used to cope with these measures. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was undertaken using an online questionnaire administered through SMS text messaging. All home-isolated children and adolescents registered at the Primary Health Care Corporation aged 7-18 years were invited to participate in the study. Children and adolescents with intellectual disadvantages were excluded. A P value of .05 (two-tailed) was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Data were collected from 6608 participants from June 23 to July 18, 2020. Nearly all participants adhered to the official regulations during the period of home isolation and social distancing; however, 69.1% (n=4568) of parents believed their children were vulnerable to the virus compared to 25% (n=1652) who expressed they were not vulnerable at all. Higher levels of anger, depression, and general anxiety were prevalent among 1.3% (n=84), 3.9% (n=260), and 1.6% (n=104) of participants, respectively. The mean score for the emotional constructs anger and depression decreased with increased compliance with regulations (P=.04 and P=.11, respectively). The differences in mean score for all psychological and coping strategies used among participants across the 3 levels of vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 were statistically significant. The mean score varied little with increasing reported vulnerability to the virus. This mild variation can make a difference when the sample size is large, as is the case in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for psychological and social disruptions is important for the development of strategies by schools and health care providers to assess and monitor behavioral changes and negative psychological impact during post–COVID-19 reintegration. Participants experiencing higher levels of anxiety should be given more attention during reintegration and transitional phases in schools. Although electronic devices and social media platforms may have lowered anxiety levels in some cases, it is important to address how they are used and how content is tailored to children and adolescents. It is also important to maintain an active lifestyle for children and young persons, and encourage them not to neglect their physical health, as this promotes a better psychological state of mind.","Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif; Qotba, Hamda; Al-Maadeed, Alyaa; Al-Kohji, Sadriya; Al Mujalli, Hanan; Ali, Atif; Al Mannai, Lolwa; Aladab, Aisha; AlSaadi, Hamda; AlKarbi, Khalid Ali; Al-Baghdadi, Tholfakhar",JMIR Form Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851577/,176

Traditional approaches to containing EVD proved inadequate and new approaches for controlling the outbreak were required. The Ministry of Health & Sanitation and King’s Sierra Leone Partnership developed a model for Ebola Holding Units (EHUs) at Government Hospitals in the capital city Freetown. The EHUs isolated screened or referred suspect patients, provided initial clinical care, undertook laboratory testing to confirm EVD status, referred onward positive cases to an Ebola Treatment Centre or negative cases to the general wards, and safely stored corpses pending collection by burial teams. Between 29th May 2014 and 19th January 2015, our five units had isolated approximately 37% (1159) of the 3097 confirmed cases within Western Urban and Rural district. Nosocomial transmission of EVD within the units appears lower than previously documented at other facilities and staff infection rates were also low. We found that EHUs are a flexible and effective model of rapid diagnosis, safe isolation and early initial treatment.

The possibility of pooling samples of saliva, using non-invasive bibula strips for sampling, was explored employing Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spiked saliva. In laboratory, up to 30 saliva-soaked strips were pooled in a single tube with 2 mL of medium. After quick adsorption with the medium and vortexing, the liquid was collected and tested with a quantitative molecular assay to quantify viral RNA genome copies. On testing of single and pooled strips, the difference between the median threshold cycles (Ct) value of test performed on the single positive saliva sample and the median Ct value obtained on the pool of 30 strips, was 3.21 cycles. Saliva pooling with bibula strips could allow monitoring of COVID-19 on a large scale, reducing costs for the health bodies in terms of medical material and skilled personnel. Finally, saliva sampling is noninvasive and less traumatic than nasopharyngeal swabs and can be self-collected.","Pratelli, Annamaria; Lucente, Maria Stella; Mari, Viviana; Cordisco, Marco; Sposato, Alessio; Capozza, Paolo; Lanave, Gianvito; Martella, Vito; Buonavoglia, Alessio",Virus Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170221002823; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198575; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34560181/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170221002823?v=s5,176

While this problem is noted universally, it could be particularly serious in China, where Confucian Heritage Culture is deeply ingrained and education development is not quite balanced. This study, via interview data with English teachers and deans from eight universities in an undeveloped region of the Mid-western China, explores the overall environment for a formative assessment initiative that is currently in place. Data analysis reveals multiple issues, such as insufficient support, improper dissemination and ineffective training at the meso-level and the instructors’ limited assessment ability, large class sizes and student’s resistance at the micro-level. A conclusion is thus drawn that the overall environment in this region is by no means favourable for the effective implementation of formative assessment, and implications are derived for better realisation of assessment innovations in this and other undeveloped regions of China.","Chen, Qiuxian; Zhang, Jiajin; Li, Liang",Educ Assess Eval Account,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11092-021-09369-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394769/,176

Residency program educators used alternative teaching methods to accommodate the lack of clinical rotations and allow orienting nurses to progress in an OR nurse residency program. Limited access to ORs and social distancing rules prevented nursing students from completing clinical rotations in health care settings, and academic educators developed flexible solutions to meet the students’ needs.

A genetic origin for the immune imbalance observed in BD, possibly involved in the mechanisms of pathogen escape, has, however, been suggested in recent studies. METHOD: Here, we present a critical review based on a systematic literature search of articles published until December 2016 on the association between BD and infectious/immunogenetic factors. RESULTS: We provide evidence suggesting that infectious insults could act as triggers of maladaptive immune responses in BD and that immunogenetic vulnerability may amplify the effects of such environmental risk factors, increasing susceptibility to subsequent environmental encounters. Quality of evidence was generally impaired by scarce attempt of replication, small sample sizes and lack of high‐quality environmental measures. CONCLUSION: Infection has emerged as a potential preventable cause of morbidity in BD, urging the need to better investigate components of the host–pathogen interaction in patients and at‐risk subjects, and thus opening the way to novel therapeutic opportunities.","Oliveira, J.; Oliveira‐Maia, A.

616838,Enhanced comparisons of COVID-19 mortality across populations,2020-06-16,"Four sediments in the colloidal size range: goethite, montmorillonite, illite, and kaolinite, were suspended with the bacteriophage φ6, a model enveloped virus, to determine relative rates of heteroaggregation and the effect of aggregation on virus viability. Turbidity was measured on combinations of virus and each sediment type at low concentration to determine aggregation rates. Aggregation of sediment with virus occurred regardless of mineral type, and larger fraction of virus is expected to aggregate with increasing sediment concentration leading to higher deposition rates. The negatively charged sediments, aggregated with φ6 (also negatively charged at neutral pH) at a faster rate than the positively charged sediments, yielding turbidity slopes of 4.94 × 10(−3) s(−1) and 7.50 × 10(−4) s(−1) for φ6-montmorillonite and φ6-illite aggregates, respectively, and 2.98 × 10(−5) s(−1) and 2.84 × 10(−5) s(−1), for φ6-goethite and φ6-kaolinite, respectively. This indicates that the interaction between sediments and virus is hydrophobic, rather than electrostatic. Large numbers of virions remained viable post-aggregation, despite the fragility of the viral envelope, indicating that small-sized aggregates, which may travel more readily through porous media, may pose an infection risk. The fraction of φ6 that remained viable varied with sediment type, with montmorillonite-φ6 aggregates experiencing the greatest reduction in infectivity at 35%. TEM analyses reveal that in all sediment-φ6 combinations, infectivity loss was likely due to disassembly of the viral envelope as a result of aggregation.","Katz, Al; Peña, Stephanie; Alimova, Alexandra; Gottlieb, Paul; Xu, Min; Block, Karin A.",Sci Total Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718316243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747115/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969718316243; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.04.425,176

617397,Australian Teledermatology experience during COVID‐19,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: In the recent decades, the use of computerized decision support software (CDSS)-integrated telephone triage (TT) has become an important tool for managing rising healthcare demands and overcrowding in the emergency department. Though these services have generally been shown to be effective, large gaps in the literature exist with regards to the overall quality of these systems. In the current systematic review, we aim to document the consistency of decisions that are generated in CDSS-integrated TT. Furthermore, we also seek to map those factors in the literature that have been identified to have an impact on the consistency of generated triage decisions. METHODS: As part of the TRANS-SENIOR international training and research network, a systematic review of the literature was conducted in November 2019. PubMed, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and the CINAHL database were searched. Quantitative articles including a CDSS component and addressing consistency of triage decisions and/or factors associated with triage decisions were eligible for inclusion in the current review. Studies exploring the use of other types of digital support systems for triage (i.e. web chat, video conferencing) were excluded. Quality appraisal of included studies were performed independently by two authors using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. RESULTS: From a total of 1551 records that were identified, 39 full-texts were assessed for eligibility and seven studies were included in the review. All of the studies (n = 7) identified as part of our search were observational and were based on nurse-led telephone triage. Scientific efforts investigating our first aim was very limited. In total, two articles were found to investigate the consistency of decisions that are generated in CDSS-integrated TT. Research efforts were targeted largely towards the second aim of our study—all of the included articles reported factors related to the operator- (n = 6), patient- (n = 1), and/or CDSS-integrated (n = 2) characteristics to have an influence on the consistency of CDSS-integrated TT decisions. CONCLUSION: To date, some efforts have been made to better understand how the use of CDSS-integrated TT systems may vary across settings. In general, however, the evidence-base surrounding this field of literature is largely inconclusive. Further evaluations must be prompted to better understand this area of research.

618089,COVID‐19: When dust mites and lockdown create the perfect storm,2020-08-11,"Abstract The murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, JHM strain, induces a retinal degenerative disease in adult BALB/c mice. Coronavirus infections are highly species specific with virus exhibiting a strong tissue and cell specificity. In this report we evaluated the cellular basis of JHM virus retinal tropism. Retinal cultures and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)-retinal mixed cell cultures were prepared from eyes obtained from Balb/c mice. The ability of JHM virus to infect and replicate in these retinal cultures was evaluated by light microscopy, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and virus isolation. Cytopathology was not observed and virus could not be detected in supernatant fluid in retinal cultures. However, low levels of infectious virus could be detected within the cells for the first 4 days. This observation suggested that cell-to-cell interactions may be critical since virus particles and virus antigens can be seen in vivo within the neural retina and the RPE. In contrast to the retinal cultures, retinal-RPE mixed cultures were supportive to JHM virus replication. Syncytial cytopathology was observed for the first 4 days and virus was isolated from supernatant fluids. By electron microscopy, virus was found intracellularly within vacuoles and extracellularly at the plasma membrane. After Day 4, a persistent virus infection was established in which cells produced virus for 5 weeks without cytopathic effects or cell death. Double-labeling immunofluorescent studies of retinal-RPE mixed cultures showed that the virus antigen was co-expressed with a Muller cell marker, glutamine synthetase. This cell is the most prominent glial element in the retina. These studies demonstrate that JHM virus is capable of establishing a persistent virus infection in mixed retinal (Muller)-RPE cell cultures. Moreover, these data suggest that cell-to-cell interactions influence the establishment of coronavirus infections in the retina.","Wang, Yun; Detrick, Barbara; Hooks, John J.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682283711098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8382393/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682283711098,176

Our study aimed to assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic further deepened these already existing health inequalities. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Data were collected from five longitudinal age-homogenous British cohorts (born in 2000-2002, 1989-1990, 1970, 1958 and 1946). PARTICIPANTS: A web survey was sent to the cohorts. Anybody who responded to the survey was included, resulting in 14 891 eligible participants. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: The survey provided data on cancelled surgical or medical appointments, and the number of care hours received in a week during the first UK COVID-19 national lockdown. INTERVENTIONS: Using binary or ordered logistic regression, we evaluated whether these outcomes differed by sex, ethnicity, SEP and having a chronic illness. Adjustment was made for study design, non-response weights, psychological distress, presence of children or adolescents in the household, COVID-19 infection, key worker status, and whether participants had received a shielding letter. Meta-analyses were performed across the cohorts, and meta-regression was used to evaluate the effect of age as a moderator. RESULTS: Women (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.55) and those with a chronic illness (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.05) experienced significantly more cancellations during lockdown (all p<0.0001). Ethnic minorities and those with a chronic illness required a higher number of care hours during the lockdown (both OR≈2.00, all p<0.002). SEP was not associated with cancellation or care hours. Age was not independently associated with either outcome in the meta-regression. CONCLUSION: The UK government’s lockdown approach during the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have deepened existing health inequalities, impacting predominantly women, ethnic minorities and those with chronic illnesses.

We assess undergraduate medical students’ adaptations and Professional Identity Formation (PIF) by exploring their written reflections. Methods: This phenomenology study analyzes undergraduate medical students’ written reflections. We perform a thematic analysis to identify emerging themes. Results: We purposively selected 80 written reflections, considering the students’ year of study, gender, GPA, and education stage (preclinical or clinical). Three themes emerged: students’ adaptation processes and coping strategies in facing the pandemic; their adaptation processes for learning; and their perceived roles as medical students during the pandemic. Conclusions: Adaptive coping mechanisms were implemented by the medical students in this study. The socialization processes that promote professional identity formation may change due to the tremendous disruption wrought by the pandemic; this has prompted our investigation of students’ roles and various ways of interacting with role models. We highlight the importance of the medical school supporting students’ adaptations and professional identity formation during this pandemic.","Findyartini, Ardi; Anggraeni, Dewi; Husin, Joseph Mikhael; Greviana, Nadia",J Public Health Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409249/; https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2020.1918,176
619216,Wastewater monitoring outperforms case numbers as a tool to track COVID-19 incidence dynamics when test positivity rates are high,2021-05-17,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a worldwide health threat. In a prospective multicentric study, we identify IL-3 as an independent prognostic marker for the outcome during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specifically, low plasma IL-3 levels is associated with increased severity, viral load, and mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit also reduced circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and low plasma IFNα and IFNλ levels when compared to non-severe COVID-19 patients. In a mouse model of pulmonary HSV-1 infection, treatment with recombinant IL-3 reduces viral load and mortality. Mechanistically, IL-3 increases innate antiviral immunity by promoting the recruitment of circulating pDCs into the airways by stimulating CXCL12 secretion from pulmonary CD123(+) epithelial cells, both, in mice and in COVID-19 negative patients exhibiting pulmonary diseases. This study identifies IL-3 as a predictive disease marker for SARS-CoV-2 infections and as a potential therapeutic target for pulmunory viral infections.","Bénard, Alan; Jacobsen, Anne; Brunner, Maximilian; Krautz, Christian; Klösch, Bettina; Swierzy, Izabela; Naschberger, Elisabeth; Podolska, Malgorzata J.; Kouhestani, Dina; David, Paul; Birkholz, Torsten; Castellanos, Ixchel; Trufa, Denis; Sirbu, Horia; Vetter, Marcel; Kremer, Andreas E.; Hildner, Kai; Hecker, Andreas; Edinger, Fabian; Tenbusch, Matthias; Mühl-Zürbes, Petra; Steinkasserer, Alexander; Richter, Enrico; Streeck, Hendrik; Berger, Marc M.; Brenner, Thorsten; Weigand, Markus A.; Swirski, Filip K.; Schett, Georg; Grützmann, Robert; Weber, Georg F.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33602937/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21310-4,176

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

We investigated the impact of cardiac CT on the utilization of cardiac catheterization among children with congenital heart disease. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 2648 cardiac CT and 3814 cardiac catheterization from 1999 to 2009 for congenital heart diseases. Diagnoses were categorized into 11 disease groups. The numbers of examination, according to the different modalities, were compared using temporal trend analyses. The estimated effective radiation doses (mSv) of CT and catheterization were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The number of CT scans and interventional catheterizations had a slight annual increase of 1.2% and 2.7%, respectively, whereas that of diagnostic catheterization decreased by 6.2% per year. Disease groups fell into two categories according to utilization trend differences between CT and diagnostic catheterization. The increased use of CT reduces the need for diagnostic catheterization in patients with atrioventricular connection disorder, coronary arterial disorder, great vessel disorder, septal disorder, tetralogy of Fallot, and ventriculoarterial connection disorder. Clinicians choose either catheterization or CT, or both examinations, depending on clinical conditions, in patients with semilunar valvular disorder, heterotaxy, myocardial disorder, pericardial disorder, and pulmonary vein disorder. The radiation dose of CT was lower than that of diagnostic cardiac catheterization in all age groups. CONCLUSION: The use of noninvasive CT in children with selected heart conditions might reduce the use of diagnostic cardiac catheterization. This may release time and facilities within the catheterization laboratory to meet the increasing demand for cardiac interventions.","Yang, Justin Cheng-Ta; Lin, Ming-Tai; Jaw, Fu-Shan; Chen, Shyh-Jye; Wang, Jou-Kou; Shih, Tiffany Ting-Fang; Wu, Mei-Hwan; Li, Yiu-Wah",J Formos Med Assoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241602/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092966461400237X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092966461400237X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2014.08.004,176

However, re-emergent transmission has signalled the need for sustainable interventions beyond these repeated chemical interventions. To take advantage of ongoing investment in rural infrastructure, an index of schistosomiasis transmission potential is needed to identify villages where environmental modifications would be particularly effective. Based on a retrospective analysis of data from 10 villages in Sichuan Province, an index linked to the basic reproductive number is shown to have promise in meeting this need. However, a lack of methods for estimating the spatial components of the proposed metric and for estimating the import of cercariae and miracidia from neighbouring villages leads to significant uncertainty in its estimation. These findings suggest a priority effort to develop methods for measuring the free-swimming forms of the parasite in surface waters. This need is underscored by the high cost and limited sensitivity of current methods for diagnosing human infection and mounting evidence of the inadequacy of snail surveys to identify environments supporting low levels of transmission.","Spear, Robert C.",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21752808/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2011.0285,176

This risk factor refrains many potential investors from investing in the share market directly. Instead, they invest in different mutual funds that are being managed by experienced portfolio managers. To avoid the risk factors and increase the gain, they put the accumulated capital in multiple stocks. They need to perform many calculations and predictions to overcome the uncertainties and unpredictability and need to ensure higher gains to the investors of that mutual fund. In this research work initially, a data mining based approach employs a curve fitting/regression technique to forecast the individual stock price. Based on the above analysis, we propose a framework to diversify the investment of the capital fund. This method employs buy and hold strategy using both statistical features and basic domain knowledge of the share market. The proposed framework distributes the capital first, by distributing sector-wise, and then for each sector, investing company-wise, as a diversified approach among different stocks for higher return but maintaining lower risks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs well and generates a good yield compared to some benchmark and ranked mutual funds in the Indian stock market.","Maji, Giridhar; Mondal, Debomita; Dey, Nilanjan; Debnath, Narayan C.; Sen, Soumya",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33425048/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12652-020-02693-6,176

Angiotensin-converting- enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cell surface receptor that recognizes the coronavirus spike protein has protective effects against inflammation and chronic hyperglycemia in animal models. The roles of ACE2 in severe SARS-CoV-2 infections remains ambiguous due to contradictory findings. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between human plasma ACE2 levels in diabetics and the high risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. First, the medical records of 245 patients with SARS-CoV-2-positive who have chronic diseases were analyzed. We also recruited 404 elderly subjects with comorbid chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and obesity, and investigated the ACE2 plasma levels. Plasma concentrations of ACE2 were much lower (2973.83±2196.79 pg/mL) in diabetics with chronic disease than in healthy controls (4308.21±2352.42 pg/ml), and the use of hypoglycemia drugs was associated with lower circulating concentrations of ACE2 (P=1.49E-08). Diabetics with lower plasma levels of ACE2 may be susceptible to severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that the poor prognosis in patients with diabetes infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be due to low circulating ACE2 levels.","Zhang, Yanliang; Sun, Yangyang; Liu, Kang; Alolga, Raphael N; Xu, Xueqiang; Feng, Ganzhu; Xiao, Pingxi",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33962399/,176

The main objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate changes in epidermal barrier function and skin homeostasis after phototherapy and (2) to explore potentially predictive values in epidermal barrier function and skin homeostasis to assess clinical improvement after fifteen sessions of phototherapy. A total of 76 subjects, 38 patients with plaque-type psoriasis and 38 gender- and age-matched healthy volunteers, were included in the study. Erythema, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), temperature, stratum corneum hydration (SCH), pH, sebum, and antioxidant capacity were measured before and after the first and fifteenth phototherapy session. Erythema (401.09 vs. 291.12 vs. 284.52 AU, p < 0.001) and TEWL (18.23 vs. 11.44 vs. 11.41 g·m(−2)·h(−1), p < 0.001) were significantly higher at psoriatic plaques than in uninvolved psoriatic skin and healthy volunteers, respectively, while SCH was lower (9.71 vs. 44.64 vs. 40.00 AU, p < 0.001). After fifteen phototherapy sessions, TEWL (–5.19 g·m(−2)·h(−1), p = 0.016) decreased while SCH (+7.01 AU, p = 0.013) and erythema (+30.82 AU, p = 0.083) increased at psoriatic plaques. An erythema increase exceeding 53.23 AU after the first phototherapy session, with a sensitivity of 71.4% and specificity of 84.2%, indicates that a patient may improve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) by ≥3 points after fifteen phototherapy sessions.

624653,COVID-19 pandemic: Cleaning and disinfection – What should the radiologist know?,2021-01-23,"INTRODUCTION: Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) is a known complication of thyroid surgery, due to iatrogenic recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, with reported rates of 2%–5% in children. The gold standard for assessing vocal cord function in flexible nasendoscopy (FNE) examination, which is considered high‐risk for contraction of the COVID‐19 virus. Intraoperative ultrasonographic assessment (IUA) of vocal cord function is a non‐invasive and relatively simple procedure performed in a supine position, performed during spontaneous breathing, following reversed anaesthesia, while the patient is still sedated. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity of IUA modality in children undergoing thyroidectomy and to compare it to the standard FNE. DESIGN: A prospective double‐blind study covering 24 months (March 2019–March 2021). Twenty thyroid lobectomies were performed, during 15 surgeries. Vocal cord function was assessed three times: Pre‐operatively by FNE, intraoperative (IUA) following extubation, and a second FNE on the first post‐operative day. SETTINGS: A tertiary paediatric hospital. RESULTS: The overall accuracy of IUA results in our study was 92%. IUA sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were 100%, 89%, 33% and 100%, respectively. Patient's age demonstrated borderline significance (p = .08). The resident's experience was associated with a better correlation between IUA and FNE results (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: IUA of vocal cord motion has a high accuracy rate for detection of iatrogenic vocal cord paralysis, similar to FNE. It is easily learned by residents, well‐tolerated by children, and it provides a safe and valid alternative modality while ensuring the safety of the medical staff in treating patients, especially in times of COVID‐19 pandemic.","Zavdy, Ofir; Schwarz, Michael; Gilony, Dror; Bachar, Gideon; Gilat, Hanna; Hod, Roy",Clin Otolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13835; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34255927/,176

As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19. To face this immediate global challenge, drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer this battle. Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19. However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed. In the present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural viroinformatics approach. Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2. Deep structural analysis of target molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3 (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)]. It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage. Thus, drug repurposition is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost to treat COVID-19, we don't have enough time as the whole world is lockdown and we are in urgent need of an obvious therapeutics' measures.","Bibi, Nousheen; Gul, Sana; Ali, Johar; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad",Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173496; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014299920305884?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841640/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014299920305884,176

The present study aimed to assess some biologically active compounds present in medicinal plants as potential COVID-19 inhibitors, using molecular docking methods. The Docking study was performed by Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE). About 20 Compounds were screened in this study; these compounds were selected based on classification of their chemical origin and their antiviral activity from literature. These compounds might be used to inhibit COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this screening strategy, which can lead to rapid drug discovery in response to new infectious diseases. The results showed that many compounds isolated from medicinal plants such as; Gallic acid (− 17.45), Quercetin (− 15.81), Naringin (− 14.50), Capsaicin (− 13.90), and Psychotrine (− 13.5) are important sources for novel antiviral drugs targeting COVID-19.","Alrasheid, Ayat Ahmed; Babiker, Mazin Yousif; Awad, Talal Ahmed",In Silico Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40203-020-00073-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33432283/,176

While a fast and reliable IgG response has been reported for samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, less is known about ambulatory patients. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG (Euroimmun) in a defined cohort of SARS-CoV-2-PCR-confirmed outpatients and asymptomatic contact persons including 137 serum samples from PCR-confirmed outpatients (n = 111) and asymptomatic but PCR-positive contact persons (n = 26) sent to our laboratory as part of routine diagnostics for determination of SARS-CoV-2-IgG. Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2-IgG was 81.1% in outpatients (irrespective of sampling before or after day 21 after onset of symptoms) but significantly lower in asymptomatic contact persons (15.4%, p < 0.0001). In contact persons without symptoms the ct values of the PCR assays were significantly higher (5 to 7 threshold cycles) than in outpatients, and ct values were significantly negative correlated to the SARS-CoV-2-IgG ratio, suggesting a lower viral load as a possible explanation for lower rate of seropositivity. In summary, our study shows that serological response to SARS-CoV-2 in outpatients including asymptomatic persons is less pronounced than in hospitalized patients. Further controlled studies are urgently needed to determine serological response in outpatients and asymptomatic persons since this is the main target population for seroepidemiological investigations.","Wellinghausen, Nele; Plonné, Dietmar; Voss, Meike; Ivanova, Ralitsa; Frodl, Reinhard; Deininger, Susanne",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32707511/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220302845; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220302845?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104542,176

METHODS: The research team adopted an improved U-shaped neural network to segment lungs and pneumonia lesions in CT images through multilayer convolution iterations. Then the appropriate 159 cases were selected to establish and train the model, and Dice loss function and Adam optimizer were used for network training with the initial learning rate of 0.001. Finally, 39 cases (29 positive and 10 negative) were selected for the comparative test. Experimental group: an attending physician a and an associate chief physician a read the CT images to diagnose COVID-19 with the help of the AI system. Control group: an attending physician b and an associate chief physician b did the diagnosis only by their experience, without the help of the AI system. The time spent by each doctor in the diagnosis and their diagnostic results were recorded. Paired t-test, univariate ANOVA, chi-squared test, receiver operating characteristic curves, and logistic regression analysis were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was statistical significance in the time spent in the diagnosis of different groups (P<0.05). For the group with the optimal diagnostic results, univariate and multivariate analyses both suggested no significant correlation for all variables, and thus it might be the assistance of the AI system, the epidemiological history and other factors that played an important role. CONCLUSION: The AI system developed by us, which was created due to COVID-19, had certain clinical practicability and was worth popularizing.","Xie, Hui; Li, Qing; Hu, Ping-Feng; Zhu, Sen-Hua; Zhang, Jian-Fang; Zhou, Hong-Da; Zhou, Hai-Bo",J Inflamm Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s301866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814922/,176

627099,New-Onset Neurologic Symptoms and Related Neuro-Oncologic Lesions Discovered After COVID-19 Vaccination: Two Neurosurgical Cases and Review of Post-Vaccine Inflammatory Responses,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a combination of metabolic risk factors causing a pathological condition that increases the risk of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. A variety of dietary approaches have been examined to halt this rapid trend; however, the effects of modified-Paleo diet and medium-carbohydrate diet on inflammation, adipokines, hepatokines, and the profile of endothelial microparticles in individuals with metabolic syndrome have not been investigated in detail. The present study is designed to examine the effect of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diet with two delivery modes: “fixed diet plan” vs “calorie counting” on weight, body composition, serum levels of some hepatokines and adipocytokines, and flow cytometric analysis of endothelial microparticles in adults with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Eighty metabolic syndrome patients will be recruited in this study. They will be randomly allocated to one of the following 4 groups: (1) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with calorie counting, (2) receiving a modified-Paleo diet with a fixed diet plan, (3) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with calorie counting, and (4) receiving a medium-carbohydrate diet with a fixed diet plan for 10 weeks. Weight, height, waist circumference, and body composition will be assessed at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Serum insulin, asprosin, chemerin, FGF-21, CTRP-1, PYY, ghrelin, plasma EMPs (CD31+/CD42b− and CD144+/CD42b−), lipid profile, glycemic indices, hs-CRP, leptin, vitamin C, creatinine and satiety, hunger, fullness, and desire to eat (via visual analog scales) will be measured at the study baseline and at the end of the trial. Insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity will be determined using the HOMA-IR and QUICKI equations. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial that will determine the effect of modified-Paleo and moderate-carbohydrate diet on weight, body composition, serum levels of some hepatokines and adipocytokines, and the profile of EMPs in adults with metabolic syndrome. Moreover, the effects of different diet delivery modes, including “fixed diet plan” and “calorie counting” will also be analyzed. The results of this trial can provide clinical witnesses on the effectiveness of carbohydrate-restricted diets in ameliorating metabolic status and prevent the development of chronic diseases.

We conducted a systematic review to assess the utility of technology-based interventions to increase point-of-care youth HIV testing and linkage to care. We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials of technology-based interventions aimed at increasing point-of-care youth HIV testing, published between 2008 and 2020. All identified citations were independently screened for inclusion by two authors, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Controlled Trials was used to assess the quality of included studies. Three studies met all inclusion criteria. Two interventions were effective in increasing HIV testing, while one was effective at linkage to care. Technology-based interventions have the potential to increase youth HIV testing in clinical settings and facilitate linkage to care, possibly reducing undiagnosed HIV among adolescents and emerging adults.","Ibitoye, Mobolaji; Lappen, Hope; Freeman, Robert; Jordan, Ashly E.; Aronson, Ian David",AIDS Behav,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03112-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231846/,176

Despite the prevailing pandemic, there are no recommendations available as yet for testing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as part of blood screening. OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV-2 antibodies, its clinical significance and to identify if total antibodies(IgA, IgM, IgG) should be tested or just the specific IgG antibodies only. METHOD: Consecutive blood donors donated were screened for standard serological panel of HbsAg, Anti-HCV, Anti-HIV and Syphilis using Cobas-411 analyser and Malaria. All seronegative donors were then screened for COVID serology using the same instrument. These results were compared with the blood donors’ seroprevalence checked in a cohort in the first week of June 2020. Pre-COVID-19 period (October 2019) blood donors’ archived samples were also compared. Donors who were positive on ECLIA were then tested for specific antibodies (IgM or IgG) by ELISA. RESULTS: A total of 380 healthy blood donors were included. All were males with the mean age being 30.6 ± 6.3 years. Ten pre-pandemic samples did not show COVID-19 antibodies, whereas out of 70 samples in the3(rd) week of June, only 15 (21.4%)were positive. However, in July out of the 300 blood donors, 113 (37.7%) were found to be reactive. To reconfirm our findings, these 113 donors were then tested on ELISA for presence of IgG specifically. Out of these 128 samples, 81 were IgG positive, 23 were borderline positive and 24 were negative. CONCLUSION: Almost 40% of blood donors are now seroconverted for COVID-19. This is a reflection of widespread seroprevalence in the adult male population.","Younas, Amber; Waheed, Samra; Khawaja, Shabnum; Imam, Mehjabeen; Borhany, Munira; Shamsi, Tahir",Transfus Apher Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473050220302378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473050220302378?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868226/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.transci.2020.102923,176

We explore whether practices in workplace health and wellbeing programs cohere around a small number of archetypal categories or whether differences between organizations are better explained by a continuum. We also examine whether adopting multiple practices predicts subsequent changes in health and wellbeing. Using survey data from 146 organizations, we found differences between organizations were best characterized by a continuum ranging from less to more extensive adoption of practices. Using two-wave multilevel survey data at both individual and organizational levels (N = 6968 individuals, N = 58 organizations), we found that, in organizations that adopt a wider range of health and wellbeing practices, workers with poor baseline psychological wellbeing were more likely to report subsequent improvements in wellbeing and workers who reported good physical health at baseline were less likely to report experiencing poor health at follow-up. We found no evidence that adopting multiple health and wellbeing practices buffered the impact of individuals’ workplace psychosocial hazards on physical health or psychological wellbeing.","Daniels, Kevin; Fida, Roberta; Stepanek, Martin; Gendronneau, Cloé",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501554/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18178964,176

Much of the research on this transition has been conducted with English-speaking mental health providers, leaving a gap in understanding related to how this shift has impacted Spanish-speaking treatment providers. Methods: Fifty non-U.S. Spanish-speaking therapists completed a survey related to their use of telecommunication modalities; client population characteristics; professional, ethical, and legal/regulatory issues; and telehealth training and practice. Participants completed the survey at one time point and retrospectively described their use of telehealth both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Results: Most of the 50 Spanish-speaking therapists surveyed reported using telepsychology 58% before COVID-19 versus 84% during the COVID-19 pandemic (&#967;2 = 5.76, p < 0.05). Compared with pre-pandemic, the number of hours therapists spent using telepsychology per week increased significantly for early adopter therapists (those who began using telehealth before the pandemic began) (Z = -3.18, p = 0.001) and also for late adopter therapists who only began using telehealth during the pandemic (Z = -3.74, p < 0.001). Many therapists reported equity issues. Most participants also reported ethical and regulatory concerns regarding security/confidentiality or Health Insurance Porability and Accountability Act. Conclusions: The rapid adoption of technology to deliver therapy during COVID-19 has spurred growing pains for Spanish-speaking therapists and their underserved clients, and more research is needed to better understand and improve the therapists' adoption of these technologies with diverse patient populations.","Sampaio, Mariana; Navarro Haro, Maria Vicenta; Wilks, Chelsey; De Sousa, Bruno; Garcia-Palacios, Azucena; Hoffman, Hunter G",Telemed J E Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34182825/; https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0124,176

The use of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) demonstrates a range of benefits for improved symptom management in adults with cancer. There are, however, multiple barriers to integrating PROMs into routine care in children and adolescents with cancer. This study aims to evaluate: (1) the effectiveness of electronic PROMs to generate stratified alerts, symptom management recommendations and graphical summaries (the RESPONSE system) to improve health outcomes and (2) the implementation of the RESPONSE system by assessing feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction, and sustainability. METHODS: A pragmatic hybrid II effectiveness-implementation controlled trial, using mixed methods, will be undertaken, advancing both knowledge of the effectiveness of the intervention and implementation factors. One-hundred and sixty children with cancer receiving active treatment will be recruited 1:1 to a non-randomised study involving two groups with an equal number of participants in each group. The intervention group (n = 80) will be prospectively recruited to receive the RESPONSE system intervention over eight weeks, versus the historical matched control group (n = 80) who will complete the ePROMs without access to the RESPONSE system. The primary outcome of the effectiveness trial is change between groups in total symptom burden. Secondary outcomes include child health-related quality-of-life and implementation outcomes. Trial data will be analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Formative implementation evaluation is informed by CFIR and ERIC frameworks and implementation outcomes will be mapped to the RE-AIM framework and include interviews, field notes, as well as administrative data to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction and sustainability.

We developed and applied an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based approach to analyse social-media public sentiment in the UK and the US towards COVID-19 vaccinations, to understand public attitude and identify topics of concern. Methods: Over 300,000 social-media posts related to COVID-19 vaccinations were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook-posts from the UK and 144,864 from the US, along with 40,268 tweets from the UK and 98,385 from the US respectively, from 1st March - 22nd November 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends and topics of discussion. These were analysed longitudinally and geo-spatially, and a manual reading of randomly selected posts around points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis. Results: We found overall averaged positive, negative and neutral sentiment in the UK to be 58%, 22% and 17%, compared to 56%, 24% and 18% in the US, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness and trials as well as concerns over safety, economic viability and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to national surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly. Conclusions: AI-enabled social-media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments, alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. This could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccinations, help address concerns of vaccine-sceptics and develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximise uptake.","Hussain, A.; Tahir, A.; Hussain, Z.; Sheikh, Z.; Gogate, M.; Dashtipour, K.; Ali, A.; Sheikh, A.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.08.20246231; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.08.20246231v1?rss=1,176
630902,COVID-19 Vaccination in Fragile Patients: Current Evidence and an Harmonized Transdisease Trial,2021-08-10,"Antibiotic resistance toward commonly used medicinal drugs is a dangerously growing threat to our existence. Plants are naturally equipped with a spectrum of biomolecules and metabolites with important biological activities. These natural compounds constitute a treasure in the fight against multidrug-resistant microorganisms. The development of plant-based antimicrobials through green synthesis may deliver alternatives to common drugs. Lepidium sativum L. (LS) is widely available throughout the world as a fast-growing herb known as garden cress. LS seed oil is interesting due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Nanotechnology offers a plethora of applications in the health sector. Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are used due to their antimicrobial properties. We combined LS and AgNP to prevent microbial resistance through plant-based synergistic mechanisms within the nanomaterial. AgNP were prepared by a facile one-pot synthesis through plant-biomolecules-induced reduction of silver nitrate via a green method. The phytochemicals in the aqueous LS extract act as reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents of AgNP. The composition of the LS-AgNP biohybrids was confirmed by analytical methods. Antimicrobial testing against 10 reference strains of pathogens exhibited excellent to intermediate antimicrobial activity. The bio-nanohybrid LS-AgNP has potential uses as a broad-spectrum microbicide, disinfectant, and wound care product.","Haj Bloukh, Samir; Edis, Zehra; Abu Sara, Hamid; Alhamaidah, Mustafa Ameen",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13091352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575428/,176
631167,A survey of the global impact of COVID‐19 on the practice of pediatric anesthesia: A study from the pediatric anesthesia COVID‐19 Collaborative Group,2021-05-03,"Cyclodextrins (CDs) are widely used in drug delivery, catalysis, food and separation processes. In this work, a comprehensive simulation study on the diffusion of the native α-, β- and γ-CDs in aqueous solutions is carried out using Molecular Dynamics simulations. The effect of the system size on the computed self-diffusivity is investigated and it is found that the required correction can be as much as 75% of the final value. The effect of the water force field is examined and it is shown that the q4md-CD/TIP4P/2005 force field combination predicts the experimentally measured self-diffusion coefficients of CDs very accurately. The self-diffusion coefficients of the three native CDs were also computed in aqueous-NaCl solutions using the Joung and Cheatham (JC) and the Madrid-2019 force fields. It is found that Na [Formula: see text] ions have higher affinity towards the CDs when the JC force field is used and for this reason the predicted diffusivity of CDs is lower compared to simulations using the Madrid-2019 force field. As a model system for drug delivery and waste-water treatment applications, the diffusion of the β-CD:Ibuprofen inclusion complex in water is studied. In agreement with experiments for similar components, it is shown that the inclusion complex and the free β-CD have almost equal self-diffusion coefficients. Our analysis revealed that this is most likely caused by the almost full inclusion of the ibuprofen in the cavity of the β-CD. Our findings show that Molecular Dynamics simulation can be used to provide reasonable diffusivity predictions, and to obtain molecular-level understanding useful for industrial applications of CDs.","Erdős, Máté; Frangou, Michalis; Vlugt, Thijs J.H.; Moultos, Othonas A.",Fluid Phase Equilib,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fluid.2020.112842; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378381220303903?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024350/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378381220303903,176

631213,A Very Peculiar Practice: Dermatology in the era of Covid‐19,2020-07-23,"BACKGROUND: Following concerns about increased antibiotic use during the COVID-19 pandemic, trends in community antibiotic prescriptions in Scotland were evaluated. METHODS: The primary care prescription electronic messaging system used in GP practices with NHS contracts provided near real-time data analysis of national data. The main outcome measures were the weekly number of prescriptions for antibiotics generated by prescribers in GP practices in 2020 compared with 2019. RESULTS: At end of Week 12 2020 (22 March), after a sharp increase, the number of prescriptions commonly used for respiratory infections was 44% higher than the corresponding week in 2019. The number of prescriptions for respiratory antibiotics reduced through April and May 2020, with 34% fewer prescriptions issued by end of Week 22 (31 May) than in the corresponding week in 2019. Reductions were pronounced in all age groups but particularly apparent for prescriptions for children aged 0–4 years. These data were compared with weekly prescriptions for a selection of non-respiratory antibiotics and no difference was seen between 2020 and 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in antibiotic prescription data show that after an initial surge, and following ‘lockdown’ in Scotland, the total number of prescriptions for antibiotics commonly used for respiratory infections fell. We believe this is the first published national evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on community use of antibiotics. Further analysis of national data is planned to provide a greater understanding of the reasons behind these trends.","Malcolm, William; Seaton, Ronald A; Haddock, Gail; Baxter, Linsey; Thirlwell, Sarah; Russell, Polly; Cooper, Lesley; Thomson, Anne; Sneddon, Jacqueline",JAC Antimicrob Resist,https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlaa105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192254/,176

The role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms, particularly the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) in exon 4, has been frequently investigated in regard to risk of persistent HBV infection. However, these investigations have generated conflicting results. To examine whether common genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is associated with risk of persistent HBV infection, haplotype-tagging and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in two case-control sample sets, totally including 2,550 cases (persistently HBV infected subjects, PIs) and 2,124 controls (spontaneously recovered subjects, SRs) of Southern Chinese ancestry. To test whether rare or subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants are associated with disease risk, the gene’s exons in 244 cases were sequenced. Overall, we found neither SNPs nor haplotypes of SLC10A1 showed significant association in the two sample sets. Furthermore, no significant associations of rare variants or copy number variation covering SLC10A1 were observed. Finally, expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that SNPs potentially affecting SLC10A1 expression also showed no significant associations. We conclude that genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is not likely a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.","Zhang, Ying; Li, Yuanfeng; Wu, Miantao; Cao, Pengbo; Liu, Xiaomin; Ren, Qian; Zhai, Yun; Xie, Bobo; Hu, Yanling; Hu, Zhibin; Bei, Jinxin; Ping, Jie; Liu, Xinyi; Yu, Yinghua; Guo, Bingqian; Lu, Hui; Liu, Guanjun; Zhang, Haitao; Cui, Ying; Mo, Zengnan; Shen, Hongbing; Zeng, Yi-Xin; He, Fuchu; Zhang, Hongxing; Zhou, Gangqiao",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28429786/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46490,176

The role of corticosteroids (CS) treatment in these patients is still controversial. Some studies evidenced a possible role of an early short-term course of CS treatment in the treatment of severe pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective study considering the patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our hospital between 9(th) March and 15(th) June 2020. Two groups were considered: early high-dose of methyl-prednisolone (eHDM; n=31) and the control group (n=52). Patients in the eHDM group received the dose of 5-8mg/kg/day of methyl-prednisolone for 2 consecutive days. Primary outcome was the mortality evaluation; secondary outcomes were clinical improvement, side-effects and laboratory/radiographic changes. RESULTS: Significant differences between the two groups were: length of hospitalization (21.5 vs 28.4 days, p=0.026), length of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation (11.5 vs 14.5 days, p=0.031), death (5 vs 12, p=0.006) and clinical improvement (16 vs 11, p=0.018). The following factors were related to in-hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis: comorbidities (OR=2.919; 95%CI=1.515-16.705; p<0.001), days from the onset of symptoms and the hospital admission (OR=1.404; 95%CI=1.069-12.492; p=0.011), PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio (OR=3.111; 95%CI=2.334-16.991; p=0.009) and eHDM treatment (OR=0.741; 95%CI=0.129-0.917; p=0.007). CONCLUSION: The eHDM is an interesting and promising approach in the ARDS related to COVID-19 pneumonia, which reduces mortality, length of hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Boglione, Lucio; Olivieri, Carlo; Rostagno, Roberto; Poletti, Federica; Moglia, Roberta; Bianchi, Bianca; Esposito, Maria; Biffi, Stefano; Borrè, Silvio",Adv Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advms.2021.04.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022675/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1896112621000225; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1896112621000225?v=s5,176
632094,COVID-19 and the Demand for Online Grocery Shopping: Empirical Evidence from the Netherlands,2021-07-07,"Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are a public health concern in Ethiopia. However, the relationship between menstrual hygiene management (MHM) and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors to RTIs have not been well addressed. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2019 among 602 systematically selected reproductive-age women aged 15–49 years in Dessie City. Data were collected using a questionnaire and a direct observation checklist. RTIs were identified by the presence during one year before data collection of one or more signs of vaginal discharge, itching/irritation or ulcers/lesions around the vulva, pain during urination and sexual intercourse, and lower abdominal pain and lower back pain. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis with 95%CI (confidence interval). The self-reported prevalence of RTIs was 11.0%(95%CI:8.5–13.7%) during one year prior to the survey. The most commonly reported symptoms of RTI were burning micturition (9.1%) and vaginal discharge (6.1%). Three-fourths 443(75.0%) of households used traditional pit latrines and the majority of the study participants 527(89.2%) did not meet the basic access requirement of 20 liters of water per capita per day. The majority 562(95.1%) of the study participants did not have multiple sexual partners during the last year and 97.8% did not practiced sexual intercourse during menstruation. The most common type of blood-absorbent material used was a sanitary pad 497(84.8%) followed by cloth 89(15.2%). Factors significantly associated with RTIs were using unclean latrines (AOR: 4.20; 95%CI:2.00–8.80), not washing hands with soap before touching the genital area (AOR: 3.94; 95%CI:1.49–10.45), history of symptoms of RTIs in the past year (AOR: 5.88; 95%CI:2.30–14.98), having multiple sexual partners in the past year (AOR: 4.46; 95%CI:1.59–12.53), changing absorbent material only once per day (AOR: 8.99; 95%CI:4.51–17.92), and washing the genital area only once per day during menstruation (AOR: 5.76; 95%CI:2.07–16.05). The self-reported prevalence of RTI showed that one women experienced RTI among ten reproductive-age women. Designing a women’s health policy that focuses on ensuring availability of WASH facilities and improving MHM at the community level is key for sustainably preventing RTIs.","Ademas, Ayechew; Adane, Metadel; Sisay, Tadesse; Kloos, Helmut; Eneyew, Betelhiem; Keleb, Awoke; Lingerew, Mistir; Derso, Atimen; Alemu, Kassahun",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32822377/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237696,176

In this cross-sectional study, 722 graduating students and fresh graduates were requested to answer a questionnaire pretested for validity and reliability. The data were analyzed statistically. Results revealed that medical participants scored 15.45 (out of 22), with 38% of them showing good knowledge about pediatric OSA, while dental participants scored 14.59, with 25.2% of them showing good knowledge. By regression analysis, medical participants (odds ratio (OR): 1.529) were more likely to have good knowledge than dental participants, while participants who belonged to institutions located in the central region (OR: 0.546) were less likely to have good knowledge than those from southern region institutions. In addition, participants from public institutions (OR: 0.290) were less likely to have good knowledge than those from private institutions. Regarding attitudes, medical participants scored 14.13 (out of 20), and dental participants scored 14.64. We detected a significant positive correlation between knowledge and attitude scores of dental participants. Given these findings, the knowledge level of graduating Saudi medical and dental students and fresh graduates about pediatric OSA was not optimal. The college type, institution sector, and location in the kingdom were factors associated with good knowledge. There is a need for further education and training about pediatric OSA in the undergraduate Saudi medical and dental curricula and continuing professional development programs about the topic after graduation.","Alharbi, Lamyaa N.; Alsaikhan, Mashail A.; Al-Haj Ali, Sanaa N.; Farah, Ra’fat I.",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090768; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572200/,176

The extent of usage, and to which concerns to earlier implementation were set aside, is unknown; this is worthy of exploration as data becomes available. SOURCES OF DATA: Sources of data are as follows: published case studies, editorials, news articles and government guidance. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: Video can be clinically effective, especially where patients cannot attend due to illness or infection risk. Patients are positive, and they can benefit from savings in time and money. Adoption of telemedicine is hindered by a range of known barriers including clinician resistance due to technological problems, disrupted routines, increased workload, decreased work satisfaction and organizational readiness. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Despite policy impetus and successful pilots, telemedicine has not been adopted at scale. GROWING POINTS: Increased use of telemedicine during the Covid-19 crisis presents opportunities to obtain robust evidence of issues and create service transformation effectively.

634867,Access to healthcare for people aged 50+ in Europe during the COVID-19 outbreak,2021-06-11,"In rare cases, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause fulminant viral hepatitis (FVH), characterized by massive hepatocyte necrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate. Other viral etiologies of FVH are rarer. FVH is life-threatening, but the patients are typically otherwise healthy, and normally resistant to other microbes. Only a small minority of infected individuals develop FVH, and this is the key issue to be addressed for this disease. In mice, mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection is the main model for dissecting FVH pathogenesis. Susceptibility to MHV3 differs between genetic backgrounds, with high and low mortality in C57BL6 and A/J mice, respectively. FVH pathogenesis in mice is related to uncontrolled inflammation and fibrinogen deposition. In humans, FVH is typically sporadic, but rare familial forms also exist, suggesting that there may be causal monogenic inborn errors. A recent study reported a single-gene inborn error of human immunity underlying FVH. A patient with autosomal recessive complete IL-18BP deficiency was shown to have FVH following HAV infection. The mechanism probably involves enhanced IL-18- and IFN-γ-dependent killing of hepatocytes by NK and CD8 T cytotoxic cells. Proof-of-principle that FVH can be genetic is important clinically, for the affected patients and their families, and immunologically, for the study of immunity to viruses in the liver. Moreover, the FVH-causing IL18BP genotype suggests that excessive IL-18 immunity may be a general mechanism underlying FVH, perhaps through the enhancement of IFN-γ immunity.","Jouanguy, Emmanuelle",Hum Genet,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00439-020-02166-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32285199/,176
635089,Racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and uptake,2021-02-28,"Hybridoma technology has been valuable in the development of therapeutic antibodies. More recently, antigen-specific B-cell selection and display technologies are also gaining importance. A major limitation of these approaches used for antibody discovery is the extensive process of cloning and expression involved in transitioning from antibody identification to validating the function, which compromises the throughput of antibody discovery. In this study, we describe a process to identify and rapidly re-format and express antibodies for functional characterization. We used two different approaches to isolate antibodies to five different targets: 1) flow cytometry to identify antigen-specific single B cells from the spleen of immunized human immunoglobulin transgenic mice; and 2) panning of phage libraries. PCR amplification allowed recovery of paired V(H) and V(L) sequences from 79% to 96% of antigen-specific B cells. All cognate V(H) and V(L) transcripts were formatted into transcription and translation compatible linear DNA expression cassettes (LEC) encoding whole IgG or Fab. Between 92% and 100% of paired V(H) and V(L) transcripts could be converted to LECs, and nearly 100% of them expressed as antibodies when transfected into Expi293F cells. The concentration of IgG in the cell culture supernatants ranged from 0.05 µg/ml to 145.8 µg/ml (mean = 18.4 µg/ml). Antigen-specific binding was displayed by 78–100% of antibodies. High throughput functional screening allowed the rapid identification of several functional antibodies. In summary, we describe a plasmid-free system for cloning and expressing antibodies isolated by different approaches, in any format of choice for deep functional screening that can be applied in any research setting during antibody discovery.","Zhang, Ruijun; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Yu, Xiaocong; Mackness, Brian C.; Boudanova, Ekaterina; Hopke, Joern; Sancho, Jose; Saleh, Jacqueline; Cho, HyunSuk; Zhang, Ningning; Simonds-Mannes, Helene; Stimple, Samuel D.; Hoffmann, Dietmar; Park, Anna; Chowdhury, Partha S.; Rao, Sambasiva P.",mAbs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899674/; https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2021.1904546,176

In the Western Pacific Region (WPR), 192,016 confirmed cases with 7,125 deaths had been reported as of 8 June 2020. In people with diabetes COVID-19 can be more difficult to treat due to the wide fluctuations in blood glucose levels or presence of comorbidities such as diabetes complications, including cardiovascular disease and renal damage, which are recognized risks for adverse outcomes. National diabetes associations and governments have established guidelines for subjects with diabetes in relation to COVID-19, and are trying to supply emergency and their regularly required medical products for them. The WPR is so large and composed of such diverse countries and COVID-19 situations, no one conclusion or program applies. Instead we could see a diverse COVID-19 pandemic profile in the WPR, and several creative diagnostic and therapeutic measures undertaken. This includes drive-through screening facilities, high-speed RT-PCR technologies, convalescent patients’ plasma therapy, which potentially had some positive contributions in combatting COVID-19 in the WPR as well as globally.

As one of the most affected countries, Iran has tackled emerging challenges in the path to overcoming the epidemic, with three peaks of the disease propagation as of February 19, 2020. To flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have implemented bundles of intrusive, sometimes extremely stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In this communication, we have dissected the effectiveness of NPIs and compared the strategies implemented by Iran, Turkey, and South Korea to mitigate the disease’s spread. METHODS: We searched online databases via PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and Scopus. Titles/abstracts and full-texts were screened by two reviewers and discrepancies were resolved upon discussion. RESULTS: Our results provide insights into five domains: prevention, screening, in-patient and out-patient facilities, governance, and management of diabetes mellitus. Analysis of previous efforts put in place illustrates that by fostering efficient social distancing measures, increasing the capability to perform prompt polymerase chain reaction tests, applying smart contact tracing, and supplying adequate personal protective equipment, Turkey and South Korea have brought the epidemic sub-optimally under control. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of policymakers, these achievements are of utmost importance given that attaining the aspirational goals in the management of the COVID-19 necessities a suitable adjustment of previous successful strategies.

635753,Outcomes of COVID-19: disparities by ethnicity,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19, a respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a burning question worldwide as it gives rise to a pandemic situation. No specific medications are still recommended for COVID-19; however, healthcare support is crucial for ameliorating the disease condition. Pharmacists are the frontline fighters who are responsible for providing healthcare support to the COVID-19 infected patients around the world. This review endeavored to briefly rationalize the contributions of several pharmacy professionals in diverse fields along with their collaborative efforts and dedication regarding their limitations during the COVID-19 situation and view the prospects of pharmaceutical care services in the post-pandemic period. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: Online databases were utilized to search for scholarly articles and organizational websites, to sum up the information about the contemporary and expanded role of pharmacists. Key articles were retrieved from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct databases using terms: “COVID-19,” “novel coronavirus,” “community,” “industrial,” “hospital,” “clinical,” “recognition,” “obstacles,” “collaboration,” “SARS-CoV-2,” “healthcare,” and “outbreak” in combination with “pharmacist.” The articles were included from the inception of the pandemic to January 25, 2021. The current review found pharmacist’s global contributions and involvements with other professionals to provide healthcare services amidst COVID-19. This included testing of suspects, providing medical information, psycho-social support, debunking myths, mitigating drug shortage events, telemedicine, e-prescription, infection control, and controlling the drug supply chain. In many countries, pharmacists’ activities were much appreciated but in some countries, they were not properly acknowledged for their contributions amidst COVID-19 outbreak. They played additional roles such as participating in the antimicrobial stewardship team, improving value-added services, conducting clinical data analysis to suppress the outspread of the SARS-CoV-2. SHORT CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic while the whole world is fighting against an invisible virus, the pharmacists are the earnest hero to serve their responsibilities along with additional activities. They need to be prepared and collaborate with other healthcare professionals further to meet the challenges of post-pandemic circumstances.","Sami, Saad Ahmed; Marma, Kay Kay Shain; Chakraborty, Agnila; Singha, Tandra; Rakib, Ahmed; Uddin, Md.

Among the extensive and crucial research that has been carried out in the last few months, the analysis of the virus-host relationship plays an important role in drug discovery. Virus-host protein-protein interactions are the active agents in virus replication, and the analysis of virus-host protein-protein interaction networks is fundamental to the study of the virus-host relationship. We have adapted and implemented a recent integer linear programming model for protein-protein interaction network alignment to virus-host networks, and obtained a consensus alignment of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virus-host protein-protein interaction networks. Despite the lack of shared human proteins in these virus-host networks and the low number of preserved virus-host interactions, the consensus alignment revealed aligned human proteins that share a function related to viral infection, as well as human proteins of high functional similarity that interact with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whose alignment would preserve these virus-host interactions.","Llabrés, Mercè; Valiente, Gabriel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191247,176

636419,COVID-19 y aparato digestivo,2020-04-09,"Introduction: Venous thromboembolism and in-situ small vessel thrombosis are increased in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in several patient cohorts. Endotheliopathy and activation of both platelets and coagulation predict critical illness and death. For these reasons the use of anti-platelet agents and increased-intensity anticoagulation in the care of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is under intense study in several clinical trials. We sought to examine the impact of aspirin and anticoagulation on hospitalization outcomes. Methods: We examined outcomes in a large multi-site cohort of consecutive, hospitalized, COVID-19 laboratory confirmed patients under a risk-stratified treatment algorithm from March 13 through June 18, with a focus on efficacy of aspirin and/or increased-intensity anticoagulation. Out of 4150 identified hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we created 3 study cohorts. The overall cohort (2785 patients) excluded pediatric patients, those with incomplete electronic data, and those with multiple admissions. The aspirin (1956 patients) and anticoagulation (1623 patients) cohorts were nested within the overall cohort; the former excluded patients on any home anti-platelet therapy or those who received non-aspirin anti-platelet therapy in the hospital, while the latter excluded patients who did not receive prophylactic or intermediate dose anticoagulation in the hospital. The primary outcome was in-hospital death. Secondary outcomes were time-to-death with a competing risk (time-to-hospital-discharge), escalation to ICU, length-of-stay and use of mechanical ventilation. Variables examined included age, gender, BMI, race, Rothman Index (RI), D-dimer (DD) and patient co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and prior VTE. The aspirin and anticoagulation cohorts underwent propensity score (PS) matching utilizing variables found to be significant in multivariable regression modeling in the overall cohort with 638 and 386 patients, respectively. Results: Univariate followed by multivariable regression modeling in the 2785 patient overall cohort established a novel role for RI, and independent roles for age, BMI, and maximum DD, in predicting severity of illness. In all cohorts the 50th and lower percentile of admission RI was predictive of mortality in multivariable modeling (i.e. aspirin: 3rd and 4th admission RI quartiles with HR = 0.18 for both, p<0.001 for both). In PS matched patients, aspirin was associated with a significant decrease in mortality (OR 0.65 [0.42, 0.98], p=0.044) and a significant increase in mechanical ventilation (OR 1.49 [1.03, 2.18], p=0.037) and ICU status (OR = 1.45 [1.06, 1.98], p=0.021). In PS matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort, intermediate versus prophylactic dose anticoagulation was associated with a marginal decrease in mortality (OR 0.60, p=0.053). In the aspirin cohort examining in-hospital death and discharge as competing risks, the use of aspirin was associated with decreased mortality (p=0.042) and had no effect on discharge (p=0.31). In the anticoagulation cohort a similar competing risk model showed the use of intermediate rather than prophylactic anticoagulation decreased mortality (p=0.046) and had no effect on discharge (p = 0.21). Conclusion: We show in a large cohort of consecutively hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated under a risk-stratified algorithm the prognostic utility of the admission RI in assessing outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a potential benefit of aspirin therapy on in-hospital death from COVID-19. A potential albeit marginal benefit of intermediate dose anticoagulation over prophylactic dose anticoagulation merits further study with results of clinical trials awaited.

636474,Severe COVID-19 initially presenting as mesenteric adenopathy,2020-10-10,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a surge in the demand for medical masks over the past few months. Many countries and regions have experienced a shortage of masks and raw materials, as well as soaring prices. Understanding mask-saving behavior is an important way to help improve medical resource sustainability and respond to the outbreak. This study integrates the theory of planned behavior and normative activation to propose a new comprehensive theoretical framework, which aims to reveal people’s mask-saving intentions (MSI) and behaviors in the post-pandemic period. Using the partial least squares structural equation modeling method, a total of 1057 questionnaires randomly collected from China were measured and empirically analyzed. Results indicate the following: (i) Reducing the frequency of going-out is the main approach to saving masks in China, and the majority of people reuse a mask from two to five times. (ii) Personal norms, subjective norms, attitudes and perceived behavioral control all have significant positive effects on MSI; awareness of consequences and ascription of responsibility also indirectly affect MSI through personal norms. (iii) As for extended factors, environmental concerns, perceived risk and information publicity positively affect MSI, but supply chain performance does not have a significant role. (iv) Excessive information publicity may weaken the impact of personal norms, subjective norms and perceived risk on MSI. Given the above findings, some insightful management implications are proposed.","Si, Hongyun; Shen, Lin; Liu, Wenchao; Wu, Guangdong",Sustain Cities Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33288994/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221067072030843X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102626; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221067072030843X?v=s5,176

COVID-19 represents a spectrum of clinical manifestations that typically include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, often with pulmonary involvement. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and most individuals within the population at large are susceptible to infection. Wild animal hosts and infected patients are currently the main sources of disease which is transmitted via respiratory droplets and direct contact. Since the outbreak, the Chinese government and scientific community have acted rapidly to identify the causative agent and promptly shared the viral gene sequence, and have carried out measures to contain the epidemic. Meanwhile, recent research has revealed critical aspects of SARS-CoV-2 biology and disease pathogenesis; other studies have focused on epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, management, as well as drug and vaccine development. This review aims to summarize the latest research findings and to provide expert consensus.

We explore Ghanaian adult citizens’ vaccine hesitancy attitudes and identify the likelihood of participation or non-participation in the government’s effort to get citizens vaccinated. A fully anonymised cross-sectional online survey of 2345 adult Ghanaians was conducted from 23 to 28 February 2021. Differences in intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination were explored using Pearson Chi-square tests. Additionally, multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the factors associated with willingness to receive vaccines. Responses were weighted using the iterative proportional fitting technique to generate a representative sample. About half (51%) of mostly urban adult Ghanaians over 15 years are likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine if made generally available. Almost a fifth (21%) of the respondents were unlikely to take the vaccine, while another 28% were undecided. Additionally, we find differences in vaccine hesitancy among some socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and primary sources of information. Attaining the proverbial 63% to 70% herd immunity threshold in Ghana is only possible if the preventive vaccination programmes are combined with an enhanced and coordinated public education campaign. Such a campaign should focus on promoting the individual and population-level benefits of vaccination and pre-emptive efforts towards addressing misinformation about vaccines.","Acheampong, Theophilus; Akorsikumah, Eli A.; Osae-Kwapong, John; Khalid, Musah; Appiah, Alfred; Amuasi, John H.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451939/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9080814,176

From 2004, the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USCDC) initiated Cooperative Agreements to build capacity in influenza surveillance in China. From 2004 to 2014, CNIC and USCDC collaborated on the following activities: 1) developing human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology in China; 2) developing a comprehensive influenza surveillance system by enhancing influenza-like illness (ILI) reporting and virological characterization; 3) strengthening analysis, utilization and dissemination of surveillance data; and 4) improving early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Since 2004, CNIC expanded its national influenza surveillance and response system which, as of 2014, included 408 laboratories and 554 sentinel hospitals. With support from USCDC, more than 2500 public health staff from China received virology and epidemiology training, enabling > 98% network laboratories to establish virus isolation and/or nucleic acid detection techniques. CNIC established viral drug resistance surveillance and platforms for gene sequencing, reverse genetics, serologic detection, and vaccine strains development. CNIC also built a bioinformatics platform to strengthen data analysis and utilization, publishing weekly on-line influenza surveillance reports in English and Chinese. The surveillance system collects 200,000–400,000 specimens and tests more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually, which provides valuable information for World Health Organization (WHO) influenza vaccine strain recommendations. In 2010, CNIC became the sixth WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza.

The SARS‐CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is an important structural and functional protein. To identify cellular proteins that interact with the SARS‐CoV N protein and to elucidate the possible involvement of N protein in SARS‐CoV pathogenesis, a human lymphocyte cDNA library was screened using a yeast two‐hybrid system assay. hUbc9, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme of sumoylation system, was found to interact specifically with the N protein, implying the post‐translational sumoylation of the N protein. Mapping studies localized the critical N sequences for this interaction to amino acids 170–210, which includes the SR‐rich motif. However, the consensus motif of sumoylation GK(62)EE in the N protein is not responsible for binding to hUbc9. Mutations of hUbc9 at the enzyme active site C93A or C93S severely impair the interaction with the N protein. The two proteins were also shown to colocalize in the cytoplasm of the transfected 293T cells.

A subsequent inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was likely related to either an embolic event or in situ coronary thrombosis. We could not ascertain whether the acute right ventricular dysfunction was due to in situ pulmonary thrombosis or inferior STEMI. The catastrophic cerebrovascular accident was likely an embolic phenomenon. Similarly, the second patient demonstrated multiple large pedunculated thrombi occupying one-third of the LV cavity with moderately reduced LV function. A segmental pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on computed tomography chest, confirming multiple territories of in situ thrombosis. DISCUSSION: COVID-19-related inflammatory cytokine release has been linked to activation of coagulation pathways. Marked elevation of ferritin and C-reactive protein levels in both patients were consistent with evidence of a hyperinflammatory state with ‘cytokine storm’. Furthermore, the finding of elevated D-dimer levels lends support to the altered coagulation cascade that plausibly explains the multisystem thrombosis observed in our patients. The direct viral endothelial involvement and subsequent endothelial dysfunction may play an important role in the development of thrombosis in different vascular beds, as seen in our patients.","Garg, Aakash; Hakeem, Hisham; Chennu, Gouthami; Saeed, Qaisra; Vucic, Esad; Kats, Yuliya; Waxman, Sergio",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34263128/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab239,176

640537,Estimating the case fatality ratio of the COVID-19 epidemic in China,2020-02-20,"BACKGROUND: The months prior to elective surgery may present an opportunity for patients to initiate behavior changes that will simultaneously ready them for surgery and improve their overall health status. An upcoming elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) may serve as motivation for patients with severe obesity (body mass index [BMI]> 40 kg/m(2)) to lose weight, as it may optimize clinical outcomes following TJA and help them become eligible for TJA since some surgeons use a BMI of 40 kg/m(2) as a cut-off for offering surgery in an effort to optimize outcomes. METHODS: The purpose of this multicenter randomized, controlled trial is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week remote dietitian (RD) supervised dietary and physical activity weight loss intervention and mobile app for 60 patients with severe obesity prior to undergoing TJA. Intervention participants will receive access to a smartphone app and connect with an RD who will contact these participants weekly or bi-weekly via video calls for up to nine video calls. Together, participants and RDs will set goals for lifestyle modifications, and RDs will check on progress towards achieving these goals using in-app tools such as food logs and text messages between video calls. All patients will be encouraged to lose at least 20 pounds with a goal BMI < 40 kg/m(2) after 12 weeks. Individuals randomized to the control group will receive clinical standard of care, such as nutritionist and/or physical therapy referrals. Outcome and demographic data will be collected from blood serology, chart review, mobile app user data, pre- and postintervention surveys, and phone interviews. The primary outcome measure will be weight change from baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include percentage of patients eligible to undergo TJA, number of sessions completed with dietitians, self-reported global health status (PROMIS Global Health scale), self-reported joint-specific pain and function (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) or Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS)), and serologies such as hemoglobin A1c, total lymphocyte count, albumin, and transferrin. Qualitative responses transcribed from phone interviews about the intervention will also be analyzed. DISCUSSION: This will be the first study to assess pre-operative weight loss in patients with severe obesity anticipating orthopaedic surgery using an RD and mobile app intervention aimed at helping patients become eligible for TJA.

This lecture first discussed whether respiratory viral infections are airborne with reference to published reviews of studies before 2008, comparative trials of surgical masks and N95 respirators, and relevant new experimental studies. However, the most recent experimental study, using naturally infected influenza volunteers as the source, showed negative results from all the manikins that were exposed.

METHODS: We conducted a three‐year comparative retrospective cohort analysis of data from the National EMS Information System. Data were included if care was provided between the 40(th) and 21(st) week of the next year and compared over three‐years. We included incidents identified through 9‐1‐1 where patient contact was made. The total number of EMS incidents per week was used as the denominator to calculate the rate of patient deaths and possible injury. We assessed for temporal and seasonal trends. RESULTS: Starting in the 10(th) week of 2020 there was a decrease in the number of EMS activations in the United States compared to the prior weeks and the same time period in previous years. The number of activations between week 10 and 16 decreased by 140,292 or 26.1%. The portion of EMS activations reporting a patient disposition of death nearly doubled between the 11(th) and 15(th) week of 2020 (1.49% to 2.77% of all activations). The number of EMS activations documenting a possible injury decreased from 18.43% to 15.27% between weeks 10 and 13. CONCLUSION: We found that early in the COVID‐19 outbreak there was a significant decrease in the number of EMS responses across the United States. Simultaneously the rate of EMS attended death doubled, while the rate of injuries decreased.","Lerner, E. Brooke; Newgard, Craig D.; Mann, N.

Of the 83 children admitted between April 2009 and March 2010 with H1N1 virus infection to a tertiary children’s hospital in a European setting, five children aged between 2 and 10 years had neurological symptoms. Four patients had seizures and encephalopathy at presentation. One patient presented with ataxia; one developed neuropsychiatric manifestations, and two developed movement disorders during the disease course. Early neuroimaging showed evidence of acute necrotising encephalopathy (ANE) in one case and non-specific white matter changes in another. Initial neuroimaging was normal for the other three, but interval MRI showed increased signal in bilateral periventricular distribution in one and significant cerebral volume loss in the other. Clinical outcomes varied: two recovered fully while three had residual seizures and/or significant cognitive deficits. Conclusion An analysis of our patients along with all reported cases reveal that seizures and encephalopathy were common neurological presentations associated with pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection in children requiring hospital admission. Neuroimaging suggestive of ANE, basal ganglia involvement and volume loss appears to be associated with worse neurological outcome.","Surana, Pinki; Tang, Shan; McDougall, Marilyn; Tong, Cheuk Yan William; Menson, Esse; Lim, Ming",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21234600/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-010-1392-3,176

However, they may play additional roles in other conditions beside cancer. We performed gene expression analysis using the NanoString PanCancer IO 360 panel in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of six COVID-19 patients and we found that H-Ras gene was significantly upregulated, while both K-Ras and N-Ras genes were downregulated. In particular, H-Ras gene upregulation was more evident in COVID-19 patients with a more severe disease. We compared our results with those obtained by analyzing two different and independent datasets, including a total of 53 COVID-19 patients, in which the gene expression analysis was performed using the Immunology_V2 panel. Comparative analysis of the H-Ras gene expression in these patients confirmed our preliminary results. In both of them, in fact, we were able to confirm the upregulation of the expression of the H-Ras gene. The exact role of this specific upregulation of the H-Ras gene in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its possible role in cancer still remains to be elucidated.

We evaluated the time-to-event relationship between hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes and COVID-19 outcomes. DESIGN: We analysed data from the prospective Dutch CovidPredict cohort, an ongoing prospective study of patients admitted for COVID-19 infection. SETTING: Patients from eight participating hospitals, including two university hospitals from the CovidPredict cohort were included. PARTICIPANTS: Admitted, adult patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR or high suspicion based on CT-imaging of the thorax. Patients were followed for major outcomes during the hospitalisation. CVD risk factors were established via home medication lists and divided in antihypertensives, lipid-lowering therapy and antidiabetics. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES: The primary outcome was mortality during the first 21 days following admission, secondary outcomes consisted of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and ICU mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to determine the association with CVD risk factors. RESULTS: We included 1604 patients with a mean age of 66±15 of whom 60.5% were men. Antihypertensives, lipid-lowering therapy and antidiabetics were used by 45%, 34.7% and 22.1% of patients. After 21-days of follow-up; 19.2% of the patients had died or were discharged for palliative care. Cox regression analysis after adjustment for age and sex showed that the presence of ≥2 risk factors was associated with increased mortality risk (HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.02), but not with ICU admission. Moreover, the use of ≥2 antidiabetics and ≥2 antihypertensives was associated with mortality independent of age and sex with HRs of, respectively, 2.09 (95% CI 1.55 to 2.80) and 1.46 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.91). CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes leads to a stepwise increased risk for short-term mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients independent of age and sex.

It is recognized as a “rapid test” in the field of body health to rapidly decide whether or not a person is affected by COVID-19. So, we should now be able to use the term “rapid tele-psychotherapy” with Single-Session Music Therapy (SSMT) in the field of mental health to characterize the mechanism of assistance provided to persons who seek therapeutic assistance virtually during this COVID-19 outbreak, so that they will easily and reliably be freed from troubling psychiatric issues. METHOD: The author reports the case of a 33-year-old widow with asymptomatic COVID-19 who was admitted to her own home. RESULTS: The author describes the effectiveness of the implementation of rapid tele-psychotherapy with SSMT in reducing the scale of anxiety, panic, fear, depression, acute stress, insomnia, and delusions of death. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This case can provide new inputs or ideas for counselors/psychologists/psychiatrists/therapists who work in hospitals/institutions to provide rapid tele-psychotherapy with SSMT as therapeutic assistance for individuals who need psychotherapy in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially for COVID-19 patients/clients. Besides that, this concept is not only suitable for rapidly screening individuals that may face psychological problems and helping them better seek therapeutic assistance, but can also be used as an adjuvant therapy for psychiatric patients.","Situmorang, Dominikus David Biondi",Palliat Support Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399867/; https://doi.org/10.1017/s1478951521001425,176

Some local health committees or traditional Chinese medicine administrations recommend a variety of other ways of using traditional aromatic Chinese herbs to prevent and cure COVID-19. These involve external fumigation, use of moxibustion, and wearing of sachet. The efficacy of aromatic Chinese herbs plays a decisive role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The unique properties, chemical composition, and mechanism of action of aromatic Chinese herbs are worthy of extensive and in-depth experimental and clinical research.

Pteropid bats commonly known as flying foxes have been identified as the natural host reservoir. The Hendra virus nucleocapsid protein (HeV N) represents the most abundant viral protein produced by the host cell, and is highly immunogenic with naturally infected humans and horses producing specific antibodies towards this protein. The purpose of this study was to express and purify soluble, functionally active recombinant HeV N, suitable for use as an immunodiagnostic reagent to detect antibodies against HeV. We expressed both full-length HeV N, (HeV N(FL)), and a C-terminal truncated form, (HeV N(CORE)), using a bacterial heterologous expression system. Both HeV N constructs were engineered with an N-terminal His(x6) tag, and purified using a combination of immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Purified recombinant HeV N proteins self-assembled into soluble higher order oligomers as determined by SEC and negative-stain transmission electron microscopy. Both HeV N proteins were highly immuno-reactive with sera from animals and humans infected with either HeV or the closely related Nipah virus (NiV), but displayed no immuno-reactivity towards sera from animals infected with a non-pathogenic paramyxovirus (CedPV), or animals receiving Equivac® (HeV G glycoprotein subunit vaccine), using a Luminex-based multiplexed microsphere assay.","Pearce, Lesley A.; Yu, Meng; Waddington, Lynne J.; Barr, Jennifer A.; Scoble, Judith A.; Crameri, Gary S.; McKinstry, William J.",Protein Expr Purif,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046592815300152; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1046592815300152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196500/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2015.07.008,176

The results of the current study reveal the areas upon which such curricula should focus with respect to dental practitioners.","Mijiritsky, Eitan; Dekel-Steinkeller, Michal; Peleg, Oren; Kleinman, Shlomi; Ianculovici, Clariel; Shuster, Amir; Arbel, Shimrit; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Shacham, Maayan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18136830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202149/,176
644271,"Histopathological assessments reveal retinal vascular changes, inflammation and gliosis in patients with lethal COVID-19",2021-02-28,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether changes in medical care due to the application of COVID-19 protocols affected clinical outcomes in patients without COVID-19 during the pandemic. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study carried out in a thirty-eight-bed surgical and medical intensive care unit of a high complexity private hospital. Patients with respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit during March and April 2020 and the same months in 2019 were selected. We compared interventions and outcomes of patients without COVID-19 during the pandemic with patients admitted in 2019. The main variables analyzed were intensive care unit respiratory management, number of chest tomography scans and bronchoalveolar lavages, intensive care unit complications, and status at hospital discharge. RESULTS: In 2020, a significant reduction in the use of a high-flow nasal cannula was observed: 14 (42%) in 2019 compared to 1 (3%) in 2020. Additionally, in 2020, a significant increase was observed in the number of patients under mechanical ventilation admitted to the intensive care unit from the emergency department, 23 (69%) compared to 11 (31%) in 2019. Nevertheless, the number of patients with mechanical ventilation after 5 days of admission was similar in both years: 24 (69%) in 2019 and 26 (79%) in 2020. CONCLUSION: Intensive care unit protocols based on international recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic have produced a change in non-COVID-19 patient management. We observed a reduction in the use of a high-flow nasal cannula and an increased number of tracheal intubations in the emergency department. However, no changes in the percentage of intubated patients in the intensive care unit, the number of mechanical ventilation days or the length of stay in intensive care unit.","Huespe, Iván Alfredo; Marco, Agustina; Prado, Eduardo; Bisso, Indalecio Carboni; Coria, Pablo; Gemelli, Nicolas; Román, Eduardo San; Heras, Marcos José Las",Rev Bras Ter Intensiva,https://doi.org/10.5935/0103-507x.20210006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886854/,176

644622,COVID-19 and Healthcare Worker: What We Need to Know,2021,"In recent years, more and more construction enterprises are expanding into overseas markets, especially in underdeveloped regions such as Africa. Compared to domestic construction projects, international construction projects have been faced with more uncertainties and increased levels of safety risks to the employees in the context of political turmoil, racism, and religious conflict in the host country. This study aims to answer what risk factors contribute to the threat to the safety of overseas employees and how safety risk factors interact, using employees from Chinese international construction companies (CICCs) in Africa as an example. A total of 39 safety risk factors were selected by literature review and case study based on Heinrich’s Domino Theory of Accident Causation. To identify the critical safety risk sources and significant risk paths, a questionnaire survey was conducted among 208 professionals who have participated in construction projects in Africa. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), a total of twelve critical risk paths and five controllable risk sources were identified. The improper behaviors of the CICCs and their employees were shown to have the largest impact on the safety of Chinese employees, through the mediating effect of the criminal offense. This study provides some insights into safety risk management in international construction projects. Meanwhile, the quantitative approach proposed can also be used by other international companies or governments in identifying the safety risk paths of their overseas workers involved in international construction projects.","Jin, Chi; Li, Bo; Ye, Zhaoying; Xiang, Pengcheng",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670811/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041990,176

We report here structure, function and antigenicity of its full-length spike (S) trimer in comparison with those of other variants, including Gamma, Kappa, and previously characterized Alpha and Beta. Delta S can fuse membranes more efficiently at low levels of cellular receptor ACE2 and its pseudotyped viruses infect target cells substantially faster than all other variants tested, possibly accounting for its heightened transmissibility. Mutations of each variant rearrange the antigenic surface of the N-terminal domain of the S protein in a unique way, but only cause local changes in the receptor-binding domain, consistent with greater resistance particular to neutralizing antibodies.

647656,Testosterone's Role in COVID-19,2021-03-19,"The interferon (IFN)-regulated endoribonuclease RNase-L is involved in multiple aspects of the antimicrobial innate immune response. It is the terminal component of an RNA cleavage pathway in which dsRNA induces the production of RNase-L-activating 2-5A by the 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase. The active nuclease then cleaves ssRNAs, both cellular and viral, leading to downregulation of their expression and the generation of small RNAs capable of activating retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors or the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. This leads to IFNβ expression and IL-1β activation respectively, in addition to broader effects on immune cell function. RNase-L is also one of a growing number of innate immune components that interact with the cell cytoskeleton. It can bind to several cytoskeletal proteins, including filamin A, an actin-binding protein that collaborates with RNase-L to maintain the cellular barrier to viral entry. This antiviral activity is independent of catalytic function, a unique mechanism for RNase-L. We also describe here the interaction of RNase-L with the E3 ubiquitin ligase and scaffolding protein, ligand of nump protein X (LNX), a regulator of tight junction proteins. In order to better understand the significance and context of these novel binding partners in the antimicrobial response, other innate immune protein interactions with the cytoskeleton are also discussed.","Ezelle, Heather J.; Malathi, Krishnamurthy; Hassel, Bret A.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26760998/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms17010074,176

COVID-19 vaccination was recently launched in Uganda, with prioritization to healthcare workers and high-risk individuals. In this study, we aimed to determine the acceptability of COVID-19 vaccine among persons at high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Uganda. METHODS: Between 29 March and 14 April 2021, we conducted a cross-sectional survey consecutively recruiting persons at high risk of severe COVID-19 (diabetes mellitus, HIV and cardiovascular disease) attending Kiruddu National Referral Hospital outpatient clinics. A trained research nurse administered a semi-structured questionnaire assessing demographics, COVID-19 vaccine related attitudes and acceptability. Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multivariable analyses were performed using STATA 16. RESULTS: A total of 317 participants with a mean age 51.5 ± 14.1 years were recruited. Of this, 184 (60.5%) were female. Overall, 216 (70.1%) participants were willing to accept the COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of willingness to accept COVID-19 vaccination were four times greater if a participant was male compared with if a participant was female [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 4.1, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8–9.4, p = 0.00]. Participants who agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.38, p = 0.003) or strongly agreed (AOR: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01–0.59, p = 0.005) that they have some immunity against COVID-19 were also significantly less likely to accept the vaccine. Participants who had a history of vaccination hesitancy for their children were also significantly less likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine (AOR: 0.1, 95% CI: 0.01–0.58, p = 0.016).

METHODS: We compared seven published real-time RT–PCR assays and two new assays that we have developed. To determine the analytical sensitivity of each assay, we constructed a synthetic universal control ribonucleic acid (uncRNA) containing all of the assays’ target regions on one RNA strand and spiked human blood or urine with known quantities of African or Asian Zika virus strains. Viral loads in 33 samples from Zika virus-infected patients were determined by using one of the new assays. FINDINGS: Oligonucleotides of the published real-time RT–PCR assays, showed up to 10 potential mismatches with the Asian lineage causing the current outbreak, compared with 0 to 4 mismatches for the new assays. The 95% lower detection limit of the seven most sensitive assays ranged from 2.1 to 12.1 uncRNA copies/reaction. Two assays had lower sensitivities of 17.0 and 1373.3 uncRNA copies/reaction and showed a similar sensitivity when using spiked samples. The mean viral loads in samples from Zika virus-infected patients were 5 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of blood and 2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL of urine. CONCLUSION: We provide reagents and updated protocols for Zika virus detection suitable for the current outbreak strains. Some published assays might be unsuitable for Zika virus detection, due to the limited sensitivity and potential incompatibility with some strains. Viral concentrations in the clinical samples were close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that the use of insensitive assays will cause false-negative results.","Corman, Victor M; Rasche, Andrea; Baronti, Cecile; Aldabbagh, Souhaib; Cadar, Daniel; Reusken, Chantal BEM; Pas, Suzan D; Goorhuis, Abraham; Schinkel, Janke; Molenkamp, Richard; Kümmerer, Beate M; Bleicker, Tobias; Brünink, Sebastian; Eschbach-Bludau, Monika; Eis-Hübinger, Anna M; Koopmans, Marion P; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas; Grobusch, Martin P; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",Bull World Health Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27994281/,176

648541,CT of Postacute Lung Complications of COVID-19,2021-08-10,"BACKGROUND: Acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysmal rupture is a devastating vascular disease accounting for 5% of strokes. COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a decrease in elective and emergency admissions in the majority of neurosurgical centers. The main hypothesis was that fear of COVID-19 may have prevented patients with critical medical or surgical emergencies from actively presenting in emergency departments and outpatient clinics. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study searching our institutional data regarding the incidence of spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and compare the admissions in two different periods: the pre COVID-19 with the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The study cohort was comprised of a total of 99 patients. The mean (SD) weekly case rate of patients with SAH was 1.1 (1.1) during the pre-COVID-19 period, compared to 1.7 (1.4) during the COVID-19 period. Analysis revealed that the volume of admitted patients with SAH was 1.5-fold higher during the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period and this was statistically significant (ExpB = 1.5, CI 95% 1–2.3, p = 0.044). Difference in mortality did not reach any statistical significance between the two periods (p = 0.097), as well as patients’ length of stay (p = 0.193). CONCLUSIONS: The presented data cover a more extended time period than so far published reports; it is reasonable that our recent experience may well be demonstrating a general realistic trend of overall increase in aneurysmal rupture rates during lockdown. Hospitalization of patients with SAH cannot afford any reductions in facilities, equipment, or personnel if optimum outcomes are desirable.","Theofanopoulos, Andreas; Fermeli, Dionysia; Boulieris, Spyros; Kalantzis, George; Kefalopoulou, Zinovia; Panagiotopoulos, Vasilios; Papadakos, Dimitrios; Constantoyannis, Constantine",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05190-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745041/,176

However, there is often a lack of local data from these countries to inform practice and policy improvements. Generating locally contextualized evidence base for NCDs that can help identify gaps, aid decision-making and improve patient care in LMICs needs an innovative approach. The approach used in Mapping the Patient Journey Towards Actionable Beyond the Pill Solutions (MAPS) is designed to quantitatively map different stages of the patient journey in four critical NCDs, ie, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and pain (chronic and neuropathic) across selected LMICs in Africa, the Middle East, South East Asia, and Latin America. The key touchpoints along the patient journey include awareness, screening, diagnosis, treatment, adherence, and control or remission. MAPS employs an evidence mapping methodology that follows a three-step semi-systematic review: 1) systematic peer-reviewed database search; 2) unstructured searches of local or real-world data; and 3) expert opinion. Evidence generation and visualization is based on locally validated and deduplicated data published over the last 10 years. This approach will be the first to provide quantitative mapping of the different stages of the patient journey for selected NCDs in LMICs. By focusing on local, patient-centric data, the goal of the MAPS initiative is to address and prioritize local research and knowledge gaps, then contribute to evidence-based, high-quality, and affordable advances in the management of NCDs in LMICs. This will ultimately improve patient outcomes and contribute towards the achievement of global NCD targets.","Bharatan, Tanaya; Devi, Ratna; Huang, Pai-Hui; Javed, Afzal; Jeffers, Barrett; Lansberg, Peter; Sidhu, Kaveri; Subramaniam, Kannan",J Healthc Leadersh,https://doi.org/10.2147/jhl.s288966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33542673/,176

One of the promising options is cells from the olfactory neuroepithelium, which contains neuronal progenitors that ensure the regeneration of olfactory receptors. These cells are easy to obtain with nasal biopsies and it is possible to grow and cultivate them in vitro. In this work, we used RNAseq expression profiling and immunofluorescence microscopy to characterise neurospheres-derived cells (NDC), that simply and reliably grow from neurospheres (NS) obtained from nasal biopsies. We utilized differential expression analysis to explore the molecular changes that occur during transition from NS to NDC. We found that processes associated with neuronal and vascular cells are downregulated in NDC. A comparison with public transcriptomes revealed a depletion of neuronal and glial components in NDC. We also discovered that NDC have several metabolic features specific to neuronal progenitors treated with the fungicide maneb. Thus, while NDC retain some neuronal/glial identity, additional protocol alterations are needed to use NDC for mass sample collection in psychiatric research.","Zelenova, Elena A.; Kondratyev, Nikolay V.; Lezheiko, Tatyana V.; Tsarapkin, Grigoriy Y.; Kryukov, Andrey I.; Kishinevsky, Alexander E.; Tovmasyan, Anna S.; Momotyuk, Ekaterina D.; Dashinimaev, Erdem B.; Golimbet, Vera E.",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34359860/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10071690,176
651215,Encephalopathy and seizure activity in a COVID-19 well controlled HIV patient,2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND: A second wave of COVID-19 cases in autumn, 2020, in England led to localised, tiered restrictions (so-called alert levels) and, subsequently, a second national lockdown. We examined the impact of these tiered restrictions, and alternatives for lockdown stringency, timing, and duration, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19. METHODS: We fit an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to data on hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy (ISARIC4C/COVID-19 Clinical Information Network, National Health Service [NHS] England), seroprevalence (Office for National Statistics, UK Biobank, REACT-2 study), virology (REACT-1 study), and deaths (Public Health England) across the seven NHS England regions from March 1, to Oct 13, 2020. We analysed mobility (Google Community Mobility) and social contact (CoMix study) data to estimate the effect of tiered restrictions implemented in England, and of lockdowns implemented in Northern Ireland and Wales, in October, 2020, and projected epidemiological scenarios for England up to March 31, 2021. FINDINGS: We estimated a reduction in the effective reproduction number (R(t)) of 2% (95% credible interval [CrI] 0–4) for tier 2, 10% (6–14) for tier 3, 35% (30–41) for a Northern Ireland-stringency lockdown with schools closed, and 44% (37–49) for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools closed. From Oct 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, a projected COVID-19 epidemic without tiered restrictions or lockdown results in 280 000 (95% projection interval 274 000–287 000) hospital admissions and 58 500 (55 800–61 100) deaths. Tiered restrictions would reduce hospital admissions to 238 000 (231 000–245 000) and deaths to 48 600 (46 400–50 700). From Nov 5, 2020, a 4-week Wales-type lockdown with schools remaining open—similar to the lockdown measures announced in England in November, 2020—was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 186 000 (179 000–193 000) and deaths to 36 800 (34 900–38 800). Closing schools was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 157 000 (152 000–163 000) and deaths to 30 300 (29 000–31 900). A projected lockdown of greater than 4 weeks would reduce deaths but would bring diminishing returns in reducing peak pressure on hospital services. An earlier lockdown would have reduced deaths and hospitalisations in the short term, but would lead to a faster resurgence in cases after January, 2021. In a post-hoc analysis, we estimated that the second lockdown in England (Nov 5–Dec 2) reduced R(t) by 22% (95% CrI 15–29), rather than the 32% (25–39) reduction estimated for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools open. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown measures outperform less stringent restrictions in reducing cumulative deaths. We projected that the lockdown policy announced to commence in England on Nov 5, with a similar stringency to the lockdown adopted in Wales, would reduce pressure on the health service and would be well timed to suppress deaths over the winter period, while allowing schools to remain open. Following completion of the analysis, we analysed new data from November, 2020, and found that despite similarities in policy, the second lockdown in England had a smaller impact on behaviour than did the second lockdown in Wales, resulting in more deaths and hospitalisations than we originally projected when focusing on a Wales-stringency scenario for the lockdown.

653210,Anxiety persists after recovery from acquired COVID-19 in anaesthesiologists,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly changed the work of general practitioners (GPs). At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, German outpatient practices had to adapt quickly. Pandemic preparedness (PP) of GPs may play a vital role in their management of a pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to examine the association in the stock of seven personal protective equipment (PPE) items and knowledge of pandemic plans on perceived PP among GPs. METHODS: Three multivariable linear regression models were developed based on an online cross-sectional survey for the period March–April 2020 (the onset of the pandemic in Germany). Data were collected using self-developed items on self-assessed PP and knowledge of a pandemic plan and its utility. The stock of seven PPE items was queried. For PPE items, three different PPE scores were compared. Control variables for all models were gender and age. RESULTS: In total, 508 GPs were included in the study; 65.16% believed that they were very poorly or poorly prepared. Furthermore, 13.83% of GPs were aware of a pandemic plan; 40% rated those plans as beneficial. The stock of FFP-2/3 masks, protective suits, face shields, safety glasses, and medical face masks were mostly considered completely insufficient or insufficient, whereas disposable gloves and disinfectants were considered sufficient or completely sufficient. The stock of PPE was significantly positively associated with PP and had the largest effect on PP; the association of the knowledge of a pandemic plan was significant but small. PPE scores did not vary considerably in their explanatory power. The assessment of a pandemic plan as beneficial did not significantly affect PP. CONCLUSION: The stock of PPE seems to be the determining factor for PP among German GPs; for COVID-19, sufficient masks are the determining factor. Knowledge of a pandemic plans play a secondary role in PP.","Stöcker, Arno; Demirer, Ibrahim; Gunkel, Sophie; Hoffmann, Jan; Mause, Laura; Ohnhäuser, Tim; Scholten, Nadine",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34383827/,176

654555,Validity of Data Collected from Randomized Behavioral Clinical Trials During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-09-26,"Post-mortem surveillance in Ireland discloses skin-test negative cattle with presumptive evidence of infection of Mycobacterium bovis (lesions at routine slaughter (LRS)), the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB). Laboratory confirmation of lesions has impacts on trade restrictions for herds, therefore if laboratory capacity was diminished, how herds are treated would require an informed risk policy. Here we report the proportion of herds with subsequent evidence of within-herd transmission, based on skin-test results. We assess how herd-size, herd-type, and bTB-history affect the probability of additional reactors at follow-up test using univariable and multivariable random-effects models. The study represents a rapid response to developing an evidential base for policy demands during an extraordinary event, the COVID-19 epidemic in Ireland. A dataset from 2005 to 2019 of breakdowns were collated. Overall, 20,116 breakdowns were initiated by LRS cases. During the index tests of these breakdowns, 3931 revealed ≥1 skin-test reactor animals (19.54%; ≥1 standard reactors: 3827; 19.02%). Increasing herd-size was associated with reactor disclosure on follow-up. For small herds (<33 animals), 11.74% of follow-up tests disclosed ≥1 reactor; 24.63% of follow-up tests from very large herds (>137) disclosed ≥1 reactors. Beef (13.87%) and “other” (13%) herd production types had lower proportion of index tests with reactors in comparison with dairy (28.27%) or suckler (20.48%) herds. Historic breakdown size during the previous 3-years was associated reactor disclosure risk on follow-up. Our results are useful for rapid tailored policy development aimed at identifying higher risk herds.

655994,Dietary Behaviors and Incident COVID-19 in the UK Biobank,2021-06-20,"PURPOSE: Covid-19 is a pandemic of unprecedented proportion, whose understanding and management is still under way. In the emergency setting new or available therapies to contrast the spread of COVID-19 are urgently needed. Elderly males, especially those affected by previous diseases or with comorbidities, are more prone to develop interstitial pneumonia that can deteriorate evolving to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) that require hospitalization in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Even children and young patients are not spared by SARS-CoV 2 infection, yet they seem to develop a milder form of disease. In this setting the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D, should be further investigated. Methods: We reviewed the literature about the immunomodulatory role of Vitamin D collecting data from the databases Medline and Embase. RESULTS: Vitamin D proved to interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and β-defensins, and adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin secretion by plasma cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function. Promising results have been extensively described as regards the supplementation of vitamin D in respiratory tract infections, autoimmune diseases and even pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In this review, we suggest that vitamin D supplementation might play a role in the prevention and/or treatment to SARS-CoV-2 infection disease, by modulating the immune response to the virus both in the adult and pediatric population.","Panfili, F.

656005,Impact of restrictions due to COVID-19 on a quality-assured screening colonoscopy program,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Endovascular revascularization has established as the first-line therapy of femoropopliteal artery disease. Paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty proved to be superior to plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) regarding prevention of restenosis and need for recurrent revascularization. Over the past years, paclitaxel was the only active drug to inhibit neointimal proliferation which could be processed to an appropriate balloon coating. The purpose of this study is to assess whether efficacy and safety of sirolimus-coated balloon angioplasty is noninferior to paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty. METHODS: This randomized controlled, single-blinded, multicentre, investigator-initiated noninferiority trial aims to enrol a total of 478 participants with symptomatic femoropopliteal artery disease of Rutherford category 2 to 4 due to de novo stenosis or restenosis. After pre-dilation, participants will be allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either sirolimus- or paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty. Post-dilation with the drug-coated balloon (DCB) used or standard balloon is mandatory in case ≥ 50%, and optional in case of ≥ 30% residual diameter stenosis. Bailout stenting with bare-metal nitinol stents should be conducted in case of flow-limiting dissection. Primary noninferiority endpoints are primary patency and the composite of all-cause mortality, major target limb amputation, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are clinical and hemodynamic improvement, change in health-related quality of life, and safety throughout 60 months. DISCUSSION: Although concerns about long-term safety of paclitaxel-coated devices were not confirmed by recent patient-level data analyses, conflicting evidence contributed to a loss of confidence among patients and physicians. Therefore, sirolimus, known for a broader therapeutic range than paclitaxel, may serve as a welcome alternative. This will be justified if noninferiority of sirolimus-coated balloon angioplasty against the current standard of paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty can be demonstrated.

In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged patients with ""re-examination positive"" may be due to low viral load, and the ability of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the discharge criteria of low viral load patients.","zhou, y.; Pei, F.; Wang, L.; Zhao, H.; Li, H.; Ji, M.; Yang, W.; Wang, Q.; Zhao, Q.; Wang, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20083956; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20083956v1?rss=1,176

We hypothesized that machine learning-based classifiers can reliably distinguish the CXR images of COVID-19 patients from other forms of pneumonia. We used a dimensionality reduction method to generate a set of optimal features of CXR images to build an efficient machine learning classifier that can distinguish COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases with high accuracy and sensitivity. By using global features of the whole CXR images, we successfully implemented our classifier using a relatively small dataset of CXR images.

In this article our goal is to study the missing peak, i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April 7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model, introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1] (for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4 populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths. Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this parameter we recover the generalized Logistic model used in [1] for these three countries.

658231,Potential for bias in assessing risk and protective factors for COVID-19: Commentary on Conlon et al.’s “Impact of the influenza vaccination on COVID-19 infection rates and severity”,2021-07-20,"Pulmonary infections are among the most common and important infectious diseases due to their high morbidity and mortality, especially in older and immunocompromised individuals. However, due to the limitations in sensitivity and the long turn-around time (TAT) of conventional diagnostic methods, pathogen detection and identification methods for pulmonary infection with greater diagnostic efficiency are urgently needed. In recent years, unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) has been widely used to detect different types of infectious pathogens, and is especially useful for the detection of rare and newly emergent pathogens, showing better diagnostic performance than traditional methods. There has been limited research exploring the application of mNGS for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections. In this study we evaluated the diagnostic efficiency and clinical impact of mNGS on pulmonary infections. A total of 100 respiratory samples were collected from patients diagnosed with pulmonary infection in Shanghai, China. Conventional methods, including culture and standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel analysis for respiratory tract viruses, and mNGS were used for the pathogen detection in respiratory samples. The difference in the diagnostic yield between conventional methods and mNGS demonstrated that mNGS had higher sensitivity than traditional culture for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and fungi (95% vs 54%; p<0.001). Although mNGS had lower sensitivity than PCR for diagnosing viral infections, it identified 14 viral species that were not detected using conventional methods, including multiple subtypes of human herpesvirus. mNGS detected viruses with a genome coverage >95% and a sequencing depth >100× and provided reliable phylogenetic and epidemiological information. mNGS offered extra benefits, including a shorter TAT. As a complementary approach to conventional methods, mNGS could help improving the identification of respiratory infection agents. We recommend the timely use of mNGS when infection of mixed or rare pathogens is suspected, especially in immunocompromised individuals and or individuals with severe conditions that require urgent treatment.","Qian, Yi-Yi; Wang, Hong-Yu; Zhou, Yang; Zhang, Hao-Cheng; Zhu, Yi-Min; Zhou, Xian; Ying, Yue; Cui, Peng; Wu, Hong-Long; Zhang, Wen-Hong; Jin, Jia-Lin; Ai, Jing-Wen",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585263/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.567615,176

Also, it is suspected to be associated with feline renal diseases including tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN), which affects domestic cats with a high incidence rate. RESULTS: To clarify the state of FmoPV infection among domestic cats in Japan, an epidemiological survey was conducted. Twenty-one out of 100 cats were found to have serum antibodies (Ab) against FmoPV-N protein by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IF) using FmoPV-N protein-expressing HeLa cells. Twenty-two of the cats were positive for FmoPV RNA in the urine and/or renal tissues. In total, 29 cats were positive for Ab and/or viral RNA. These FmoPV-infected cats were classified into three different phases of infection: RNA+/Ab + (14 cats), RNA+/Ab- (8 cats) and RNA-/Ab + (7 cats). In immunohistochemistry (IHC), 19 out of 29 cats were positive for FmoPV-N protein in kidney tissues; however, the FmoPV-N protein was located in the inflammatory lesions with severe grade in only four out of the 19 cats. Since 15 out of 29 infected cats were positive for viral RNA and Ab, approximately half of the infected cats were persistently infected with FmoPV. CONCLUSIONS: A statistically significant difference was observed between infection of FmoPV and the presence of inflammatory changes in renal lesions, indicating a relationship between FmoPV infection and feline renal diseases. However, we could not obtain histopathological evidence of a relationship between FmoPV infection and TIN.","Park, Eun-Sil; Suzuki, Michio; Kimura, Masanobu; Mizutani, Hiroshi; Saito, Ryuichi; Kubota, Nami; Hasuike, Youko; Okajima, Jungo; Kasai, Hidemi; Sato, Yuko; Nakajima, Noriko; Maruyama, Keiji; Imaoka, Koichi; Morikawa, Shigeru",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27724851/,176

We revisit several variants of the SEIR-model and investigate various adjustments to the model in order to achieve output consistent with measured data in Manaus, India and Stockholm. In particular, Stockholm is interesting due to the almost constant NPI's, which substantially simplifies the mathematical modeling. Analyzing mobility data for Stockholm, we argue that neither behavioral changes, age and activity stratification nor NPI's alone are sufficient to explain the observed pandemic progression. We find that the most plausible hypothesis is that a large portion of the population, between 40 to 65 percent, have some protection against infection with the original variant of SARS-CoV-2.","Carlsson, M.; Hatem, G.; Soderberg-Naucler, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.21.21255782v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.21.21255782,176

In particular, our argumentations focus on the comprehensive management of fatigue persisting after the resolution of the acute infection. This sequela seems to be the most frequent disabling outcome, leading to a delay in social reintegration and return to working life. We suggest that spa facilities including multidisciplinary interventions and trained staffs could be an appropriate setting for providing rehabilitative protocols to treat chronic fatigue in post COVID-19 subjects. Spa treatments may improve the physical symptoms of chronic fatigue and modulate the immune imbalance, reducing persisting inflammation. Moreover, in the spa setting, specific respiratory rehabilitation and neuropsychological interventions could be provided. The rehabilitative protocol could also properly address comorbidities. In conclusion, respecting the hygiene and preventive measures, the spa setting could represent the appropriate environment to take care of post-COVID chronic fatigue, offering adequate and multidisciplinary rehabilitation protocols. Further, prospective trials on this topic are needed to fully evaluate the positive impact of a comprehensive rehabilitative treatment in the spa environment for subjects with post-COVID-19 fatigue.

Early safe reintroduction of immune individuals into the workforce may be essential to protecting the economic welfare of communities. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction testing, our primary diagnostic tool to date, has sensitivity and timing concerns, owing to sampling/handling errors, as well as a complex virus–host interaction. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction assays do not establish immune status once the virus has been cleared. Targeted serosurveillance for the determination of individuals’ potential for transmissibility, particularly if paired with direct pathogen testing, may aid in “cleared for business” decision-making.","Krsak, Martin; Johnson, Steven C.; Poeschla, Eric M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329432/,176

The host-pathogen interactions in B. pseudomallei infection largely remain the tip of the iceberg. The pathological manifestations are protean ranging from acute to chronic involving one or more visceral organs leading to septic shock, especially in individuals with underlying conditions similar to COVID-19. Pathogenesis is attributed to the intracellular ability of the bacterium to ‘step into’ the host cell’s cytoplasm from the endocytotic vacuole, where it appears to polymerize actin filaments to spread across cells in the closer vicinity. B. pseudomallei effectively evades the host’s surveillance armory to remain latent for prolonged duration also causing relapses despite antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, eradication of intracellular B. pseudomallei is highly dependent on robust cellular immune responses. However, it remains ambiguous why certain individuals in endemic areas experience asymptomatic seroconversion, whereas others succumb to sepsis-associated sequelae. Here, we propose key insights on how the host’s surveillance radars get commandeered by B. pseudomallei.","Mariappan, Vanitha; Vellasamy, Kumutha Malar; Barathan, Muttiah; Girija, A. S.

In the present study, we found that without any stimulation, CD4(+) T cells in pleural fluid cells (PFCs) from patients with TBP expressed significantly higher levels of CD69 than PBMCs from patients with tuberculosis (TB) or healthy donors. CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells expressed T-bet and IL-12Rβ2. After stimulation with MTB-specific antigens, CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α than CD4(+)CD69(−) T cells, demonstrating that CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were MTB-specific Th1 cells. In addition, CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were mostly polyfunctional Th1 cells that simultaneously produced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α and displayed an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA(−)CCR7(−)CD62L(−)CD27(−)). Moreover, the percentages of CD4(+)CD69(+) T cells were significantly and positively correlated with polyfunctional T cells. Interestingly, sorted CD4(+)CD69(+) but not CD4(+)CD69(−) fractions by flow cytometry produced IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α that were significantly regulated by CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells. Taken together, based on the expression of CD69, we found a direct quantitative and qualitative method to detect and evaluate the in vivo generated MTB-specific polyfunctional CD4(+) T cells in PFCs from patients with TBP. This method can be used for the potential diagnosis and enrichment or isolation of MTB-specific Th1 cells in the investigations.","Li, Li; Qiao, Dan; Fu, Xiaoying; Lao, Suihua; Zhang, Xianlan; Wu, Changyou",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0023700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21887301/,176
664634,Conducting Translational Gastrointestinal Research in the Era of COVID-19,2020-08-26,"Laboratory diagnosis plays one of the key roles in the diagnosis of many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The methods underlying the in vitro study of many CVD biomarkers, including cardiac troponins (cTnI and cTnT), are imperfect and are continually being improved to enhance their analytical performance, with sensitivity and specificity being the most important. Recently developed improved cTnI and cTnT detection methods, referred to as highly sensitive methods (hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT), have changed many of our ideas about the biology of cardiac troponins and opened up a number of additional diagnostic capabilities for practical healthcare. This article systematizes some relevant data on the biology of cardiac troponins as well as on methods for determining cTnI and cTnT with an analysis of the diagnostic value of their analytical characteristics (limit of blank, limit of detection, 99th percentile, coefficient of variation, and others). Data on extracardiac expression of cTnI and cTnT, mechanisms of formation and potential clinical significance of gender, age, and circadian characteristics of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT content in serum are discussed. Considerable attention is paid to the discussion of new diagnostic capabilities of hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT, including consideration of promising possibilities for their study in biological fluids that can be obtained by non-invasive methods. Also, some possibilities of using hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT as prognostic laboratory biomarkers in healthy people (for example, to assess the risk of developing CVD) and in patients suffering from a number of pathological conditions that cause damage to cardiomyocytes are examined, and the potential mechanisms underlying the increase in hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT are discussed.","Chaulin, Aleksey",Vasc Health Risk Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/vhrm.s300002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113117/,176

665390,A Laboratory Risk Assessment during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020-04-16,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to major changes in clinical practice on a global scale in order to protect patients. This includes the identification of vulnerable patients who should “shield” in order to reduce the likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV2. We used national specialty guidance and an adapted screening tool to risk stratify patients identified from our prescribing and monitoring databases, and identify those needing to shield (score ≥ 3) using information from departmental letters, online general practice records and recent laboratory investigations. We collated underlying rheumatological conditions and risk factors. Two months into the shielding process, we examined the COVID-19 status of these patients using hospital laboratory records and compared to population level data. Of 887 patients assessed, 248 (28%) scored ≥ 3 and were sent a standard shielding letter. The most common risk factor in the shielding letter group was age ≥ 70 years and/or presence of a listed co-morbidity (199 patients). The most common rheumatology conditions were rheumatoid arthritis (69.4%), polymyalgia rheumatica (8.5%) and giant cell arteritis (8.5%). Coronavirus incidence rates were similar in the shielding letter group (0.403%) and in the UK population (0.397%). However, we found a trend towards lower incidence (0.113%) in our whole cohort (RR 0.28, 95%CI 0.04–2.01 for the whole cohort compared to UK population). The trend towards lower incidence in this cohort could be because of prior education regarding general infection risk and response to public health messages. While risk stratification and shielding could be effective, prior education regarding general infection risk and public health messages to enhance health protection behaviours during a pandemic may have equal or more important roles.","Kipps, Sarah; Paul, Anindita; Vasireddy, Sreekanth",Clin Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05494-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174109/,176

We aimed to compare the incidence of candidemia in ICU patients with and without COVID‐19, and to investigate epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of candidemia patients and risk factors for mortality in candidemia patients. This retrospective study was conducted in patients followed in the ICUs of Ankara City Hospital for 2 years, divided into pre‐pandemic and pandemic periods. The incidence (event per 1000 patient‐days) and epidemiology of candidemia, clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients were compared in COVID‐19 and non‐COVID‐19 groups. Candidemia incidence was higher in the COVID‐19 group (2.16, 95% CI 1.77–2.60) than the non‐COVID‐19 group (1.06, 95% CI 0.89–0.125) (p < .001). A total of 236 candidemia episodes (105 in COVID‐19 patients and 131 in non‐COVID‐19 patients) were detected during the study periods. COVID‐19 cases had a higher rate of corticosteroid use (63.8% vs. 9.9%, p < .001). Epidemiology of candidemia and antifungal susceptibility were similar. Candidemia developed 2 weeks earlier in COVID‐19 groups and resulted in higher mortality (92.5% vs. 79.4%, p .005). One‐third of candidemia patients died before receiving any antifungal treatment, and this rate was higher in the COVID‐19 group. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, corticosteroid use, presence of sepsis and age older than 65 years were independent risk factors for mortality in candidemia patients. Candidemia with high mortality is a more serious problem for COVID‐19 patients due to its increased incidence, earlier occurrence and a higher rate of mortality.","Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Kaya Kalem, Ayşe; Bilgic, Zeynep; Asilturk, Dilek; Hasanoglu, Imran; Ayhan, Muge; Tezer Tekce, Yasemin; Erdem, Deniz; Turan, Sema; Mumcuoglu, Ipek; Guner, Rahmet",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13332; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085319/,176

We aimed to assess physicians’ attitude among different medical specialties towards this sudden and unexpected shift of traditional face-to-face meetings into webinars, and to suggest future recommendations. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, internet-based survey study using a 25-item questionnaire, from November 1 and November 15, 2020. The survey was created and distributed to physicians from different medical and surgical specialties and from different countries via several social media platforms, using a snowball technique. RESULTS: A total of 326 physicians responded; 165 (50.6%) were females, mean age of responders was 38.7 ± 7.5 years. The majority of responses (93.2%) came from Arab countries. Of them, 195 (59.8%) reported attending more webinars compared to the same period last year, with average of 3 per month. As regard to the general impression; 244 (74.8%) were “strongly satisfied” or “satisfied”, with the most satisfaction for “training courses: by 268 (82.2%), and “International conferences” by 218 (66.9%). However, 246 respondents (75.5%) felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars during the pandemic, 171 (52.5%) reported attending less than 25% of webinars they are invited to, 205 (62.8%) disagreed that webinars can replace in-person meetings after the pandemic, and 239 (73.3%) agreed that online meetings need proper regulations. CONCLUSIONS: Webinars comprised a major avenue for education during COVID-19 pandemic, with initial general satisfaction among physicians. However, this paradigm shift was sudden and lacked proper regulations. Despite initial satisfaction, the majority of physicians felt overwhelmed with the number and frequency of webinars. Physicians’ satisfaction is crucial in planning future educational activities, and considering that this current crisis will most likely have long lasting effects, webinars should be viewed as complementing traditional in-person methods, rather than replacement. In this study, we are suggesting recommendations to help future regulation of this change.","Ismail, Ismail Ibrahim; Abdelkarim, Ahmed; Al-Hashel, Jasem Y.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861799/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250241,176

Little is known about the laboratory surface areas and operation behaviors that may cause potential contamination in SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing. This study aims to provide reference basis for the improvement of laboratory disinfection programs and personal operating protocols. In this study, we compared the qRT-PCR and ddPCR in detecting of residual virus that existed on the object surfaces from sample transportation and reception related facilities, testing related instruments, personal protective equipment and other facilities in nucleic acid testing laboratory. All samples were negative by qRT-PCR, in contrast, 13 of 61 samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by ddPCR. The areas with highest density of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid were the outer gloves of operator A (37.4 copies/cm2), followed by door handle of 4 °C refrigerator (26.25 copies/cm2), goggles of operator A (22.16 copies/cm2), outer cover of high speed centrifuge (19.95 copies/cm2), inner wall of high speed centrifuge (14.70 copies/cm2) and others. We found that all the positive objects were directly or indirectly contacted by the operator's gloved hands, suggesting that hands contact was the main transmission pathway that led to laboratory environmental contamination. In summary, ddPCR has an advantage over qRT-PCR in tracing laboratory contamination.

We describe the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in students and staff in the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) region in the first three months of the 2020/2021 academic year, and examine the extent of transmission in schools. Methods: This descriptive epidemiologic study using contact tracing data included all SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to VCH between September 10 and December 18, 2020 who worked in or attended K-12 schools in-person. Case and cluster characteristics were described. Results: There were 699 school staff and student cases during the study period, for an incidence of 55 cases per 10,000 population, compared to 73 per 10,000 population in all VCH residents. Among VCH resident staff and student cases, 53% were linked to a household case/cluster, <1.5% were hospitalized and there were no deaths. Out of 699 cases present at school, 26 clusters with school-based transmission resulted in 55 secondary cases. Staff members accounted for 54% of index cases (14/26) while comprising 14% of the school population. Among clusters, 88% had fewer than 4 secondary cases. Interpretation: COVID-19 incidence in the school population was lower than that of the general population. There were no deaths and severe disease was rare.

METHODS We downloaded COVID-19 time series surveillance data from the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment by report and illness onset dates for 9-Mar-2020 to 30-Sep-2020. We used existing Bayesian methods to first adjust for misclassification in testing and surveillance, followed by deconvolution of date of infection. We propagated forward uncertainty from each step corresponding to 10,000 posterior time-series of doubly adjusted epidemic curves. The effective reproduction number (Rt), a parameter of principal interest in tracking the pandemic, gauged the impact of the adjustment on inference. RESULTS Observed period prevalence was 1.3%; median of the posterior of true (adjusted) prevalence was 1.7% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 1.4%, 1.8%). Sensitivity of surveillance declined over the course of the epidemic from a median of 88.8% (95% CrI: 86.3%, 89.8%) to a median of 60.8% (95% CrI: 60.1%, 62.6%). The mean (minimum, maximum) values of Rt were higher and more variable by report date, 1.12 (0.77, 4.13), compared to those following adjustment, 1.05 (0.89, 1.73). The epidemic curve by report date tended to overestimate Rt early on and be more susceptible to fluctuations in data. CONCLUSION Adjusting for epidemic curves based on surveillance data is necessary if estimates of missed cases and the effective reproduction number play a role in management of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Goldstein, Neal D; Quick, Harrison; Burstyn, Igor",Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310444/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ede.0000000000001402,176

Given the large number of patients affected, healthcare personnel and facility resources are stretched to the limit; however, the need for urgent and emergent neurosurgical care continues. This article describes best practices when performing neurosurgical procedures on patients with COVID-19 based on multi-institutional experiences. METHODS: We assembled neurosurgical practitioners from 13 different health systems from across the USA, including those in hot spots, to describe their practices in managing neurosurgical emergencies within the COVID-19 environment. RESULTS: Patients presenting with neurosurgical emergencies should be considered as persons under investigation (PUI) and thus maximal personal protective equipment (PPE) should be donned during interaction and transfer. Intubations and extubations should be done with only anesthesia staff donning maximal PPE in a negative pressure environment. Operating room (OR) staff should enter the room once the air has been cleared of particulate matter. Certain OR suites should be designated as covid ORs, thus allowing for all neurosurgical cases on covid/PUI patients to be performed in these rooms, which will require a terminal clean post procedure. Each COVID OR suite should be attached to an anteroom which is a negative pressure room with a HEPA filter, thus allowing for donning and doffing of PPE without risking contamination of clean areas. CONCLUSION: Based on a multi-institutional collaborative effort, we describe best practices when providing neurosurgical treatment for patients with COVID-19 in order to optimize clinical care and minimize the exposure of patients and staff.","Pandey, Aditya S; Ringer, Andrew J; Rai, Ansaar T; Kan, Peter; Jabbour, Pascal; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Riina, Howard; Tanweer, Omar; Levitt, Michael R; Kim, Louis J; Veznedaroglu, Erol; Binning, Mandy J; Arthur, Adam S; Mocco, J; Schirmer, Clemens; Thompson, Byron Gregory; Langer, David",J Neurointerv Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434798/; https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2020-016161,176

The viral inactivation rate, virus half-life, and percentage of titer reduction after UV-C irradiation were assessed. Infectivity was maintained on plastic and glass until 120 h and on stainless steel until 72 h. The virus half-life was 5.3, 4.4, and 4.2 h on plastic, stainless steel, and glass, respectively. In all cases, titer decay was >99% after drop drying. UV-C irradiation efficiently reduced virus titer (99.99%), with doses ranging from 10.25 to 23.71 mJ/cm(2). Plastic and stainless steel needed higher doses to achieve target reduction. The total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on glass was obtained with the lower dose applied. SARS-CoV-2 survival can be long lasting on inanimate surfaces. It is worth recommending efficient disinfection protocols as a measure of prevention of viral spread. UV-C can provide rapid, efficient and sustainable sanitization procedures of different materials and surfaces.

The associated bleeding risk remains unknown. We investigated major bleeding complications in ICU COVID-19 patients and we examined their relationship with inflammation and thromboprophylaxis. Retrospective monocentric study of consecutive adult patients admitted in ICU for COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Data collected included demographics, anticoagulation status, coagulation tests and outcomes including major bleeding and thrombotic events. Among 56 ICU COVID-19 patients, 10 (18%) patients had major bleeding and 16 (29%) thrombotic events. Major bleeding occurred later than thrombosis after ICU admission [17(14–23) days versus 9(3–11) days respectively (p = 0.005)]. Fibrinogen concentration always decreased several days [4(3–5) days] before bleeding; D-dimers followed the same trend. All bleeding patients were treated with anticoagulants and anticoagulation was overdosed for 6 (60%) patients on the day of bleeding or the day before. In the whole cohort, overdose was measured in 22 and 78% of patients receiving therapeutic anticoagulation during fibrinogen increase and decrease respectively (p < 0.05). Coagulation disorders had biphasic evolution during COVID-19: first thrombotic events during initial hyperinflammation, then bleeding events once inflammation reduced, as confirmed by fibrinogen and d-dimers decrease. Most bleeding events complicated heparin overdose, promoted by inflammation decrease, suggesting to carefully monitor heparin during COVID-19. Thromboprophylaxis may be adapted to this biphasic evolution, with initial high doses reduced to standard doses once the high thrombotic risk period ends and fibrinogen decreases, to prevent bleeding events.","Godier, Anne; Clausse, Darless; Meslin, Simon; Bazine, Myriame; Lang, Elodie; Huche, Florian; Cholley, Bernard; Hamada, Sophie Rym",J Thromb Thrombolysis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646501/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11239-021-02403-9,176

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled experimental study. ANIMALS: Eighteen female Himalayan rabbits, weight 2.1 ± 0.1 kg. METHODS: Premedication with 0.1 mg kg(−1) medetomidine and 5 mg kg(−1) carprofen subcutaneously, was followed by intravenous anaesthetic induction with sufentanil (2.3 μg mL(−1)) and midazolam (0.45 mg mL(−1)). After endotracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with sufentanil-midazolam (n = 9) or sevoflurane (n = 9). Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Intermittent positive pressure ventilation was performed as required. Physiological variables were studied perioperatively. Group means of physiologic data were generated for different anaesthetic periods. Data were compared for changes from sedation, and between groups by anova. Post-operatively, 0.05 mg kg(−1) buprenorphine was administered once and 5 mg kg(−1) carprofen once daily for 2–3 days. Rabbits were examined and weighed daily until one week after surgery. RESULTS: Smooth induction of anaesthesia was achieved within 5 minutes. Sufentanil and midazolam doses were 0.5 μg kg(−1) and 0.1 mg kg(−1), during induction and 3.9 μg kg(−1) hour(−1) and 0.8 mg kg(−1) hour(−1) during surgery, respectively. End-tidal sevoflurane concentration was 2.1% during surgery. Assisted ventilation was required in nine rabbits receiving sufentanil-midazolam and four receiving sevoflurane. There were no differences between groups in physiologic data other than arterial carbon dioxide. In rabbits receiving sevoflurane, mean arterial pressure decreased pre-surgical intervention, heart rate increased 25% during and after surgery and body weight decreased 4% post-operatively. Post-operative problems sometimes resulted from catheterization of the ear artery. CONCLUSION: Sevoflurane and sufentanil-midazolam provided surgical anaesthesia of similar quality. Arterial blood pressure was sustained during sufentanil-midazolam anaesthesia and rabbits receiving sevoflurane lost body weight following ovariohysterectomy. Mechanical ventilation was required with both anaesthetic regimens.

674180,A Global Respiratory Perspective on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Commentary and Action Proposals,2020-06-25,"Some immune system cells express type A and/or type B γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)-Rs and/or GABA(B)-Rs). Treatment with GABA, which activates both GABA(A)-Rs and GABA(B)-Rs), and/or a GABA(A)-R-specific agonist inhibits disease progression in mouse models of type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and COVID-19. Little is known about the clinical potential of specifically modulating GABA(B)-Rs. Here, we tested lesogaberan, a peripherally restricted GABA(B)-R agonist, as an interventive therapy in diabetic NOD mice. Lesogaberan treatment temporarily restored normoglycemia in most newly diabetic NOD mice. Combined treatment with a suboptimal dose of lesogaberan and proinsulin/alum immunization in newly diabetic NOD mice or a low-dose anti-CD3 in severely hyperglycemic NOD mice greatly increased T1D remission rates relative to each monotherapy. Mice receiving combined lesogaberan and anti-CD3 displayed improved glucose tolerance and, unlike mice that received anti-CD3 alone, had some islets with many insulin(+) cells, suggesting that lesogaberan helped to rapidly inhibit β-cell destruction. Hence, GABA(B)-R-specific agonists may provide adjunct therapies for T1D. Finally, the analysis of microarray and RNA-Seq databases suggested that the expression of GABA(B)-Rs and GABA(A)-Rs, as well as GABA production/secretion-related genes, may be a more common feature of immune cells than currently recognized.","Tian, Jide; Middleton, Blake; Lee, Victoria Seunghee; Park, Hye Won; Zhang, Zhixuan; Kim, Bokyoung; Lowe, Catherine; Nguyen, Nancy; Liu, Haoyuan; Beyer, Ryan S.; Chao, Hannah W.; Chen, Ryan; Mai, Davis; O’Laco, Karen Anne; Song, Min; Kaufman, Daniel L.",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418884/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9010043,176

Recent rises in these infections are likely due to complex and multifactorial external drivers, including climate change, the increased mobility of people and goods and rapid demographic change to name but a few. In parallel with these external factors, we are gaining a better understanding of the internal factors associated with viral immunity. Increasingly the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome has been shown to be a significant player in the host immune system, acting as a key regulator of immunity and host defense mechanisms. An increasing body of evidence indicates that disruption of the homeostasis between the GI microbiome and the host immune system can adversely impact viral immunity. This review aims to shed light on our understanding of how host-microbiota interactions shape the immune system, including early life factors, antibiotic exposure, immunosenescence, diet and inflammatory diseases. We also discuss the evidence base for how host commensal organisms and microbiome therapeutics can impact the prevention and/or treatment of viral infections, such as viral gastroenteritis, viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papilloma virus (HPV), viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), influenza and SARS CoV-2. The interplay between the gastrointestinal microbiome, invasive viruses and host physiology is complex and yet to be fully characterized, but increasingly the evidence shows that the microbiome can have an impact on viral disease outcomes. While the current evidence base is informative, further well designed human clinical trials will be needed to fully understand the array of immunological mechanisms underlying this intricate relationship.","Harper, Ashton; Vijayakumar, Vineetha; Ouwehand, Arthur C.; ter Haar, Jessica; Obis, David; Espadaler, Jordi; Binda, Sylvie; Desiraju, Shrilakshmi; Day, Richard",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.596166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643929/,176

Concerns have also arisen about the ability of fuel poor individuals to adapt to the hardship recently brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper contributes to the literature by exploring empirically the link between fuel poverty and financial distress prior to and during the first wave the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis is based on the most recent longitudinal, nationally representative survey of the United Kingdom, Understanding Society (UKHLS, Wave 10, January 2018–February 2020). After correcting for the effects of potential endogeneity in the variables of interest, our results identify a statistically robust relationship between fuel poverty indicators and self-reported measures of current financial distress, with stronger effects for subjective indicators. The fuel poverty indicators however exert only a limited influence on an individual's expectation of their future financial situation. Our analysis of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic also confirms that fuel poverty contributed to financial distress. Our main findings are robust to a suite of specification and sensitivity checks. Our results lead to recommend assessing measures which target fuel poverty on the basis of their potential indirect effect on financial distress.","Burlinson, Andrew; Giulietti, Monica; Law, Cherry; Liu, Hui-Hsuan",Energy Econ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140988321003509; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140988321003509; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105464; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602677/,176

675599,Covid-19 Belgium: Extended SEIR-QD model with nursery homes and long-term scenarios-based forecasts from school opening,2020-09-09,"Since its initial discovery in late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID19, has spread worldwide and despite significant research efforts, treatment options remain limited. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung is associated with marked infiltration of macrophages and activation of innate immune inflammatory responses triggered, in part, by heightened production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) that recruits lymphocytes to the site of infection that amplify tissue injury. Antagonists of the glucocorticoid and androgen receptors have shown promise in experimental models of COVID19 and in clinical studies, because cell surface proteins required for viral entry, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), are transcriptionally regulated by these receptors. We therefore postulated that the glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) antagonist, PT150, would reduce infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent inflammatory lung injury in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID19. Animals were infected intranasally with 2.5 × 104 TCID50/ml equivalents of SARS-CoV-2 (strain 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/ 2020) and PT150 was administered by oral gavage at 30 and 100 mg/Kg/day for a total of 7 days. Animals were then examined at days 3, 5 and 7 post-infection (DPI) for lung histopathology, viral load and production of proteins regulating the initiation and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results of these studies indicated that oral administration of PT150 decreased replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung, as well as expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein. Hypercellularity and inflammatory cell infiltration driven by macrophage responses were dramatically decreased in PT150-treated animals, as was tissue damage and expression of IL-6. Molecular modeling suggested that PT150 binds to the co-activator interface of the ligand binding domain of both AR and GR and thereby acts as an allosteric modulator and transcriptional repressor of these receptors.

(H. cordata) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its excellent biological activities. However, impurities and deficient preparations of the essential oil limit its safety and effectiveness. Herein, we proposed a strategy to prepare H. cordata essential oil (HEO) safely and effectively by combining the solvent extraction and the macroporous resin purification flexibly, and then encapsulating it using microemulsion. The extraction and purification process were optimized by orthogonal experimental design and adsorption-desorption tests, respectively. The average houttuynin content in pure HEO was then validated at 44.3% ± 2.01%, which presented a great potential for industrial application. Subsequently, pure HEO-loaded microemulsion was prepared by high-pressure homogenization and was then fully characterized. Results showed that the pure HEO-loaded microemulsion was successfully prepared with an average particle size of 179.1 nm and a high encapsulation rate of 94.7%. Furthermore, safety evaluation tests and in vitro antiviral testing indicated that the safety and activity of HEO were significantly improved after purification using D101 resin and were further improved by microemulsion encapsulation. These results demonstrated that the purification of HEO by macroporous resin followed by microemulsion encapsulation would be a promising approach for industrial application of HEO for the antiviral therapies.","Pang, Jianmei; Dong, Wujun; Li, Yuhuan; Xia, Xuejun; Liu, Zhihua; Hao, Huazhen; Jiang, Lingmin; Liu, Yuling",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules22020293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212296/,176

Encephalopathy and encephalitis are devastating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus‐associated central nervous system complications. We reported a case of a 67-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital for the management of COVID-19 pneumonia. Due to worsening hypoxia, the patient was transferred to ICU and was intubated. On examination, he was aphasic and noted to have right-sided hemiplegia with left-sided hemiparesis on day 4. CT scan of the head without contrast and MRI findings were suggestive of acute necrotizing encephalopathy secondary to intracranial cytokine storm caused by viral infection. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and high dose corticosteroids, with clinical improvement in the right-sided hemiparesis on day 5. A repeat MRI brain revealed decreased edema. The pathogenesis of encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 may be multifactorial. Postulated mechanisms include hypoxic/metabolic changes produced by the intense inflammatory response due to cytokine storm and neurotropism. Cytokine storm causes hypoxia and metabolic insults that result in global dysfunction of the brain. Altered consciousness, ranging from mild confusion, delirium, to deep coma, are some of the cardinal clinical features. The most common imaging finding on MRI T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (MRI T2/FLAIR) includes symmetric, multifocal lesions with invariable thalamic involvement. Other commonly involved locations include the brainstem, cerebral white matter, cortical and subcortical white matter, and cerebellum. In a few case reports, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis has shown the presence of the virus. Management of encephalopathy in COVID-19 patients involves supportive care including supplemental oxygen therapy and immune modulators. Immune modulation therapy including high-dose corticosteroids and IVIG have been shown to improve outcomes in these patients.","Shah, Parth; Patel, Jinish; Soror, Noha N; Kartan, Ritha",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34458032/,176
676087,Is it time to Permanently transition to Home-based Cardiac Rehabilitation after COVID-19?,2020-09-30,"According to the neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is known that the nervous system is influenced by the virus. We used pediatric human cerebral cortical cell line HCN-2 as a neuronal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, through transcriptomic analysis, our aim was to evaluate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 in this type of cells. Transcriptome analyses revealed impairment in TXN gene, resulting in deregulation of its antioxidant functions, as well as a decrease in the DNA-repairing mechanism, as indicated by the decrease in KAT5. Western blot analyses of SOD1 and iNOS confirmed the impairment of reduction mechanisms and an increase in oxidative stress. Upregulation of CDKN2A and a decrease in CDK4 and CDK6 point to the blocking of the cell cycle that, according to the deregulation of repairing mechanism, has apoptosis as the outcome. A high level of proapoptotic gene PMAIP1 is indeed coherent with neuronal death, as also supported by increased levels of caspase 3. The upregulation of cell-cycle-blocking genes and apoptosis suggests a sufferance state of neurons after SARS-CoV-2 infection, followed by their inevitable death, which can explain the neurological symptoms reported. Further analyses are required to deeply explain the mechanisms and find potential treatments to protect neurons from oxidative stress and prevent their death.","Valeri, Andrea; Chiricosta, Luigi; Calcaterra, Valeria; Biasin, Mara; Cappelletti, Gioia; Carelli, Stephana; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Bramanti, Placido; Pelizzo, Gloria; Mazzon, Emanuela; Gugliandolo, Agnese",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10092189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571838/,176

It can cause mild to fatal respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. We aimed to find out whether elevated D-dimer levels are a predictor of the bad progression of COVID-19 to help reducing the mortality. METHODS: the data of COVID-19 patients from March 21, 2020 to April 24, 2020 were retrieved from the Cheick Khalifa Hospital database. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to get the optimum cutoff value of D-dimer levels on admission and after 5 days. We used these cutoffs to divide patients into two groups and compare the in-hospital mortality between them to assess the prognosis value of D-dimer levels. RESULTS: the data of COVID-19 patients from March 21, 2020 to April 24, 2020 were retrieved from the Cheick Khalifa Hospital database. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to get the optimum cutoff value of D-dimer levels on admission and after 5 days. We used these cutoffs to divide patients into two groups and compare the in-hospital mortality between them to assess the prognosis value of D-dimer levels. 89 patients were included in this study, of whom 79 were discharged and 10 died in hospital. The optimum cutoff value to predict mortality in patient using D-dimer levels on admission was 668 ng/ml (sensitivity 90%, specificity 63.3%, Areas under the ROC curve 0,775). As for D-dimer levels on day 5, it was 1360 ng/ml (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88,6%, Areas under the ROC curve 0.946). The group with D-dimer levels on day 5 > 1360 ng/ml (19 patients) had a worst evolution and a higher incidence of mortality compared to the group with D-dimer < 1360 ng/ml (69 patients) (10/19 vs 0/69, P = 0,0002). CONCLUSION: D-dimer greater than 1360 ng/ml on day 5 could help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19.","Oualim, Sara; Abdeladim, Salma; Ouarradi, Amal El; Bensahi, Ilham; Hafid, Sara; Naitlho, Abdelhamid; Bouaiti, Elarbi; Sabry, Mohamed",Pan Afr Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282060/; https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2020.35.2.24692,176

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV and has been suggested to be also the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Paradoxically, ACE2 expression in the lung protects mice from SARS-CoV spike protein induced lung injury by attenuating the renin-angiotensin system. In the intestine, ACE2 also suppresses intestinal inflammation by maintaining amino acid homeostasis, antimicrobial peptide expression and ecology of the gut microbiome. Upon analysis of single cell-RNA sequencing data from control subjects and those with colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we found that ACE2 expression in the colonocytes was positively associated with genes regulating viral infection, innate and cellular immunity, but was negatively associated with viral transcription, protein translation, humoral immunity, phagocytosis and complement activation. In summary, we suggest that ACE2 may play dual roles in mediating the susceptibility and immunity of 2019-nCoV infection.","Wang, J.; Zhao, S.; Liu, M.; Zhao, Z.; Xu, Y.; Wang, P.; Lin, M.; Huang, B.; Zuo, X.; Chen, Z.; Bai, F.; Cui, J.; Lew, A.

These cases of large B cell EBL in patients receiving dasatinib raise concern about a possible association and we strongly recommend cytological investigation in patients with persistent/relapsing pleural effusion under dasatinib to improve the knowledge about this entity. ABSTRACT: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the treatment of choice for BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although TKIs have substantially improved prognosis of CML patients, their use is not free of adverse effects. Dasatinib is a second generation TKI frequently associated with pleural effusion in up to 33% of patients. This results in symptoms as dyspnea, cough and chest pain that may require therapy discontinuation. In the present report, we describe two exceptional cases of HHV8-negative large B-cell effusion-based lymphoma (EBL) confined to the pleura, incidentally, diagnosed in patients presenting with dasatinib-related pleural effusion. One patient (case 1) is alive and is in remission at 17 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis while unfortunately the other patient (case 2) died of progressive disease and COVID-19 pneumonia 16 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis. These cases raise concern about a possible association between large B-cell EBL and dasatinib, and the different clinical outcome of the two cases poses a challenge in treatment decision. For this reason, we strongly recommend cytological investigation in patients with persistent/relapsing pleural effusion under dasatinib, primarily to validate its possible association with lymphoma development and to improve the knowledge about this entity.","Fiori, Stefano; Todisco, Elisabetta; Ramadan, Safaa; Gigli, Federica; Falco, Patrizia; Iurlo, Alessandra; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Croci, Giorgio; Pileri, Stefano A.; Tarella, Corrado",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10020152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672947/,176

Our comparison is based on a computerized simulation integrating accumulated SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological knowledge. Our results stress the importance of immediate on-symptom isolation of suspected cases and household members, and the beneficial effects of prompt testing capacity. Our findings expose significant epidemic-suppression differences among strategies with seemingly similar economic cost stressing the importance of not just the portion of population and business that is released, but also the pattern. The most effective building blocks are the ones that integrate several base strategies - they allow to release large portions of the population while still achieving diminishing viral spread. However, it may come with a price on somewhat more complex schemes. For example, our simulations indicate that dividing the population into two groups completely released except for taking turns on a long weekend (Fri-Tue) self-isolation once every two weeks, while protecting the 5% most sensitive population would reduce R below 1 even if ten percent of the population does not follow it. We further simulate the contrasting approach of a stratified population release in a hope to achieve herd immunity, which for the time being seems inferior to other suggested building blocks. Knowing the tradeoff between building blocks could help optimize exit strategies to be more effective and suitable for a particular area or country, while maximizing human life as well as economic value. Given our results, we believe that pandemic can be controlled within a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable socio-economic burden.","Barkan, Elad; Shilo, Smadar; Talmor-Barkan, Yeela",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.20072850,176
681093,The Effect of COVID-19 on Anxiety Levels of Children with CF and Healthy Peers,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Older adults may experience loneliness due to social distancing and isolation during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Loneliness may further catalyze numerous poor health outcomes including impaired sleep. This study aimed to assess COVID-19 related worries and resilience as potential moderators of the loneliness-sleep problems link. METHOD: In the midst of the lock-down period of COVID-19, we collected data using a web-based public platform from 243 Israeli older adults (mean age = 69.76, SD = 6.69, age range = 60–92). Participants completed measures of COVID-19 related loneliness, sleep problems, COVID-related worries, and resilience. RESULTS: COVID-19 related loneliness was related to more sleep problems. The loneliness-sleep association was especially strong among those with more COVID-19 related worries or among those with lower resilience. CONCLUSION: The relationship between COVID-19 related loneliness and sleep problems is not uniform across older adults. The subjective sleep quality of those with more COVID-19 related worries or less resilience (i.e., feeling less being able to adapt to the challenging circumstances) is more susceptible to feeling lonely. Considering these variables may facilitate detection of and intervention for older adults vulnerable to aversive results in the context of COVID-19.","Grossman, Ephraim S.; Hoffman, Yaakov S.G.; Palgi, Yuval; Shrira, Amit",Pers Individ Dif,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110371; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886920305626; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886920305626?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904342/,176

The aim of the current study was to assess the clinical course and the outcome in hematological or oncological malignancy cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV. METHODS: This is a case series of hematological /oncological cases, diagnosed with MERS-CoV, in a tertiary care setting in 2015. The cases were identified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) MERS-CoV case definition. The demographic, clinical, and outcome data were retrieved from the patients’ medical charts and electronic health records. RESULTS: In total, nine hematological or oncological cases were identified, diagnosed with MERS-CoV. The baseline malignant condition was hematological malignancy in seven patients, as well as colon cancer and osteosarcoma in one patient each. Six (67%) patients were male. The median age was 65 years (range 16–80 years). Co-morbidities included chronic kidney disease (n = 3.33%), diabetes mellitus (n = 3.33%), and hypertension (n = 2.22%). The presenting symptoms were shortness of breath (n = 6.66%), fever (n = 5.55%), cough (n = 2.22%), and diarrhea (n = 2.22%). Chest x-rays indicated bilateral infiltrates in 6 patients (66%). The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test was repeated in six patients to confirm the diagnosis. The mortality rate was 100%, and the median time to death was 26 days (range 15–77 days). CONCLUSION: MERS-CoV infection in this small cohort of hematology or oncology patients has a 100% mortality rate, regardless of the status of the underlying disease.

RESULTS: Females with IA reported significantly higher rates of decline in general health (40% vs 16%, p = 0.01), mood disturbance (43.4% vs 26%, p = 0.03) and increased disease activity (50% vs 16%, p = 0.01) compared to males. Evaluating the mean PHQ-4 scores, no significant difference was noted between genders (4.80 vs 3.44, p = 0.10). However, females demonstrated a non-significant trend toward increased rates of moderate to severe psychological distress (40% vs 30%, p = 0.13). Subanalysis of patients with axSpA found high rates of moderate to severe distress in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: Females with IA reported significantly higher rates of decline in general health, mood disturbance and increased disease activity during the period of social isolation. This was reflected in a trend towards greater levels of psychological distress.","Maguire, Sinead; O’Shea, Finbar",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656691/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02307-2,176

Patients presenting with more advanced disease such as T4 cancers are frequently excluded from undergoing ERAS programs due to the difficulty in applying established protocols. The primary aim of this investigation was to evaluate the possibility of applying a validated ERAS protocol in patients undergoing colorectal resection for T4 colon and rectal cancer and to evaluate the short-term outcome. METHODS: Single-center, retrospective cohort study. All patients with a clinical diagnosis of stage T4 colorectal cancer undergoing surgery between November 2016 and January 2020 were treated following the institutional fast track protocol without exclusion. Short-term postoperative outcomes were compared to those of a control group treated with conventional care and that underwent surgical resection for T4 colorectal cancer at the same institution from January 2010 to October 2016. Data from both groups were collected retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were diagnosed with T4 cancer, 49 patients were included in the ERAS cohort and 33 in the historical conventional care cohort. Both, the mean time of tolerance to solid food diet and postoperative length of stay were significantly shorter in the ERAS group than in the control group (3.14 ± 1.76 vs 4.8 ± 1.52; p < 0.0001 and 6.93 ± 3.76 vs 9.50 ± 4.83; p = 0.0084 respectively). No differences in perioperative complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this cohort study from a single-center registry support the thesis that the adoption of the ERAS protocol is effective and applicable in patients with colorectal cancer clinically staged T4, reducing significantly their length of stay and time of tolerance to solid food diet, without affecting surgical postoperative outcomes.","Bellato, Vittoria; An, Yongbo; Cerbo, Daniele; Campanelli, Michela; Franceschilli, Marzia; Khanna, Krishn; Sensi, Bruno; Siragusa, Leandro; Rossi, Piero; Sica, Giuseppe S.",World J Surg Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12957-021-02282-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34215273/,176

Accordingly, multifaceted mental health problems will continue to increase, thereby creating a challenge for society and the health care system in general. Recent studies show that COVID-19 can directly or indirectly influence the central nervous system, potentially causing neurological pathologies such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease. Thus, chronic COVID-19-related disease processes have the potential to cause serious mental illnesses, including depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders. Importantly, mental health problems can foster systemic changes in functionally-linked neuroendocrine conditions that heighten a person’s susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. These altered defense mechanisms may include compromised “self-control” and “self-care”, as well as a “lack of insight” into the danger posed by the virus. These consequences may have serious social impacts on the future of COVID-19 survivors. Compounding the functionally related issues of altered mental health parameters and viral susceptibility are the potential effects of compromised immunity on the establishment of functional herd immunity. Within this context, mental health takes on added importance, particularly in terms of the need to increase support for mental health research and community-based initiatives. Thus, COVID-19 infections continue to reveal mental health targets, a process we must now be prepared to deal with.","Ptacek, Radek; Ptackova, Hana; Martin, Anders; Stefano, George B.",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.930340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323916/,176

We hypothesized the application of pleiotropic tetracyclines as potential therapeutic candidates. Here, we present a retrospective multi-institutional cohort study evaluating ventilatory status in patients who had taken a tetracycline antibiotic within a year prior to diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The primary outcomes were the need for mechanical ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation. The secondary outcome was the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Data was evaluated using logistic regression and treatment effects regression models. Minocycline or doxycycline treatment within a year prior to ARDS diagnosis was associated with a 75% reduced likelihood for mechanical ventilation during hospital stay. Furthermore, tetracycline antibiotic therapy corresponded to significant reductions in duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay in ARDS patients. These data suggest tetracyclines may provide prophylactic benefit in reducing ventilatory support for ARDS patients and support further evaluation in a randomized prospective trial.","Byrne, J.

This has led to an increased importance of understanding sequence data related to COVID-19. In this chapter, we propose an alignment-free k-mer based LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model that can classify 20 different variants of COVID-19. We handle the class imbalance problem by sampling a fixed number of sequences for each class label. We handle the vanishing gradient problem in LSTMs arising from long sequences by dividing the sequence into fixed lengths and obtaining results on individual runs. Our results show that one-vs-all classifiers have test accuracies as high as 92.5% with tuned hyperparameters compared to the multi-class classifier model. Our experiments show higher overall accuracies for B.1.1.214, B.1.177.21, B.1.1.7, B.1.526, and P.1 on the one-vs-all classifiers, suggesting the presence of distinct mutations in these variants. Our results show that embedding vector size and batch sizes have insignificant improvement in accuracies, but changing from 2-mers to 3-mers mostly improves accuracies. We also studied individual runs which show that most accuracies improved after the 20th run, indicating that these sequence positions may have more contributions to distinguishing among different COVID-19 variants.","Basu, Sayantani; Campbell, Roy H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450335,176

Studies have not assessed the difference in D-dimer levels between patients who develop thrombosis and those who do not. METHODS: Our study retrospectively assessed D-dimer levels in all virus confirmed hospitalized patients between May to September, 2020. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 with normal D-dimer of < 0.5 µg/mL, group 2 with elevation up to six folds, and group 3 with more than six-fold elevation. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software 23.0. RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty patients (group1 (n = 414), group 2 (n = 284) and group 3 (n = 22)) were studied. Eight thrombotic events were observed. Events were two with stroke, two non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and one each of ST elevation myocardial infarction, superior mesenteric artery thrombosis with bowel gangrene, arteriovenous fistula thrombus and unstable angina. No significant difference (P = 0.11) was observed between median D-dimer levels among patients who developed thrombosis (1.34) and those who did not develop thrombosis (0.91). Twenty-nine patients died. The adjusted odds of death among those with a six-fold or higher elevation in D-dimer was 128.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.2 - 446.3, P < 0.001), while adjusted odds of developing clinical thrombosis was 1.96 (95% CI: 0.82 - 18.2, P = 0.18). CONCLUSIONS: Our study observed a 1.1% in-hospital incidence of clinical thrombosis. While, a six-fold elevation in D-dimer was significantly associated with death; the same was not a strong predictor of thrombosis; an observation which implies that dose of anticoagulation should not be based on absolute D-dimer level.","Rajendran, Vaasanthi; Gopalan, Sowmya; Varadaraj, Priyadarshini; Pandurangan, Viswanathan; Marappa, Lakshmi; Nair, Aiswarya M.; Madhavan, Sudha; Mani, Rajkumar; Bhaskar, Emmanuel",J Clin Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394783/; https://doi.org/10.14740/jocmr4550,176

Endovascular procedures for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) have become increasingly common in outpatient settings; their safety is yet to be determined in a rural, underserved area with no stand-by vascular surgeon on site. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of endovascular procedures for the investigation and management of lower extremity PAD between December 2012 and August 2015. Patients were classified by Rutherford score, degree of stenosis and length of lesions. Complications were major (requiring hospitalization) or minor, including perforation, distal embolization, hematoma, and allergic reactions, which could be treated immediately in the catheterization laboratory with no sequelae. Patients were monitored in the facility and followed up using clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters at 24 h and 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 692 patients underwent endovascular procedures for the investigation and/or treatment of PAD, of which 608 were interventional. Of these patients, 10.20% experienced procedural complications, of which 0.66% were classified as major, including wire retention and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. In total, 99.34% were discharged safely on the same day as the procedure. No adverse events were reported at follow up. CONCLUSION: Endovascular procedures for PAD can be performed safely in a rural outpatient setting with low complication rates. Most complications are minor and do not require hospitalization. Outpatient procedures for PAD are safe and may widen access to specialist procedures in areas of socio-economic deprivation.","Ansari, Athar; Shah, Moiz Ali; Shah, Manaim Amir; Ansari, Zahra",Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/1753944720948651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885724/,176

We introduce a modified rural–urban continuum classification, the Rural–Urban Gradient (RUG). The RUG holds metropolitan classification constant, effectively designates exurbs, and distinguishes central city core counties in major metropolitan areas from their suburbs and exurbs. The RUG is used to compare, over time and across regions, net migration, and migration efficiency using annual county-level data from the Internal Revenue Service. Results show how migration patterns correlated with changes in demographics and housing depending on counties’ location along the RUG.

Antibodies against such emerging infectious diseases are one of the important tools for basic viral research and the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents. CR3022 is a monoclonal antibody against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV found in SARS patients, but it was also shown to have strong affinity for that of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we produced large amounts of three formats of CR3022 antibodies (scFv, Fab and IgG) with high purity using a silkworm-baculovirus expression vector system. Furthermore, SPR measurements showed that the affinity of those silkworm-produced IgG antibodies to S protein was almost the same as that produced in mammalian expression system. These results indicate that the silkworm-baculovirus expression system is an excellent expression system for emerging infectious diseases that require urgent demand for diagnostic agents and therapeutic agents.

687051,COVID-19: what have we learned?,2020,"Previously, we have demonstrated that ACIS KEPTIDE™, a chemically modified peptide, selectively binds to ACE-2 receptor and prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 virions in vitro in primate kidney Cells. However, it is not known if ACIS KEPTIDE™ attenuates the entry of SARS-CoV2 virus in vivo in lung and kidney tissues, protects health, and prevent death once applied through intranasal route. In our current manuscript, we demonstrated that the intranasal administration of SARS-CoV2 (1*106) strongly induced the expression of ACE-2, promoted the entry of virions into the lung and kidney cells, caused acute histopathological toxicities, and mortality (28%). Interestingly, thirty-minutes of pre-treatment with 50 μg/Kg Body weight ACIS normalized the expression of ACE-2 via receptor internalization, strongly mitigated that viral entry, and prevented mortality suggesting its prospect as a prophylactic therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. On the contrary, the peptide backbone of ACIS was unable to normalize the expression of ACE-2, failed to improve the health vital signs and histopathological abnormalities. In summary, our results suggest that ACIS is a potential vaccine-alternative, prophylactic agent that prevents entry of SARS-CoV2 in vivo, significantly improves respiratory health and also dramatically prevents acute mortality in K18-hACE2 humanized mice. Highlights ACIS KEPTIDE stimulates the internalization of ACE-2 receptor (Fig. 2) and buffers the membrane localization of ACE-2 receptors (Fig. 2, 6 & 8). Intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV2 upregulates the expression of ACE-2 in lung epithelium (Fig.6) and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8). ACIS KEPTIDE normalizes the expression of ACE-2 in the kidney tubular cells of virus-treated K18-hACE2mice (Fig. 8). ACIS KEPTIDE™ completely prevents the entry of SARS-CoV2 in Bronchiolar epithelium (Fig.6), alveolar parenchyma (Fig. 6), and kidney tubular cells (Fig.8). ACIS KEPTIDE™ improves the pulmonary (Fig. 5) and renal pathological changes (Fig. 7) caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus insult. Intranasal administration of 0.05% Beta-propiolactone (βPL)-inactivated SARS-CoV2 (1 *106) causes significant death (28%) in K18-hACE2 humanized mice after 24 hrs of intranasal inoculation (Supplemental videos) suggesting that SARS-CoV2 does not require its infective properties and genetic mechanism to be functional to cause mortality. The peptide backbone of ACIS KEPTIDE™ provides much less and insignificant protection in the prevention of pathological changes in Lungs (Fig.5 & 6) and Kidney (Fig.7 & 8).

687299,Development and execution of a pandemic preparedness plan: Therapeutic medical physics and radiation dosimetry during the COVID‐19 crisis,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND: University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes—such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic—the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students’ mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education.","Browning, Matthew H.

The proposal of a DBS target in the midbrain, known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) to address FOG, was based on its observed pathology in PD and its hypothesized involvement in locomotor control as a part of the mesencephalic locomotor region, a functionally defined area of the midbrain that elicits locomotion in both intact animals and decerebrate animal preparations with electrical stimulation. Initial reports of PPN DBS were met with much enthusiasm; however, subsequent studies produced mixed results, and recent meta-analysis results have been far less convincing than initially expected. A closer review of the extensive mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) preclinical literature, including recent optogenetics studies, strongly suggests that the closely related cuneiform nucleus (CnF), just dorsal to the PPN, may be a superior target to promote gait initiation. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study to assess safety and feasibility of CnF DBS in PD patients with levodopa-refractory FOG. Four patients will receive CnF DBS and have gait assessments with and without DBS during a 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This paper presents the study design and rationale for a pilot study investigating a novel DBS target for gait dysfunction, including targeting considerations. This pilot study is intended to support future larger scale clinical trials investigating this target.

However, currently, there is a lack of systematic study and quantitative information of the aerosol generation during these instruments, which is crucial for offering risk assessment and the corresponding mitigation strategies for the reopening of these activities. Collaborating with 15 musicians from the Minnesota Orchestra, we conduct a systematic study of the aerosol generation from a large variety of wind instruments under different music dynamic levels and articulation patterns. We find that the aerosol concentration from different brass and woodwinds exhibits two orders of magnitude variation. Accordingly, we categorize the instruments into low (tuba), intermediate (bassoon, piccolo, flute, bass clarinet, French horn, and clarinet) and high risk (trumpet, bass trombone, and oboe) levels based on a comparison of their aerosol generation with those from normal breathing and speaking. In addition, we observe that the aerosol generation can be affected by the changing dynamic level, articulation pattern, the normal respiratory behaviors of individuals, and even the usage of some special techniques during the instrument play. However, such effects vary substantially for different types of instrument, depending on specific breathing techniques as well as the tube structure and inlet design of the instrument. Overall, our findings can bring insights into the risk assessment of airborne decrease transmission and the corresponding mitigation strategies for various musical activities involving wind instrument plays, including orchestras, community and worship bands, music classes, etc.","He, Ruichen; Gao, Linyue; Trifonov, Maximilian; Hong, Jiarong",J Aerosol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952210/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021850220301555?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021850220301555; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaerosci.2020.105669,176

Previous studies suggested a tumor-promoting role of IL-10 in breast cancer, whereas recent discoveries that IL-10 activated and expanded tumor-resident CD8(+) T cells challenged the traditional view. Here, we investigated the role of IL-10 in HLA-A2-positive breast cancer patients with Grade III, Stage IIA or IIB in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, and compared it with that of IL-2, the canonical CD8(+) T cell growth factor. We first observed that breast cancer patients presented higher serum levels of IL-2 and IL-10 than healthy controls. Upon prolonged TCR stimulation, peripheral blood CD8(+) T cells from breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, which could be prevented by the addition of IL-2 and/or IL-10. The cytotoxicity of TCR-activated CD8(+) T cells was also enhanced by exogenous IL-2 and/or IL-10. Interestingly, IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, since the enhancement in CD8(+) T cell function when both cytokines were added was greater than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. IL-10 by itself could not promote the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells but could significantly enhance IL-2-mediated promotion of CD8(+) T cell proliferation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells in breast tumor was elevated when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present but not when either one was absent. This synergistic effect was stopped by CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), which depleted IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrated that IL-2 and IL-10 could work synergistically to improve the survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of activated CD8(+) T cells, an effect suppressible by CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells.","Li, Xiaogang; Lu, Ping; Li, Bo; Zhang, Wanfu; Yang, Rong; Chu, Yan; Luo, Kaiyuan",Int J Biochem Cell Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357272517300493; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1357272517300493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28274688/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2017.03.003,176

There is an urgent need for predictive markers that can guide clinical decision-making, inform about the effect of experimental therapies, and point to novel therapeutic targets. Here, we characterize the time-dependent progression of COVID-19 through different stages of the disease, by measuring 86 accredited diagnostic parameters and plasma proteomes at 687 sampling points, in a cohort of 139 patients during hospitalization. We report that the time-resolved patient molecular phenotypes reflect an initial spike in the systemic inflammatory response, which is gradually alleviated and followed by a protein signature indicative of tissue repair, metabolic reconstitution and immunomodulation. Further, we show that the early host response is predictive for the disease trajectory and gives rise to proteomic and diagnostic marker signatures that classify the need for supplemental oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation, and that predict the time to recovery of mildly ill patients. In severely ill patients, the molecular phenotype of the early host response predicts survival, in two independent cohorts and weeks before outcome. We also identify age-specific molecular response to COVID-19, which involves increased inflammation and lipoprotein dysregulation in older patients. Our study provides a deep and time resolved molecular characterization of COVID-19 disease progression, and reports biomarkers for risk-adapted treatment strategies and molecular disease monitoring. Our study demonstrates accurate prognosis of COVID-19 outcome from proteomic signatures recorded weeks earlier.","Demichev, V.; Tober-Lau, P.; Nazarenko, T.; Thibeault, C.; Whitwell, H.; Lemke, O.; RoÌhl, A.; Freiwald, A.; Szyrwiel, L.; Ludwig, D.; Correia-Melo, C.; Helbig, E.

689176,"Telemedicine, legal certainty, and COVID-19: where are we?",2020,"Although a vast knowledge has already been gathered on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, there are still limited, non-optimal treatment options. In this paper, we describe a multicentre, retrospective, observational study to describe the course of SARS-CoV-2 disease in patients treated with ImmunoFormulation (IF), an add-on therapy developed to decrease duration of clinical symptoms. In parallel, a group of patients that did not receive IF was used for comparison (using standard of care treatment). A total of 39 patients were evaluated. Throughout the observational period, 90% of patients recovered in the IF cohort and 47.4% in the Control cohort (p=0.0057). From the symptoms with statistically significant differences, the duration of symptoms (i.e., the time to recover from it) was shorter in the IF cohort than in control cohort (in days, average), especially for fever (2.25 x 21.78), dry cough (4.38 x 24.00), dyspnoea (3.67 x 20.00), headache (2.00 x 26.50), diarrhoea (5.25 x 25.25), and weakness (1.92 x 23.30). This demonstrates a potential promising role of IF as adjuvant therapy on the evolution of symptomatology to COVID-19 patients.","Hernandez, M.; Urrea, J.; Bascoy, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.11.20246561; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.11.20246561v1?rss=1,176
689544,Covid-19 and absence of music therapy: Impact on mother-child dyad during invasive procedures in pediatric oncology(),2021-07-28,"2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new acute infectious disease of respiratory system, posed a great threat to human health because of its strong infectivity and rapid progress. This study aimed to assess the severity of COVID-19 Pneumonia by analyzing the change of CT manifestations and body temperature. This retrospective review included 22 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. The imaging manifestations and clinical features were observed and evaluated. Most of the infected patients were men (13/22, 59%). Fever (>38°C) (17/22, 77%) and cough (6/22, 27%) were the main symptoms. Leukocytes count decreased in 23% of patients and lymphocyte decreased in 41%. Twenty-one patients with pneumonia had abnormal findings on chest CT. The special CT manifestations were observed at the first CT examination when the lesions progressed, including a single ground glass nodule with uneven density, multiple ground glass opacities distributed in subpleural, and the ground glass opacities confined in superior lobe. The special CT manifestations were observed at the first CT examination when the lesions resolved, including ground glass opacities with homogeneous density. The lesion involved in the bilateral lungs and the absorption of the lesions mainly occurred in bilateral inferior lobes. Three patients had normalized body temperature increased more than 1°C within 1 to 2 days after admission. Ten patients fluctuated more than 1°C within 1 to 7 days after admission and the second CT scans showed the disease was at the progressive stage. Dynamic analysis of CT manifestations and body temperature have the potential to predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Liang, Pan; Wang, Rui; Ren, Xiu-chun; Huang, Wen-peng; Gao, Jian-bo",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34232165/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000025938,176
689949,Assessing the impact of multiple comorbidities on fatal outcome in young COVID-19,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND: The measures adopted to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries included mobility and social restrictions that produced an immediate impact on the lifestyle of their inhabitants. METHODS: We assessed the association between the consequences of these measures and depressive symptomatology using a population-based sample of 692 individuals aged 18 or over from an ongoing study in the province of Girona (Catalonia, Spain). Participants responded to a telephone-based survey that included questions related to the consequences of confinement and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptomatology. Multivariate logistic and linear regressions were used to identify which changes in lifestyle resulting from confinement were independently associated with a possible depression episode and depressive symptomatology. RESULTS: The prevalence of a possible depressive episode during the confinement was 12.7% (95% CI = 10.3–15.4). An adverse work situation, expected economic distress, self-reported worsening of the mental health and of the dietary pattern, and worries about a relative's potential infection were variables related to an increased risk of having a possible depressive episode. The changes in lifestyle accounted for 32% of the variance of the PHQ-9 score. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate an association of the job situation, the expected negative economic consequences, the perceived worsening of health and habits, and the worries about COVID-19 infection with depressive symptomatology during the confinement.","Garre-Olmo, Josep; Turró-Garriga, Oriol; Martí-Lluch, Ruth; Zacarías-Pons, Lluís; Alves-Cabratosa, Lia; Serrano-Sarbosa, Domènec; Vilalta-Franch, Joan; Blanes, Rafel Ramos",Compr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152214; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010440X20300560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186837/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X20300560?v=s5,176
