Here, we developed a framework combining single‐cell RNA‐Seq and highly multiplex RNA FISH and applied it to human intestinal organoids infected with human astrovirus, a model human enteric virus. We found that interferon controls the infection and that astrovirus infects all major cell types and lineages and induces expression of the cell proliferation marker MKI67. Intriguingly, each intestinal epithelial cell lineage exhibits a unique basal expression of interferon‐stimulated genes and, upon astrovirus infection, undergoes an antiviral transcriptional reprogramming by upregulating distinct sets of interferon‐stimulated genes. These findings suggest that in the human intestinal epithelium, each cell lineage plays a unique role in resolving virus infection. Our framework is applicable to other organoids and viruses, opening new avenues to unravel roles of individual cell types in viral pathogenesis.","Triana, Sergio; Stanifer, Megan L; Metz‐Zumaran, Camila; Shahraz, Mohammed; Mukenhirn, Markus; Kee, Carmon; Serger, Clara; Koschny, Ronald; Ordoñez‐Rueda, Diana; Paulsen, Malte; Benes, Vladimir; Boulant, Steeve; Alexandrov, Theodore",Mol Syst Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8311733/,699

CD8(+) tissue-resident memory (Trm) cells are important for tissue immune surveillance, provide an important line of defence against invading pathogens and show promise in cancer therapies. These cells differ in phenotype from other memory populations, are adapted to the tissue they home to where they found their cognate antigen and have different metabolic requirements for survival and activation. CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells also consist of specialised populations, found in non-lymphoid tissues, with distinct transcriptional programmes. These cells have equally adapted to function in the tissue they made their home. Both Trm and Treg cells have functions beyond immune defence, involving tissue homeostasis, repair and turnover. They are part of a multicellular communication network. Intriguingly, occupying the same niche, Treg cells are important in the establishment of Trm cells, which may have implications to harness the immune surveillance and tissue homeostasis properties of Trm cells for future therapies.","Barros, Leandro; Ferreira, Cristina; Veldhoen, Marc",Mucosal Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488068/,699

The aims were to assess the factors associated with blood clot structure and the impact of thromboembolus structure on MT using stent-retrievers in patients with acute large artery IS in the anterior circulation.Methods and Results:In an observational cohort study, we studied the components of intra-arterial clots retrieved from large cerebral arteries in 80 patients with acute IS treated with MT with or without i.v. thrombolysis (IVT). Histology of the clots was carried out without knowledge of the clinical findings, including the treatment methods. The components of the clots, their age, origin and semi-quantitative graded changes in the architecture of the fibrin components (e.g., ""thinning"") were compared via neuro-interventional, clinical and laboratory data. The most prominent changes in the architecture of the fibrin components in the thromboemboli were associated with IVT (applied in 44 patients; OR, 3.50; 95% CI: 1.21-10.10, P=0.02) and platelet count (OR, 2.94; 95% CI: 1.06-8.12, P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS In patients with large artery IS treated with the MT using stent-retrievers, bridging therapy with IVT preceding MT and higher platelet count were associated with significant changes of the histological structure of blood clots.","Krajíčková, Dagmar; Krajina, Antonín; Šteiner, Ivo; Vyšata, Oldřich; Herzig, Roman; Lojík, Miroslav; Chovanec, Vendelín; Raupach, Jan; Renc, Ondřej; Waishaupt, Jan; Vítková, Eva; Dulíček, Petr; Čabelková, Pavla; Vališ, Martin",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,https://doi.org/10.1253/circj.cj-17-0375; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29176266/,699

This study aimed to determine the yield of DSA for the detection of causative vascular lesions in this clinical scenario. MATERIALS AND METHODS We examined the yield of DSA for the detection of causative vascular lesions in a cohort of patients presenting to our institution with SAH and negative initial noninvasive neurovascular examinations during a 5-year period. Two experienced neuroradiologists independently evaluated the NCCT to determine the SAH pattern (diffuse, perimesencephalic, or peripheral sulcal) and the catheter angiograms to assess the presence of a causative vascular lesion. RESULTS Fifty-five patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 58.2 years (median, 58 years; range, 25-88 years). Twenty-eight patients were men (50.9%), and 27 were women (49.1%). The initial noninvasive examination was a CTA in 47 patients (85.5%) and an MRA in 8 patients (14.5%). Thirty-three patients had diffuse SAH (60%); 11, perimesencephalic SAH (20%); and 11, peripheral sulcal SAH (20%). DSA demonstrated a causative vascular lesion in 6 patients (10.9%), 5 of whom had diffuse SAH (yield of 15.2%) and 1 of whom had peripheral sulcal SAH (yield of 9.1%). No causative vascular lesions were found in patients with perimesencephalic SAH. CONCLUSIONS DSA is a valuable tool in the evaluation of patients with diffuse and peripheral sulcal SAH who have negative initial noninvasive neurovascular examinations, demonstrating a causative vascular lesion in 15.2% and 9.1% of patients, respectively.","Delgado Almandoz, J E; Crandall, B M; Fease, J L; Scholz, J M; Anderson, R E; Kadkhodayan, Y; Tubman, D E",AJNR.

Due to the frequent detection of boscalid, we evaluated its impact on the reproduction of adult zebrafish following a 21 d exposure to 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 mg/L. Following exposure to boscalid, the fertility of female zebrafish and fertilization rate of spawning eggs were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner up to a respective 87% and 20% in the highest concentration. A significant 16% reduction in the percentage of late vitellogenic oocytes was noted in ovaries, and a significant 74% reduction in the percentage of spermatids in testis was also observed after treatment with 1.0 mg/L. 17β-Estradiol (E2) concentrations decreased significantly in females (34% decrease) but significantly increased in males (15% increase) following 1.0 mg/L boscalid treatment. The expression of genes (such as era, er2b, cyp19a, and cyp19b) related to the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad-liver (HPGL) axis was significantly altered and positively correlated with E2 concentrations in female and male zebrafish (p < 0.05). Molecular docking results revealed that the binding modes between boscalid and target proteins (ER and CYP19) of zebrafish were similar to that of the reference compounds and the target proteins. The binding energies indicate that boscalid may have a weak estrogen-like binding effect or CYP19 inhibition, potentially altering the HPGL axis, thereby reducing E2 concentrations and fecundity in females. In contrast, boscalid caused significant induction of E2 steroidogenesis and subsequent feminization of gonads in males, indicating gender-specific adverse outcome pathways.","Qian, Le; Qi, Suzhen; Zhang, Jie; Duan, Manman; Schlenk, Daniel; Jiang, Jiazhen; Wang, Chengju",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c02871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138376/,699

STUDY DESIGN Vaginal delivery (n = 63) and elective cesarean delivery infants were prospectively evaluated for the first 10 minutes after delivery. Peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate were measured on the right hand using pulsoximetry with near infrared spectroscopy. Regional oxygen saturation of the brain (rSO(2)brain) was measured. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction was calculated for each minute. RESULTS From 4 to 8 minutes, SpO(2) values for cesarean delivery infants were significantly lower than for vaginally delivered infants. Heart rate of the cesarean delivery infants was significantly lower throughout the whole observation period. There was no difference between groups in rSO(2)brain. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction only differed at minute 10.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all patients aged > 18 years tested for flu A/B by laboratory PCR in January 2017 and by POCT in January 2018. Results From 21 December 2017 to 30 April 2018, a total of 1375 POCTs were performed with a total of 479 (35%) influenza-positive cases. Results demonstrated that 1046 (76%) suspected cases did not require isolation or were able to be discharged from Emergency Department (ED), once other risks had been ruled out. We particularly looked into the differences between the month of January 2017 (before POCT) and the month of January 2018. Discussion Results demonstrate that influenza POCT had a positive impact on the Trust regarding prompt patient diagnosis and treatment, discharge decisions, improvement of patient bed management by avoiding unnecessary patient isolation and reducing bay closures, and significant reduction in length of stay in both positive and negative cases.

Here, we explored 61,485 sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in real-timePCR based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n=30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including 3'-end mismatch to primer-pair of 11 well characterized primer sets. Noteworthy, CDC (USA) recommended N2 primer set contained lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD), respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions, mostly (n =10) within the highly flexible linker region, were revealed and the rest within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequence of high-frequency mutations (≥ 20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) co-occuring mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 comprises an average of 1.2 mutations per strain compared to 4.4 and 0.4 in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively. Despite being proposed as the alternate target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, ongoing evolution of the N protein may challenge the endeavors, thus need further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions. This article is protected by copyright.

214300,"Increase in Hospital-Acquired Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Infection and Colonization in an Acute Care Hospital During a Surge in COVID-19 Admissions - New Jersey, February-July 2020",2020,"PURPOSE: As our hospitals conserve and re-allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis, there is urgent need to determine how best to continue caring for breast cancer patients. During the time window before the COVID-19 critical peak and particularly thereafter, as hospitals are able to resume cancer operations, we anticipate that there will be great need to maximize efficiency to treat breast cancer. The goal of this study is to present a same-day protocol that minimizes resource utilization to enable hospitals to increase inpatient capacity, while providing care for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: IRB exempt patient quality improvement initiative was conducted to detail the operationalization of a novel same-day breast reconstruction protocol. Consecutive patients having undergone immediate breast reconstruction were prospectively enrolled between February and March of 2020 at Massachusetts General Hospital during the COVID-19 crisis. Peri-operative results and postoperative complications were summarized. RESULTS: Time interval from surgical closure to patient discharge was 5.02 ± 1.29 h. All patients were discharged home, with no re-admissions or emergency department visits. No postoperative complications were observed. CONCLUSION: This report provides an instruction manual to operationalize a same-day breast reconstruction protocol, to meet demands of providing appropriate cancer treatment during times of unprecedented resource limitations. Pre-pectoral implant-based breast reconstruction can be the definitive procedure or be used as a bridge to autologous reconstruction. Importantly, we hope this work will be helpful to our patients and community as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Specht, Michelle; Sobti, Nikhil; Rosado, Nikki; Tomczyk, Eleanor; Abbate, Olivia; Ellis, Dan; Liao, Eric C",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,699

Clinical outcomes were classified into critical & non-critical based on severity. Two independent radiologists graded frontal view CXRs into COVID-19 pneumonia category 1 (CoV-P1) with <4 zones and CoV-P2 with &#8805;4 zones involvement. Interobserver agreement of CoV-P category for the CXR preceding the clinical outcome was assessed using Kendall's &#964; coefficient. Association between CXR findings and clinical deterioration was calculated along with temporal changes of CXR findings with disease progression. RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were evaluated for clinical features. 56 of these (total: 325 CXRs) were evaluated for radiological findings. Common patterns were progression from lower to upper zones, peripheral to diffuse involvement, & from ground glass opacities to consolidation. Consolidations starting peripherally were noted in 76%, 93% and 48% with critical outcomes, respectively. The interobserver agreement of the CoV-P category of CXRs in the critical and non-critical outcome groups were good and excellent, respectively (&#964; coefficient = 0.6 & 1.0).

The human body is equipped with the immune system that can recognize, respond and fight against pathogens such as viruses. Following the innate response, immune system processes the adaptive response by which each pathogen is encoded and recorded in memory system. The humoral reaction containing cytokines and antibodies is expected to activate when the pathogens come back. Exploiting this nature of body protection, neutralizing antibodies have been investigated. Learning from past, in parallel to SARS-CoV-2, other coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV who caused previous pandemics, are recalled in this review. We here propose insights of origin and characteristics and perspective for the future of antibodies development.","Tong, Phuoc-Bao-Viet; Lin, Li-Yun; Tran, Tuan Hiep",Life Sci,,699

To prepare health systems to deal with the pandemic, epidemiological and cost projection models are required to inform budgets and efficient allocation of resources. This study estimates daily inpatient care costs of COVID-19 in South Africa, an important input into cost projection and economic evaluation models. METHODS: We adopted a micro-costing approach, which involved the identification, measurement and valuation of resources used in the clinical management of COVID-19. We considered only direct medical costs for an episode of hospitalisation from the South African public health system perspective. Resource quantities and unit costs were obtained from various sources. Inpatient costs per patient day was estimated for consumables, capital equipment and human resources for three levels of inpatient care - general wards, high care wards and intensive care units (ICUs). RESULTS: Average daily costs per patient increased with the level of care. The highest average daily cost was estimated for ICU admissions - 271 USD to 306 USD (financial costs) and ~800 USD to 830 USD (economic costs, excluding facility fee) depending on the need for invasive vs. non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Conversely, the lowest cost was estimated for general ward-based care - 62 USD to 79 USD (financial costs) and 119 USD to 278 USD (economic costs, excluding facility fees) depending on the need for supplemental oxygen. In high care wards, total cost was estimated at 156 USD, financial costs and 277 USD, economic costs (excluding facility fees). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest our costs estimates are robust to uncertainty in cost inputs. CONCLUSION: Our estimates of inpatient costs are useful for informing budgeting and planning processes and cost-effectiveness analysis in the South African context. However, these estimates can be adapted to inform policy decisions in other context.","Edoka, Ijeoma; Fraser, Heather; Jamieson, Lise; Meyer-Rath, Gesine; Mdewa, Winfrida",Int. j. health policy manag,,699

285418,"Asymptomatic and Presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infections in Residents of a Long-Term Care Skilled Nursing Facility - King County, Washington, March 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Value-based healthcare is being extensively piloted, scaled and implemented by healthcare providers and systems around the world. However, the ability of the healthcare supply chain function to strategically contribute to the improvement of value has been held back by a lack of practical tools for turning value-based procurement from concept into action. Two recently developed conceptual models - the American CQO Movement and the European MEAT VBP Framework - have been developed to support the implementation of value-based procurement in healthcare. We demonstrate how the latter of these models can be adapted and applied pragmatically to generate insights into the value of a specific medical device, technology or consumable. METHODS: We undertook an explanatory, qualitative, single-case study focused on a specific consumable - surgical gloves - that provide a critical example of a type of medical device usually procured in high volumes but at risk of commoditisation due to a widespread lack of understanding of their value. Since the global Covid-19 pandemic prevented fieldwork, structured interviews were conducted via Zoom and corroborated by a literature review. RESULTS: We identified ten cost criteria and eight outcome criteria with which the value of surgical gloves can be analysed and understood. For each of these criteria we propose definitions and value impact metrics that decision-makers can use during a procurement exercise to describe, quantify and compare glove value. CONCLUSION: The MEAT VBP Framework provides a highly practical and adaptable means of imposing both structure and rigour on a value analysis process and of qualitatively describing the potential value impact of surgical gloves for patients, professionals, providers and health systems.","Stanberry, Benedict; Bothma, Gerhard; Harrison, Katie",Health Econ Rev,,699

OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the Covid-19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of health care has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of spinal tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons, and radiation oncologists was formed to analyze the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during Covid-19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture, and/or neurological symptoms. Primary spine tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like en bloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like chordoma or chondrosarcomas, if intensive care unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteogenic sarcoma must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. In immunocompromised patients, (treated by chemotherapy), it is necessary to avoid contact with affected or exposed people. CONCLUSION: Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy.

After this declaration countries swiftly implemented a variety of health policies. In this work we examine how rapid countries responded to this pandemic using two events: the day in which the first case of COVID-19 was reported, and first day in which countries used school closure as one of the measures to avoid outbreaks. We also assessed how countries' health systems, globalization, economic development, political systems, and economic integration to China, Republic of Korea and Italy increased the speed of adoption. METHODS: We compiled information from multiple sources, from December 31st 2019 to June 1st 2020, to trace when 172 countries reported their first COVID-19 case and implemented school closure to contain outbreaks. We applied cross-national Weibull survival analysis to evaluate the global speed of detection of first COVID-19 reported cases and school closure. RESULTS: Ten days after WHO declared COVID-19 to be an international emergency, relative to seven days from this declaration, countries were 28 (95% CI: 12-77) times more likely to report first COVID-19 cases and 42 (95% CI: 22-90) times more likely to close schools. One standard deviation increase in the epidemic security index rises the rate of report first cases by 37% (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.37 (95% CI: 1.09-1.72) and delays the adoption for school closures by 36% (HR 0.64 (95% CI:0.50-0.82). One standard deviation increase in the globalization index augments the adoption for school closures by 74% (HR 1.74 (95% CI:1.34-2.24). CONCLUSION: After the WHO declared a global emergency, countries were unprecedently acting very rapidly. While countries more globally integrated were swifter in closing schools, countries with better designed health systems to tackle epidemics were slower in adopting it. More studies are needed to assess how the speed of school closures and other policies will affect the development of the pandemic.","Nazif-Muñoz, José Ignacio; Peña, Sebastián; Oulhote, Youssef",PLoS One,,699

Up to date, the clinical characteristics of diabetes patients with COVID-19 and the risk factors for poor clinical outcomes are not clearly understood. Methods: The study was retrospectively carried out on enrolled diabetes patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection from a designated medical center for COVID-19 from January 25th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020 in Wuhan, China. The medical record was collected and reviewed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk factors associated with the severe events which were defined as a composite endpoint of admission to intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Results: A total of 52 diabetes patients with COVID-19 were finally included in the study. 21 (40.4%) patients had developed severe events in 27.50 (IQR 12.25-35.75) days follow-up, 15 (28.8%) patients experienced life-threatening complications and 8 patients died with a recorded mortality rate of 15.4%. Only 13 patients (41.9%) were in optimal glycemic control with HbA1c value of <7.0%. In addition to general clinical characteristics of COVID-19, the severe events diabetes patients showed higher counts of white blood cells and neutrophil, lower lymphocytes (40, 76.9%), high levels of hs-CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (PCT) as compared to the non-severe diabetes patients.

We aimed to explore the role of socioeconomic status and religion, sexual double standards, erotophobia-erotophilia, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and relationship satisfaction to explain sexual function and satisfaction in Ecuador. METHOD: 599 participants (431 women and 159 men) completed an online survey. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: The Female sexual function was predicted by sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, sexual dysfunctional beliefs, and sexual double standards, while the male sexual function was predicted solely by sexual satisfaction. Additionally, female sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function, relationship satisfaction, and sexual dysfunctional beliefs, while male sexual satisfaction was predicted by sexual function and relationship satisfaction. RESULTS: Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function, Brief Sexual Opinion Survey, Sexual Double Standards Scale, Sexual Dysfunctional Beliefs Questionnaire, New Sexual Satisfaction Scale, and Couple Satisfaction Index. CONCLUSION: This study provided novel information on the determinants of sexual function and satisfaction within a culture in which conservative religious beliefs still prevail. Results should be interpreted with caution given the unequal distribution of men and women, social desirability and volunteer biases, and the specific COVID-19 pandemic context during which the survey took place. Markers of sexual conservatism were inversely related to sexual function and satisfaction, mainly in women, and may, therefore, be important targets of treatment. Female sexuality seemed more context-dependent than male sexuality, although enhancing the general climate of the relationship may benefit feeling sexually satisfied in both men and women.

Available data suggest that COVID-19 case fatality rate had varied temporally (as the epidemic has progressed) and spatially (among countries). Here, we attempted to identify key factors possibly explaining the variability in case fatality rate across countries. We used data on the temporal trajectory of case fatality rate provided by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and country-specific data on different metrics describing the incidence of known comorbidity factors associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. We also compiled data on demography, economy and political regimes for each country. We found that temporal trajectories of case fatality rate greatly vary among countries. We found several factors associated with temporal changes in case fatality rate both among variables describing comorbidity risk and demographic, economic and political variables. In particular, countries with the highest values of DALYs lost to cardiovascular, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases had the highest values of COVID-19 CFR. CFR was also positively associated with the death rate due to smoking in people over 70 years. Interestingly, CFR was negatively associated with share of death due to lower respiratory infections. Among the demographic, economic and political variables, CFR was positively associated with share of the population over 70, GDP per capita, and level of democracy, while it was negatively associated with number of hospital beds ×1000. Overall, these results emphasize the role of comorbidity and socio-economic factors as possible drivers of COVID-19 case fatality rate at the population level.","Sorci, Gabriele; Faivre, Bruno; Morand, Serge",Sci Rep,,699

Here, we use a powerful and efficient computational strategy by combining machine learning (ML) based models and high-fidelity ensemble docking simulations to enable rapid screening of possible therapeutic molecules (or ligands). Our screening is based on the binding affinity to either the isolated SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at its host receptor region or to the Sprotein-human ACE2 interface complex, thereby potentially limiting and/or disrupting the host-virus interactions. We first apply our screening strategy to two drug datasets (CureFFI and DrugCentral) to identify hundreds of ligands that bind strongly to the aforementioned two systems. Candidate ligands were then validated by all atom docking simulations. The validated ML models were subsequently used to screen a large bio-molecule dataset (with nearly a million entries) to provide a rank-ordered list of ~19,000 potentially useful compounds for further validation. Overall, this work not only expands our knowledge of small-molecule treatment against COVID-19, but also provides an efficient pathway to perform high-throughput computational drug screening by combining quick ML surrogate models with expensive high-fidelity simulations, for accelerating the therapeutic cure of diseases.","Batra, Rohit; Chan, Henry; Kamath, Ganesh; Ramprasad, Rampi; Cherukara, Mathew J.; Sankaranarayanan, Subramanian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03766v1.pdf,699

The damage related to TBI is first due to the direct injury and then to a secondary phase in which neuroinflammation plays a key role. NLRP3 inflammasome is a component of the innate immune response and different diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, are characterized by NLRP3 activation. This review aims to describe NLRP3 inflammasome and the consequences related to its activation following TBI. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1ß, and IL-18 are significantly upregulated after TBI, therefore, the use of nonspecific, but mostly specific NLRP3 inhibitors is useful to ameliorate the damage post-TBI characterized by neuroinflammation. Moreover, NLRP3 and the molecules associated with its activation may be considered as biomarkers and predictive factors for other neurodegenerative diseases consequent to TBI. Complications such as continuous stimuli or viral infections, such as the SARS-CoV-2 infection, may worsen the prognosis of TBI, altering the immune response and increasing the neuroinflammatory processes related to NLRP3, whose activation occurs both in TBI and in SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review points out the role of NLRP3 in TBI and highlights the hypothesis that NLRP3 may be considered as a potential therapeutic target for the management of neuroinflammation in TBI.","Irrera, Natasha; Russo, Massimo; Pallio, Giovanni; Bitto, Alessandra; Mannino, Federica; Minutoli, Letteria; Altavilla, Domenica; Squadrito, Francesco",,,699

Predicting the disease severity at time of diagnosis can be helpful in prioritizing hospital admission and resources. METHODS: We prospectively recruited 1096 consecutive patients of whom 643 met the inclusion criterion with COVID-19 from Jaber Hospital, a COVID-19 facility in Kuwait, between 24 February and 20 April 2020. The primary endpoint of interest was disease severity defined algorithmically. Predefined risk variables were collected at the time of PCR based diagnosis of the infection. Prognostic model development used 5-fold cross-validated regularized logit regression. The model was externally validated against data from Wuhan, China. RESULTS: There were 643 patients with clinical course data of whom 94 developed severe COVID-19. In the final model, age, CRP, procalcitonin, lymphocyte percentage, monocyte percentages and serum albumin were independent predictors of a more severe illness course. The final prognostic model demonstrated good discrimination, and both discrimination and calibration were confirmed with an external dataset. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a simple score calculated at time of diagnosis that can predict patients with severe COVID-19 disease reliably and that has been validated externally.

With new findings suggesting that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, impacting the respiratory system and beyond in some individuals, we need new molecular targets for therapeutics innovation more than ever. We argue that the current pandemic will likely strip the limited resources from other diseases such as malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and among others affecting the African continent. Hence, we need to address not only COVID-19 but also its broader health care and societal impacts in Africa. Extensive diagnostic testing to trace and isolate the COVID-19 cases as well as basic income and economic support for those who are unable to work will be needed. A critically informed and democratic governance that builds on transparency and trust for the elected leaders is crucial. Finally, the pandemic offers a silver lining for Africa: the prospects to integrate omics research with long-standing expertise in herbal medicine in Africa, thus accelerating the advances toward novel molecular therapeutic targets for COVID-19 and precision herbal medicine worldwide.","Dandara, Collet; Dzobo, Kevin; Chirikure, Shadreck",Omics,,699

In this single-center study we prospectively acquired and evaluated 100 recorded ten-second cine-loops in confirmed COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. All loops were rated by ten observers with different subspeciality backgrounds for four times by each observer (400 loops overall) in a random sequence using a web-based rating tool. We analyzed inter- and intraobserver variability for specific pathologies and a semiquantitative LUS score. Interobserver agreement for both, identification of specific pathologies and assignment of LUS scores was fair to moderate (e.g., LUS score 1 Fleiss' &#954; = 0.27; subpleural consolidations Fleiss' &#954; = 0.59). Intraobserver agreement was mostly moderate to substantial with generally higher agreement for more distinct findings (e.g., lowest LUS score 0 vs. highest LUS score 3 (median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.71 vs. 0.79) or air bronchograms (median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.72)). Intraobserver consistency was relatively low for intermediate LUS scores (e.g. LUS Score 1 median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.52). We therefore conclude that more distinct LUS findings (e.g., air bronchograms, subpleural consolidations) may be more suitable for disease monitoring, especially with more than one investigator and that training material used for LUS in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) should pay refined attention to areas such as B-line quantification and differentiation of intermediate LUS scores.","Lerchbaumer, Markus H; Lauryn, Jonathan H; Bachmann, Ulrike; Enghard, Philipp; Fischer, Thomas; Grune, Jana; Hegemann, Niklas; Khadzhynov, Dmytro; Kruse, Jan Matthias; Lehner, Lukas J; Lindner, Tobias; Oezkan, Timur; Zickler, Daniel; Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Hamm, Bernd; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Muench, Frédéric",Sci Rep,,699

Here, we test the participation of KCa-channels in human heart explant-derived cell (EDC) physiology and therapeutic potential. TRAM34-sensitive KCa3.1-channels, encoded by the KCNN4 gene, are exclusively expressed in therapeutically bioactive EDC subfractions and maintain a strongly polarized resting potential; whereas therapeutically inert EDCs lack KCa3.1 channels and exhibit depolarized resting potentials. Somatic gene transfer of KCNN4 results in membrane hyperpolarization and increases intracellular [Ca2+], which boosts cell-proliferation and the production of pro-healing cytokines/nanoparticles. Intramyocardial injection of EDCs after KCNN4-gene overexpression markedly increases the salutary effects of EDCs on cardiac function, viable myocardium and peri-infarct neovascularization in a well-established murine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thus, electrophysiological engineering provides a potentially valuable strategy to improve the therapeutic value of progenitor cells for cardioprotection and possibly other indications.","Vigneault, Patrick; Parent, Sandrine; Kanda, Pushpinder; Michie, Connor; Davis, Darryl R; Nattel, Stanley",Nat Commun,,699
406093,"Hospitalization Rates and Characteristics of Patients Hospitalized with Laboratory-Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 — COVID-NET, 14 States, March 1–30, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Diagnostic or procedural coding of clinical notes aims to derive a coded summary of disease-related information about patients. Such coding is usually done manually in hospitals but could potentially be automated to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical coding. Recent studies on deep learning for automated medical coding achieved promising performances. However, the explainability of these models is usually poor, preventing them to be used confidently in supporting clinical practice. Another limitation is that these models mostly assume independence among labels, ignoring the complex correlations among medical codes which can potentially be exploited to improve the performance. METHODS: To address the issues of model explainability and label correlations, we propose a Hierarchical Label-wise Attention Network (HLAN), which aimed to interpret the model by quantifying importance (as attention weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE) initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation and then injects the representation into the final layers and the label-wise attention layers in the models. We evaluated the methods using three settings on the MIMIC-III discharge summaries: full codes, top-50 codes, and the UK NHS (National Health Service) COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) shielding codes. Experiments were conducted to compare the HLAN model and label embedding initialisation to the state-of-the-art neural network based methods, including variants of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RESULTS: HLAN achieved the best Micro-level AUC and F1 on the top-50 code prediction, 91.9% and 64.1%, respectively; and comparable results on the NHS COVID-19 shielding code prediction to other models: around 97% Micro-level AUC. More importantly, in the analysis of model explanations, by highlighting the most salient words and sentences for each label, HLAN showed more meaningful and comprehensive model interpretation compared to the CNN-based models and its downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Label embedding (LE) initialisation significantly boosted the previous state-of-the-art model, CNN with attention mechanisms, on the full code prediction to 52.5% Micro-level F1. The analysis of the layers initialised with label embeddings further explains the effect of this initialisation approach. The source code of the implementation and the results are openly available at https://github.com/acadTags/Explainable-Automated-Medical-Coding. CONCLUSION: We draw the conclusion from the evaluation results and analyses. First, with hierarchical label-wise attention mechanisms, HLAN can provide better or comparable results for automated coding to the state-of-the-art, CNN-based models. Second, HLAN can provide more comprehensive explanations for each label by highlighting key words and sentences in the discharge summaries, compared to the n-grams in the CNN-based models and the downgraded baselines, HAN and HA-GRU. Third, the performance of deep learning based multi-label classification for automated coding can be consistently boosted by initialising label embeddings that captures the correlations among labels.

METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cohort study was conducted from a random sample of 733 adult patients (age &#8805; 18 years) obtained from a total of 4356 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases who presented to the Emergency Department of Montefiore Medical Center between March-June 2020. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital severe outcomes of COVID-19. A secondary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Among the 733 patients included in our final analysis, 438 patients (59.8%) presented with anemia. 105 patients (14.3%) had mild, and 333 patients (45.5%) had moderate-severe anemia. Overall, 437 patients (59.6%) had a composite endpoint of severe outcomes. On-admission anemia was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, (Odds Ratio 1.52, 95% CI [1.01-2.30], p = 0.046) but not for composite severe outcomes. However, moderate-severe anemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) on admission was independently associated with both severe outcomes (OR1.53, 95% CI [1.05-2.23], p = 0.028) and mortality (OR 1.67, 95% CI [1.09-2.56], p = 0.019) during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Anemia on admission was independently associated with increased odds of all-cause mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Furthermore, moderate-severe anemia (Hb <11 g/dL) was an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 outcomes. Moving forward, COVID-19 patient management and risk stratification may benefit from addressing anemia on admission.","Oh, Seung Mi; Skendelas, John P; Macdonald, Eric; Bergamini, Michael; Goel, Swati; Choi, Jaeun; Segal, Kathryn R; Vivek, Kumar; Nair, Singh; Leff, Jonathan",Am J Emerg Med,,699

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their health care systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policy makers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from North Carolina and the greater Charlotte Region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics such as the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte Region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI 2.11-3.25) and in North Carolina 2.94 days (95% CI 2.33-4.00). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte Region to 4.70 days (95% CI 3.77-6.22) and in North Carolina to 4.01 days (95% CI 3.43-4.83). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte Region compared to North Carolina as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for North Carolina and 0.43 for the Charlotte Region. In addition, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policy makers, public health officials, and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","Turk, Philip J; Chou, Shih-Hsiung; Kowalkowski, Marc A; Palmer, Pooja P; Priem, Jennifer S; Spencer, Melanie D; Taylor, Yhenneko J; McWilliams, Andrew D",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,699

To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. METHODS: Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. CONCLUSION: Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19. Veterans with greater prepandemic psychiatric and substance use problems, COVID-related stressors and fewer psychosocial resources may be at increased risk of these outcomes.","Na, Peter; Tsai, J; Harpaz-Rotem, I; Pietrzak, R",,,699

However, practical studies have often criticized this linear regression model due to its sensitivity to departure from the normality and from the partial nonlinearity. This paper proposes to solve these potential issues simultaneously in the context of the partial linear regression model by assuming that the random errors follow a scale-mixture of normal (SMN) family of distributions. The proposed method allows us to model data with great flexibility, accommodating heavy tails, and outliers. By implementing the B-spline function and using the convenient hierarchical representation of the SMN distributions, a computationally analytical EM-type algorithm is developed to perform maximum likelihood inference of the model parameters. Various simulation studies are conducted to investigate the finite sample properties as well as the robustness of the model in dealing with the heavy-tails distributed datasets. Real-word data examples are finally analyzed for illustrating the usefulness of the proposed methodology.","Naderi, Mehrdad; Mirfarah, Elham; Bernhardt, Matthew; Chen, Ding-Geng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07559v1.pdf,699

Online learning is a novel experience for medical education in Sri Lanka. A novel approach to undergraduate surgical learning was taken up in an attempt to improve the interest amongst the students in clinical practice while maximizing the limited contact time. METHOD: Online learning activity was designed involving medical students from all stages and multi consultant panel discussions. The discussions were designed to cover each topic from basic sciences to high-level clinical management in an attempt to stimulate the student interest in clinical medicine. Online meeting platform with free to use basic plan and a social media platform were used in combination to communicate with the students. The student feedback was periodically assessed for individual topics as well as for general outcome. Lickert scales and numeric scales were used to acquire student agreement on the desired learning outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1047 student responses for 7 questionnaires were analysed. During a 6-week period, 24 surgical topics were discussed with 51 contact hours. Eighty-seven per cent definitely agreed (highest agreement) with the statement 'students benefitted from the discussions'. Over 95% have either participated for all or most sessions. A majority of the respondents (83.4%) 'definitely agreed' that the discussions helped to improve their clinical sense. Of the total respondents, 79.3% definitely agreed that the discussions helped to build an interest in clinical medicine. Around 90% agreed that both exam-oriented and clinical practice-oriented topics were highly important and relevant. Most widely raised concerns were the poor Internet connectivity and limitation of access to the meeting platform. CONCLUSION: Online teaching with a novel structure is feasible and effective in a resource-limited setting. Students agree that it could improve clinical interest while meeting the expected learning outcomes.","Chandrasinghe, P C; Siriwardana, R C; Kumarage, S K; Munasinghe, B N L; Weerasuriya, A; Tillakaratne, S; Pinto, D; Gunathilake, B; Fernando, F R",BMC Med Educ,,699

Fungal epidemic was announced amid COVID pandemic with several cases of COVID-associated mucormycosis and aspergillosis being reported. But, there is no data regarding mixed fungal infections in COVID patients. Materials and MethodsThe study presented a series of ten consecutive cases with dual invasive molds in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID in May 2021 at a tertiary care center in North India, ten microbiologically confirmed dual/mixed COVID-associated mucor-aspergillosis (CAMA) were evaluated. ResultsAll patients were diabetics with the majority having severe COVID pneumonia (6/10, 60%) either on admission or in the past one month, whilst two were each of moderate (20%) and mild (20%) categories of COVID. The patients were managed with amphotericin-B along with surgical intervention. In this case series, 70% of all CAMA (Rhizopus arrhizus with Aspergillus flavus in seven and Aspergillus fumigatus in three patients) patients survived, connoting the critical importance of a high index of clinical suspicion and accurate microbiological diagnosis for managing invasive molds. ConclusionsMixed fungal infections i.e. CAMA during COVID and post-COVID periods may be an emerging disease. This outbreak is seen particularly in such patients with uncontrolled diabetes, on steroids, or cocktail therapy, or living in unhygienic environments.We believe that our findings would help gain a better insight into the risk and progression of invasive fungal mixed infections among COVID patients and thus play a pivotal role in diagnosing, classifying, and implementing an effective management strategy for treating similar cases in the future.","Singh, Vanya; Prasad, Amber; Panda, Prasan Kumar; Totaganti, Manjunath; Tyagi, Amit; Thaduri, Abhinav; Rao, Shalini; Bairwa, Mukesh; Singh, Ashok K",,,699

Our approach is motivated by the close similarities between the steps industrial designers follow to draw 3D shapes, and the operations CAD modeling systems offer to create similar shapes. To overcome the strong ambiguity with parsing 2D sketches, we observe that in a sketching sequence, each step makes sense and can be interpreted in the \emph{context} of what has been drawn before. In our system, this context corresponds to a partial CAD model, inferred in the previous steps, which we feed along with the input sketch to a deep neural network in charge of interpreting how the model should be modified by that sketch. Our deep network architecture then recognizes the intended CAD operation and segments the sketch accordingly, such that a subsequent optimization estimates the parameters of the operation that best fit the segmented sketch strokes. Since there exists no datasets of paired sketching and CAD modeling sequences, we train our system by generating synthetic sequences of CAD operations that we render as line drawings. We present a proof of concept realization of our algorithm supporting four frequently used CAD operations. Using our system, participants are able to quickly model a large and diverse set of objects, demonstrating Sketch2CAD to be an alternate way of interacting with current CAD modeling systems.","Li, Changjian; Pan, Hao; Bousseau, Adrien; Mitra, Niloy J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04927v1.pdf,699

Many countries have pointed out that electricity supply security during the epidemic is critical to ensuring people's livelihood. Accurate prediction of electricity demand would act a more important role in ensuring energy security for all the countries. Although there have been many studies on electricity forecasting, they did not consider the pandemic, and many works only considered the prediction accuracy and ignored the stability. Driven by the above reasons, it is necessary to develop an electricity consumption prediction model that can be well applied in the pandemic. In this work, a hybrid prediction system is proposed with data processing, modelling, and optimization. An improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise is used for data preprocessing, which overcomes the shortcomings of the original method; a multi-objective optimizer is adopted for ensuring the accuracy and stability; support vector machine is used as the prediction model. Taking daily electricity demand of US as an example, the results prove that the proposed hybrid models are superior to benchmark models in both prediction accuracy and stability. Moreover, selection of input parameters is discussed, and the results indicate that the model considering the daily infections has the highest prediction accuracy and stability, and it is proved that the proposed model has great potential in real-world applications.","Lu, Hongfang; Ma, Xin; Ma, Minda",Energy (Oxf),,699

Here, we overexpressed SARS-CoV-2 genes in A549 lung epithelial cells. We then isolated extracellular vesicles (EVs) and detected the presence of viral RNA within these EVs. We observed that human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are receptive to these EVs, and viral genes were detectable in the cardiomyocytes.

502007,"COVID-19 Trends Among Persons Aged 0-24 Years - United States, March 1-December 12, 2020",2021,"BackgroundWidely available rapid testing is pivotal to the fight against COVID-19. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) remains the gold standard. We compared two frequently used commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2-antigens, the SD Biosensor SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Test (Roche Diagnostics) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test (Abbott Diagnostics), against rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. MethodsWe compared the tests in 2215 all-comers at a diagnostic centre between February 1 and March 31, 2021. rRT-PCR-positive samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 variants. Findings338 participants (15%) were rRT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivities of Roche-RDT and Abbott-RDT were 60.4% and 56.8% (P<0{middle dot}0001) and specificities 99.7% and 99.8% (P=0{middle dot}076), respectively. Sensitivity inversely correlated with rRT-PCR-derived Ct values. Unadjusted, the RDTs had higher sensitivities in individuals referred by treating physicians and health departments than those tested for other reasons, in persons without comorbidities compared to those with comorbidities, in individuals with symptoms suggesting COVID-19, and in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to Alpha variant carriers. The associations of sensitivity with clinical symptoms and the SARS-CoV-2 genotype were robust against adjustment for Ct values. Assuming that 10 000 symptomatic individuals are tested, 500 of which are truly positive, the RDTs would generate 38 false-positive and 124 false-negative results. Assuming that 10 000 asymptomatic individuals are tested, including 50 true positives, 18 false-positives and 34 false-negatives would be generated. InterpretationThe sensitivities of the two RDTs are unsatisfactory. This calls into question whether their widespread use is effective in the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. FundingSYNLAB Holding Deutschland GmbH Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSSmall studies and a meta-analysis from the Cochrance collaboration indicate vastly different diagnostic efficacies of commercial rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants has not been known. Added value of this studyThis is one of the largest real-world studies of the diagnostic efficacy of two widely recommended RDTs SARS-CoV-2 antigen in comparison to rRT-PCR. The sensitivities of the two RDTs are unsatisfactory, mainly in asymptomatic persons. Presence of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha Variant decreased both tests sensitivities significantly. Implications of all the available evidencePolicy and health care providers should account for substantial limitations of RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 particular in asymptomatic persons. Research into alternative approaches to the screening for SARS-CoV-2 should be intensified.","Wertenauer, Christoph; Brenner-Michael, Geovana; Dressel, Alexander; Pfeifer, Caroline; Hauser, Ulrike; Wieland, Eberhard; Mayer, Christian; Mutschmann, Caren; Roskos, Martin; Wertenauer, Hans-Joerg; Maerz, Winfried",,,699

In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to determine face mask-wearing behaviors and practices in 1173 young Polish people during the second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in October 2020. The majority of respondents (97.4%) declared that they wore face masks in areas/situations where it is mandatory. The most common types of utilized face masks were cloth masks (47.7%) and surgical masks (47%), followed by respirators (N95/FFP3) (3.2%) and half-face elastomeric respirators (0.9%). Over 38% reported frequently disinfecting their face masks, especially females. Respondents reporting personal atopic predisposition (64.5% vs. 72.1%;p = 0.02) or sensitive skin (65.5% vs. 74.3%;p = 0.005) declared multiple use of face masks less commonly than other individuals. Individuals suffering from facial skin lesions declared disinfecting face masks more commonly (40.8% vs. 34.9%;p = 0.04). Overall, the self-declared utilization of face masks among young people in Poland has improved since the beginning of the epidemic as compared with our previous study. Until the mass vaccination of the public is achieved and government policy is changed, face mask use remains a valuable tool to decrease the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Reszke, R.; Szepietowska, M.; Krajewski, P.

This paper describes the foremost methods and outcomes of airway management in patients in the emergency department who required intubation for status asthmaticus. METHODS: We analyzed all intubations with a primary indication of asthma over a 3-y period (January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018) using the National Emergency Airway Registry (NEAR), a 25-center, prospective, observational registry of emergency department intubations. We report the incidence of intubations for asthma, methods and medications used, devices used, peri-intubation adverse events, and intubation success and failures using univariate descriptive statistics and cluster-adjusted incidence with 95% CI. RESULTS: A total of 19,071 encounters were recorded during the study period, with 14,517 patients intubated for medical indications. Of those, 173 (1.2%, 95% CI 0.9-1.6) were intubated for asthma. The first-attempt success rate was 90.8% (95% CI 81.9-95.5), and overall intubation success was 100%. Compared to the medical registry as a whole, patients with asthma were more likely to undergo rapid-sequence intubation (96.5% [95% CI 92.9-98.3] vs 80.8% [95% CI 75.1-82.5]), preoxygenation with bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP) (62.9% [95% CI 49.6-74.6] vs 13.5% (95% CI 10.4-16.9]), and induction with ketamine (51.8% [95% CI 30.6-71.4] vs 11.6% [95% CI 7.6-16.8]). The adverse event rate in the patients with asthma was 12.14% (95% CI 8.1-17.9) compared to 11.93% (95% CI 9.79-14.12) in the medical registry. CONCLUSIONS: Status asthmaticus accounts for about 1% of emergent medical intubations. The majority of patients are intubated using rapid-sequence intubation after preoxygenation with BPAP and induction with ketamine, with the latter 2 practices being much more common for emergent intubations for status asthmaticus than for other medical indications.","Godwin, Haley T; Fix, Megan L; Baker, Olesya; Madsen, Troy; Walls, Ron M; Brown, Calvin A",Respir. care,,699

The results showed that human IFITM3 did not affect the assembly and morphogenesis of progeny adenovirus. Human IFITM3 can be expressed in both A549 and MDCK cells in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, cells infected with rAd5-IFITM3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 for 24 h were challenged with avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1 at an MOI of 1 for 6, 12 and 24 h. Rates of H5N1 infection in rAd5-IFITM3 cells were significantly decreased at 24 h post-infection (hpi), in a time dependent manner, compared with that of wild type wtAd5-infected cells. The expressions of viral genes were significantly inhibited at transcriptional and translational levels at 6 and 12 hpi.

In this study, we identified immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitopes in the RBD and the non-RBD domain of the spike antigen using a novel TCR-binding algorithm. A selected pool of 11 predicted epitopes induced robust T-cell activation in unexposed donors demonstrating pre-existing CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 antigen. The T-cell reactivity to the predicted epitopes was higher than the Spike-S1 and S2 peptide pools containing 157 and 158 peptides both in unexposed donors and in convalescent patients suggesting that strong T-cell epitopes are likely to be missed when larger peptide pools are used in assays. A key finding of our study is that pre-existing T-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is contributed by TCRs that recognize common viral antigens such as Influenza and CMV, even though the viral epitopes lack sequence identity to the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. This finding is in contrast to multiple published studies in which pre-existing T-cell immunity is suggested to arise from shared epitopes between SARS-CoV-2 and other common cold-causing coronaviruses. Whether the presence of pre-existing T-cell immunity provides protection against COVID-19 or contributes to severe disease phenotype remains to be determined in a larger cohort. However, our findings raise the expectation that a significant majority of the global population is likely to have SARS-CoV-2 reactive T-cells because of prior exposure to flu and CMV viruses, in addition to common cold-causing coronaviruses.","Mahajan, Swapnil; Kode, Vasumathi; Bhojak, Keshav; Magdalene, Coral M.; Lee, Kayla; Manoharan, Malini; Ramesh, Athulya; Sudheendra, HV; Srivastava, Ankita; Sathian, Rekha; Khan, Tahira; Kumar, Prasanna; Chakraborty, Papia; Chaudhuri, Amitabha",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.367375,699

We develop an approach to estimate the economic potential of crop reallocation using a Bayesian hierarchical model of yields. We apply the model to six crops in the United States, and show that it outperforms traditional empirical models under cross-validation. The fitted model parameters provide evidence of considerable existing climate adaptation across counties. If crop locations are held constant in the future, total agriculture profits for the six crops will drop by 31% for the temperature patterns of 2070 under RCP 8.5. When crop lands are reallocated to avoid yield decreases and take advantage of yield increases, half of these losses are avoided (16% loss), but 57% of counties are allocated crops different from those currently planted.

Alongside political and financial barriers is a limited understanding of the roles, impacts, contexts and mechanisms for peer involvement, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. We conducted a rapid review of available literature on this topic. METHODS: Within a community-academic partnership, we used a rapid review approach, framed by realist theory. We used a network search strategy, focused on core journals and reference lists of related reviews. Twenty-nine studies were included. We developed thematic summaries framed by a realist approach of exploring interventions, their mechanisms, outcomes and how they are shaped by contexts. RESULTS: Reported outcomes of peer involvement included reduced HIV incidence and prevalence; increased service access, acceptability and quality; changed risk behaviours; and reduced stigma and discrimination. Mechanisms via which these roles work were trust, personal commitment and empathy, using community knowledge and experience, as well as ‘bridge’ and ‘role model’ processes. Contexts of criminalisation, under-resourced health systems, and stigma and discrimination were found to shape these roles, their mechanisms and outcomes. Though contexts and mechanisms are little explored within the literature, we identified a common theme across contexts, mechanisms and outcomes. Peer outreach interventions work through trust, community knowledge and expertise, and ‘bridge’ mechanisms (M) to counter criminalisation and constraining clinic and service delivery environments (C), contributing towards changed drug-using behaviours, increased access, acceptability and quality of harm reduction services and decreased stigma and discrimination (O). CONCLUSION: Peer involvement in HIV and harm reduction services in low- and middle-income settings is linked to positive health outcomes, shaped by contexts of criminalisation, stigma, and resource scarcity. However, peer involvement is under-theorised, particularly on how contexts shape mechanisms and ultimately outcomes. Efforts to study peer involvement need to develop theory and methods to evaluate the complex mechanisms and contexts that have influence. Finally, there is a need to expand the range of peer roles, to embrace the capacities and expertise of people who use drugs.","Chang, Judy; Shelly, Shaun; Busz, Machteld; Stoicescu, Claudia; Iryawan, Arif Rachman; Madybaeva, Dinara; de Boer, Yuri; Guise, Andy",Harm Reduct J,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00461-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33536033/,699

The end point is direct patient satisfaction comparison between face-to-face and telemedicine encounters/interactions prior and during the pandemic. RESULTS: There were 6,262 patient encounters from 01/01/2020 to 08/06/2020. Of the total encounters, 790 (12.6%) were via telemedicine, which were initiated on 03/11/2020 after the World Health Organization’s (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. These telemedicine encounters were readily adopted and embraced by both the providers and patients and remain popular as an option to patients for all types of visits. 78.7% of patients rated their overall health care experience during face-to-face encounters as “very good” and 80.6% of patients rated their health care experience during telemedicine encounters as “very good” (p=0.78). CONCLUSION: Although the COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented consequences to the practice of Medicine and specifically of Vascular Surgery, our multi-site health care system has been able to swiftly adapt and adopt telemedicine technologies for the care of our complex patients. Most importantly, the high quality of patient reported satisfaction and health care experience has remained unchanged.","Erben, Y.; Franco-Mesa, C.; Hamid, O.; Lin, M.; Stone, W.; Meltzer, A.J.; Hattery, W.; Palaj, A.; Wilshusen, L.L.; Vista, T.; Kalra, M.; Farres, H.; Bower, T.C.; De Martino, R.R.; Hakaim, A.G.; Huang, J.F.; Meschia, J.F.; TerKonda, S.P.",J Vasc Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420325489; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33338578/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420325489?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.12.012,699

In Mexico, these plants are traditionally used to alleviate or counteract rheumatism and inflammatory muscle diseases. In the present study we evaluated the activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of these four plants, on the replication of dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2). METHODS: Extraction process was carried out in a Soxtherm® system at 60, 85 and 120 °C; a chemical fractionation in silica gel chromatography was performed and compounds present in the active fractions were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MSn. The cytotoxic concentration and the inhibitory effect of extracts or fractions on the DENV2 replication were analyzed in the BHK-21 cell line (plaque forming assay). The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and the selectivity index (SI) were calculated for the extracts and fractions. RESULTS: The methanolic extracts at 60 °C of T. officinale and U. dioica showed the higher inhibitory effects on DENV2 replication. After the chemical fractionation, the higher activity fraction was found for U. dioica and T. officinale, presenting IC(50) values of 165.7 ± 3.85 and 126.1 ± 2.80 μg/ml, respectively; SI values were 5.59 and 6.01 for each fraction. The compounds present in T. officinale, were luteolin and caffeoylquinic acids derivatives and quercertin diclycosides. The compounds in the active fraction of U. dioica, were, chlorogenic acid, quercertin derivatives and flavonol glycosides (quercetin and kaempferol). CONCLUSIONS: Two fractions from U. dioica and T. officinale methanolic extracts with anti-dengue activity were found. The compounds present in both fractions were identified, several recognized molecules have demonstrated activity against other viral species. Subsequent biological analysis of the molecules, alone or in combination, contained in the extracts will be carried out to develop therapeutics against DENV2.","Flores-Ocelotl, María R.; Rosas-Murrieta, Nora H.; Moreno, Diego A.; Vallejo-Ruiz, Verónica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Domínguez, Fabiola; Santos-López, Gerardo",BMC Complement Altern Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29548293/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-018-2163-3,699

Drug repurposing has been employed to rapidly find a cure; but despite great efforts, no drug or vaccine is presently available for treating or prevention of COVID-19. Apart from antivirals, immunotherapeutic strategies are suggested considering the role of the immune response as the host defense again the virus, and the fact that SARS-CoV-2 suppresses interferon induction as an immune evasion strategy. Active immunization through vaccines, interferon administration, passive immunotherapy by convalescent plasma or synthesized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, as well as immunomodulatory drugs, are different immunotherapeutic approaches that will be mentioned in this review. The focus would be on passive immunotherapeutic interventions. Interferons might be helpful in some stages. Vaccine development has been followed with unprecedented speed. Some of these vaccines have been advanced to human clinical trials. Convalescent plasma therapy is already practiced in many countries to help save the lives of severely ill patients. Different antibodies that target various steps of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or the associated immune responses are also proposed. For treating the cytokine storm induced at a late stage of the disease in some patients, immune modulation through JAK inhibitors, corticosteroids, and some other cognate classes are evaluated. Given the changing pattern of cytokine induction and immune responses throughout the COVID-19 disease course, different adapted approaches are needed to help patients. Gaining more knowledge about the detailed pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, its interplay with the immune system, and viral-mediated responses are crucial to identify efficient preventive and therapeutic approaches. A systemic approach seems essential in this regard.","Owji, Hajar; Negahdaripour, Manica; Hajighahramani, Nasim",Int Immunopharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567576920324309?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567576920324309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877828/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106924,699

We performed a systemic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence and the duration of shedding of fecal RNA in patients with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese databases Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data up to June 2020 were searched for studies evaluating fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA, including anal and rectal samples, in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in patients with detectable respiratory RNA was estimated. The days of shedding and days to loss of fecal and respiratory RNA from presentation were compared. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies (N = 1,636) met criteria. The pooled prevalence of fecal RNA in COVID-19 patients was 43% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34%–52%). Higher proportion of patients with GI symptoms (52.4% vs 25.9%, odds ratio = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.7) compared with no GI symptoms, specifically diarrhea (51.6% vs 24.0%, odds ratio = 3.0, 95% CI 1.9–4.8), had detectable fecal RNA. After loss of respiratory RNA, 27% (95% CI 15%–44%) of the patients had persistent shedding of fecal RNA. Days of RNA shedding in the feces were longer than respiratory samples (21.8 vs 14.7 days, mean difference = 7.1 days, 95% CI 1.2–13.0). Furthermore, days to loss of fecal RNA lagged respiratory RNA by a mean of 4.8 days (95% CI 2.2–7.5). DISCUSSION: Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA is commonly detected in COVID-19 patients with a 3-fold increased risk with diarrhea. Shedding of fecal RNA lasted more than 3 weeks after presentation and a week after last detectable respiratory RNA.","Zhang, Yawen; Cen, Mengsha; Hu, Mengjia; Du, Lijun; Hu, Weiling; Kim, John J.; Dai, Ning",Clin Transl Gastroenterol,https://doi.org/10.14309/ctg.0000000000000343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835096/,699

The viral surface glycoprotein Spike binds to hACE2, which triggers virus entry into cells. As of today, the role of hACE2 for virus fusion is not well understood. Blocking the transition of Spike from its prefusion to post-fusion state might be a strategy to prevent or treat COVID-19. Here we report a single particle cryo-electron microscopy analysis of SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike in presence of the human ACE2 ectodomain. The binding of purified hACE2 ectodomain to Spike induces the disassembly of the trimeric form of Spike and a structural rearrangement of its S1 domain to form a stable, monomeric complex with hACE2. This observed hACE2 dependent dissociation of the Spike trimer suggests a mechanism for the therapeutic role of recombinant soluble hACE2 for treatment of COVID-19.","Ni, Dongchun; Lau, Kelvin; Lehmann, Frank; Fränkl, Andri; Hacker, David; Pojer, Florence; Stahlberg, Henning",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.12.336016,699

The newly arrived Rohingyas were accommodated in overcrowded refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District (CBD). The camps are highly vulnerable to landslides, tropical cyclones, flash-flooding, and communicable disease outbreak. Although a number of improvement measures are ongoing, however, no study to date has addressed Rohingyas' self-adopted strategies to mitigate disaster risks. Consequently, this paper aims to explore how refugees cope with risks associated with environmental hazards in the Kutupalong Rohingya Camp in CBD. A mixed-methods research strategy incorporating both quantitative household questionnaire survey and qualitative focus group discussions (FGDs) techniques were applied. In total 250 Rohingya refugees were selected for the questionnaire survey using a stratified random sampling method from camps 17 and 19, and two FGDs (male and female-only) were carried out in camp 13 involving 21 Rohingya participants. Results derived from the study show that responding to early warning systems, storing dried food and medicine, utilising available resources, relocating to safer shelters, and keeping hopes high were some of the coping strategies practised by the respondents. Literacy level imposed a significant impact over respondents' perception to accept various measures. For instance, the probability of storing dried food in preparation for disasters was 4 times higher among literate Rohingya compared to their illiterate counterparts. Similarly, for literate respondents, the probability was 20 times higher to store medicine than for illiterate. Guaranteed distribution of shelter strengthening kits among all refugee households, inclusion of disaster risk awareness and preparedness trainings, ensuring safe and dignified return in Myanmar, and global and regional cooperation to address the refugee crisis are some of the propositions recommended in this study for improving Rohingyas' future adaptation strategies in a humanitarian context.","Zaman, Shamrita; Sammonds, Peter; Ahmed, Bayes; Rahman, Taifur",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518743/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212420919317145; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420919317145?v=s5,699

A surge in firearm purchasing following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed to an increase in firearm violence. We sought to estimate the state-level association between firearm purchasing and interpersonal firearm violence during the pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia from January 2018 through July 2020. Data were obtained from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (a proxy for firearm purchasing) and the Gun Violence Archive. Using negative binomial regression models, we estimated the association between cumulative excess firearm purchases in March through July 2020 (measured as the difference between observed rates and those expected from autoregressive integrated moving average models) and injuries (including nonfatal and fatal) from intentional, interpersonal firearm violence (non-domestic and domestic violence). RESULTS: We estimated that there were 4.3 million excess firearm purchases nationally from March through July 2020 and a total of 4075 more firearm injuries than expected from April through July. We found no relationship between state-level excess purchasing and non-domestic firearm violence, e.g., each excess purchase per 100 population was associated with a rate ratio (RR) of firearm injury from non-domestic violence of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.50–1.02) in April; 0.99 (95% CI: 0.72–1.25) in May; 1.10 (95% CI: 0.93–1.32) in June; and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.85–1.12) in July. Excess firearm purchasing within states was associated with an increase in firearm injuries from domestic violence in April (RR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.32–5.93) and May (RR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.19–2.91), though estimates were sensitive to model specification. CONCLUSIONS: Nationwide, firearm purchasing and firearm violence increased substantially during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. At the state level, the magnitude of the increase in purchasing was not associated with the magnitude of the increase in firearm violence. Increases in purchasing may have contributed to additional firearm injuries from domestic violence in April and May. Results suggest much of the rise in firearm violence during our study period was attributable to other factors, indicating a need for additional research.

Although the RNA cap structures originating from human and microbial enzymes are often identical, the subunit composition, structure and catalytic mechanisms of the microbial‐encoded enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure are often significantly different from those of host cells. As a consequence, these pathogenic cap‐forming enzymes are potential targets for antimicrobial drugs. During the past few years, experimental studies have started to demonstrate that inhibition of the RNA capping activity is a reasonable approach for the development of antimicrobial agents. The combination of structural, biochemical, and molecular modeling studies are starting to reveal novel molecules that can serve as starting blocks for the design of more potent and specific antimicrobial agents. Here, we examine various strategies that have been developed to inhibit microbial enzymes involved in the synthesis of the RNA cap structure, emphasizing the challenges remaining to design potent and selective drugs.
