This disease is currently diagnosed by clinical features, chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Recently, some studies have suggested parenchymal consolidation and air bronchogram in severe cases. However, the effective treatment for COVID-19 patients with bronchogram has not been discussed. Herein, we report a case of 47-year-old woman who suffered from COVID-19 with bronchogram. These findings revealed that the body temperature and clinical laboratory test all returned to normal after this patient received a prolonged treatment. Furthermore, chest CT showed the bronchogram and consolidation resolved and nucleic acid retest of SARS-CoV-2 was also negative. These results provide an important reference for treatment option of COVID-19 with bronchogram.","Qian, W-J; Li, L; Sun, L-Y; Shi, H-R; Liu, H; Jing, X",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,629,1

Drug therapies and complementary medicine have been used to treat dysmenorrhea. The aim of this study was to investigate and offer an updated perspective on the treatments for dysmenorrhea. METHODS The present study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The required information was collected based on searches for the following keywords: treatment, primary dysmenorrhea, medicinal plants, chemical drugs, and herbs. Searches were performed on databases Pubmed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, Iran medex, and SID by March 2018 to find literature in the English and Persian languages on this subject without a time limit. RESULTS This review included 17 papers, 10 of which on complementary medicine, three on drug therapies, and four on acupuncture and acupressure. The largest and smallest samples had 303 and 24 patients, respectively. Length of treatment ranged from one to six months and the measures most commonly used in the studies were the visual analogue scale and clinical efficacy. Reported complications included gastrointestinal events, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and liver and kidney disorders. CONCLUSION Medicinal plants, drugs, and acupressure seem to suppress pain by reducing the level of prostaglandins, mediating nitric oxide, increasing beta-endorphin levels, blocking the calcium channel, and enhancing circulatory flow through the uterine pathway. Further trials are required to confirm the benefits of the procedures described and ensure the absence of complications.","Sharghi, Maedeh; Mansurkhani, Shabnam Malekpour; Larky, Damoon Ashtary; Kooti, Wesam; Niksefat, Mehdi; Firoozbakht, Mohammad; Behzadifar, Masoud; Azami, Milad; Servatyari, Karo; Jouybari, Leila",JBRA assisted reproduction,629,31

Nine Yazidi women participated in two small photovoice groups, each group lasting eight sessions (16 sessions total). Women discussed premigration and resettlement challenges, cultural strengths and resources, and strategies to overcome adversity. Yazidi women identified trauma and perceived loss of culture as primary stressors. Participants' resilience processes included using naan (as sustenance and symbol) to survive and thrive as well as by preserving an ethnoreligious identity. Findings suggest that women's health priorities and resilience-promoting strategies center on fostering a collective cultural, religious, and ethnic identity postmigration. Importantly, women used naan (bread) as a metaphor to index cultural values, experiences of distress, and coping strategies. We discuss implications for this in promoting refugees' mental and psychosocial health in U.S. resettlement.","Tippens, Julie A; Roselius, Kaitlin; Padasas, Irene; Khalaf, Gulie; Kohel, Kara; Mollard, Elizabeth; Sheikh, Izdihar Vianne",Qualitative health research,629,7

Factors affecting the adoption of surgical innovation are not well understood and proposed models of adoption do not accurately correlate with historical evidence. This protocol is for a systematic review that aims to identify the qualitative evidence relating to surgeon views regarding the adoption of novel surgical innovation into clinical practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance will be performed. Two independent reviewers will search the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews. Inclusion criteria are studies which report on the views of surgeons who adopt a novel surgical innovation into clinical practice. Each article will be screened for inclusion and assessed according to a Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. Data will be synthesised and analysed according to thematic analysis. Given the anticipated yield of a small heterogeneous body of evidence meeting the eligibility criteria for the review, a narrative-based summary is planned. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This review does not require formal ethical approval as it does not involve direct patient contact or patient-identifiable data. The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at relevant conferences. The results will also inform an empirical qualitative study exploring surgeon and other stakeholder views regarding the introduction of novel surgical technology and procedures into clinical practice.

This retrospective case-control study examined the prevalence, risk factors and geographic distribution of chalazia in a large veteran population. METHODS Data on all individuals seen at a Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic between October 2010 and October 2015 were extracted from the VA health database. Subjects were grouped based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for chalazion. Univariable logistic regression modelling was used to identify clinical and demographic factors associated with chalazion presence, followed by multivariable modelling to examine which factors predicted risk concomitantly. All cases were mapped across the continental US using geographic information systems modelling to examine how prevalence rates varied geographically. RESULTS Overall, 208 720 of 3 453 944 (6.04%) subjects were diagnosed with chalazion during the study period. Prevalence was highest in coastal regions. The mean age of the population was 69.32±13.9 years and most patients were male (93.47%), white (77.13%) and non-Hispanic (93.72%). Factors associated with chalazion risk included smoking (OR=1.12, p<0.0005), conditions of the tear film (blepharitis (OR=4.84, p<0.0005), conjunctivitis (OR=2.78, p<0.0005), dry eye (OR=3.0, p<0.0005)), conditions affecting periocular skin (eyelid dermatitis (OR=2.95, p<0.0005), rosacea (OR=2.50, p<0.0005)), allergic conditions (history of allergies (OR=1.56, p<0.0005)) and systemic disorders (gastritis (OR=1.54, p<0.0005), irritable bowel syndrome (OR=1.45, p<0.0005), depression (OR=1.35, p<0.0005), anxiety (OR=1.31, p<0.0005)). These factors remained associated with chalazion risk when examined concomitantly. CONCLUSION Periocular skin, eyelid margin and tear film abnormalities were most strongly associated with risk for chalazion. The impact of environmental conditions on risk for chalazion represents an area in need of further study.","Patel, Sneh; Tohme, Natalia; Gorrin, Emmanuel; Kumar, Naresh; Goldhagen, Brian; Galor, Anat",The British journal of ophthalmology,629,29

In rat experimental model, a 1.5 × 2.0 cm defect in abdominal wall was reconstructed by using the Permacol surgical implant or knitted meshes produced from either PDO monofilament, or PGA multifilament. The implant sites were assessed for the tensile strength and the extents of material resorption, host inflammatory response and host tissue replacement on days 3, 10, 30, or 60 after the surgery. The PDO and PGA meshes were rapidly pervaded by the host connective tissue with elements of skeletal muscle histogenesis. The degree of adhesions was significantly higher in the Permacol group. All of the prostheses underwent resorption, which correlated with gradual decreases in the overall tensile strength of the site and the Col1a1 gene expression level. Elevated expression of Fgf2 gene maintained longer in the PDO group, and the Mmp9 gene expression level in this group was higher than in the other groups. Gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were higher in the Permacol group. The foreign body giant cell numbers were lower in the PDO and Permacol groups than in the PGA group. Minimal macrophage infiltration with predominance of M2 cells was observed in the PDO group. Overall, the PDO prosthesis turned out to be significantly better than the PGA or Permacol prostheses by a number of indicators of biocompatibility and efficacy. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here we assess these genetic alterations for the first time in a cohort from North of Morocco. METHODS Thirty-three patients diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of ≤40 years were recruited irrespective of breast and/or ovarian cancer family history. Coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were sequenced from peripheral blood DNA using Ion Proton (Thermo Fisher Scientific) next generation sequencing platform. RESULTS Overall, five BRCA germline mutations were identified (15.1%). The frequency of mutations among patients with family history of breast cancer was 16.7%. Three mutations were found in BRCA1 (9%) and two within the BRCA2 gene (6%). These are three frameshift mutations (c.798_799del, c.2125_2126insA, c.5116_5119delAATA), one missense (c.116G > A) and one nonsense mutation (c.289G > T). The mutation c.5116_5119delAATA has a founder effect in North Africa. Moreover, one variant of unknown significance was identified in BRCA2 (c.4090A > G). Most BRCA mutations carriers (80%) had no family history of breast cancer. CONCLUSION Our data do not support the hypothesis that BRCA mutations alone explain the higher frequency of breast cancer in Moroccan young women. The young age (≤40 years) for breast cancer diagnosis seems to be strongly predictive of BRCA mutation status in Moroccan patients. These results will help in decision making with regard to genetic counseling and testing in the national scale.","Bakkach, Joaira; Mansouri, Mohamed; Derkaoui, Touria; Loudiyi, Ali; El Fahime, ElMostafa; Barakat, Amina; Ghailani Nourouti, Naima; Martinez De Villarreal, Jaime; Cortijo Bringas, Carlos; Bennani Mechita, Mohcine",BMC cancer,629,1

However, fibroblast impurity during WJ-MSCs isolation is unavoidable because of morphological similarities and shared surface markers. Here, a proteomic approach was employed to identify specific proteins differentially expressed by WJ-MSCs in comparison to those by neonatal foreskin and adult skin fibroblasts (NFFs and ASFs, respectively). Mass spectrometry analysis identified 454 proteins with a transmembrane domain. These proteins were then compared across the different cell-lines and categorized based on their cellular localizations, biological processes, and molecular functions. The expression patterns of a selected set of proteins were further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunofluorescence assays. As anticipated, most of the studied proteins had common expression patterns. However, EphA2, SLC25A4, and SOD2 were predominantly expressed by WJ-MSCs, while CDH2 and Talin2 were specific to NFFs and ASFs, respectively. Here, EphA2 was established as a potential surface-specific marker to distinguish WJ-MSCs from fibroblasts and for prospective use to prepare pure primary cultures of WJ-MSCs. Additionally, CDH2 could be used for a negative-selection isolation/depletion method to remove neonatal fibroblasts contaminating preparations of WJ-MSCs.","Al Madhoun, Ashraf; Marafie, Sulaiman K; Haddad, Dania; Melhem, Motasem; Abu-Farha, Mohamed; Ali, Hamad; Sindhu, Sardar; Atari, Maher; Al-Mulla, Fahd",International journal of molecular sciences,629,16

The technical and oncologic differences between these modalities are unclear. METHODS We conducted a matched-cohort analysis of patients undergoing open MWA or RFA for CRLM at a tertiary-care center between 2008 and 2011; the primary endpoint was ablation-site recurrence. Tumors were matched by size, clinical-risk score, and arterial-intrahepatic or systemic chemotherapy use. Outcomes were compared using conditional logistic regression and stratified log-rank test. RESULTS We matched 254 tumors (127 per group) from 134 patients. MWA and RFA groups were comparable by age, gender, median number of tumors treated, proximity to major vessels, and postoperative complication rates. Patients in the MWA group had lower ablation-site recurrence rates (6% vs. 20%; P < 0.01). Median follow-up, however, was significantly shorter in the MWA group (18 months [95% confidence interval 17-20] vs. 31 months [95% confidence interval 28-35]; P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of ablation-site recurrence at 2 years were significantly lower for the lesions treated with MWA (7% vs. 18%, P: 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Ablation-site recurrences of CRLM were lower with MWA compared with RFA in this matched cohort analysis. Longer follow-up time in the MWA may increase the recurrence rate; however, actuarial local failure estimations demonstrated better local control with MWA.","Correa-Gallego, Camilo; Fong, Yuman; Gonen, Mithat; D'Angelica, Michael I; Allen, Peter J; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Jarnagin, William R; Kingham, T Peter",Annals of surgical oncology,629,12

As a result of social distancing policies, the risk for loneliness and associated decline in quality of life has increased. The current study examined factors associated with loneliness and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic cross-sectionally (n = 797) and longitudinally (n = 395). Older age and larger social network size were associated with less loneliness, whereas having multiple physical or mental health diagnoses was associated with greater loneliness. Greater virtual social contact was also associated with increased loneliness. Greater loneliness was associated with all domains of quality of life both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Understanding factors associated with loneliness is critical to developing effective strategies at reducing loneliness and improving quality of life during the pandemic. Contrary to popular perceptions, older age was associated with less loneliness and more virtual social contact was associated with more loneliness. Thus, it may be prudent to deemphasize virtual social contact in public campaigns and to emphasize safe methods of interacting in person.","Rumas, Rachel; Shamblaw, Amanda L; Jagtap, Shreya; Best, Michael W",Psychiatry research,629,1

The average cadence of the SSC cycling trial was then used as a target for the FC of cycling that the participants were instructed to maintain. The motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited via transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex were recorded from the biceps brachii during each trial of SSC and FC arm cycling. RESULTS Corticospinal excitability, as assessed via normalized MEP amplitudes (MEPs were made relative to a maximal compound muscle action potential), was not different between groups.

Jamil hospital padang, Indonesia",19.357878,12.736877,2021,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people around the world both directly through the infection itself and indirectly through its economic, social and sanitary impact. Collecting data over time is essential for the understanding of the disease spread, the incidence of COVID19-like symptoms, the level and dynamics of immunity, as well as the long-term impact of the pandemic. Objective The objective was to set up a longitudinal follow-up of adult participants of serosurveys carried out in the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Serosurvey participants were invited to create an account on the dedicated digital platform Specchio-COVID19 (https://www.specchio-covid19.ch/). Upon registration, an initial questionnaire assessed socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics (including housing conditions, physical activity, diet, alcohol and tobacco consumption), general health, and experience related to COVID-19 (symptoms, COVID-19 test results, quarantines, hospitalizations). Weekly, participants were invited to fill in a short questionnaire with updates on self-reported COVID-19-compatible symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and vaccination. A more detailed questionnaire about mental health, well-being, risk perception, and changes in working conditions was proposed monthly. Supplementary questionnaires were proposed at regular intervals to assess more in depth the impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health, vaccination adherence, health care consumption and changes in health behaviors. At baseline, serology testing allowed to assess the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the general population and subgroups of workers. Additionally, seropositive participants and a sample of randomly selected participants were invited for serologic testing at regular intervals in order to monitor both the seropersistance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of the Canton of Geneva. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Cantonal Research Ethics Commission of Geneva (CCER Project ID 2020-00881). Results will be disseminated via the Specchio-COVID19 platform and scientific articles.","Baysson, H.; Pennachio, F.; Wisniak, A.; Zabella, M.

We utilized BERT and RoBERTa models to identify claims in social media text a professional fact-checker should review, and rank these in priority order for the fact-checker. For the English challenge, we fine-tuned a RoBERTa model and added an extra mean pooling layer and a dropout layer to enhance generalizability to unseen text. For the Arabic task, we fine-tuned Arabic-language BERT models and demonstrate the use of back-translation to amplify the minority class and balance the dataset.

The aim of this study is to delineate the trauma patterns and outcomes at Aintree University Teaching Hospital level 1 Major Trauma Centre (MTC) during the COVID-19 lockdown imposed by the U.K. government. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study data from the Merseyside and Cheshire Trauma Audit and Research Network database were analysed. The 7-week 'lockdown period' was compared to a 7-week period prior to the lockdown and also to an equivalent 7-week period corresponding to the previous year. RESULTS: A total of 488 patients were included in the study. Overall, there was 37.6% and 30.0% reduction in the number of traumatic injuries during lockdown. Road traffic collisions (RTC) reduced by 42.6% and 46.6%. RTC involving a car significantly reduced during lockdown, conversely, bike-related RTC significantly increased. No significant changes were noted in deliberate self-harm, trauma severity and crude mortality during lockdown. There was 1 mortality from COVID-19 infection in the lockdown cohort. CONCLUSION: Trauma continues during lockdown, our MTC has continued to provide a full service during lockdown. However, trauma patterns have changed and departments should adapt to balance these alongside the COVID-19 pandemic. As the U.K. starts its cautious transition out of lockdown, trauma services are required to be flexible during changes in national social restrictions and changing trauma patterns. COVID-19 and lockdown state were found to have no significant impact on survival outcomes for trauma.","Rajput, Kunal; Sud, Ajay; Rees, Michael; Rutka, Olga",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,629,10

Notably, individuals with mental disorders have been reported to have a higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Personality traits could represent an important determinant of preventative health behavior and, therefore, the risk of contracting the virus. AimsWe examined overlapping genetic underpinnings between major psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsLinkage disequilibrium score regression was used to explore the genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders and personality traits based on data from the largest available respective genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In two cohorts (the PsyCourse (n=1346) and the HeiDE (n=3266) study), polygenic risk scores were used to analyze if a genetic association between, psychiatric disorders, personality traits, and COVID-19 susceptibility exists in individual-level data. ResultsWe observed no significant genetic correlations of COVID-19 susceptibility with psychiatric disorders. For personality traits, there was a significant genetic correlation for COVID-19 susceptibility with extraversion (p=1.47x10-5; rg=0.284). Yet, this was not reflected in individual-level data from the PsyCourse and HeiDE studies. ConclusionsWe identified no significant correlation between genetic risk factors for severe psychiatric disorders and genetic risk for COVID-19 susceptibility. Among the personality traits, extraversion showed evidence for a positive genetic association with COVID-19 susceptibility, in one but not in another setting. Overall, these findings highlight a complex contribution of genetic and non-genetic components in the interaction between COVID-19 susceptibility and personality traits or mental disorders.","Heilbronner, Urs; Streit, Fabian; Vogl, Thomas; Senner, Fanny; Sabrina, Schaupp; Reich-Erkelenz, Daniela; Papiol, Sergi; Kohshour, Mojtaba Oraki; Klohn-Saghatolislam, Farahnaz; Kalman, Janos L; Maria, Heilbronner; Gade, Katrin; Comes, Ashley L; Budde, Monika; Andlauer, Till FM; Anderson-Schmidt, Heike; Adorjan, Kristina; Sturmer, Til; Loerbroks, Adrian; Amelang, Manfred; Poisel, Eric; Foo, Jerome; Heilmann-Heimbach, Stefanie; Forstner, Andreas J; Degenhardt, Franziska; Zimmermann, Jorg; Wiltfang, Jens; Hagen, Martin von; Spitzer, Carsten; Schmauss, Max; Reininghaus, Eva; Reimer, Jens; Konrad, Carsten; Juckel, Georg; Lang, Fabian U; Jager, Markus; Figge, Christian; Fallgatter, Andreas J; Dietrich, Detlef E; Dannlowski, Udo; Baune, Bernhardt T; Arolt, Volker; Anghelescu, Ion-George; Nothen, Markus M; Witt, Stephanie H; Andreassen, Ole A; Chen, Chi-Hua; Falkai, Peter; Rietschel, Marcella; Schulze, Thomas G; Schulte, Eva C",,629,16

Out of necessity, virtual care became a preferred and default modality of extending primary care services to health care consumers. Although telemedicine is not a new concept and had been used in many organizations and health systems, the COVID-19 pandemic scaled up its use in a variety of health care settings. Telehealth's use in primary care was particularly important because of the need to maintain continuity of care for successful coordination of chronic disease management. This article examines the benefits of telehealth, including continuity of care, convenience of access to care, screening and triaging, and social distancing and disease prevention. The utilization of telehealth and financial implications are discussed, including reimbursement and cost-effectiveness. Barriers and challenges are addressed, including methods for successful implementation of nurse practitioner (NP) in primary care practices as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The leadership role of the NP in telehealth is discussed and implementation guidance is provided.","Dhaliwal, Jaspreet K; Hall, Tara D; LaRue, Julie L; Maynard, Susan E; Pierre, Peterson E; Bransby, Kristen A",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),629,32

In this cross-sectional study, we examined factors associated with different levels of psychological impact as a result of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. From April 1 to 30, 2020, we used a self-administered online questionnaire to collect data from 10,609 respondents. Using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents, we categorized the levels of impact as normal, mild, moderate, or severe. Ordinal logistic regression was used to examine the associated factors. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe psychological impact was 10.2%, 4.8%, and 45.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of reporting normal vs mild, moderate, or severe psychological impact were 5.9 times higher for people living in the Chittagong Division, 1.7 times higher for women with lower education levels, 3.0 times higher among those who were divorced or separated, 1.8 times higher for those working full time, and 2.4 times higher for those living in shared apartments. The odds of reporting a psychological impact were also higher among people who did not enforce protective measures inside the home, those in self-quarantine, those who did not wear face masks, and those who did not comply with World Health Organization precautionary measures. Increased psychological health risks due to COVID-19 were significantly higher among people who experienced chills, headache, cough, breathing difficulties, dizziness, and sore throat before data collection.

We designed and developed a novel toolkit to support teamworking in endoscopy during the pandemic. METHODS: A human factors model was developed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on endoscopy teams. From this, we identified a set of key teamworking goals, which informed the development of a toolkit to support several team processes. The toolkit was refined following expert input and refinement over a 6-week period. RESULTS: The toolkit consists of four cognitive aids that can be used to support team huddles, briefings, and debriefs, alongside techniques to optimize endoscopic nontechnical skills across the patient-procedure pathway. We describe the processes that local endoscopy units can employ to implement this toolkit. CONCLUSION: A toolkit of cognitive aids, based on human factors principles, may be useful in supporting teams, helping them adapt to working safely in the era of COVID-19.","Ravindran, Srivathsan; Matharoo, Manmeet; Coleman, Mark; Marshall, Sarah; Healey, Chris; Penman, Ian; Thomas-Gibson, Siwan",Endoscopy,629,1

This study was conducted to identify the noncompliance rate of self-quarantine for COVID-19 cases and assess the impact of a 1-strike out policy and an increased amount of penalty for the violating self-quarantine in South Korea. METHODS: The self-quarantine noncompliance rate for COVID-19 was examined using publicly available data. We collected the daily number of quarantine and quarantine violation cases from March 22 to June 10, 2020. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted to identify the impact of additional sanctions for the quarantine violation. RESULTS: The median number of individuals quarantined per day was 36,561 (interquartile range, 34,408-41,961). The median number of daily self-quarantine violations was 6 (range, 0-13). The median rate of self-quarantine violations was 1.6 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals (range, 0.0-8.0 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals). The additional sanction has no significant impact on the number of violations among quarantine individuals (P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The additional sanction for the violation of quarantined individuals did not reduce the self-quarantine violations. Further studies are warranted to strengthen the compliance of self-quarantine for future pandemics.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Hwang, Youngsik; Yoon, Hongbi; Chun, Byung Chul",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,629,1

In this work, based on the concept of virus spreadability in the host, antiviral effectiveness thresholds are determined to establish whether or not a treatment will be able to clear the infection. In addition, the virus dynamic in the host - including the time-to-peak and the final monotonically decreasing behavior - is characterized as a function of the time to treatment initiation. Simulation results, based on nine patient data, show the potential clinical benefits of a treatment classification according to patient critical parameters. This study is aimed at paving the way for the different antivirals being developed to tackle SARS-CoV-2.","Abuin, Pablo; Anderson, Alejandro; Ferramosca, Antonio; Hernandez-Vargas, Esteban A; Gonzalez, Alejandro H",Annual reviews in control,629,6

COVID-19, specialization of services, resource demands, and technology development are all examples of aspects leading to adaptations among stakeholders at different system levels whilst also attempting to maintain high service quality and safety. This commentary sets the scene for a journal collection on Resilient and responsive health systems in a changing world. The commentary aims to outline main challenges and opportunities in resilient healthcare theory and practice globally, as a backdrop for contributions to the collection. MAIN TEXT: Some of the main challenges in this field relate to a myriad of definitions and approaches to resilience in healthcare, and a lack of studies having multilevel perspectives. Also, the role of patients, families, and the public in resilient and responsive healthcare systems is under researched. By flipping the coin, this illustrates opportunities for research and practice and raise key issues that future resilience research should pay attention to. The potential of combining theoretical lenses from different resilience traditions, involvement of multiple stakeholders in co-creating research and practice improvement, and modelling and visualizing resilient performance are all opportunities to learn more about how healthcare succeeds under stress and normal operations. CONCLUSION: A wide understanding of resilience and responsiveness is needed to support planning and preparation for future disasters and for handling the routine small-scale adaptation. This collection welcomes systematic reviews, quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods research on the topic of resilience and responsiveness in all areas of the health system.","Wiig, Siri; O’Hara, Jane K.",BMC Health Serv Res,629,2
