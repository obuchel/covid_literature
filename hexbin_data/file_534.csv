When it comes to more complex models like multi‐strain dynamics to describe the virus‐host interaction in dengue fever, even most recently developed parameter estimation techniques, like maximum likelihood iterated filtering, come to their computational limits. However, the first results of parameter estimation with data on dengue fever from Thailand indicate a subtle interplay between stochasticity and deterministic skeleton. The deterministic system on its own already displays complex dynamics up to deterministic chaos and coexistence of multiple attractors.","Aguiar, Maíra; Ballesteros, Sebastién; Boto, João Pedro; Kooi, Bob W.; Mateus, Luís; Stollenwerk, Nico",AIP Conf Proc,534,1

CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old man was admitted to our university hospital with dyspnea. Progressive respiratory failure developed leading to admission to the intensive care unit, intubation and prone positioning was necessary. To ensure adequate oxygenation and lung protective ventilation veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was established. Despite maximal therapy and adequate antiinfective therapy of all discovered pathogens the condition of the patient declined further and he deceased. Postmortem autopsy revealed Mucor and Aspergillus mycelium in multiple organs such as lung, heart and pancreas as the underlying cause of his deterioration and death. CONCLUSION: Routine screening re-evaluation of every infection is essential for adequate initiation and discontinuation of every antiinfective therapy. In cases with unexplained deterioration and unsuccessful sampling the possibility for diagnostic biopsies should be considered.","Prohaska, Stefanie; Henn, Philipp; Wenz, Svetlana; Frauenfeld, Leonie; Rosenberger, Peter; Haeberle, Helene A.",BMC Anesthesiol,534,1

Compounds PC10 and PC11 remarkably inhibited MAO-B with IC(50) values of 0.65 and 0.71 μM, respectively. Ten of the eleven compounds weakly inhibited AChE and BChE with > 50% of residual activities at 10 μM, although PC4 inhibited AChE by 56.6% (IC(50) = 8.77 μM). Compound PC3 effectively inhibited BACE-1 (IC(50) = 6.72 μM), and PC10 and PC11 moderately inhibited BACE-1 (IC(50) =14.9 and 15.3 μM, respectively). Reversibility and kinetic studies showed that PC10 and PC11 were reversible and competitive inhibitors of MAO-B with K(i) values of 0.63 ± 0.13 and 0.53 ± 0.068 μM, respectively. ADME predictions for lead compounds revealed that PC10 and PC11 have central nervous system (CNS) drug-likeness. Molecular docking simulations showed that fluorine atom and trifluoromethyl group on PC10 and PC11, respectively, interacted with the substrate cavity of the MAO-B active site. Our results suggested that PC10 and PC11 can be considered potential candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.","Mathew, Bijo; Oh, Jong Min; Baty, Roua S.; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; Parambi, Della Grace Thomas; Gambacorta, Nicola; Nicolotti, Orazio; Kim, Hoon",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,534,5

Human-relevant preclinical models of ALD are urgently needed. Here, we leverage a triculture human Liver-Chip with biomimetic hepatic sinusoids and bile canaliculi to model ALD employing human-relevant blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and multimodal profiling of clinically relevant endpoints. Our Liver-Chip recapitulates established ALD markers in response to 48 h of exposure to ethanol, including lipid accumulation and oxidative stress, in a concentration-dependent manner and supports the study of secondary insults, such as high blood endotoxin levels. We show that remodeling of the bile canalicular network can provide an in vitro quantitative readout of alcoholic liver toxicity.

Synaptic damage and loss are earlier events than amyloid plaques and NFTs in AD progress and best correlate with cognitive deficits in AD patients. Soluble oligomeric Aβ initiates the progression of AD and tau mediates the subsequent synaptic impairments at an early stage of AD. In this review we discuss how Aβ or/and tau causes synaptic dysfunction. Aβ oligomers gather at synapses and give rise to synaptic death in a variety of ways such as regulating receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases, unbalancing calcium homeostasis, and activating caspases and calcineurin. A large amount of hyperphosphorylated tau exists in the synapse of the AD brain. Aβ-triggered synaptic deficits are dependent on tau. Soluble, hyperphosphorylated tau is much more correlated to cognitive decline in AD patients. Tau-targeted therapies have received more attention because the treatments targeting Aβ failed in AD. Here, we also review the therapy strategies used to intervene in the very early stages of AD. Soluble hyperphosphorylated tau forms a complex with cell surface receptors, scaffold proteins, or intracellular signaling molecules to damage synaptic function. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting synaptic tau at the early stage of AD may ameliorating pathology in AD. This review aims to provide an update on the role of oligomeric Aβ and soluble hyperphosphorylated tau in the early pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease and to develop a new treatment strategy based on this.","Yin, Xiaomin; Qiu, Yanyan; Zhao, Chenhao; Zhou, Zheng; Bao, Junze; Qian, Wei",Med Sci Monit,534,1

These viruses infect respiratory epithelial cells, where they may induce specific metabolite alterations. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate the novel use of liquid chromatography (LC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF) for the study of host cell metabolite alterations to diagnose and differentiate respiratory viruses. METHODS: We studied nasopharyngeal swab samples positive for respiratory viruses by the eSensor Respiratory Viral Panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA). Banked, frozen samples (−80°C) stored in viral transport media were retrieved and thawed. Aliquots of 100 μL were centrifuged at 13.3 × g for 15 minutes, and the filtrate was analyzed by Agilent 6545 Quadrupole LC/Q-TOF (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Compounds were separated using a novel column arrangement based on hydrophobicity and charge using a quaternary solvent manager, followed by accurate mass analysis by LC/Q-TOF. Agilent Mass Profiler 3D principal component analysis was performed, and compound identification was completed using the METLIN metabolite database. RESULTS: A total of 235 specimens were tested by LC/Q-TOF, including 195 positive specimens [including adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A H1N1 and H3N2, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus] as well as 40 negative clinical specimens. LC/Q-TOF primary component analysis (PCA) allowed preliminary identification of key metabolites that distinguished all virus-positive specimens compared with the negative group, and differentiated respiratory viruses from one another including between influenza A 2009 H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data from our LC/Q-TOF analysis show that respiratory viruses exhibit different host cell metabolomic profiles that allow viral differentiation to the species level, and for influenza A virus, the subtype level. This metabolomic approach has substantial potential for diagnostic applications in infectious diseases directly from patient samples, and may be eventually adapted for point-of-care testing.

Het tijdperk van delayed degenerativediseases, d.w.z. geen uitschakeling ziekten maar uitstel naar hogere leeftijden (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Daling sterfte hart- en vaatziekten door afname roken, daling serumcholesterol, betere opsporing hypertensie, betere medische zorg. Daling verkeersongevallen door verkeersveiligheid (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Ischemische hartziekte werd van managersziekte een 'volksziekte' (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Terugkeer infectieziekten na 1970 door resistentie micro-organismen tegen antibiotica en nieuwe infectieziekten zoals hiv/aids, SARS (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). Levensverwachting Nederlanders neemt toe, maar minder snel dan andere Europese landen (zie paragraaf 3.2.1). In de twintigste eeuw vijf tot acht jaar winst in levensverwachting door verbeteringen gezondheidszorg (o.a. antibiotica, vaccinaties, combinatiechemotherapie, verbeteringen chirurgie) (zie paragraaf 3.2.2). infecties bovenste luchtwegen; nek- en rugklachten; acute urineweginfecties; privéongevallen; contacteczeem. nek- en rugklachten; contacteczeem; artrose; diabetes mellitus; coronaire hartziekten. Kwaliteit van leven: 11% van Nederlanders van 12 jaar en ouder heeft een of meer ernstige functionele beperkingen (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Top-5 aandoeningen met grootste verlies kwaliteit van leven is ander rijtje dan top-5 aandoeningen met hoogste prevalentie. Angststoornissen en depressie staan hoog in rangorde want beperkt sociaal functioneren (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Sterfte belangrijkste indicator volksgezondheid. Sterftegegevens betrouwbaar en registratie over het algemeen volledig (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Door toename levensverwachting is het relatieve belang van sterfte als indicator volksgezondheid verminderd (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Belangrijkste doodsoorzaken Nederland. Mannen: kanker. Vrouwen: hart- en vaatziekten (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). Levensverwachting wordt berekend met behulp van overlevingstafel en geboortecohort (zie paragraaf 3.3.1). gezonde levensverwachting; health-adjusted life expectancy; disability-adjusted life years (DALY's). : Anticonceptie en vruchtbaarheidsproblemen. Geboorteregeling in Nederland nagenoeg perfect. Keerzijde: uitstellen zwangerschappen. Perinatale sterfte en zuigelingensterfte. Sinds jaren tachtig verloopt daling in Nederland minder snel dan bijvoorbeeld Zweden en Finland, door o.a. meerlingzwangerschappen (door ivf), roken, allochtone herkomst zwangeren, verschillen in zorg. Barkerhypothese: groeivertraging foetus heeft langetermijngevolgen voor gezondheid. Foetale programmering: aanpassingen van metabole en endocriene systeem van foetus onder invloed van tekort aan voedingsstoffen zijn schadelijk op latere leven. Ongevallen, suïcide(poging) en geweld: ongevallen in de privésfeer zorgen voor meeste aantal gewonden en overledenen. Moord en doodslag in Nederland vrij zeldzaam. Alcoholgebruik speelt bij verschillende categorieën een rol (zie paragraaf 3.3.3). : Depressie. Prevalentie 5%. Kwetsbaarheid en uitlokkende factoren spelen rol. Schizofrenie. Prevalentie 7 gevallen per 1.000 personen. Openbaart zich vaak op jonge leeftijd, tussen 16 en 24 jaar. Combinatie kwetsbaarheid en omgevingsfactoren. Komt meer voor bij Marokkanen en Surinamers, waarschijnlijk door migratie-ervaringen en/of discriminatie. . Thuisloosheid: vaak oorzaak ernstige psychische problemen. : Ischemische hartziekte. Hoge incidentie komt o.a. door toegenomen welvaart en roken, hoge bloeddruk en hoog serumcholesterol. Beroerte. Een derde toe te schrijven aan verhoogde bloeddruk. Ook verhoogd serumcholesterol, roken, overmatig alcoholgebruik en lichamelijke activiteit. Westerse ziekte en gevolg van modern voedingspatroon (met veel zout). Kanker. Strijd tegen kanker geen succesverhaal. Vroegere opsporing, dus overlevingsverbetering is deels artificieel. Longkanker heeft hoogste sterfte. Huidkanker komt het meest voor. Borstkanker komt na longkanker het meest voor bij vrouwen. Bevolkingsonderzoek leidt tot verbetering opsporing en daling sterfte. : Vergrijzing. Beperkingen: chronische ziekten, mobiliteit, slechthorendheid, dementie. Ontwikkelingen van (gezonde) levensverwachtingen: meningen zijn verdeeld. Evolutiebiologen denken dat bovengrens misschien bereikt is.

Relatief risico (RR): de verhouding van de incidentie van een ziekte bij personen met en zonder blootstelling aan een bepaalde determinant (zie paragraaf 3.4.1). Populatieattributieve fractie (PAF): de proportie van de totale incidentie van een ziekte binnen de bevolking die toe te schrijven is aan de blootstelling aan een bepaalde determinant (zie paragraaf 3.4.1). Voor de berekening van PAF hoeft de incidentie van de ziekte niet bekend te zijn. Kan met behulp van RR. Voor formules voor berekening RR en PAF, zie paragraaf 3.4.1. : Infectieziekten. Omgekeerde samenhang tussen ernst infectie en besmettelijkheid. Verspreidingswegen. Meldingsplicht bij ziekten als bacillaire dysenterie, kinkhoest, legionellose, malaria en tuberculose. Maag-darminfecties. Voedselvergiftiging komt op grote schaal voor. Hepatitis. A: verspreiding langs fecaal-orale weg. B: via bloed en andere lichaamsvloeistoffen, C: via bloed en veel gezien onder hemofiliepatiënten. Vectorgebonden infectieziekten: Malaria (importziekte). Ziekte van Lyme (via tekenbeten, wel in Nederland). Klimaatverandering verhoogt risico's op vectorgebonden infectieziekten. Zoönosen: infectieziekten van dier op mens. Creutzfeldt-Jakob, hondsdolheid, ornithose/psittacose, Q-koorts, SARS, vogelgriep. Risico is vermoedelijk toegenomen door verstoring ecosystemen en klimaatverandering. Soa's: ook in Nederland neemt frequentie toe, vermoedelijk door toename onveilig vrijen. Komt ook door besef dat behandeling hiv/aids is verbeterd. : Omgevingstemperatuur: verhoging sterfte met hittegolven en koude wintermaanden. Vooral bij kwetsbare groepen. Lawaai. Op werk of thuis. Stress en slaapverstoring kan tot hoge bloeddruk leiden. Veel jongvolwassenen gehoorschade door popconcerten. Ultraviolette straling. Veroorzaakt huidkanker. Neemt erg toe laatste jaren door verandering gedrag bevolking en dunner worden ozonlaag. Chemische stoffen. Asbest, metalen, oplosmiddelen. Geen grote bron gezondheidsschade in Nederland. Luchtverontreiniging. 'Fijn stof' zorgt vermoedelijk voor flink aantal extra sterfgevallen, maar nog niet duidelijk waarop dat effect berust. EU-norm wordt in grote delen van Nederland overschreden. Klimaatverandering. Gevolgen grotendeels onbekend. . : Psychosociale stress. Life events en arbeidssituatie kan invloed hebben. Sociale steun heeft gunstig effect op psychosociale stress. Roken. Verhoogd risico hart- en vaatziekten, kanker en COPD. Tabakswet van 2002 is mijlpaal in antirookbeleid. Rokers in Nederland onder 30%. Middenmoter in Europa. Alcohol en drugs. Veel lichamelijke en psychische problemen en oorzaak huiselijk geweld en zinloos geweld. Comazuipen onder jongeren in Nederland probleem. Ecstasygebruik ook hoog. Voeding. Nederlanders eten te vet en te weinig fruit en groenten, wat risico hart- en vaatziekten vergroot. Lichaamsbeweging. Helpt beschermen tegen hart- en vaatziekten, diabetes, depressie, borst- en dikkedarmkanker. Helft van de Nederlanders beweegt te weinig. . Energiebalans en overgewicht. Obesitas in Nederland 11% onder volwassenen en neemt toe. : Genen versus omgeving en gedrag. Genen belangrijk bij gezondheid individuen, niet zozeer bij volksgezondheid. Genen en ziekte. Rol genetische factoren bij ontstaan ziekte varieert sterk. . Belang van preventie. Belangrijk om meer inzicht te krijgen in genetische determinanten van multifactoriële aandoeningen. Gezondheidsverschillen naar geslacht (zie paragraaf 3.5.1): vrouwen worden ouder maar groter aantal jaren met minder goede gezondheid. Gezondheidsverschillen naar burgerlijke staat (zie paragraaf 3.5.1): gehuwden leven langer. : Arbeidsmarktpositie. Werkenden gezonder dan werklozen en arbeidsongeschikten. Sociaaleconomisch. Mensen met een lagere sociaaleconomische positie zijn vaker ziek. : Regionale verschillen. Verstedelijkte gebieden en aantal regio's in noordoosten hogere sterfte- en ziektecijfers. Brabant en Limburg hebben achterstand. Urbanisatiegraad. In grote steden sterfte hoger. Komt door veranderde bevolkingssamenstelling (gezonde bewoners vertrekken naar elders), niet door slechte levensomstandigheden.","Mackenbach, J.P.",Volksgezondheid en gezondheidszorg,534,13

Data on the frequency, transfusion practice and outcome of severe trauma haemorrhage in paediatric patients are inconsistent. METHODS: Datasets from paediatric trauma patients were retrieved from the registry of the German trauma society (TR-DGU(®)) between 2009 and 2016. Coagulopathy was defined by a Quick’s value < 70% (INR (international normalized ratio) > 1.4) and/or thrombocytes ≤ 100 k upon emergency room admission. Children were grouped according to age in 4 different groups (A: 1–5, B: 6–10, C: 11–15 and D: 16–17 years). Prevalence of coagulopathy was assessed. Demographics, injury severity, haemostatic management including transfusions and mortality were described. RESULTS: 5351 primary admitted children ≤ 17 years with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) ≥ 3 and complete datasets were included. The prevalence of coagulopathy was 13.7% (733/5351). The majority of the children sustained blunt trauma (more than 90% independent of age group) and a combination of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and any other trauma in more than 60% (A, C, D) and in 53.8% in group B. Coagulopathy occurred the most among the youngest (A: 18.2%), followed by all other age groups with approximately 13%. Overall mortality was the highest in the youngest (A: 40.9%) and among the youngest patients with traumatic brain injury (A: 71.4% and B: 47.1%). Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) occurred almost in a 2:1 ratio (or less) across all age subgroups. CONCLUSION: Traumatic haemorrhage in association with coagulopathy and severe shock is a major challenge in paediatric trauma across all age groups.

The existing literature involving symmetric tensor response and vector predictors proceeds by vectorizing the tensor response to a multivariate vector, thus ignoring the structural information in the tensor. A few recent approaches have proposed novel regression frameworks exploiting the structure of the symmetric tensor and assume symmetric tensor coefficients corresponding to scalar predictors to be low-rank. Although low-rank constraint on coefficient tensors are computationally efficient, they might appear to be restrictive in some real data applications. Motivated by this, we propose a novel class of regularization or shrinkage priors for the symmetric tensor coefficients. Our modeling framework a-priori expresses a symmetric tensor coefficient as sum of low rank and sparse structures, with both these structures being suitably regularized using Bayesian regularization techniques. The proposed framework allows identification of tensor nodes significantly influenced by each scalar predictor. Our framework is implemented using an efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Empirical results in simulation studies show competitive performance of the proposed approach over its competitors.","Guhaniyogi, Rajarshi",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,534,1

GAD antibodies (GAD-Abs) are linked to various neurological disorders. However, the significance of GAD-Abs in neurocritical patients is undetermined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with serologically positive GAD-Abs and requiring neurocritical care were included. The clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: We included 9 patients with serologically positive GAD-Abs. Clinical manifestations involved both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Six (66.7%) patients had other specific autoimmune antibodies. Non-specific autoimmune responses were observed in 8 (88.9%) patients. All patients clinically responded well to immunotherapy. The titers of GAD-Abs decreased in 7 (77.8%) patients but remained unchanged in the other 2 patients. One (11.1%) patient awoke before the negative conversion of GAD-Abs, and 3 (33.3%) patients remained unconscious and/or under mechanical ventilation for several weeks after the vanishing of GAD-Abs. CONCLUSIONS: Most neurocritical patients with serologically positive GAD-Abs had other specific autoimmune antibodies. All patients responded well to immunotherapy, but not parallel to the titers of GAD-Abs. These results indicated that GAD-Abs might be more a bystander than a culprit in neurocritical patients, suggesting that an underlying autoimmune disease should be explored.","Wang, Dongmei; Huang, Kaibin; Lin, Zhenzhou; Zhang, Yongfang; Liu, Guanghui; Wu, Yongming; Wang, Shengnan",Neurol Sci,534,13

Although assumed that ZIKV infection may engender lifelong immunity, the long-term kinetics of ZIKV antibody responses are unclear. We assessed long-term kinetics of ZIKV NS1-IgG response in 144 individuals from 3 different subpopulations: HIV patients, tuberculosis patients and healthy individuals first tested in 2016 and retested 1.5–2 years after the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, using a widely distributed NS1-based commercial ELISA. The seropositivity in 2016 reached 59.0% (85/144, 95% confidence interval (CI) 50.7–66.7%), and decreased to 38.6% (56/144, CI 31.3–47.0%) 1.5–2 years later. In addition, the median ZIKV NS1-ELISA reactivity for individuals that remained positive in both timepoints significantly decreased from a ratio of 4.4 (95% CI 3.8–5.0) to 1.6 (95% CI 1.6–1.9) over the 2-year interval (Z: − 6.1; p < 0.001) irrespective of the subpopulation analyzed. Initial 2016 DENV antibody response was non-significant between groups, suggesting comparable DENV background. The high 20.6% seroreversion suggest that widely used serologic tests may fail to account a considerable proportion of past ZIKV infections in flavivirus endemic countries. In addition, ZIKV immunity might be shorter-lived than previously thought, which may contribute to local ZIKV resurgence once individual immune responses wane sufficiently to reduce community protective immunity in addition to birth and migration.","Moreira-Soto, Andres; de Souza Sampaio, Gilmara; Pedroso, Célia; Postigo-Hidalgo, Ignacio; Berneck, Beatrice Sarah; Ulbert, Sebastian; Brites, Carlos; Netto, Eduardo Martins; Drexler, Jan Felix",Virus Genes,534,1

Immune responses to Plasmodium falciparum malaria vary among individuals and between populations. Human genetic variation in immune system genes is likely to play a role in this heterogeneity. Natural killer (NK) cells produce inflammatory cytokines in response to malaria infection, kill intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum parasites by cytolysis, and participate in the initiation and development of adaptive immune responses to plasmodial infection. These functions are modulated by interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Therefore, variations in KIR and HLA genes can have a direct impact on NK cell functions. Understanding the role of KIRs and HLAs in immunity to malaria can help to better characterize antimalarial immune responses. In this review, we summarize the different KIRs and HLAs associated with immunity to malaria thus far.","Tukwasibwe, Stephen; Nakimuli, Annettee; Traherne, James; Chazara, Olympe; Jayaraman, Jyothi; Trowsdale, John; Moffett, Ashley; Jagannathan, Prasanna; Rosenthal, Philip J.; Cose, Stephen; Colucci, Francesco",Cell Mol Immunol,534,22

Leishmania infantum is the species most frequently reported in cats and causes feline leishmaniosis (FeL). Cats exposed to L. infantum are able to mount a cell-mediated immune response that does not parallel antibody production. Cats with L. infantum-associated clinical disease have positive blood PCR and low to very high antibody levels. About half of the clinical cases of FeL are diagnosed in cats with impaired immunocompetence. Skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common clinical findings; however, FeL is a systemic disease. Skin or mucocutaneous lesions and lymph node enlargement are seen in at least half of cases, ocular or oral lesions and some aspecific signs (weight loss, anorexia, lethargy) in about 20–30% of cases, and many other clinical signs (e.g., respiratory, gastrointestinal) are sporadically observed. Ulcerative and nodular lesions due to diffuse granulomatous dermatitis are the most frequent skin manifestations, mainly distributed on the head or symmetrically on the distal limbs. Diagnosis can be obtained by cytology and histology, and immunohistochemistry is useful to confirm the causative role of Leishmania infection in the dermopathological manifestations; however, other skin diseases may coexist with FeL. Polymerase chain reaction is used in case of suggestive lesions with lack of parasites and for Leishmania speciation. Comorbidities, coinfections, and chronic renal disease influence the prognosis and should be investigated. Treatment is currently based on the same drugs used for canine leishmaniosis, and generally clinical cure is obtained; however recurrence is possible.","Pennisi, Maria Grazia",Feline Dermatology,534,1

In general a Bayesian statistical approach along with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm can be used for quantifying the uncertainties associated with subsurface parameters. However, the complex nature of flow simulators presents considerable challenges to accessing inherent uncertainty in all flow simulator parameters of interest. In this work we focus on the transport of contaminants in a heterogeneous permeability field of a aquifer. In our problem the limited data comes in the form of contaminant fractional flow curves at monitoring wells of the aquifer. We then employ a Karhunen-Loève expansion to truncate the stochastic dimension of the permeability field and thus the expansion helps reducing the computational burden. Aiming to reduce the computational burden further, we code our numerical simulator using parallel programming procedures on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In this paper we mainly present a comparative study of two well-known MCMC methods, namely, two-stage and DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM), for the characterization of the two-dimensional aquifer. A thorough statistical analysis of ensembles of the contaminant fractional flow curves from both MCMC methods is presented. The analysis indicates that although the average fractional flow curves are quite similar, both time-dependent ensemble variances and posterior analysis are considerably distinct for both methods.","Ali, Alsadig; Al-Mamun, Abdullah; Pereira, Felipe; Rahunanthan, Arunasalam",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,534,1

Coexistence of MSAs do not commonly occur. If they do, it is unknown if there is an overlap of clinical features or prognostic implications. There are a few reported cases of overlap between these antibodies, mostly reported in patients with Japanese descent. Our aim for this case report is to turn more attention and interest for future MSA profile studies in the Hispanic population, which may hopefully spur better therapies if we realize the prognostic implications of certain myositis subsets including double-positive autoantibody syndromes. CASE PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old Hispanic female was admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She had failed conventional mechanical ventilation and was cannulated for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) to manage her respiratory failure. She had erythematous scaly plaques on bilateral 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints on examination. Her autoimmune workup revealed positivity for both anti-PL-7(threonyl) and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) autoantibodies. After extensive evaluation, it was concluded that she had rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RPILD) due to amyopathic dermatomyositis. Despite maximal medical management, she was ultimately transitioned to comfort care measures and expired. CONCLUSION: We would like to highlight the rarity of double antibody positive amyopathic dermatomyositis. This unique clinical presentation has only been reported in persons of Japanese descent. Our case is likely to be the first reported to occur in a person of Hispanic descent in the United States. The rarity of our case could stimulate further study of overlapping MSA to understand its varied presentations and prognoses including possible tendency toward a rapidly progressive ILD phenotype. Earlier detection of these clinical syndromes can lead to better outcomes for patients with RPILD. This case report could also herald an increased recognition and understanding of MSA profile in the Hispanic population in the USA.","Li, Zi Ying; Gill, Evanpaul; Mo, Fan; Reyes, Candice",BMC Pulm Med,534,1

Nonetheless, it had not been reported whether H/R affected proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of stem/progenitor cell markers in the bronchial epithelial cells. In this study, we investigated differential effects of consecutive hypoxia and intermittent 24/24-h cycles of H/R on human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from the same-race and age-matched healthy subjects (i.e., NHBE) and subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (i.e., DHBE). To analyze gene/protein expression during differentiation, both the NHBE and DHBE cells at the 2nd passage were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) in the differentiation medium under normoxia for 3 days, followed by either culturing under hypoxia (1% O(2)) for consecutively 9 days and then returning to normoxia for another 9 days, or culturing under 24/24-h cycles of H/R (i.e., 24 h of 1% O(2) followed by 24 h of 21% O(2), repetitively) for 18 days in total, so that all differentiating HBE cells were exposed to hypoxia for a total of 9 days. In both the normal and diseased HBE cells, intermittent H/R significantly increased HIF1A, BMP4, NOTCH1, MKI67, OCT4, and MUC5AC expression, while consecutive hypoxia significantly decreased NKX2-1, NOTCH3, HEY1, CC10, and FOXJ1 expression. Inhibition of HIF1A or NKX2-1 expression by siRNA transfection respectively decreased BMP4/NOTCH1/MKI67/OCT4/MUC5AC and NOTCH3/HEY1/CC10/FOXJ1 expression in the HBE cells cultured under intermittent H/R to the same levels under normoxia. Overexpression of NKX2-1 via cDNA transfection caused more than 2.8-fold increases in NOTCH3, HEY1, and FOXJ1 mRNA levels in the HBE cells cultured under consecutive hypoxia compared to the levels under normoxia. Taken together, our results show for the first time that consecutive hypoxia decreased expression of the co-regulated gene module NOTCH3/HEY1/CC10 and the ciliogenesis-inducing transcription factor gene FOXJ1 via NKX2-1 mRNA downregulation, while intermittent H/R increased expression of the co-regulated gene module BMP4/NOTCH1/MKI67/OCT4 and the predominant airway mucin gene MUC5AC via HIF1A mRNA upregulation.","Yang, Yung-Yu; Lin, Chao-Ju; Wang, Cheng-Chin; Chen, Chieh-Min; Kao, Wen-Jen; Chen, Yi-Hui",Front Cell Dev Biol,534,1

Human fecal markers crAssphage CPQ_064 and Bacteroides HF183, the human pathogen norovirus GII, and culturable fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) were quantified at six locations spanning reaches of the Mapocho River from upstream to downstream of Santiago, as well as in repeated sub-daily frequency samples at two urban locations. Norovirus showed positive correlation trends with crAssphage (τ = 0.57, p = 0.06) and HF183 (τ = 0.64, p = 0.03) in river water, but not with E. coli or enterococci. CrAssphage and HF183 concentrations were strongly linearly related (slope = 0.97, p < 0.001). Chlorinated wastewater effluent was an important source of norovirus GII genes to the Mapocho.

Concentrations of crAssphage and HF183 in untreated sewage were 8.35 and 8.07 log(10) copy/100 ml, respectively. Preliminary specificity testing did not detect crAssphage or HF183 in bird or dog feces, which are predominant non-human fecal sources in the urban Mapocho watershed.

Starting January, PHNs at A city (population approx. 210,000) established a free telephone consultation hotline for COVID-19. This study aims to review the PHNs’ telephone consultations during the first wave of COVID-19. The number of calls were aggregated weekly and their time-trend was examined. The study was approved by the University of Tokyo Ethics Review Board. During the first wave between January and May, there were 3,242 calls, with the highest number of calls (n=491/week) in the second week of April. At this point the regular PHNs were not enough to meet the hightened needs of consultations and PHNs from other departments were temporalily transferred for support. The number of consultation calls fluctuated weekly. The increase of calls seemed to preceed the increase of positive cases by one week. We consider that the call may be an initial action of those who suspected possible infection, and the consultation by the PHN might have led them to proper clinic visits and PCR testing. Telephone consultation is an easy tool to use for general public, especially older persons. Having health professionals respond directly to calls may have had the advantage of providing appropriate guidance for infection control and PCR testing and mental support.","Sumikawa, Yuka; Honda, Chikako; Yoshioka-Maeda, Kyoko; Iwasaki-Motegi, Riho; Yamamoto-Mitani, Noriko",Innov Aging,534,16

Design/Methodology/Approach: The authors determine regression dependence of the sustainable development manifestations on the possibilities of sustainable development financing: state budget surplus as the difference between revenues and expenditures, government debt, and volume of private investments. Forecasts of change of the indicators’ values, which characterize the opportunities for sustainable development financing, are developed. The established regression dependence helps to determine the consequences for sustainable development. Findings: A forecast of financing and sustainable development amid the crisis of 2020 is compiled. The budget deficit will be more vivid (surplus budget will decrease by 220.61%, and government debt will grow by 85.42%); the investment will shrink by 41.96%. State financing has more significant influence (regression coefficient equals 379.34 for state budget surplus and 67.41 for government debt on average); private investments (regression coefficient is −266.64 on average). Originality/Value: A far-reaching influence of deficit of financing for sustainable development is moderately negative on the whole – the expected decrease of all indicators of sustainable development under the control of the 2020 crisis compared to 2019, will constitute −0.55%. The perspectives of solving the problem of sustainable development financing in the conditions of the budget deficit and investment collapse under the influence of the 2020 crisis are connected to balancing the revenues and expenditures of government debt, limitation of borrowings, reduction of the volume of government debt, and attraction of investments in economy and restriction of their outflow.","Popkova, Elena G.; Oudah, Al-Muttar Mohammed Yousif; Ermolina, Liliya V.; Sergi, Bruno S.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,534,13

Throughout this period integration process among the Gulf group states, and consequently their level of socio economic development went through significant changes, having significant research interest and practical implications. The novelty of this research is related to identification of new trends in regional economic integration among the GCC member states, specifically their focus on joint development of innovation component. Research concluded that over the period of 2010 through 2018 integration efforts of the Gulf group states were focused primarily on scientific, humanitarian and innovation activities, rather than pure trade, investments, and project efforts. This article is based on statistical and comparative analysis and systematic approach. Statistical analysis is based on the data provided by UNCTAD to ensure data compatibility.","Savinsky, A.

Design/Methodology/Approach: To highlight the regions that provide 80% of the national food security of Russia, it is worth considering in more detail the indicators of import-substituting food potential for the regions of the Russian Federation. The average indicators of import-substituting food potential in the federal districts of the Russian Federation for 2015–2018 are considered. Using the ranked method, the data is presented more clearly. After ranking using the methodology Olgarenko and Ugryumova (Ugryumova and Olgarenko, .Nat. Interests Priorities Secur. 16:6–8, 2015) the contribution of each region to the import-substituting food potential of the country was assessed. The federal districts were grouped according to the degree of their contribution to import substitution of the Russian Federation using the ABC analysis method. Findings: The Central Federal District, the North Caucasus Federal District, the Southern Federal District have a great influence on the development of food security in Russia as a whole. When considering measures to improve food security in Russia, one should focus on the leading regions. This is due to the greater return on the implementation of measures. Originality/Value: Improving the sustainability of food security from internal and external threats can be achieved through the institutionalization of the system of its provision, which includes organizational, information and legal, scientific and technological, personnel, financial, land and other resource components at different levels of the economy. This approach is especially important when food security is correlated with indicators of demographic security.","Reutov, Viktor E.; Burkaltseva, Diana D.; Zmiyak, Sergey S.; Kuzmina, Kristina V.; Osipova, Arina V.",Modern Global Economic System: Evolutional Development vs,534,7

Multiple care gaps exist for hospitalized patients with cirrhosis, resulting in high rates of re-hospitalization (e.g. 44% at 90 days in Alberta). The Cirrhosis Care Alberta (CCAB) is a 4-year multi-component pragmatic trial with an aim to reduce acute-care utilization by implementing an electronic order set and supporting education across eight hospital sites in Alberta. AIMS: As part of the pre-implementation evaluation, this qualitative study analyzed data from provider focus groups to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation. METHODS: We conducted focus groups at eight hospital sites with a total of 54 healthcare providers (3–12 per site). A semi-structured interview guide based upon constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Normalization Process Theory (NPT) frameworks was used to guide the focus groups. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed thematically and inductively. RESULTS: Five major themes emerged across all eight sites: (i) understanding past implementation experiences, (ii) resource challenges, (iii) competing priorities among healthcare providers, (iv) system challenges, and (v) urban versus rural differences. Site-specific barriers included perceived lack of patient flow, time restraints, and concerns about the quality and quantity of past implementation interventions. Facilitators included passionate project champions, and an ample feedback process. CONCLUSIONS: Focus groups were useful for identifying pre-implementation barriers and facilitators of an electronic orders set. Findings from this study are being refined to address the influence of COVID-19, and the data will be used to inform the intervention roll-out at each of the sites.

With the rise of the 2019 SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), many institutions have mandated strictly enforced endoscopic PPE guidelines. We currently do not know how current practitioners perceive these mandates or how they will influence their practice long-term. AIMS: We aimed to survey the PPE practices among endoscopists across Canada and compare their perceived differences in practice between the pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic eras. We hypothesize that the PPE guidelines during the pandemic will influence changes in PPE practices in endoscopy. METHODS: A 74-item questionnaire was emailed from June 2020 to September 2020 to all members of the Canadian Association of Gastroenterologists and the Canadian Association of General Surgeons through newsletters. The survey was created by expert consensus and distributed using the REDCap software. Survey questions collected basic demographics and differences between PPE practices pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic eras. PPE practices were categorized into four endoscopic procedure types: diagnostic or therapeutic, and upper or lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. Individual outcomes were reported as rates, or ranges when evaluating for all procedure types. RESULTS: A total of 77 respondents completed the survey with the majority of respondents aged 40–49 (34 [44.2%]) and identifying as Gastroenterologists (54 [70.1%]). Gender was evenly split (38 females [49.4%] versus 39 males [50.6%]). In the pre-pandemic era, the majority of endoscopists wore gowns (91.0–93.9%) and all endoscopists wore gloves (100%). However, the majority of endoscopists did not wear surgical masks (20.9%-31.3%), N95 respirators (1.5%-3.2%), face shields (13.4%-33.9%), eye protection (13.4%-21.3%), or hair protection (11.1%-12.5%). In the post-pandemic era, endoscopists reported a plan to dramatically change their pre-pandemic practices and adopt current PPE mandates. All endoscopists reported a plan to fully gown and glove (100%) with the majority reporting they will continue wearing surgical masks (87.7%-90.5%), face shields (57.8%-75.0%), and hair protection (50.8%-53.8%). However, the majority reported a plan to decrease universal use of N95 respirators (6.5%-23.7%) or eye protection (36.5%-40.0%). Over half of the respondents reported changing their practice from no masking pre-pandemic to implementing routine masking. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the attitudes of many endoscopists regarding future PPE use in routine endoscopy. Ongoing studies comparing the rates of transmission of hospital-acquired infections in the setting of endoscopy are needed to develop a new post-pandemic PPE consensus.

The relevance of gay neighborhoods—originally formed to promote segregation of individuals who identify as sexual minorities—is lately challenged by advances in technology, experiences with pandemics, shifts in generational opinion and social values, increasing acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals, and (in certain places) increased rights and protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. This confluence of change has created for many people anxiety related to the belief that gay neighborhoods may be dissolving or even disappearing altogether. Seeking to address these concerns, this opening chapter of the book The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods: Renaissance and Resurgence presents eight important takeaway messages distilled from the chapters in this volume that, taken together, provide an in-depth overview of the formation, maturation, current challenges, and future prospects of LGBTQ+ spaces in urban environments. Findings suggest that shifts in patterns of residence, socialization, and entertainment for LGBTQ+ residents and visitors across metropolitan space have resulted in certain gay neighborhoods becoming less gay while other neighborhoods become more gay. In this time of social change, economic inequities, public health crises, and technological evolution, gay neighborhoods provide a culturally and historically significant template for communities in confronting adversity, fear, and discrimination. At this point in their maturity, gay neighborhoods have reached a plateau in their evolution; from here we pause to consider the current state of gay neighborhoods—and trajectories that might describe their future form—as we contemplate the importance of gay neighborhoods in the ongoing advancement of LGBTQ+ people everywhere. We conclude by observing that while gayborhoods have experienced a certain level of de-gaying, the trend toward viewing gayborhoods as inclusive and gay-friendly places de-emphasizes the self-segregation aspects of gayborhoods that were important to their initial formation; consequently, while gay neighborhoods may become less gay, other neighborhoods may also become more gay.","Hess, Daniel Baldwin; Bitterman, Alex",The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods,534,1

Following the 2008 global financial meltdown, many countries announced fiscal interventions to stimulate their economies. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, global tourism has never been in need of a bailout. However, due to the pandemic, hotel occupation and restaurant visits plummeted, and some airlines and related businesses were liquidated. By means of secondary data and public pronouncements, as well as document and critical discourse analysis, the chapter profiles stimulus packages to save the tourism industry. From small island developing states (SIDS) in the Pacific and the Caribbean to major global economies and in countless African countries, COVID-19 devastated the tourism sector. The findings are that stimulus packages included measures such as the postponement and restructuring of tourism business loan payments; the postponement of tourism surcharges, levies and taxes; delayed tax declarations and deductions for the sector; the introduction of special tourism sector loans and credit lines; exemption from utility payments and delayed tax collection; cuts and subsidies in interest rates and guarantees on loans for small, medium and microenterprises; the marketing of domestic tourism and discounts on air tickets and jet fuel. The most popular stimulus packages were income tax and corporate tax deferrals. The chapter recommends that wealthier countries, development banks and donors urgently consider topping up fiscal packages for SIDS and least developed countries because the demands occasioned by COVID-19 are bigger than domestic resources (if there are any). It also argues for the escalation of national stimulus packages already in place and quick peer learning and assistance across the world. Since some major companies are able to remain afloat, corporations who are to be bailed out with taxpayers’ money have to be selected carefully.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,534,1

It can be shockingly effective at finding bugs, but it often requires generating a very large number of inputs to do so. In this paper, we apply ideas from combinatorial testing, a powerful and widely studied testing methodology, to modify the distributions of our random generators so as to find bugs with fewer tests. The key concept is combinatorial coverage, which measures the degree to which a given set of tests exercises every possible choice of values for every small combination of input features. In its “classical” form, combinatorial coverage only applies to programs whose inputs have a very particular shape—essentially, a Cartesian product of finite sets. We generalize combinatorial coverage to the richer world of algebraic data types by formalizing a class of sparse test descriptions based on regular tree expressions. This new definition of coverage inspires a novel combinatorial thinning algorithm for improving the coverage of random test generators, requiring many fewer tests to catch bugs. We evaluate this algorithm on two case studies, a typed evaluator for System F terms and a Haskell compiler, showing significant improvements in both.","Goldstein, Harrison; Hughes, John; Lampropoulos, Leonidas; Pierce, Benjamin C.",Programming Languages and Systems,534,1

Rather than comprehensively detailing these repeated violations, this article focuses on the EU dimension of Poland’s rule of law breakdown. Using the activation of the Rule of Law Framework by the European Commission on 13 January 2016 as a starting point, this article offers a critical five-year assessment of EU’s (in)action starting with an overview of the extent to which virtually all of the multiple problematical issues identified early on by the Commission have yet to be addressed by Polish authorities by January 2021. Regarding the Commission and the Council’s (in)action, this article argues that the Commission has systematically acted in a too little too late fashion while the Council has systematically failed to meaningfully act, with the inaction of these two EU institutions amounting, at times, to dereliction of duties. By contrast, the Court of Justice has forcefully defended judicial independence whenever an infringement case was lodged with it by the Commission. The Court of Justice’s record in preliminary ruling cases is more mixed due, in part, to the Court’s apprehension to undermine the principle of mutual trust.

These include endothelial pathologies like engraftment syndrome (ES), transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), veno-occlusive disease of liver (VOD), capillary leak syndrome, and others which include noninfectious pulmonary complications, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), infections (bacterial/fungal/viral), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), mucositis, and graft failure. It is important to recognize these complications at the earliest, for implementing suitable interventions, salvaging the graft and to prevent any disease relapse.","Mirgh, Sumeet; Khattry, Navin",Contemporary Bone Marrow Transplantation,534,1

Competing explanations for this possible ‘crisis’ are compared and placed in the context of changes to the funding and regulation of universities. At the beginning of the 2020s British higher education, and in particular its universities, have a problem of declining incomes together with rising demand from growth in numbers aged between 18 and 24. Before the impact of Covid 19 a high proportion of institutions were in financial difficulty and were reducing staff numbers. There had been growing criticism of universities, from within for becoming too managerialist, commercial and market-focussed, and from outside for failing to meet key needs of society and the economy; such as equality of access for those from minority or disadvantaged backgrounds, and the production of graduates with the skills required by employers. Some commentators have attributed these challenges to the recent strength of right-wing and populist forces, and ideas which question the role and usefulness of higher education and support for increased government control and regulation. The chapter argues instead that the current problems of universities are not new, but have a longer history, and largely be explained by incremental changes to the funding of higher education over the last seventy years.","Baldock, John",Populism and Higher Education Curriculum Development: Problem Based Learning as a Mitigating Response,534,1

Coverage is one of the important indicators to measure the performance of sensor network nodes. Through the research on coverage problems, we can seek ways to improve the quality of sensor network services. A wireless sensor network node control effect is proposed. A distributed algorithm based on probability model is first constructed to optimize the probability perception algorithm. The above-mentioned two-dimensional space algorithm is extended to three-dimensional space, and the greedy heuristic algorithm is used to obtain the control solution to achieve the optimal control of the current wireless sensor network. In addition, the matlab simulation program is written, and the algorithm is compared with the simulation results of the average algorithm and the random algorithm. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm have significant advantages.","Xu, Jia; Song, Chao",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,534,24

To study the association of both pandemics, we conducted an observational, retrospective cohort study involving 521 patients admitted with Covid-19 to an inner city, community hospital in Brooklyn, NY in the period March 20 to May 2, 2020. Of the cohort, 57.6% was men, mean age was 61.6±17.2 years, and mean BMI was 29.0 ± 8.2 kg /m2. 11% had BMI > 40 kg/m(2). 53.9% was Hispanic, 33.3% was African American, 7.1% was White, with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (99%). Diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease were found in 45%, 41.5%, 15%, and 20.1% cases, respectively. Mean HbA1c was 5.8%± 1.1 in patients with no history of diabetes, 3% presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, mortality rate was 30.6%. Non-survivors were significantly older (median age 68 vs 56, p < 0.03) and had higher rate of microvascular and macrovascular diseases. In patients with diabetes, mortality rate was 40.1%. HbA1c was similar between survivors and non-survivors. Older age and hyperglycemia on admission were the risk factors for mortality. Only 30% of the cohort had normal weight (BMI<25), 30% was overweight and 40% was obese. In univariate analysis, the characteristics at admission significantly associated with mortality were age, BMI, hyperglycemia, diabetes and DKA in patients with or without diabetes. In age- and sex-adjusted multivariable analysis only BMI 30–39 kg/m(2) (OR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10, 2.43; p = 0.015), BMI >40 kg/m(2) (OR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.22, 3.44; p = 0.007) and DKA (OR = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.18, 2.64; p = 0.005) remained positively associated with higher mortality.

Smart walkers are a particular type of these devices since they integrate navigation systems, path-following algorithms, and user interaction modules to ensure natural and intuitive interaction. Although these functionalities are often implemented in rehabilitation scenarios, there is a need to actively involve the healthcare professionals in the interaction loop while guaranteeing safety for them and patients. This work presents the validation of two visual feedback strategies for the teleoperation of a simulated robotic walker during an assisted navigation task. For this purpose, a group of 14 clinicians from the rehabilitation area formed the validation group. A simple path-following task was proposed, and the feedback strategies were assessed through the kinematic estimation error (KTE) and a usability survey. A KTE of 0.28 m was obtained for the feedback strategy on the joystick. Additionally, significant differences were found through a Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test for the perception of behavior and confidence towards the joystick according to the modes of interaction (p-values of 0.04 and 0.01, respectively). The use of visual feedback with this tool contributes to research areas such as remote management of therapies and monitoring rehabilitation of people’s mobility.","Garcia A., Daniel E.; Sierra M., Sergio D.; Gomez-Vargas, Daniel; Jiménez, Mario F.; Múnera, Marcela; Cifuentes, Carlos A.",Sensors (Basel),534,1

These communities typically consist of accommodation, services and community facilities which cater to older people and the desire to maintain independence. The Nutrition and Healthy Ageing Trajectories in Retirement Living (NutriHAT-RL) study aims to investigate the nutrition and lifestyle-based behaviours which contribute to healthy ageing and the maintenance of social and physical functioning among older people living in retirement communities. METHODS: This study will recruit a total of 2,770 people aged 55 years or over living in retirement communities in the Australian Capital Territory and southern New South Wales regions of Australia for a four-year prospective longitudinal study commencing in March 2021. A range of measures, including nutritional intake, health and lifestyle behaviours, cognitive and psychological function, and physical health, will be completed on three occasions over a total of four years. Participants will complete a face-to-face comprehensive, validated food frequency questionnaire at each time point. Risk of malnutrition and nutritional behaviour (emotional appetite and intuitive eating) will also be evaluated. Multiple mental, social, and physical health domains will be assessed at each time point. This will include cognitive and mental health (depression, anxiety, and loneliness) screening, social and occupational functioning questionnaires, self-reported and observed physical function assessments, and sleep quality. Bitter taste endophenotype, salivary C-reactive protein, telomere length, and blood biomarkers associated with healthy ageing will also be evaluated. RESULTS: Ethics approval has been obtained through the University of Canberra Human Ethics Research Committee (UCHREC-2306). To reduce risk of COVID-19 transmissions, a risk mitigation plan has been developed. CONCLUSIONS: The NutriHAT-RL study will be the first Australian longitudinal study with a focus on nutrition and healthy ageing in people living in retirement communities. Findings from this study will contribute to understanding of nutrition and healthy ageing in this growing population and will inform policy and practice related to nutrition and ageing in place.

In line with both knowledge economy and financial literature, the paper aims to indagate the relationship between agency costs, firm’s performance, and delisting. Despite there is evidence in finance that highlights the role of exchange regulators in the going private processes, just few studies focus on the voluntary delisting and its antecedents. Starting from the knowledge economy setting, this paper aims to define how firm’s financial performance moderates the relationship between agency costs and delisting choices. Based on a sample of non-financial firms delisted from the most important European stock markets between 1997 and 2017, we applied an OLS regression to analyze the main variables that influence the going private processes. We find that a high level of stock market performance, associated with high level of free cash flows, promotes going private as a means of anticipating and preventing future value decreases. Finally, the paper provides practical implications for the development of new approach of delisting choice.","Magni, Domitilla; Morresi, Ottorino; Pezzi, Alberto; Graziano, Domenico",J Knowl Econ,534,1

SETTING: Spinal cord injury centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. METHODS: Data of SCI/D patients diagnosed with bladder cancer were collected between Jan 2012–Dec 2019 in the course of annual surveys in the neuro-urological departments of all 28 centers. Demographic and paralysis-specific data, data on the type and management of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, and histopathological tumor characteristics were collected. RESULTS: Regarding histopathological tumor characteristics, no significant differences were found in 135 individuals with SCI/D when stratified for bladder management without chronic catheterization, SCI/D severity, and ASIA classification. The mean latency period between the onset of SCI/D and the diagnosis of bladder cancer was significantly longer in patients with catheter-free emptying methods compared to patients with intermittent catheterization, and in patients with LMNL (Lower Motor Neuron Lesion) compared to patients with UMNL (Upper Motor Neuron Lesion).

Decision-makers consider the benefits and harms of screening when reviewing the evidence about these programmes. Economic evaluations contribute one important part of this assessment process. However, it is not fully understood what approaches health economic assessments have adopted to measure and value benefits and harms. This study aims to systematically review and critique the published and grey literature on methods for identifying, measuring and valuing the benefits and harms of antenatal and newborn screening adopted by health economic assessments. METHODS AND ANALYSIS Nine bibliographic databases will be searched from 2000 onwards. These search strategies will be supplemented by manual reference searching of bibliographies, forward citation searching, contacts with experts, author searching and web searching for grey literature. Studies will be selected for review if they report health economic assessments of an antenatal or newborn screening programme. Assessments of title and abstracts and full reports will be undertaken independently with disagreements resolved through discussion. Data extraction will include fields to assess the reporting quality of the studies using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards statement and a bespoke ancillary form to assess how benefits and harms have been accounted for.

New influenza vaccine technologies, such as virus-like-particles (VLPs), offer a promising alternative. Here, we tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a VLP vaccine containing hemagglutinin (HA) and M1 from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus (H1N1pdm) in ferrets and compared intramuscular (i.m.) and intranasal (i.n.) routes of immunization. Vaccination of ferrets with VLPs containing the M1 and HA proteins from A/California/04/2009 (H1N1pdm) induced high antibody titers and conferred significant protection against virus challenge. VLP-vaccinated animals lost less weight, shed less virus in nasal washes, and had markedly lower virus titers in all organs tested than naïve controls. A single dose of VLPs, either i.m. or i.n., induced higher levels of antibody than did two doses of commercial split vaccine. Ferrets vaccinated with split vaccine were incompletely protected against challenge; these animals had lower virus titers in olfactory bulbs, tonsils, and intestines, but lost weight and shed virus in nasal washes to a similar extent as naïve controls. Challenge with heterologous A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1) virus revealed that the VLPs conferred minimal cross-protection to heterologous infection, as revealed by the lack of reduction in nasal wash and lung virus titers and slightly higher weight loss relative to controls. In summary, these experiments demonstrate the strong immunogenicity and protective efficacy of VLPs compared to the split vaccine and show that i.n. vaccination with VLPs has the potential for highly efficacious vaccination against influenza.","Hossain, M Jaber; Bourgeois, Melissa; Quan, Fu-Shi; Lipatov, Aleksandr S; Song, Jae-Min; Chen, Li-Mei; Compans, Richard W; York, Ian; Kang, Sang-Moo; Donis, Ruben O",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,534,1

Pain is a commonly studied symptom in pancreatic cancer; however, few studies examine the frequency of multiple patient-reported symptoms. Our aim is to ascertain patient-reported symptom burden at initial consultation with a palliative care provider and compare patient prognostic awareness to provider estimation of prognosis. METHODS Data were extracted from the standardized Quality Data Collection Tool (QDACT). Adults with pancreatic cancer seen by a palliative care provider were included. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic features, symptom prevalence and burden, as well as assess patient prognosis awareness defined by congruence or incongruence with provider estimated prognosis. RESULTS 285 patients were included in our analysis. The average age was 68 years (SD: 12.4), 87.2% were white, 50% male. The mean number of moderate/severe symptoms was 2.6 (SD: 2) out of 9 symptoms. Tiredness (66.7%), appetite (64.5%) and pain (46.2%) had the highest rates of moderate/severe symptom burden. Patients with a prognosis of 1-6 months had the lowest proportion of congruence with provider estimation (56.5%). CONCLUSION Our study suggests targets to improve patient-centered care of pancreatic cancer. Patients commonly have multiple symptoms that are moderate/severe at time of palliative care referral. While pain has been well-reported, tiredness and decreased appetite are more prevalent at initial visit. This emphasizes the importance of assessing multiple symptoms and working closely with palliative care for early referral. Overall, one third of patient prognosis estimates differed from the provider assessment of prognosis. Our data support the importance of early referral to palliative care to manage symptoms and better prepare patients for end-of-life care.","Johnson, Alyson M; Wolf, Steven; Xuan, Mengdi; Samsa, Greg; Kamal, Arif; Fisher, Deborah A",Journal of palliative care,534,16

RESULTS The public perceived different levels of risk regarding the likelihood and their concern about contracting the 2009 H1N1 flu. These measures of risk perception were primarily correlated with people of Hispanic ethnicity, having children in the household, and recent seasonal flu experience in the previous year. The perceived likelihood was not strongly associated with preventive behaviors, whereas the perceived concern was significantly associated with precautionary and preparatory behaviors. The association between perceived concern and precautionary behavior persisted after controlling for demographic characteristics.

While some of these viruses have a significant impact on public health, others appear to be non-pathogenic. At present little is known about the host cell responses to infection with different arenaviruses, particularly those found in the New World; however, apoptosis is known to play an important role in controlling infection of many viruses. Here we show that infection with Tacaribe virus (TCRV), which is widely considered the prototype for non-pathogenic arenaviruses, leads to stronger induction of apoptosis than does infection with its human-pathogenic relative Junín virus. TCRV-induced apoptosis occurred in several cell types during late stages of infection and was shown to be caspase-dependent, involving the activation of caspases 3, 7, 8 and 9. Further, UV-inactivated TCRV did not induce apoptosis, indicating that the activation of this process is dependent on active viral replication/transcription. Interestingly, when apoptosis was inhibited, growth of TCRV was not enhanced, indicating that apoptosis does not have a direct negative effect on TCRV infection in vitro. Taken together, our data identify and characterize an important virus-host cell interaction of the prototypic, non-pathogenic arenavirus TCRV, which provides important insight into the growing field of arenavirus research aimed at better understanding the diversity in responses to different arenavirus infections and their functional consequences.","Wolff, Svenja; Groseth, Allison; Meyer, Bjoern; Jackson, David; Strecker, Thomas; Kaufmann, Andreas; Becker, Stephan",The Journal of general virology,534,5

METHODS In this retrospective observational study we enrolled 1049 patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in a single Italian Center from 21 February to 20 March 2020 Evaluated risk factors (RFs) were: advanced age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Endpoint of the study was death from any cause. A multivariate logistic regression model was built using covariates that showed as statistically significant at univariate regression analysis. RESULTS Median age at presentation was 71.1 years (IQR: 59.1-80.5); 244 (72.2%) were males. Primary outcome occurred in 338 patients (32.2%). In decedents, median survival from Hospitalization was 6 (IQR: 3-10) days. 264 decedents had 1 RF, 120 had 2 RFs and 39 had ≥3 RFs. At multivariate logistic regression model, variables associated with primary outcome were: age class (64-69 years) (OR 3.03, CI 1.75-5.31, p<0.001), age class (70-88 years) (OR 10.08, CI 6.67-15.72, p<0.001), age class (≥ 88 years) (OR 23.99, CI 13.21-44.82, p<0.001), male gender (OR 1.88, CI 1.36-2.62, p<0.001), diabetes (OR 1.56, CI 1.07-2.26, p=0.02), stroke (OR 3.41, CI 1.33-9.91, p=0.015).

METHODS We conducted a technical analysis of manufacturer specifications of the biologic prostheses that are currently available in France accompanied by a literature review by selecting meta-analyses and systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials and publications of health technology rating agencies. RESULTS Biological implants for parietal reinforcement are mainly intended for use in a contaminated environment where the use of synthetic prostheses is contra-indicated. We identified fourteen systematic reviews and meta-analyses and one randomized controlled trial. Six ongoing clinical trials were identified as well as two clinical trials that had been interrupted. In the current state of knowledge, there are no high-level evidence data on the therapeutic contribution of biologic prostheses that allow prioritization of the various biologic prostheses according to their characteristics or their different manufacturing processes. CONCLUSION Pending the results of current randomized controlled trials to validate the indications and an eventual specific reimbursement, indications for the use of biologic parietal reinforcement prostheses seems to be limited to rare clinical situations and only after collegial discussion.","Sainfort, A; Denis Hallouard, I; Hartmann, D; Aulagner, G; Francois, Y; Tiffet, O; Barabino, G; Nuiry, O; Armoiry, X",Journal of visceral surgery,534,1

This rapid review summarizes how this knowledge has evolved in recent years. RECENT FINDINGS The number of articles on patient financial burden is increasing, suggesting awareness about the growing impact of economic burden on patients. This is particularly evident when discussing out-of-pocket costs, and lost work for patients/caregivers. However, there is an increasing focus on 'foregone care' and 'financial distress'. Additionally, emerging literature is examining policies and approaches to screen and/or mitigate these patient financial risks, thereby improving access to care. There is also increasing focus on populations that shoulder a disproportionate financial burden, including ethnic minorities (blacks, Asians, Latinos) as well as those with lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, there is evidence that this burden also affects the middle class. SUMMARY As healthcare budgets become stretched, especially during a pandemic, supportive programs benefiting the less fortunate often shrink, which impacts access to care. The emerging research on strategies with government or institutions to mitigate these burdens and access issues are both welcome and needed.","Longo, Christopher J; Fitch, Margaret I",Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,534,1

We aimed to assess thromboembolic risk and baseline ATT by geographic region and identify factors associated with prescription of ATT in a large, truly global registry of patients with recently diagnosed AF. Methods and Results Our analysis comprises 15,092 patients newly diagnosed with non-valvular AF at risk for stroke, enrolled in Phase II of Global Registry on Long-Term Oral Antithrombotic Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (GLORIA-AF). Global oral anticoagulation (OAC) use was 79.9%, being highest in Europe (90.1%), followed by Africa/Middle East (87.4%) and Latin America (85.3%), North America (78.3%) and Asia (55.2%). Among OAC users, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been replaced by non-VKA OACs (NOACs) as the more prevalent OAC option in all regions, with highest use in North America (66.5%) and lowest in Asia (50.2%). In Asia, OAC was 80.4% in community hospitals but only 49.8% in university hospitals and 42.6% in specialist offices, and varied from 21.0% in China to 89.7% in Japan (NOACs at 5.8% in China and 83.3% in Japan). Globally, 76.5% of low-risk patients were prescribed ATT (46.1% OAC), whereas 17.7% high-risk patients were not anticoagulated (Europe 8.8%; North America 18.9%; Asia 42.4%). Conclusion Substantial inter- and intra-regional differences in ATT for stroke prevention in AF are evident in this global registry. While guideline-adherent ATT can be further improved, NOACs are the main contributor to high OAC use worldwide.","Mazurek, Michał; Huisman, Menno V; Rothman, Kenneth J; Paquette, Miney; Teutsch, Christine; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Dubner, Sergio J; Halperin, Jonathan L; Ma, Chang Sheng; Zint, Kristina; Elsaesser, Amelie; Lu, Shihai; Lip, Gregory Y H",Thrombosis and haemostasis,534,16

The role of chemokines and their receptors in viral infections including HIV-1 was predicted from the early studies of HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 and its ligands and a divergent role of C-C chemokines in HIV-1 pathogenesis has been established. For example, CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β) and CCL5 (RANTES) have been shown to possess antiviral effects by binding to the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5, whereas CCL2, a pro-inflammatory chemokine, supports HIV-1 replication despite being a member of same chemokine family. Furthermore, the well-established role of CCL2 in driving the Th2 immune response supports its potential role in HIV-1/AIDS. Recent reports suggest multiple pathways of CCL2 affect HIV-1 infection.

METHODS Forty-one consecutive neonates and infants undergoing bypass were monitored with right + left cerebral and renal NIRS. Near-infrared spectroscopy and lactate were measured at 20 time points, from baseline 1 day preoperatively, during bypass and modified ultrafiltration (MUF; 10 minutes), until 24 hours postoperatively. Adverse events were extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)/death, prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) or length of hospital stay. RESULTS Perioperative mean renal NIRS remained higher than baseline (n = 41) as did cerebral NIRS in all undergoing biventricular repair. During bypass (n = 41), mean right and left cerebral NIRS were equal. During MUF, cerebral and renal NIRS values increased (P < .001). Cerebral NIRS and lactate inversely correlated during the first six postoperative hours. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation /death occurred in four patients, correlating with cerebral and renal NIRS below 45% (P = .030) and 40% (P = .019) at anytime, respectively, and with mean lactate levels >9.3 mmol/L in the first postoperative 24 hours (P < .001). Among survivors, renal NIRS below 30% at any time predicted a longer ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS At bypass conclusion, 10 minutes of MUF does not adversely affect cerebral or renal NIRS. Left and right cerebral NIRS are equal, so that biparietal cerebral NIRS monitoring is probably not warranted. Perioperative cerebral and renal NIRS readings, respectively, below 45% and 40% correlate with ECMO/death and renal NIRS below 30% with prolonged ICU stay. Cerebral NIRS and lactate levels showed a strong inverse correlation during the first six postoperative hours.","Dodge-Khatami, Jannika; Gottschalk, Urda; Eulenburg, Christine; Wendt, Ulrike; Schnegg, Clivia; Rebel, Marcus; Reichenspurner, Hermann; Dodge-Khatami, Ali",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,534,16

AREAS COVERED This perspective provides an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 positive cases in the UK throughout the year, the number of hospitalisations, patients in critical care, and COVID-19 associated deaths. EXPERT OPINION The COVID-19 associated hospital admission represents only 15% of total COVID-19 positive cases in November 2020 compared to around 65% during the first wave. In April 2020, 17% of total COVID-19 positive patients in the country died from the disease, this was dropped to under 4% in November 2020. Age was the single most determinator of COVID-19 associated mortality, people with 50 years or older age accounted for 98% of total COVID deaths recorded in the country. This probes interesting questions about the current state of immunity, national lockdown, and mass immunisation measures to curb the pandemic cycle; it also emphasises the need to invest in novel antivirals to save the most vulnerable in the society and hence a refocus in efforts and resources needed to bring the life back to normality.","Merchant, Hamid A; Kow, Chia Siang; Hasan, Syed Shahzad",Expert review of respiratory medicine,534,17

However, the molecular understanding on the stability of As‒S slag is missing, which in turn restricts the development of robust approach to solve the challenge. In this work, we investigated the structure-stability relationship of As‒S slag with adopting various As‒S clusters as prototypes by density functional theory (DFT). Results showed that the configuration of S multimers-covering-(As2S3)n is the most stable structure amongst the candidates by the analysis of energies and bonding characteristics. The high stability is explained by orbital composition that the 4p-orbital (As) binding with 3p-orbital (S) decreases energy level of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Inspired from the calculations, an excess-S-based hydrothermal method was successfully proposed and achieved to promote the stabilization of As‒S slag. Typically, the As concentration from the leaching test of stabilized As‒S slag is only 0.8 mg/L, which is much lower than the value from other stabilized slag.","Liu, Fansong; Xu, Qiujing; Liang, Huizhi; Wang, Haiying; Zhong, Cheng; Min, Xiaobo; Zhang, Liyuan",Journal of hazardous materials,534,1

Material and methods: Sixty-six patients with 69 resection cavities treated with HFSRT after macroscopic complete resection of 1-3 brain metastases between 2009 and 2016 in our institution were included in this study. Overall survival, local recurrence and locoregional recurrence were evaluated depending on the time interval from surgery to the start of radiation therapy. Results: Patients that started radiotherapy within 21 days from surgery had a significantly decreased OS compared to patients treated after a longer interval from surgery (p < .01). There was no significant difference between patients treated ≥ 34 and 22-33 days from surgery (p = .210). In the univariate analysis, local control was superior for patients starting treatment 22-33 days from surgery compared to a later start (p = .049). This effect did not prevail in a multivariate model. There was no significant difference between patients treated within 21 days and patients treated more than 33 days after surgery (p = .203). Locoregional control was not influenced by RT timing (p = .508). Conclusion: A short delay in the start of radiotherapy does not seem to negatively impact the outcome in patients with resected brain metastases. We even observed an unexpected reduction in OS in patients treated within 21 days from surgery. Further studies are needed to define the optimal timing of postoperative radiotherapy to the resection cavity.","Scharl, Sophia; Kirstein, Anna; Kessel, Kerstin A; Diehl, Christian; Oechsner, Markus; Straube, Christoph; Meyer, Bernhard; Zimmer, Claus; Combs, Stephanie E",Acta oncologica,534,31

Clarity around this issue is important as it may influence the quality of peer reviewer reports. This scoping review explored the roles and tasks of peer reviewers of biomedical journals. METHODS Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Educational Resources Information Center, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science from inception up to May 2017. There were no date and language restrictions. We also searched for grey literature. Studies with statements mentioning roles, tasks and competencies pertaining to the role of peer reviewers in biomedical journals were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently performed study screening and selection. Relevant statements were extracted, collated and classified into themes. RESULTS After screening 2763 citations and 600 full-text papers, 209 articles and 13 grey literature sources were included. A total of 1426 statements related to roles were extracted, resulting in 76 unique statements. These were grouped into 13 emergent themes: proficient experts in their field (3 items), dutiful/altruistic towards scientific community (7 items), familiar with journal (2 items), unbiased and ethical professionals (18 items), self-critical professionals (4 items), reliable professionals (7 items), skilled critics (15 items), respectful communicators (6 items), gatekeepers (2 items), educators (2 items), advocates for author/editor/reader (3 items) and advisors to editors (2 items). Roles that do not fall within the remit of peer reviewers were also identified (5 items). We also extracted 2026 statements related to peer reviewers' tasks, resulting in 73 unique statements. These were grouped under six themes: organisation and approach to reviewing (10 items), make general comments (10 items), assess and address content for each section of the manuscript (36 items), address ethical aspects (5 items), assess manuscript presentation (8 items) and provide recommendations (4 items). CONCLUSIONS Peer reviewers are expected to perform a large number of roles and tasks for biomedical journals. These warrant further discussion and clarification in order not to overburden these key actors.","Glonti, Ketevan; Cauchi, Daniel; Cobo, Erik; Boutron, Isabelle; Moher, David; Hren, Darko",BMC medicine,534,27

METHODS We performed a retrospective medical chart review of patients with glaucoma who received ripasudil or SLT as an adjuvant therapy. We collected data on 65 eyes (65 patients) with primary open-angle glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma, or exfoliation glaucoma with at least 12 months of follow-up. IOP and number of glaucoma medications at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were compared between and within groups. A repeated-measures mixed model was used to perform statistical analysis. We also investigated factors associated with treatment success, which was defined as ≥ 20% reduction in IOP at all follow-up periods, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Significant IOP reduction was observed at all time-points after treatment in the ripasudil group (n = 33) and in the SLT group (n = 32), with no statistically significant difference between the groups before or after treatment. Patients in the SLT group used more anti-glaucoma medications before treatment, but fewer during follow-up, than those in the ripasudil group. Regardless of treatment, higher baseline IOP was associated with treatment success [crude odds ratio: 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.38), adjusted odds ratio: 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.77)]. CONCLUSIONS Adjuvant SLT or ripasudil in patients with inadequately controlled glaucoma both reduced IOP to a similar degree, but SLT contributed to reducing the number of medications used.","Ono, Koichi; Sakemi, Fumika; Marumoto, Tatsuya",International ophthalmology,534,12

These hidden colour signals are often conspicuous and are used as a secondary defence to warn or startle predators (deimatic displays) and/or to confuse them (flash displays). The hidden signals used in these displays frequently resemble typical aposematic signals, so it is possible that prey with hidden signals have evolved to employ colour patterns of a form that predators have previously learned to associate with unprofitability. Here, we tested this hypothesis by conducting two experiments that examined the effect of predator avoidance learning on the efficacy of deimatic and flash displays. We found that the survival benefits of both deimatic and flash displays were substantially higher against predators that had previously learned to associate the hidden colours with unprofitability than against naive predators. These findings help explain the phenological patterns we found in 1568 macro-lepidopteran species on three continents: species with hidden signals tend to occur later in the season than species without hidden signals.","Kim, Yongsu; Hwang, Yerin; Bae, Sangryong; Sherratt, Thomas N; An, Jeongseop; Choi, Sei-Woong; Miller, Jeffrey C; Kang, Changku",Proceedings.

To stop the deadly spread of the virus, many countries, including Indonesia, have applied the 'Large-scale Social Restriction' (LSSR) policy. Numerous studies have reported positive impacts of air quality due to this policy. However, in Indonesia, data on the impacts of LSSR on air quality are still sparse. Therefore, this study aims to analyze changes in air quality at before and during the LSSR periods in the South Sumatera Province, Indonesia using the satellite-based observations of particulate matter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The results showed that the concentrations of the measured pollutants markedly declined during the LSSR period from the highest was SO2 (98.90%) and followed by NO2 (34.79%), CO (12.70%) and PM10 (11.54%), respectively. The emissions from biomass burning activities were expected as a major source of air pollutant during the LSSR. Furthermore, we found a positive association between PM10 and the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in the study area (r = 0.514, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, this study concluded that the implementation of LSSR could reduce air pollutants concentration in the study area while a higher PM10 exposure could increase the risk of death from COVID-19. The output of the study can be used to arrange air quality management practice and COVID-19 transmission control in Indonesia.","Rendana, M.",Aerosol and Air Quality Research,534,16

The aim of the study was to develop a prognostic model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at the time of diagnosis and determine risk factors for severe disease. Methods: All SARS-CoV-2-positive adults in Iceland were prospectively enrolled into a telehealth service at diagnosis. A multivariable proportional-odds logistic regression model was derived from information obtained during the enrollment interview with those diagnosed before May 1, 2020 and validated in those diagnosed between May 1 and December 31, 2020. Outcomes were defined on an ordinal scale; no need for escalation of care during follow-up, need for outpatient visit, hospitalization, and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Risk factors were summarized as odds ratios (OR) adjusted for confounders identified by a directed acyclic graph. Results: The prognostic model was derived from and validated in 1,625 and 3,131 individuals, respectively. In total, 375 (7.9%) only required outpatient visits, 188 (4.0%) were hospitalized and 50 (1.1%) were either admitted to ICU or died due to complications of COVID-19. The model included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking, underlying conditions, and symptoms and clinical severity score at enrollment. Discrimination and calibration were excellent for outpatient visit or worse (C-statistic 0.75, calibration intercept 0.04 and slope 0.93) and hospitalization or worse (C-statistic 0.81, calibration intercept 0.16 and slope 1.03). Age was the strongest risk factor for adverse outcomes with OR of 75- compared to 45- year-olds, ranging from 5.29-17.3. Higher BMI consistently increased the risk and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease correlated with worse outcomes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, a same-day-discharge strategy reduces resource utilization, relieves hospital occupation, and possibly reduces the risk of in-hospital transmission. We sought to analyze the feasibility for the implementation of a same-day-discharge protocol in a series of patients receiving LAAO with cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA)-guided pre-procedural planning and intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE)-guided device deployment in patients under conscious sedation. Methods: A prospective analysis of 20 consecutive patients who underwent same-day discharge following LAAO over a 6-month period with cardiac CTA-guided pre-procedural planning and ICE was conducted. Procedures were performed in a large academic hospital in the United States. Procedural success, adverse events, length of procedure, and length of stay were evaluated. Results: The same-day-discharge protocol was implemented for all 20 patients (100%) successfully, 12 (60%) with WATCHMAN™ 2.5 devices and 8 (40%) using the next-generation WATCHMAN™ FLX platform. The mean CHA2DS2VASc score was 4.2±1.2 and the mean HAS-BLED score was 3.9±0.9. All deployments were sized on the basis of pre-procedural CTA and were ICE-guided, with 100% success, with the patients under conscious sedation. Hence, there was no need for trans-esophageal echocardiogram, intubation, or mechanical ventilation. No adverse events occurred. Conclusions: The same-day-discharge strategy is feasible and may play an important role in the COVID-19 era. A protocol including CTA pre-procedural planning, ICE-guided deployment, and conscious sedation reduces hospital occupation and lowers costs. [Formula presented]","Dallan, L. A.

We evaluated a novel POC microfluidic cartridge-based device (ViroTrack Sero COVID-19 Total Ab) for quantitative detection of total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimeric spike protein and compared to standard laboratory chemiluminescence (CLIA) based tests. Methods: Capillary- and venous blood samples were collected from 101 individuals employed at Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark. Antibody responses were measured on capillary-, venous whole blood, plasma and diluted plasma samples directly on the POC instrument. POC results were available within seven minutes on the microfluidic cartridge reader. Plasma samples were analysed on the DiaSorin LIAISON XL CLIA Analyzer using LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 IgM, LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assays. The data from the CLIA platform was used as a reference. Results: The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between ViroTrack Sero COVID-19 Total Ab and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assays is found to be 0.86 and 0.90 respectively. ViroTrack Sero COVID-19 Total Ab furthermore showed high correlation (>0.86) among the different sample matrixes. The agreement for determination of samples >200 BAU/mL on POC and CLIA methods is estimated to be around 90%.

The absence of vaccines and effective drugs is a key trouble responsible for the ineffective management of this pandemic. Considering this emergency situation, several trials have been made to identify repurposing on-market drugs known for their antiviral behavior. Several modern technologies such as deep machine learning are used to combat this deadly disease with faster prediction and greater accuracy. More interestingly, these studies have provided clues for the antiviral properties and are believed to help in effective control of this pandemic. The drugs identified by deep learning-based virtual screening will help in unraveling molecular mechanisms of therapeutic and antiviral properties and will pave the way for designing artificial drugs.

A novel paradigm, including speech recognition, language understanding, pilot repetition generation (PRG), and text-to-speech (TTS), is designed to formulate the framework pipeline, which also incorporates a simulation system interface. We mainly focus on the PRG and TTS models to address the ATC specificities in this work. The neural architecture is proposed to generate the text repetition instruction by using a sequence-to-sequence text mapping. The Transformer block is improved to implement a high-efficient TTS model, in which the nonautoregressive mechanism is applied to achieve the parallel synthesis. A dedicated phoneme vocabulary is designed to cope with the multilingual issue in the ATC domain and address the out-of-vocabulary problem. With the APA framework, a virtual training mode is proposed to complete the training task without the limitation of time and location. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that the proposed APA framework replaces the human pilot with considerable high confidence in a real-time manner during the simulation training. Most importantly, the APA framework and the virtual training system are able to cope with the dilemma of physical attendance (like COVID-19) and improve the equipment utilization capacity for the ATCO training.

This consensus has been based on results obtained in middle-aged populations, whereas only few data exist for the oldest and most frail adults such as nursing home residents (NH-Res) that is, the population most vulnerable to develop severe forms of COVID-19. In this study, we studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG(S) level of NH-Res and healthcare workers (HCWs) with or without a history of COVID-19 infection taking into account the time since immunization (COVID-19 and/or vaccination). 654 subjects were analyzed: 397 NH-Res (median age 88, IQR 82-93 years, 75% women) and 257 Health Care Workers (HCWs, median 46, IQR 38-54 years, 81% women). NH-Res and HCWs were classified in one of the following 3 groups: No-COVID history and 2 vaccine shots (COV-NO/2VACC); Yes-COVID history and 1 (COV-YES/1VACC) or 2 (COV-YES/2VACC) vaccine injections. The time-related decrease in IgG (S) in subjects without COVID-19 history, SARS-COV-2 serology would be negative in HCWs approximately 220 days and in residents 180 days after vaccination. This time-related decrease was much slower in those with history of COVID. NH-Res belonging into the COV-NO/2VACC and the COV-YES/1VACC groups showed lower IgG (S) levels than the same groups of HCWs (for both groups, p<0.0001), whereas in the group COV-YES/2VACC, IgG (S) levels were similar in NH-Res and HCWs (p=0.88). These results remained unchanged after adjustment for age and duration since immunization. Thus, in NH-Res, 2 vaccine shots were associated with a more pronounced immune response, whereas in HCWs, 1 or 2 vaccine shots in patients with COVID-19 history did make any difference. These results indicate significant differences in mRNA vaccination between NH-Res and middle-aged controls, and could contribute to the specification of vaccine policy in this very old, frail population.","Jeulin, H.; Craus, D.; Labat, C.; Benetos, A.",,534,11

As a case study, we consider undergraduate students starting their academic year virtually in the context of a pandemic. Through the application of the PANAS questionnaire and NLP techniques on free-text responses, students' emotions are automatically classified as positive and negative, as well as a level of basic emotions of the Plutchik model. The results allow to identify the most frequent sentiments in students. Also, they show concordances between both measurement instruments and a high capacity for the classification of emotions. © 2021 AISTI.","Puraivan, E.; Leon, M.; Beltran, J.; Riquelme, F.","16th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, CISTI 2021",534,16

(Special Edition: Baltic states.),14.090377,1.700579,2020,"Separation of B cells into different subsets has been useful to understand their different functions in various immune scenarios. In some instances, the subsets defined by phenotypic FACS separation are relatively homogeneous and so establishing the functions associated with them is straightforward. Other subsets, such as the “Double negative” (DN, CD19+CD27-IgD-) population, are more complex with reports of differing functionality which could indicate a heterogeneous population. Recent advances in single-cell techniques enable an alternative route to characterise cells based on their transcriptome. To maximise immunological insight, we need to match prior data from phenotype-based studies with the finer granularity of the single-cell transcriptomic signatures. We also need to be able to define meaningful B cell subsets from single cell analyses performed on PBMCs, where the relative paucity of a B cell signature means that defining B cell subsets within the whole is challenging. Here we provide a reference single-cell dataset based on phenotypically sorted B cells and an unbiased procedure to better classify functional B cell subsets in the peripheral blood, particularly useful in establishing a baseline cellular landscape and in extracting significant changes with respect to this baseline from single-cell datasets. We find 10 different clusters of B cells and applied a novel, geometry-inspired, method to RNA velocity estimates in order to evaluate the dynamical transitions between B cell clusters. This indicated the presence of two main developmental branches of memory B cells. One involves IgM memory cells and two DN subpopulations, culminating in a population thought to be associated with Age related B cells and the extrafollicular response. The other branch involves a third DN cluster which appears to be a precursor of classical memory cells. In addition, we identify a novel DN4 population, which is IgE rich and on its own developmental branch but with links to the classical memory branch.","Stewart, Alexander; Ng, Joseph; Wallis, Gillian; Tsioligka, Vasiliki; Fraternali, Franca; Dunn-Walters, Deborah",bioRxiv,534,24

This study aims to determine the factors regarding the social and environmental indicators and the demographical and economical factors that affect the online shopping tendencies of households in Turkey. The results of this research can be used to review the online shopping strategies by the decision-makers. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the cross-sectional data acquired from the Household Budget Research survey, which has been conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute between 2015 and 2018, is used. In this data set consisting of 11,491 in 2015, 12,096 in 2016, 12,166 in 2017 and 11,828 in 2018, a total of 47,581 data from the households that are 15-year-old and older are used. To determine the factors affecting the online shopping behaviour of households, binary logistic regression and binary probit regression analyses are applied. As a result of these analyses, it has been decided that the most suitable model is the binary probit regression model. Findings: According to the analysis results, it has been detected that factors such as educational status, age, marital status, employment status, income, life assurance ownership, credit card usage, automobile ownership and the year of the survey affect the online shopping behaviour of households. Practical implications: In this study, factors affecting the tendency to do online shopping, which has gained big importance particularly with the COVID-19 pandemic, are determined. In Turkey, households’ tendency to do online shopping is affected by the demographical and economical factors and by the factors related to the social and environmental indicators. Determination of the effects of these factors has been a guide for the decision-makers and policymakers in explaining the tendency to shop online and creating a competitive advantage. Originality/value: In this study, data consisting of a total of 47,581 observations, which has acquired from the Household Budget Research survey conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute between 2015 and 2018, are used by applying a weighting process, and no study that is as comprehensive and inclusive as this study has been found in the literature, e-commerce that has become prevalent with the help of technological progress and changing habits in the past years is continuing to become prevalent more increasingly particularly after COVID-19 pandemic.

Widespread shortfalls of physical activity interventions suggests the complex underlying mechanisms of change are not yet fully understood. More insightful process evaluations are needed to design and implement more effective approaches. This paper describes the protocol for a process evaluation of the JU:MP programme, a whole systems approach to increasing physical activity in children and young people aged 5-14 years in North Bradford, UK. Methods: This process evaluation, underpinned by realist philosophy, aims to understand the development and implementation of the JU:MP programme and the mechanisms by which JU:MP influences physical activity in children and young people. It also aims to explore behaviour change across wider policy, strategy and neighbourhood systems. A mixed method data collection approach will include semi-structured interview, observation, documentary analysis, surveys, and participatory evaluation methods including reflections and ripple effect mapping. Discussion: Not only is this an innovative approach to process evaluation but it will also feed into iterative programme development to generate evidence-based practice and deliver practice-based evidence. This paper advances knowledge regarding the development of process evaluations for evaluating systems interventions, and emphasises the importance of process evaluation.","Hall, J.; Bingham, D.

Diminished expression of human leukocyte antigen DR on circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR), measured by standardized flow cytometry procedure, is a reliable indicator of immunosuppression in severely injured intensive care unit patients. As such, it is used as stratification criteria in clinical trials evaluating novel immunostimulating therapies. Pre-analytical constraints relative to the short delay between blood sampling and flow cytometry staining have nevertheless limited its use in multicentric studies. The objective of the present work was to compare mHLA-DR expression between whole blood samples simultaneously drawn in EDTA or Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. Methods. In 2 university hospitals, mHLA-DR was assessed in fresh whole blood from septic patients (n = 12) and healthy donors (n = 6) simultaneously sampled on EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. Staining was performed immediately after sampling and after blood storage at room temperature. Results. We observed the remarkable stability of mHLA-DR results when blood was collected in Cyto-Chex BCT tubes (until 48-72 h). On baseline values, despite good correlation between tubes (r = 0.98, p< 0.001), mHLA-DR expression was systematically lower with Cyto-Chex BCT. Conclusion. The present reports confirms the great potential of Cyto-Chex BCT tubes to delay mHLA-DR staining in centers without rapid access to flow cytometry facilities. However, a 30 % gap exists between results obtained with EDTA and Cyto-Chex BCT tubes. As current thresholds for clinical decisions were obtained with EDTA samples, further studies are needed to confirm clinical thresholds with Cyto-Chex BCT tubes.","monneret, g.",,534,20

It can be defensibly labelled as illiberal, as it is based on a longing for a charismatic leader and specific national identity, combining individual freedom with non-liberal values, and distances itself from western standards comprising the Rule of Law, democracy, and human rights protection. Weak restraint is provided by EU and international norms and procedures. The aim of this paper is to recognize the tendencies in legislative practice in Poland since 2015 that are associated with the illiberalization of the constitutional system, and investigate their role in deterioration of the legislative quality, and thus, maintenance of illiberal constitutionalism. These tendencies are detected as inequality, defective constitutional justice and compromised judicial independence, accelerated and pure majoritarian approach to legislation, and illiberal content of laws. It is found that the legislation has been fuelled by the majoritarian vision of a state community that is emphasized in the political narrative of the ruling alliance. This vision has been transformed into political decision-making and situated against rule-of-law considerations. It generates de facto discrimination against certain groups of people (LGBTQI+), de iure inequalities (retirement age and pension), and the will of the (majority of) people is placed above the Constitution. A captured constitutional court is not able to defend the Constitution. The legislative process has been accelerated to such an extent that there is no meaningful discussion, consultation, or public participation in the procedure. The statutes are abused for informal constitutional changes or have symbolic meaning without proper legislative effectiveness. Legislation during the COVID-19 crisis has not improved the quality of laws at all and could not properly addressed the criticism emerged after some experiences of the pandemic-related functioning of the parliament and government. The combination of all these tendencies makes the Polish legislative practice distinctive in its illiberal tone. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bień-Kacała, A.",Theory and Practice of Legislation,534,16

Through close analysis of their lived experiences, the book identifies key patterns, pitfalls, and lessons learnt from pandemic education. Drawing on contributions from all levels of the US education system, the book situates these myriad voices and perspectives within a prismatic theory framework in order to recognise how these views and experiences interconnect. Detailed narrative and phenomenological analysis also call attention to patterns of inequality, reduced social and emotional well-being, pressures on parents, and the role of communication, flexibility, and teacher-led innovation. Chapters are interchanged with interludes that showcase a lyrical and authentic approach to understanding the multiplicity of experience in the text. Providing a valuable contribution to the contemporary field of pandemic education research, this volume will be of interest to researchers, academics, and educators with an interest in the sociology of education, online teaching and eLearning, and those involved with the digitalization of education at all levels.

Although communication during the pandemic has highlighted many linguistic barriers and a huge divide between hegemonic and minority languages (see López 2020 for Latin America), there has been an unprecedented worldwide production of health information materials in indigenous languages (see CEJIS 2020, among others, for some examples in Bolivian languages), which was also made possible by linguistic research. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the description of minority languages even more urgent, as coronavirus has often hit the hardest those vulnerable communities in which endangered languages are spoken, causing the death of many language keepers.

These infections are typically nonpathogenic in bats raising questions about host response differences that might exist between bats and other mammals. Tetherin is a restriction factor which inhibits the release of a diverse range of viruses from host cells, including retroviruses, coronaviruses, filoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, some of which are deadly to humans and transmitted by bats. Here we characterise the tetherin genes from 27 species of bats, revealing that they have evolved under strong selective pressure, and that fruit bats and vesper bats express unique structural variants of the tetherin protein. Tetherin was widely and variably expressed across fruit bat tissue-types and upregulated in spleen tissue when stimulated with Toll-like receptor agonists. The expression of two computationally predicted splice isoforms of fruit bat tetherin was verified. We identified an additional third unique splice isoform which includes a C-terminal region that is not homologous to known mammalian tetherin variants but was functionally capable of restricting the release of filoviral particles. We also report that vesper bats possess and express at least five tetherin genes, including structural variants, a greater number than any other mammal reported to date. These findings support the hypothesis of differential antiviral gene evolution in bats relative to other mammals.","Hayward, Joshua A.; Tachedjian, Mary; Johnson, Adam; Irving, Aaron T.; Gordon, Tamsin B.; Cui, Jie; Nicolas, Alexis; Smith, Ina; Boyd, Vicky; Marsh, Glenn A.; Baker, Michelle L.; Wang, Lin-Fa; Tachedjian, Gilda",bioRxiv,534,26

In late February and March 2020, the number of people requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation has soared, putting a strain on the Italian health system. In the absence of pharmaceuticals therapies, the government implemented a set of mobility restrictions for transmission containment. Starting from the need of predicting hospitalization and ICU rates for the Umbria region in Italy, we propose the application of a computational framework to model the epidemic and analyze the effects of the imposed lock-down. We calibrate a compartmental model of COVID-19 clinical progression using a Bayesian method called Conditional Robust Calibration (CRC) against the daily epidemiological data. Then, we perform a robustness analysis on the calibrated model, in order to quantify the influence of model parameters on the hospital capacity and to draw possible scenarios of different containment measures. CRC confirms the hypothesis of underestimation of new positive cases and highlights how identifying presymptomatic transmission is crucial for reducing the contagion. Moreover, our results show the central importance of the lock-down timeliness and intensity, in order to curb the contagion and avoid a relapse.","Antonini, C.; Calandrini, S.; Stracci, F.; Dario, C.; Bianconi, F.; Ieee,",2020 Ieee 20th International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering,534,1

These circumstances are leading to unintended effects such as the increase in the burden of other diseases. Here, using a data-driven epidemiological model for Tuberculosis (TB) spreading, we describe the expected rise in TB incidence and mortality that can be attributable to the impact of COVID-19 on TB surveillance and treatment in four high-burden countries. Our calculations show that the reduction in the diagnosis of new TB cases due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in 824250 (CI 702416-940873) excess deaths in India, 288064 (CI 245932-343311) in Indonesia, 145872 (CI 120734-171542) in Pakistan, and 37603 (CI 27852-52411) in Kenya.

Adopted coping mechanisms may have played a significant role in surmounting the challenges related to the pandemic. The main aim of the survey is to evaluate the prevalence of depression, its determinants, and association with coping mechanisms among college students during COVID-19 lockdown. Materials and Methods: College students were invited during lockdown to participate in a nationwide cross-sectional e-survey using Snowball sampling technique (dated October 6th–30th, 2020). A total sample size of 920 was calculated. A self-administered questionnaire regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related experiences along with two scales (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9], and Carver Brief-Coping Orientation to the Problem Experienced -28) for assessment of depression and adopted coping mechanisms was applied to participants. Chi-square test, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used to investigate the determinants of depression and its association with coping mechanisms in college students. Results: On analysis of 884 qualified participants, it was revealed that 402 (45.5%) participants have depressive symptoms ranging from moderate to severe level. The mean score of PHQ-9 was 9.82 ± 6.61. Nearly 85% students were lagging behind in studies. Around 5%–10% of students initiated/increased the consumption of substances. The main determinants of depression in this study were age group of 21–24 years, thought of lagging behind in studies and family members/friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19. Adaptive coping mechanisms (emotional support, religion, and humor) were significantly associated with lower depressive symptoms and maladaptive coping mechanisms (self-distraction, denial, behavioral disengagement, and venting) were significantly associated with higher depressive symptoms among students. Conclusions: This survey revealed multiple determinants of depression, mainly including academic worries among college students. The college staff should provide a well-structured pedagogical framework to encourage them and alleviate the unpleasant psychological effects of pandemic on students.","Garg, Sunny Chauhan Alka Verma Dinesh Chaudhary Karishma Singh Sanjeet Bansal Kirti",Acta Medica International,534,1

NETs have emerged as critical mediators of lung damage, inflammation and thrombosis in COVID-19 and other diseases, but there are no therapeutics to prevent or reduce NETs that are available to patients. Here, we show that neutrophils isolated from hospitalised patients with COVID-19 produce significantly more NETs in response to LPS compared to cells from healthy control subjects. A subset of patients were captured at follow-up clinics (3-4 month post-infection) and while LPS-induced NET formation is significantly lower at this time point, it remains elevated compared to healthy controls. LPS- and PMA-induced NETs were significantly inhibited by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor ruboxistaurin. Ruboxistaurin-mediated inhibition of NETs in healthy neutrophils reduces NET-induced epithelial cell death. Our findings suggest ruboxistaurin could reduce proinflammatory and tissue-damaging consequences of neutrophils during disease, and since it has completed phase III trials for other indications without safety concerns, it is a promising and novel therapeutic strategy for COVID-19.","Dowey, R.; Cole, J.; Thompson, A.

In our approach, situational awareness is achieved by integrating and analyzing multiple aspects of data using stacked bar graphs and geographic representations of the data. We provide a data visualization tool to represent COVID pandemic data on top of the geographical information. The combination of geospatial and temporal data provides the information needed to conduct situational analysis for the COVTD-19 pandemic. By providing interactivity, geographical maps can be viewed from different perspectives and offer insight into the dynamical aspects of the COVTD-19 pandemic for the fifty states in the USA. We have overlaid dynamic information on top of a geographical representation in an intuitive way for decision making. We describe how modeling and simulation of data increase situational awareness, especially when coupled with immersive virtual reality interaction.

Podcasting is a well-established digital communication platform utilised daily in a myriad of capacities, including education. A group of medical students were tasked with creating their own educational podcasts covering specific aspects of psychiatry.ObjectivesEach pair was set a sub-topic of psychiatry and utilised software to produce educational resources. The objective of this project was to reflect upon production as well as explore the efficacy of podcasting as a tool within undergraduate training.MethodsThe medical students conducted research and contacted experts within the field to contribute to their podcasts. The majority of the students then conducted reviews of the literature surrounding podcasting within medical education, which informed the production of their own podcasts. From this, it was discussed how this project could impact future practice, and indicated that podcasts may become crucial asynchronous learning tools in medical education.ResultsLiterature review and first-hand experience of podcast production enabled the students to appreciate the advantages of podcasting and the potential for its widespread future applications. Their wider reading revealed that podcast-using study participants outperformed or matched their peers in assessments, and overwhelmingly enjoyed using podcasts over traditional teaching methods.ConclusionsThe use of podcasting can complement traditional psychiatry training and appeal to a generation of digital natives that prefer this learning style. Podcast production is also an excellent revision method, highlighting the advantages of peer-to-peer education in both learning and increasing engagement with psychiatry.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Rahman, J.; Charalambous, A.; Aled, L.; Leonard, X.; Parsons, C.; Cole, G.; Sharma, G.; Skuse, K.; Tran, M.",European Psychiatry,534,1

WHO has recommended a cumulative engagement of minimum 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Maintaining physical activity throughout life is considered an important public health objective. However, there is a global trend towards engaging in sedentary behaviours. There is no previous work on the physical activity pattern in Eastern India, nor any study to find predictors in terms of non-communicable disease causation. Objectives: To find out the prevalence and patterns of physical activity in urban population. To investigate the relationship of non-communicable disease with physical inactivity. Materials and methods: The study was community based cross-sectional survey and systematic random sampling method was used for arriving at a total sample of 1203 subjects from the 30 clusters selected out of 67 wards in the city. Socio-demographic and health profile were collected along with physical activity using IPAQ score, and stage of change for physical activity behaviour using Prochaska and DiClemente's model. IBM SPSS 20.0 was used for analysis. Logistic regression analyses were used to compute adjusted odds ratios for each variable. Causality of chronic disease due to physical inactivity was tested through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using marginal structural model (MSM). Statistical significance were tested at p=0.05. Results: A total of 1221 subjects were included in the study, and a total 1125 cases were included for analysis after data cleaning. Mean age of the study participants was 35.25 (SD 10.72) years. 71.9% of the respondents were found physically inactive, 15.9% practised 'yogasana'. General caste, presence of chronic disease, being in a static stage of change and a yogassana practitioner were all factors influencing physical activity positively. Physically inactive individuals were also found to have 1.54 times higher odds of having chronic disease than those who are physically active. Conclusion: Prevalence of physical activity among the smart city was found to be low. Physical activity was found be a causative factor for chronic diseases among the population.","Mohanty, S.; Sahoo, J.; Epari, V.; Shankar, G. G.; Panigrahi, S. K.",,534,8

Objective: The current study conducted to explore the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 patients, fatality of this disease and its mortality risk factors in major hospitals affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS). Methods: The data were collected in four major teaching hospitals affiliated with TUMS for all the patients that were admitted between Feb 19th and Apr 15th 2020 and were diagnosed as COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), clinical diagnosis and/or lung computed tomography (CT) scan. The case fatality rate of the disease was estimated by age, sex, symptoms, comorbidities, and type of diagnosis. Logistic regression model was used to examine the associations between different factors and in-hospital deaths. Results: By Apr 15th 2020, a total of 4377 patients were admitted with COVID-19 diagnosis in four selected hospitals and 496 (11.3%) of these patients died in hospital. The case fatality rate of this disease was 28.8% in the ≥80-year age group, which was the highest compared to the other age groups. The case fatality rates were 12.5% and 9.8% among men and women, respectively. The results of multiple logistic regression on the outcome of death indicated that age, sex, cough, myalgia, reduced consciousness at arrival and past history of cancer were significantly associated with in-hospital death. Adjusting the effect of other variables, for each 10-year increase in age, the odds of death due to COVID-19 was 1.61 times greater (adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.51 to 1.72, p<0.001). Conclusions: Older age, the male gender, past history of comorbidities (particularly cancer) and reduced consciousness at arrival are among the factors that can significantly increase the odds of in-hospital death in COVID 19 patients. These factors might be helpful in detecting and managing patients with poorer prognosis. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Baigi, V.; Nedjat, S.; Yunesian, M.; Sari, A.

The study objectives were to assess the factors associated with vaccine coverage and determine vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARSCoV2 infection in a healthcare worker (HCW) population. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted among HCW working at a public secondary hospital in Kuwait. The follow-up period was from 24 December 2020 to 15 June 2021. The primary outcomes were vaccine coverage and PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for the VE analysis. Data on new SARS-CoV-2 infections (with or without symptoms) during study period in addition to HCWs characteristics (sex, age, nationality, and occupation) were extracted from the hospital records. The vaccine coverage and PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were cross-tabulated by the HCWs characteristics. Furthermore, we used Cox regression to estimate time to infection hazard ratios in vaccinated (first and second dose) compared to unvaccinated HCWs. Only one ChAdOx1 dose was given during the study period. Results: There were 3246 HCWs included in the analysis. The median age was 38 years (IQR = 33 - 44), 63.4% were females, 46.8% aged 31 - 40, and 82.3% were non-Kuwaitis. Overall, 82.1% of HCWs received at least one vaccine dose (50.4% received only one dose of ChAdOx1, 3.3% received one dose of BNT162b2, and 28.3% received two doses of BNT162b2). 17.9% of HCWs remained unvaccinated by the end of the study. A significantly lower vaccination coverage percentage was amongst female HCWs, younger age group (20 - 30 years old), and administrative/executive staff. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed infection prevalence was 7.3%. No asymptomatic infections were reported. The SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rate was 126 per 100,000 person-days in the unvaccinated group; the incidence rates in partially vaccinated groups ([≥] 28 days after ChAdOx1 first dose) and ([≥] 14 days after receiving BNT162b2 through receipt of second dose) were 31.4 and 10.9 per 100,000 person-days, respectively. In the fully vaccinated group ([≥] 14 days after BNT162b2 second dose), the incidence rate was 6.3 per 100,000 person-days. The estimated adjusted vaccine effectiveness of fully vaccinated was 94.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89.4%-97.2%). The VE of partially vaccinated for ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 was 75.4% (95% CI = 67.2%-81.6%) and 91.4% (95% CI = 65.1% - 97.9%), respectively. Conclusions: Both BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines prevented most symptomatic infections in this population across age groups, nationalities, and occupations. A significant proportion (17.9%) of HCWs were unvaccinated despite the vaccine accessibility. The findings complement other VE studies and demonstrate the vaccine benefit for HCWs.","Alali, W.

To date, there are no treatments available to slow or prevent the disease. Hence, it remains essential to identify molecular factors that promote muscle biogenesis since they could serve as therapeutic targets for treating DMD. While the muscle enriched microRNA, miR-133b, has been implicated in the biogenesis of muscle fibers, its role in DMD remains unknown. To assess the role of miR-133b in DMD-affected skeletal muscles, we genetically ablated miR-133b in the mdx mouse model of DMD. In the absence of miR-133b, the tibialis anterior muscle of juvenile and adult mdx mice is populated by small muscle fibers with centralized nuclei, exhibits increased fibrosis, and thickened interstitial space. Additional analysis revealed that loss of miR-133b exacerbates DMD-pathogenesis partly by altering the number of satellite cells and levels of protein-encoding genes, including previously identified miR-133b targets as well as genes involved in cell proliferation and fibrosis. Altogether, our data demonstrate that skeletal muscles utilize miR-133b to mitigate the deleterious effects of DMD.","Taetzsch, Thomas; Shapiro, Dillon; Eldosougi, Randa; Myers, Tracey; Settlage, Robert; Valdez, Gregorio",bioRxiv,534,13

Hypertension is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. In South Africa, the government has employed a whole systems approach to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. We used a novel incident care cascade approach to measure changes in the South African health system's ability to manage hypertension between 2008 and 2017. Methods. We used data from Waves 1-5 of the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) to estimate trends in the hypertension care cascade and unmet treatment need across four successive cohorts with incident hypertension. We used a negative binomial regression to identify factors that may predict higher rates of hypertension control, controlling for socio-demographic and healthcare factors. The largest cascade attrition occurred prior to diagnosis. Results. In 2011, 19.6% (95%CI 14.2, 26.2) of individuals with incident hypertension were diagnosed, 15.4% (95% CI 10.8, 21.4) were on treatment and 7.1% had controlled blood pressure. By 2017, the proportion of individuals with diagnosed incident hypertension had increased to 24.4% (95% CI 15.9, 35.4) with increases in treatment (23.3%, 95% CI 15.0, 34.3) and control (22.1%, 95% CI 14.1, 33.0) were also observed, translating to a decrease in unmet need from 92.9% in 2011 to 77.9% in 2017. Multivariable regression showed that participants with incident hypertension in 2017 were 3.01 (95% CI 1.77, 5.13) times more likely to have a controlled blood pressure compared to those in 2011. Conclusions. The proportion of people with incident hypertension who successfully progressed to controlled blood pressure tripled between 2011 and 2017 in South Africa. Despite these improvements, a low absolute proportion of the population were able to control their blood pressure and a high burden of unmet need remains.","Benade, M.; Prasad, S.

We identified three themes from interviews: (1) visual elements, such as color and simple graphics, enable participants to interpret, relate to, and contextualize their polygenic score, (2) word-based descriptions of risk and polygenic scores presented as percentiles were most often recognized and understood, (3) participants had varying levels of interest in understanding complex genomic information and therefore would benefit from additional resources that can adapt to their individual needs in real time. In response to user feedback, colors used for communicating risk were modified to minimize unintended color associations and odds ratios were removed. Of note, all 10 participants expressed interest in receiving this report based on their personal genomic information. Conclusions: Our findings describe a generalizable approach to develop and test a polygenic score disclosure tool that is desired by the general public. These results are likely to inform ongoing efforts related to polygenic score disclosure within clinical practice.","Brockman, D. G.; Petronio, L.; Dron, J. S.; Kwon, B.

We analyzed the effect of IFITMs on the gamma2-herpesviruses Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and the closely related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV). We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout to generate A549, human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with combined IFITM1/2/3 knockout and identified IFITMs as cell type-dependent inhibitors of KSHV and RRV infection in A549 and HFF but not HUVEC. IFITM overexpression revealed IFITM1 as the relevant IFITM that inhibits KSHV and RRV infection. Fluorescent KSHV particles did not pronouncedly colocalize with IFITM-positive compartments. However, we found that KSHV and RRV glycoprotein-mediated cell-cell fusion is enhanced upon IFITM1/2/3 knockout. Taken together, we identified IFITM1 as a cell type-dependent restriction factor of KSHV and RRV that acts at the level of membrane fusion. Strikingly, we observed that the endotheliotropic KSHV circumvents IFITM-mediated restriction in HUVEC despite high IFITM expression, while influenza A virus (IAV) glycoprotein-driven entry into HUVEC is potently restricted by IFITMs even in the absence of interferon. IMPORTANCE IFITM proteins are the first line of defense against infection by many pathogens, which may also have therapeutic importance, as they, among other effectors, mediate the antiviral effect of interferons. Neither their function against herpesviruses nor their mechanism of action are well understood. We report here that in some cells, but not in, for example, primary umbilical vein endothelial cells, IFITM1 restricts KSHV and RRV, and that, mechanistically, this is likely effected by reducing the fusogenicity of the cell membrane. Further, we demonstrate potent inhibition of IAV glycoprotein-driven infection of cells of extrapulmonary origin by high constitutive IFITM expression.","Hörnich, Bojan F.; Großkopf, Anna K.; Dcosta, Candice J.; Schlagowski, Sarah; Hahn, Alexander S.",bioRxiv,534,27

Biological sequence comparison is an important HPC application that compares sequences in search of similarities. MASA-OpenMP is a highly optimized sequence comparison tool that obtains optimal results. Yet, it can take a long time, depending on the number of sequences compared and their lengths. The Covid-19 pandemic study is of particular interest nowadays, and the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 sequences is crucial to understanding this disease. In this paper, we compare SARS-CoV-2 sequences with MASA-OpenMP in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), using both spot and on-demand instances. To efficiently execute a MASA-OpenMP application composed of more than 22, 000 tasks on EC2 respecting a given deadline, we propose an execution modeling for MASA-OpenMP on top of the Burst-HADS framework. Burst-HADS is a spot instance-based dynamic scheduler for Bag-of-Tasks applications in the cloud, which minimizes both execution time and financial costs regarding a given deadline even in the presence of spot interruptions. Performance results reveal that, by using spots, our Burst-HADS strategy considerably reduces the monetary cost for executing 22, 600 SARS-CoV-2 sequence comparisons with MASA-OpenMP when contrasted to the on-demand only approach. We also show that our strategy can meet the deadlines, even in scenarios with several spot interruptions. © 2021 IEEE.","Teylo, L.; Nunes, A. L.; Melo, A. C. M. A.; Boeres, C.; De A. Drummond, L.

Of course, credit cards are a dominant way of doing business online. The credit card fraud detection problem has become relevant more than ever as the losses due to fraud accumulate. Most research on this topic takes an isolated, focused view of the problem, typically concentrating on tuning the data mining models. We noticed a significant gap between the academic research findings and the rightfully conservative businesses, which are careful when adopting new, especially black-box, models. In this paper, we took a broader perspective and considered this problem from both the academic and the business angle: we detected challenges in the fraud detection problem such as feature engineering and unbalanced datasets and distinguished between more and less lucrative areas to invest in when upgrading fraud detection systems. Our findings are based on the real-world data of CNP (card not present) fraud transactions, which are a dominant type of fraud transactions. Data were provided by our industrial partner, an international cardprocessing company. We tested different data mining models and approaches to the outlined challenges and compared them to their existing production systems to trace a cost-effective fraud detection system upgrade path. © 2021 by the authors.","Mekterović, I.; Karan, M.; Pintar, D.; Brkić, L.",Applied Sciences (Switzerland),534,16

For viruses, such as Zika virus (ZIKV), where the viremia clears quickly, antibody-based (IgM or IgG) diagnostics are recommended for patients who present seven days after symptom onset. However, cross-reactive antibody responses can complicate test interpretation among populations where closely related viruses circulate. We examined the accuracy (proportion of samples correctly categorized as Zika-positive or negative) for antibody-based diagnostics among Brazilian residents (Rio de Janeiro) during the ZIKV outbreak. Four ZIKV ELISAs (IgM and IgG Euroimmun, IgM Novagnost and CDC MAC), two dengue ELISAs (IgM and IgG Panbio), and the ZIKV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) were evaluated. Positive samples were ZIKV PCR confirmed clinical cases collected in 2015-2016 (n=169); Negative samples (n=236) were collected before ZIKV was present in Brazil (≤2013). Among serum samples collected ≥7 days from symptom onset, PRNT exhibited the highest accuracy (93.7%), followed by the Euroimmun IgG ELISA (77.9%). All IgM assays exhibited lower accuracy (<74%). IgG was detected more consistently than IgM among ZIKV cases using Euroimmun ELISAs (68% versus 22%). Anti-DENV IgM ELISA was positive in 41.1% of confirmed ZIKV samples tested. The Euroimmun IgG assay, although misdiagnosing 22% of samples, provided the most accurate ELISA. Anti-ZIKV IgG was detected more reliably than IgM among ZIKV patients, suggesting a secondary antibody response to assay antigens following ZIKV infection. Antibody ELISAs need careful evaluation in their target population to optimise use and minimise misdiagnosis, prior to widespread deployment, particularly where related viruses co-circulate.","Medialdea-Carrera, Raquel; Levy, Flavia; Castanha, Priscila; de Sequeira, Patricia Carvalho; Brasil, Patricia; Lewis-Ximenez, Lia L; Turtle, Lance; Solomon, Tom; de Filippis, Ana Maria Bispo; Brown, David W.; Griffiths, Michael J.",bioRxiv,534,7

Hence, the tracking of viral evolutionary trajectories is clearly of great importance. Little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolution in nonhuman primate models used to test vaccines and therapies and to model human disease. Viral RNA was sequenced from rectal swabs from Chlorocebus aethiops (African green monkeys) after experimental respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection. Two distinct patterns of viral evolution were identified that were shared between all collected samples. First, mutations in the furin cleavage site that were initially present in the virus as a consequence of VeroE6 cell culture adaptation were subsequently lost in virus recovered in rectal swabs, confirming the necessity of this motif for viral infection in vivo. Three amino acid changes were also identified; ORF 1a S2103F, and spike D215G and H655Y, that were detected in rectal swabs from all sampled animals. These findings are demonstrative of intra-host SARS-CoV-2 evolution unique to this nonhuman primate species and may identify a host-adapted variant of SARS-CoV-2 that would be useful in future development of primate disease models.","Rowe, Lori A.; Beddingfield, Brandon J.; Goff, Kelly; Killeen, Stephanie Z.; Chirichella, Nicole R.; Melton, Alexandra; Roy, Chad J.; Maness, Nicholas J.",bioRxiv,534,24

Polymorphisms in the S protein can affect cleavage, viral transmission, and pathogenesis. Here, we investigated the role of arising S polymorphisms in vitro and in vivo to understand the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. First, we showed that the S:655Y is selected after in vivo replication in the mink model. This mutation is present in the Gamma Variant Of Concern (VOC) but it also occurred sporadically in early SARS-CoV-2 human isolates. To better understand the impact of this polymorphism, we analyzed the in vitro properties of a panel of SARS-CoV-2 isolates containing S:655Y in different lineage backgrounds. Results demonstrated that this mutation enhances viral replication and spike protein cleavage. Viral competition experiments using hamsters infected with WA1 and WA1-655Y isolates showed that the variant with 655Y became dominant in both direct infected and direct contact animals. Finally, we investigated the cleavage efficiency and fusogenic properties of the spike protein of selected VOCs containing different mutations in their spike proteins. Results showed that all VOCs have evolved to acquire an increased spike cleavage and fusogenic capacity despite having different sets of mutations in the S protein. Our study demonstrates that the S:655Y is an important adaptative mutation that increases viral cell entry, transmission, and host susceptibility. Moreover, SARS-COV-2 VOCs showed a convergent evolution that promotes the S protein processing.","Escalera, Alba; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S.; Aslam, Sadaf; Mena, Ignacio; Pearl, Rebecca L.; Laporte, Manon; Fossati, Andrea; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Alshammary, Hala; van de Guchte, Adriana; Bouhaddou, Mehdi; Kehrer, Thomas; Zuliani-Alvarez, Lorena; Meekins, David A.; Balaraman, Velmurugan; McDowell, Chester; Richt, Jürgen A.; Bajic, Goran; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Krogan, Nevan; Simon, Viviana; Albrecht, Randy A.; van Bakel, Harm; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Aydillo, Teresa",bioRxiv,534,10

This is a challenge for culturally diverse communities as groups may have different informational needs and information-seeking behaviours. In this paper we present the frequency of information sources for COVID-19 in a culturally diverse area of Sydney, Australia. Methods: This study reports findings from two surveys. The first recruited participants across 10 languages between March 21 and July 9, 2021. The second provides a point of reference, and was an Australian, nationally-representative sample of English-speaking participants between November 4 and 18, 2020. Results: For the survey in culturally and linguistically diverse communities, of 708 participants, mean age was 45.4 years (SE 0.78), and 51% of respondents were female. Across all language groups, 54.7% of participants used Australian official or public broadcasters to find out about COVID-19 (n=421). Australian commercial information sources (54.1%, n=417), social media (51.6%, n=397), and family and friends in Australia (32.7%, n=252) were common sources. Patterns varied substantially across language groups. In the nationally representative survey (n=2313), 67% of participants (n=1540) used Australian official or public broadcasters, with lower proportions for social media (31.9%, n=738) and friends, family or other personal sources (23.1%; n=533). Conclusion: Almost 50% of participants from culturally and linguistically diverse communities did not report using Australian official or public broadcaster as main sources of information. Instead Australian commercial information sources, friends and family, overseas sources and social media were common. Though a crude comparison of the two datasets, this data can guide policy decisions for communication to different community groups. Further analysis is needed to interpret this data. Better understanding of how diverse communities seek and receive COVID-19 health information is imperative as we manage the current COVID-19 outbreak in the Sydney region.","Ayre, J.; Muscat, D.

To achieve secure and reliable identity verification in eLearning exams, it has been suggested to employ face recognition technologies for remote student authentication in online examinations. However, novel attacks on face recognition in eLearning systems have rarely been considered in the scientific literature.In this work, we investigate the feasibility of so-called face morphing attacks in eLearning systems. Such attacks can be launched in scenarios where students are authenticated via identity documents containing face images that are remotely presented prior to online examinations. In this relevant scenario, students are able to fool human examination and automated face recognition by morphing their face image with that of an accomplice, e.g. fellow student. Resulting morphed face images contain biometric information of both subjects contributing to it. Consequentially, an accomplice could take part in an online examination for a student with high probability of passing an identity verification unnoticed. We assess the vulnerability of a commercial and an open-source face recognition system to said attack. To this end, a realistic dataset of morphing attacks is collected. It is shown that automated face recognition in eLearning systems can be tricked with alarmingly high success chance. © 2021 IEEE.","Rathgeb, C.; Poppelmann, K.; Busch, C.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",534,1

An ensemble of LASSO logistic regression models was used to identify the most informative Boolean features with respect to the genetic bases of severity. The Boolean features selected by these logistic models were combined into an Integrated PolyGenic Score that offers a synthetic and interpretable index for describing the contribution of host genetics in COVID-19 severity, as demonstrated through testing in several independent cohorts. Selected features belong to ultra-rare, rare, low-frequency, and common variants, including those in linkage disequilibrium with known GWAS loci. Noteworthly, around one quarter of the selected genes are sex-specific. Pathway analysis of the selected genes associated with COVID-19 severity reflected the multi-organ nature of the disease.

We address this question and present a Bayesian quantile analysis of public opinion using a nationally representative survey data from the United States. We find that previous participation in online courses and full-time employment status favor the educational value of online courses. We also find that the older demographic and females have a greater propensity for online education.

Descriptive statistics was used for demographic, clinical data, drug exposure, adverse events (AEs) and events of special interest (ESI). Results: Until 31.10.2020, 1173 JIA patients were reported to have received Adalimumab. 352 treatments have been started after January 1, 2017. A biosimilar was used first line in 44 patients. Further 55 patients switched for the originator to a biosimilar. 2 patient switched from a biosimilar to the originator. 3 patients switched to a second biosimilar while 5 patients who switched from the originator to a biosimilar reswitched back to the originator. After 2017, 33 pediatric rheumatology centres reported initiation of Adalimumab treatment. 17 have used a biosimilar. 15 centres have swichted at least 1 patient from the originator to a biosimilar and 14 have used first line a biosimilar in at least 1 patient. In a single centre, initiation of a biosimilar was used more frequently (8 versus 7). The patients' characteristics and disease activity parameters were brightly comparable. The JIA category rheumatoid factor (RF) negative polyarthritis was less frequent in the biosimilar first cohort while RF positive polyarthritis and psoriatic arthritis was more frequent. In patients with idiopathic uveitis the originator was used more often. In the switching cohort, more patients had RF negative polyarthritis, persistent oligoarthritis but less had psoriatic arthritis and no had RF positive polyarthritis. No difference in disease activity parameters between patients receiving the originator or biosimilars were noted, neither at baseline, during the course of treatment nor at last observation upon treatment (Figure 1). At the time of switching, 46 (92%) had JADAS minimal disease activity (MDA) and 30 (69%) were in JASDAS remission. At last observation, those numbers were comparable with 42 (86%) with JADAS MDA and 28 (57%) with JADAS remission. In total, 45 adverse events (AE) were reported in 45 patients upon biosimilar treatment. 26 patients had 1, 12 patients had 2 and 6 patients reported 3 and 1 reported 4 events. Adverse event of special interest were Infection associated leukopenia (n=1), COVID 19 infection (n=1), Uveitis flare (n=8), other disease deterioration (arthritis flare) (n=20), injection site reaction n=2. A single serious AE was reported. A 16 year old female adolescent was admitted for unexpected CK elevation. In 10 patients, Adalimumab was discontinued, in 2 it was temporarily paused. Conclusion: This article is the first attempt to present a large sample of data on JIA patients exposed to Adalimumab biosimilars. Since approval of Adalimumab-Biosimilars, limited experience from clinical practice is available. Biosimilars are used in a minority of patients and by a minority of centers although no difference in efficacy or safety was noted from our analysis.","Horneff, G.; Dressler, F.; Rühlmann, M.; Geikowski, T.; Mrusek, S.; Klein, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,534,16

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Indonesian families face three significant problems: distanced-family relations;neglected family education;and unequal socio-economic situation. This paper aims at explaining these three fundamental changes in family institutions. Besides, this paper identifies the factors that lead to family dysfunction. This article also offers concrete solutions to restore the lose of families function due to the COVID-19, i.e. the formation of a Family Corner. This research is a normative study using a critical, descriptive analysis method by presenting data from various literature and document sources. The latest data supported by several recent studies are described in detail in this paper. This research shows that post-pandemic family functions' revitalization can be started by preparing a strong husband and wife's emotional maturity. In addition, it is necessary to assist in communication and financial management of the family. Furthermore, revitalization will be successful if job opportunities are opened as widely as possible with incentive funds from the government and philanthropic institutions. Finally, the resolution and anticipation of natural disasters can be anticipated and resolved as quickly as possible. One of the effective ways for family revitalization is by establishing a family corner at each smallest unit of the society. Further research on this issue can be conducted through interviews with some informants who have experienced changes family lifestyle during the COVID-19 pandemic and mapping their hopes post pandemic period. © 2021 Samarah.

The temporal information buried in EHRs are often underutilized in developing computational phenotypic definitions. The objective of this study is to develop a high-throughput phenotyping method, leveraging temporal sequential patterns of discrete events from electronic health records. Materials and Methods We develop a representation mining algorithm to extract five classes of representations from EHR diagnosis and medication records: the aggregated vector of the records (AVR), the traditional immediate sequential patterns (SPM), the transitive sequential patterns (tSPM), as well as two hybrid classes of SPM+AVR and tSPM+AVR. A final small set of representations were selected from each class using the MSMR dimensionality reduction algorithm. Using EHR data on 10 phenotypes from Mass General Brigham Biobank, we trained regularized logistic regression algorithms, which we validated using labeled data. Results Phenotyping with temporal sequences resulted in a superior classification performance across all 10 phenotypes compared with the AVR representations that are conventionally used in electronic phenotyping. Although this study only utilizes the diagnosis and medication records, the high-throughput algorithm’s classification performance was superior or similar to the performance of previously published electronic phenotyping algorithms. We characterize and evaluate the top transitive sequences of diagnosis records paired with the records of risk factors, symptoms, complications, medications, or vaccinations. Discussion The proposed high-throughput phenotyping approach enables seamless discovery of sequential record combinations that may be difficult to assume from raw EHR data. A transitive sequence can offer a more accurate characterization of the phenotype, compared with its individual components. Additionally, the identified transitive sequences of a given phenotype reflect the actual lived experiences of the patients with that particular disease. Conclusion Sequential data representations provide a precise mechanism for incorporating raw EHR records into downstream Machine Learning.","Estiri, Hossein; Strasser, Zachary H; Murphy, Shawn N.",bioRxiv,534,1

Most important determinants of this satisfaction include physical working conditions, social relationships, possibility of open and direct communication, etc. Shortcomings in this regard will be reflected in the quality of work performance. The COVID-19 Pandemic outbreak in 2020 has changed not only the life conditions of people, but also the work conditions of organizations. This paper focuses particularly on working from home. The risks that employees are exposed to and how teleworking will affect their job satisfaction is the subject of this article. This paper further presents an analysis of a new possible scope of teleworking, which could potentially reduce the job satisfaction of workers and will be contrasted to former research results. The research is fundamentally based on an extensive literature review by using databases, like Web of Science, SpringerLink, SCOPUS, Research Gate, Google Scholar, Bitkom Research, Google Search and Wiley Online Library. 34 studies employing quantitative, qualitative and mixed method designs have been included in the review. The method of qualitative content analysis as outlined by Mayring has been used to analyse the literature and interpret the findings. An elaboration of the theoretical basics targeted for the topic is required for achieving the goal of the paper. The increase of teleworking frequency has a positive influence on job satisfaction;however, it includes some negative aspects related to social and professional isolation and perceived threats in professional advancement.

It engages data obtained from various World Bank sources for 15 West African countries that are members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for the period 2000–2019. The study calculates inclusive growth using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and applies the Two-stage Least Squares (2SLS) to resolve the possible issue of endogeneity. The findings show, among others, that agricultural trade is significant in explaining the level of inclusive growth. It implies that a 1% increase in agricultural trade may increase inclusive growth by 0.88% (first stage) and 0.99% (second stage), respectively. In contrast, FDI is insignificant in explaining inclusive growth.

Of clinical interest, RIF1-depleted cells are highly sensitive to replication inhibitors such as Aphidicolin, but the reasons for this sensitivity have been enigmatic. Here we show that RIF1 must be present both during replication stress and in the ensuing recovery period to promote cell survival. RIF1 Long and Short isoforms are produced by alternative splicing. We find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is completely incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with its isoform-specific role in enabling survival, RIF1-Long is specifically required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages to support genome maintenance following replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a previously unsuspected but crucial role in damage site protection during the ensuing G1 phase.","Watts, Lotte P.; Natsume, Toyoaki; Saito, Yuichiro; Garzón, Javier; Kanemaki, Masato T.; Hiraga, Shin-ichiro; Donaldson, Anne D.",bioRxiv,534,1

An effective time-course strategy for the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines is crucial given that the global vaccine supply will still be limited in some countries/regions in the near future and that mutant strains have emerged and will continue to spread worldwide. Both asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission have played major roles in the COVID-19 pandemic, which can only be properly described as a typical non-Markovian process. However, the prioritization of vaccines in the non-Markovian framework still lacks sufficient research, and the underlying mechanism of the time-course vaccine allocation optimization has not yet been uncovered. In this paper, based on an age-stratified compartmental model calibrated through clinical and epidemiological data, we propose optimal vaccination strategies (OVS) through steady-state prediction in the non-Markovian framework. This OVS outperforms other empirical vaccine prioritization approaches in minimizing cumulative infections, cumulative deaths, or years of life lost caused by the pandemic. We found that there exists a fast decline in the prevention efficiency of vaccination if vaccines are solely administered to a selected age group, which indicates that the widely adopted strategy to continuously vaccinate high-risk group is not optimal. Through mathematical analysis of the model, we reveal that dynamic vaccine allocations to combinations of different age groups is necessary to achieve optimal vaccine prioritization. Our work not only provides meaningful references for vaccination in countries currently lacking vaccines and for vaccine allocation strategies to prevent mutant strains in the future, but also reveals the mechanism of dynamic vaccine allocation optimization, forming a theoretical and modelling framework empirically applicable to the optimal time-course prioritization.","Feng, M.; Tian, L.; Zhou, C.",,534,1

The patients have a range of mild to severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia, shock, and other organs involvement. Clinical and hematological evidence can serve as a prognostic factor to detect severe cases of COVID-19. Objectives: The present study aimed to evaluate hematological parameters related to the severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients in Mashhad, Eastern Iran. Patients and Methods: All the individuals with positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test results and the patients with clinical symptoms whose computed tomography scan results were matched with the diagnosis of viral pneumonia were included in the study. The hematological examinations and complete blood count of the patients were performed by the healthcare personnel through collecting blood samples at the time of admission and discharge from the hospital. Results: In total, 189 COVID-19 patients were included in the study, 47.6% and 58.73% of whom were over 60 years old and male, respectively. Investigation of the hematological parameters revealed that the number of white blood cells, mean value of corpuscular volume, number of platelets, and lymph count had significantly increased at the time of discharge (P &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and red cell distribution width values were significantly higher at the time of admission in comparison to discharge (P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, it was found that male gender had a significant relationship with the development of lymphopenia in the patients (P=0.021). Conclusion: It can be concluded that hematological parameters and inflammatory biomarkers in COVID-19 patients could potentially act as the independent factors and affect the prognosis of the disease.","Seddigh-Shamsi, M.; Mahali, S.

SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which is transmitted from animal to human and because of being contagious, further it transmitted human to human. Recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) as a global pandemic. But, no specific medications are available for the treatment of COVID-19 so far. As a corollary, there is a need for a potential vaccine to impede the progression of the disease. Lately, it has been documented that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for viral replication as well as interferes with host immune responses. We have comparatively analyzed the sequences of N protein of SARS-CoV-2 for the identification of core attributes and analyzed the ancestry through phylogenetic analysis. Subsequently, we have predicted the most immunogenic epitope for T-cell as well as B-cell. Importantly, our investigation mainly focused on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I potential peptides and NTASWFTAL interacted with most human leukocyte antigen (HLA) that are encoded by MHC class I molecules. Further, molecular docking analysis unveiled that NTASWFTAL possessed a greater affinity towards HLA and also available in a greater range of the population.

While a myriad number of reasons may be responsible for this situation, the absence of a mature legal framework as well as the scant availability of sufficiently trained government personnel to trace and recover stolen assets, hidden domestically and abroad, arguably remain contributory factors. Granted that corrupt public office holders are typically enabled by porous (domestic) legal frameworks that provide them wide escape routes for their crimes, contestably however, the laws bordering on confiscation of assets in many foreign countries (safe havens) seem intentionally designed to frustrate any recovery of stolen assets by developing countries. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the rate of stealing public assets by public office holders in developing countries is foreseen to rise astronomically and is likely to deepen their existing levels of poverty and hopelessness (Ayode, 2020).

Recent attempts to provide anticoronaviral functions have involved alternative compositions and architectures aimed at producing nanoscale compounds for highly effective anticoronaviral activities. However, translating the nanocompounds to the field requires considerable investment and time as well as actual trials;thus, they may not be a viable option for timely deployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. With these considerations in mind, we have used sodium chloride, which is generally recognized as safe (GRAS), to functionalize nonwoven sheets as frequently touched surfaces. Specifically, we produced nano-dry-salt (NDS) particles through Collison-type atomization and subsequent diffusion drying, and these NDS particles were finally deposited on electret meltblown nonwovens in a single-pass air flow. The resulting GRAS NDS deposited electret nonwovens were examined for effectiveness in anticoronaviral function and aerosol filtration with pressure drop. The treated nonwovens exhibited significant inactivation of airborne human coronaviruses (surrogates of SARS-CoV-2) while retaining the original filtration performance, even under saliva droplet and dust exposures. Several realizable platforms can thus be presented to quickly incorporate NDS deposition in conventional nonwoven production.","Park, D. H.; Choi, J.; Piri, A.; Hwang, J.; Byeon, J.

One of such type of advanced materials, Inconel 625 possesses superior materialistic properties and finds number of industrial applications in Aerospace, Marine, Petro-chemical and Solar power stations etc. However, machining and finishing of Inconel 625 components are still remain difficult tasks to deals with. A recently developed finishing process: Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) process has been experimented to finish Inconel 625 surfaces but this process is not much effective to finish and machine Inconel 625 work surfaces. In present work, Chemically assisted Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (CMAF) process has been experimented for simultaneous internal and external surface finishing of Inconel 625 tubes. An indigenous magnetic tool has been developed using Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets. Experiments have been designed by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Effect of five input process parameters i.e. processing time, surface rotational speed, weight percentage (Wt %age) of abrasives, chemical concentration and abrasive size on the material removal (MR) has been analyzed. Experimental Results proves that selected input process parameters have significant effect on material removal (MR). Material is uniformly removed from both internal and external surface of Inconel 625 tubes.

Surface plasmon resonance analysis allowed us to determine the kinetic constants of the VP3-dsRNA interaction as well as to map the VP3 dsRNA bipartite dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD), uncovering the specific role of the previously described Patch1 and Patch2 dsRB subdomains. Here we show that the Patch1 domain plays a primary binding function while Patch2 exerts a subordinate role stabilizing VP3-dsRNA complexes. The use of a set of VP3 mutant versions facilitated the identification of K99 and K106 within Patch1 as the essential residues for the formation of VP3-dsRNA complexes. Furthermore, replacement of either one of these two residues by aspartic acid completely thwarts both evasion from host’s sensors and virus replication. Data presented here allow us to propose a VP3-dsRNA interaction model that should help to further elucidate the mechanics of IBDV morphogenesis and genome packaging as well as to better understand how VP3 counteracts recognition of virus-encoded dsRNA by specialized host’s sensors.","Busnadiego, Idoia; Martín, Maria T; Ferrero, Diego S; de la Blanca, María G Millán; Broto, Laura; Díaz-Beneitez, Elisabeth; Fuentes, Daniel; Rodríguez, Dolores; Verdaguer, Nuria; Kremer, Leonor; Rodríguez, José F.",bioRxiv,534,16

The obesity prevalence is threefold higher in the Arab Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) population than the rest of the world and leaves healthcare providers within the region with no alternative than to offer continuous and sustainable healthcare services. Obesity prevention would be more economical for governments than providing treatment. Preventing obesity is challenging because it requires motivating individuals to live a healthy lifestyle. Personal health (pHealth) has recently been actively involved in finding solutions to encourage healthy living. However, pHealth does not address the high percentage of people lacking the desire to maintain healthy living plans, which could have a negative effect on attempts aimed at reducing obesity prevalence. This study sheds light on the challenges faced by the GCC governments in reducing high obesity rates using pHealth;we propose a solution, Wholesome Coin, which incorporates advanced technologies to help governments reduce high obesity rates. Wholesome Coin has two components: one uses wearable IoT (WIoT) to help patients manage their behavior by tracking their physical activities and diet, and the other utilizes blockchain technology to help healthcare payers to incentify patients to maintain a healthy living plan by awarding digital coins that can be redeemed for real goods and services. GCC governments' adoption of Wholesome Coin could improve the quality of life of obese patients in a seamless, secure, and self-motivated manner, resulting in a healthier tomorrow, especially amid challenging times featuring global social distance campaigns.","Alsalamah, H.

Despite its importance for public health, how these multilocus adaptations jointly evolve is poorly understood. Here we consider the joint evolution of two adaptations: the pathogen’s ability to escape the vaccine-induced immune response and adjustments to the pathogen’s virulence and transmissi-bility. We elucidate the role played by epistasis and recombination, with an emphasis on the different protective effects of vaccination. We show that vaccines reducing transmission and/or increasing clearance generate positive epistasis between the vaccine-escape and virulence alleles, favouring strains that carry both mutations, whereas vaccines reducing virulence mortality generate negative epistasis, favouring strains that carry either mutation, but not both. High rates of recombination can affect these predictions. If epistasis is positive, frequent recombination can lead to the sequential fixation of the two mutations and prevent the transient build-up of more virulent escape strains. If epistasis is negative, frequent recombination between loci can create an evolutionary bistability, such that whichever adaptation is more accessible tends to be favoured in the long-term. Our work provides a timely alternative to the variant-centered perspective on pathogen adaptation and captures the effect of different types of vaccines on the interference between multiple adaptive mutations.","McLeod, David V.; Gandon, Sylvain",bioRxiv,534,1

In such a context, this article describes and interprets two presidential speeches that announce the States of Exception based on conjunctural enemies' rise. This social problem is investigated from Critical Discourse Studies (Fairclough, 2013;O'Grady, 2019) and Systemic Functional Linguistics, particularly the appraisal system (Martin and White, 2005), together with the categories of legitimation proposed by van Leeuwen (2008). This research is positioned from a qualitative perspective (Flick, 2015) and takes as a corpus of analysis the two speeches declaring a State of Exception by President Pinera in 2019 and 2020, respectively. These speeches are available to the public at https://prensa.presidencia.cl/. The results show that an enemy is constructed in both cases by contrasting the actions taken or not, which present negative appreciation valuations in the case of COVID-19 and negative integrity judgments in the case of the social outbreak. In both cases, key social actors emerge that are firmly legitimized within the State of Exception framework, which in turn is based on the categories of authority and moral legitimation. In conclusion, the enemy's construction is identified in both cases with modification of the actors that interact through a problem, an action, and an agent that solves the problem constructed.","Echiburu, G.

It has also been identified in multiple screens for host proteins required for productive SARS-CoV2 infection. Because standard approaches to understand TMEM106B at the sequence level find no homology to other proteins, it has remained a protein of unknown function. Here, the standard tool PSI-BLAST was used in a non-standard way to show that the lumenal portion of TMEM106B is a member of the LEA-2 domain superfamily. The non-standard tools (HMMER, HHpred and trRosetta) extended this to predict two yeast LEA-2 proteins in the lumenal domains of the degradative vacuole, equivalent to the lysosome: one in Vac7, a regulator of PI(3,5)P2 production, and three in Tag1 which signals to terminate autophagy. Further analysis of previously unreported LEA-2 structures indicated that LEA-2 domains have a long, conserved lipid binding groove.

The ease of transmission of COVID-19 and its potential to kill older adults could affect older adults' Subjective Wellbeing (SWB). This study aimed to assess SWB, and investigate the risk factors associated with declined SWB in the elderly during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods & Materials In this cross-sectional study, a total of 400 older adults (age: >60 years) were studied from April 4 to June 20, 2020, in Mashhad City, Iran. In this study, the multistage sampling method was used. In the first stage, 5 healthcare networks were considered as 5 clusters. Next, from each healthcare network, one healthcare center was randomly selected and considered as a cluster. Then, to reach the desired number of samples, 80 subjects were randomly selected per healthcare center and entered into the study. After obtaining permission for entrance to the healthcare centers from the Vice-Chancellor of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, the researcher in charge of research referred to the healthcare centers;after obtaining permission from the center officials, the researcher collected the telephone numbers of the elderly from their records and completed the demographic and main questionnaire used by telephone for all study participants. The questionnaires were completed in June 2020. Each day, 20 elderly were examined;accordingly, except for the 10 days off in June 2020, the questionnaires were completed in the remaining 20 days of the month. The SWB of the elderly was assessed using the Persian version of The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS using descriptive statistics, Chi-squared, and logistic regression tests at the significance level of 0.05. Results The Mean +/- SD age of the study participants was 66.7 +/- 5.8 years. Of the total research participants, 224(56%) were females and 176(44%) were males. The mean +/- SD SWB scores in the explored elderly were 44.8 +/- 24.7. Furthermore, the SWB score in 285(71.2%) of the study sample was <50, indicating low an SWB. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between the SWB and contextual variables. Loneliness (OR=8.28, 95%CI: 4.79-14.31), chronic illness (OR=23.77, 95%CI: 13.42-42.08), isolation (OR=8.03, 95%CI: 3.72-17.30),and physical inactivity (OR=7.37, 95%CI: 2.98-18.18) predicted lower SWB in the study subjects. Conclusion The present research results indicated that the SWB of the examined elderly was undesirable concerning the COVID-19 crisis. Thus, to maintain and improve the SWB of older adults at times of major life events and threats, like the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of coping strategies should be considered.","Olyani, S.; Peyman, N.",Salmand-Iranian Journal of Ageing,534,5

Intensive interventions implemented since 2004 have reduced prevalence, but progress has stalled in recent years. A challenge for elimination has been malaria infections in residents acquired during travel to mainland Equatorial Guinea. We quantify how off-island contributes to remaining malaria prevalence on Bioko Island, and investigate the potential role of a pre-erythrocytic vaccine in making further progress towards elimination. Methods: We simulated malaria transmission on Bioko Island using a model calibrated based on data from the Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) from 2015-2018, including detailed travel histories and malaria positivity by rapid-diagnostic tests (RDTs), as well as geospatial estimates of malaria prevalence. Mosquito population density was adjusted to fit local transmission, conditional on importation rates under current levels of control and within-island mobility. We evaluated the impact of two pre-erythrocytic vaccine distribution strategies: mass treat and vaccinate, and prophylactic vaccination for off-island travelers. We propagated uncertainty through the model through an ensemble of simulations fit to the Bayesian joint posterior probability distribution of the geospatial prevalence estimates. Results: The simulations suggest that in Malabo, an urban city containing 80% of the population, there are some pockets of residual transmission, but a large proportion of prevalence is attributable to malaria importation by travelers. Outside of Malabo, prevalence was mainly attributable to local transmission. We assess the uncertainty in the local transmission vs. importation to be lowest within Malabo and highest outside. Using a pre-erythrocytic vaccine to protect travelers would have larger benefits than using the vaccine to protect residents of Bioko Island from local transmission. In simulations, mass treatment and vaccination had short-lived benefits, as malaria prevalence returned to current levels as the vaccine's efficacy waned. Prophylactic vaccination of travelers resulted in longer-lasting reductions in prevalence. These projections were robust to underlying uncertainty in prevalence estimates. Conclusions: The modeled outcomes suggest that the volume of malaria cases imported from the mainland is a partial driver of continued endemic malaria on Bioko Island, and that continued elimination efforts on must account for human travel activity.","Citron, D.

Methods: In September-October 2020 we interviewed adults with mental health conditions pre-dating the pandemic whom we had previously interviewed three months earlier. Participants had been recruited through online advertising and voluntary sector community organisations. Interviews were conducted by telephone or video-conference by researchers with lived experience of mental health difficulties and explored changes over time in experiences of participants of the pandemic. Results: We interviewed 44 people, achieving diversity of demographic characteristics and a range of mental health conditions and service use among our sample. Three overarching themes were derived from interviews. The first theme Spectrum of adaptation: to difficulties in access to, or the quality of, statutory mental health services, through developing new personal coping strategies or identifying alternative sources of support. The second theme is Accumulating pressures: from pandemic-related anxieties and sustained disruption to social contact and support, and to mental health treatment. The third theme Feeling overlooked: A sense of people with pre-existing mental health conditions being overlooked during the pandemic by policy-makers at all levels. The latter was compounded for people from ethnic minority communities or with physical health problems.

To date, no systematic reviews have been published on this topic. This systematic review aimed to summarize and highlight the frequency of bat infections reported in currently available observational studies for coronavirus. The purpose of this study was also to examine the differences between the pool prevalence by technique and country. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess coronavirus (CoV) infection in bats and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We carried out random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). In all, 824 articles were retrieved (1960-2021). After screening by abstract/title, 43 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 33 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From the total of studies, the pool prevalence by RT-PCR (n=14,295 bats) for CoV was 9.8% (95% CI 8.7-10.9%); Italy reported the highest pooled prevalence (44.9%, 95% CI 31.6-58.1%), followed by the Philippines (29.6%). Regarding the ELISA, the pool prevalence for coronavirus from 15 studies, including 359 bats, was 30.2% (95% CI 14.7-45.6%). The results for coronaviruses with the MIF were significantly lower, 2.6% (95% CI 1.5-3.7%). A considerable proportion of infected bats tested positive, particularly by molecular tests.

They underwent heart transplantation for ischaemic and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, respectively. After evaluation of donor hearts, we cryopreserved and stored two pulmonary valves for clinical application and one aortic valve for research. Light microscopy of myocardium, mitral valve and aortic and pulmonary arterial wall and RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test of myocardium, mitral and tricuspid valve and aortic wall for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were performed. Presence of ACE2 in tissues was assessed with immunostaining. Light microscopy revealed a mild eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, whereas enlarged cardiomyocytes with irregular nucleus and some with cytoplasmic vacuoles in the hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy heart. Aortic and pulmonary wall were histologically normal. Immunostaining revealed diffuse presence of ACE2 in the myocardium of the heart with eosinophilic myocarditis, but only discrete presence in the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart. The RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test showed no presence of the virus in tested tissues. Despite eosinophilic myocarditis in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart, no viral traces were found in the myocardium and valve tissues. However, ACE2 was present diffusely in the ischemic cardiomyopathy heart. SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the cardiac tissues of these COVID-19 asymptomatic heart donors. In our opinion, clinical application of the valves from these donors presents negligible risk for coronavirus transmission. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty regarding the risk of virus transmission with the human tissue transplantation, we would not release in any case the pulmonary valve recovered from the eosinophilic myocarditis heart. In contrast, we may consider the release of the pulmonary valve from the dilated cardiomyopathy heart only for a life-threatening situation when no other similar allograft were available.","Jashari, R; Van Esbroeck, M; Vanhaebost, J; Micalessi, I; Kerschen, A; Mastrobuoni, S",Cell tissue bank,534,16

This is because child welfare agencies serve some of the highest needs children and families. A significant proportion of these families face economic hardship, and as a result of containment measures for COVID-19, more families inevitably will. OBJECTIVE: Given the range of negative consequences related to the pandemic and the evolving supports available to families, child protection workers needed a clinical tool to guide and support work with families informed by an understanding of economic hardship. The objective of this paper is to report on the development and implementation strategy of a tool to be used for practice intervention during the pandemic. METHODS: Action research methodology was utilized in the creation of the clinical tool. The tool's development and implementation occurred through an academic/child welfare sector partnership involving child welfare agencies representing diverse regions and populations in Ontario, Canada. Factor analysis of representative child welfare data from the Ontario Incidence Study of Reported Child Abuse and Neglect 2018 (OIS-2018) on economic hardship was used to inform the development of questions on the clinical tool. RESULTS: The development and implementation strategy of the clinical tool are described, including the results from analyses of the OIS-2018.

All SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis in Zhoushan City were followed up for viral shedding in respiratory tract specimens and faecal samples. Positivity was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively by proper statistical approaches with strong testing power. Viral shedding in respiratory tract and faecal specimens was prolonged to 45 and 40 days after the last exposure, respectively. The overall positive rate in respiratory tract specimens was low and relatively unstable, being higher in the early-to-mid stage than in the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. Compared with respiratory tract specimens, faecal samples had a higher viral load, higher overall positive rate, and more stable positivity in different disease courses and varied symptomatic status. Faecal specimens have the potential ability to surpass respiratory tract specimens in virus detection. Testing of faecal specimens in diagnosis, especially for identifying asymptomatic carriers, is recommended. Simultaneously, testing respiratory tract specimens at the early-to-mid stage is better than testing at the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. A relatively small sample size was noted, and statistical approaches were used to address it. Information was missing for both specimen types at different stages of the disease course due to censored data. Our research extends the observed viral shedding in both specimen types and highlights the importance of faecal specimen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Healthcare workers, patients, and the general public may all benefit from our study findings. Disposal of sewage from hospitals and residential areas should be performed cautiously because the virus sheds in faeces and can last for a long time.","Yuan, Chen Wang HongLing Li KeFeng Tang An Dai YaXin Wu Bing Zhang Hui Chen JiaBei Liu JieNan Wu WenJie Gu SongYe Wang Hai Xu HaoDi Wu MingYu Yu MengLu Wang YuChao Yu XinWei He JiaLu Liu SheLan Zhang YongLi Tong ZhenDong Yan JianBo",PLoS ONE,534,30

Absent a vaccine, authorities have few other tools by which to mitigate further spread of the virus. This begs the question of how effective social policy really is at reducing new infections that, left alone, could potentially overwhelm the existing hospitalization capacity of many states. We developed a mathematical model that captures correlations between some state-level ""social distancing"" policies and infection kinetics for all U.S. states, and use it to illustrate the link between social policy decisions, disease dynamics, and an effective reproduction number that changes over time, for case studies of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Washington states.

While studies in homozygous Sox9 knockout mouse models confirmed that SOX9 is critical for testis development, mice heterozygous for the Sox9-null allele were reported to develop normal testes. This led to the belief that the SOX9 dosage requirement for testis differentiation is different between humans, which often require both alleles, and mice, in which one allele is sufficient. However, in prior studies, gonadal phenotypes in heterozygous Sox9 XY mice were assessed only by either gross morphology, histological staining or analyzed on a mixed genetic background. In this study, we conditionally inactivated Sox9 in somatic cells of developing gonads using the Nr5a1-Cre mouse line on a pure C57BL/6 genetic background. Section and whole-mount immunofluorescence for testicular and ovarian markers showed that XY Sox9 heterozygous gonads developed as ovotestes. Quantitative droplet digital PCR confirmed a 50% reduction of Sox9 mRNA as well as partial sex reversal shown by an upregulation of ovarian genes.

This comes with a drawback, since CoG has a non-linear response at the periphery of the detector due to the lack of weights beyond the detector. Detectors with multiplexed readout that are based on finely segmented scintillators and coarsely segmented photosensors are known to suffer from the so called edge effect where a pile-up of the reconstructed coordinates from the edge crystals is observed. This may lead to incorrect assignment of the events to crystal pixels and result in formation of erroneous lines of response causing a degradation of spatial resolution and reduction of image contrast. To overcome abovementioned limitations in gamma ray detectors with multiplexed photosensor readout, we propose to use modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity technique for calculation of gamma ray interaction position. Here the proposed method is applied to PET detectors with 24×24 LYSO crystals read out by 8 × 8 SiPM array with 64:16 row/column multiplexing. Furthermore, we compared the modified Gaussian Position Weighted Center of Gravity (PW-CoG) and Truncated Center of Gravity (TCoG) coordinate reconstruction methods. It was observed that both algorithms resolve peaks corresponding to events registered in the crystal pixels on the periphery of the crystal array, however peak-to-valley ratios and crystal resolvability metrics for PW-CoG algorithm are generally greater.","Poladyan, Harutyun; Bubon, Oleksandr; Teymurazyan, Aram; Senchurov, Sergii; Reznik, Alla",Phys. med. biol,534,30

SUBJECTS: Twenty-six adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 33 adult noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients, matched for age, sex, and disease severity, constituted the control group. All patients were steroid-free. INTERVENTIONS: None.

Five drivers were ranked with the highest probability to play a key role in the emergence of COVID-19 in pets: availability and quality of diagnostic tools, human density close to pets, ability of preventive/control measures to avoid the disease introduction or spread in a country (except treatment, vaccination and reservoir(s) control), current species specificity of the disease-causing agent and current knowledge on the pathogen. As scientific knowledge on the topic is scarce and still uncertain, expert elicitation of knowledge, in addition with clustering and sensitivity analyses, is of prime importance to prioritize future studies, starting from the top five drivers. The present methodology is applicable to other emerging pet diseases.","Saegerman, Claude; Bianchini, Juana; Renault, Véronique; Haddad, Nadia; Humblet, Marie-France",Transbound. emerg. dis.

Indeed, global climate change disturbs the local ambient environment and threatens endosymbiotic species, and in some cases leads to local ecosystem collapse. Recent studies have revealed that the endosymbiont can affect holobiont (endosymbiont and host together) stress tolerance as much as the host does, and manipulation of the microbial partners in holobionts may mitigate the impacts of the environmental stress. Here, we first show how the endosymbiont presence affects holobiont stress tolerance by discussing three well-studied endosymbiotic systems, which include plant-fungi, aquatic organism-algae, and insect-bacteria systems. We then review how holobionts are able to alter their stress tolerance via associated endosymbionts by changing their endosymbiont composition, by adaptation of their endosymbionts, or by acclimation of their endosymbionts. Finally, we discuss how different transmission modes (vertical or horizontal transmission) might affect the adaptability of holobionts. We propose that the endosymbiont is a good target for modifying holobiont stress tolerance, which makes it critical to more fully investigate the role of endosymbionts in the adaptive responses of holobionts to stress.","Ye, Siao; Siemann, Evan",Results Probl Cell Differ,534,1

METHODS: Single-center retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at our university-affiliated NYC hospital from 3/10/20 through 4/13/20 with follow-up to 5/1/20. Our primary endpoint was hospitalization rate among patients with confirmed COVID-19 compared with the regional population based on race. Our secondary endpoint survival to discharge among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. NYC Department of Health data were used to calculate hospitalization odds ratios. Chi-square and t tests were used to compare categorial and continuous variables, respectively. Cox proportional hazards regression and predictive analysis were used to investigate our endpoints further. RESULTS: Our cohort of 734 patients included 355 women (48.4%), 372 Blacks (50.7%), 214 Whites (29.2%), and 92 Hispanics (12.5%) in our analysis. Blacks were nearly twice as likely as Whites to require hospitalization for COVID-19 (OR 1.89, 95% CI, 1.59-2.24, p < 0.001). Hispanics were also more likely to suffer in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 compared with Whites (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.21-2.80; p = 0.005). There was a non-significant increased hazard of in-hospital mortality among Blacks when compared with Whites (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.95-1.78; p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Blacks were more likely than Whites to require hospitalization for COVID-19 while Hispanics were more likely to experience in-hospital mortality. Further investigation into the socioeconomic factors underlying racial disparities in COVID-19 survival and severity requiring hospitalization is needed on a national scale.","Renelus, Benjamin D; Khoury, Neil C; Chandrasekaran, Karthik; Bekele, Ezana; Briggs, William M; Ivanov, Alexander; Mohanty, Smruti R; Jamorabo, Daniel S",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),534,24

METHODS: The sample was drawn from individuals who subscribed to the Text4Hope program, a cognitive behavioural therapy inspired text messaging service developed to support Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey link was sent to the subscribers to ascertain their relationship status and assess psychopathology using the Perceived Stress Scale-10(PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data analysis was carried out using SPSS-26 for descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Within the first six weeks of the pandemic, 8,267 of 44,992 subscribers responded to the online survey giving a response rate of 19.4%. Mean scores on the PSS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 were highest among those who were single and lowest amongst those who were widowed. Overall, mean scores on the PHQ-9 were higher in groups self-identified as separated or divorced in comparison to those with partners including the categories of married or cohabiting.

The rest of the transcripts are defined as noncoding RNAs, including Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) and MicroRNAs (miRNAs) that mostly function post-transcriptionally to regulate the gene expression. The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has caused a major public health concern across the globe. The SARS-CoV is the seventh coronavirus that is known to cause human disease. There are currently no promising antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. As of August 10, 2020, SARS-CoV has been infected more than 13 million cases in more than 213 countries, with an estimated mortality rate of ∼3 %. Thus, it is of utmost important priority to develop novel therapies for COVID-19. It is not fully investigated whether noncoding RNAs regulate signaling pathways that SARS-CoV involved in. Hence, computational analysis of the noncoding RNA interactions and determining importance of key regulatory noncoding RNAs in antiviral defense mechanisms will likely be helpful in developing new drugs to attack SARS-CoV infection. To elucidate this, we utilized bioinformatic approaches to find the interaction network of SARS-CoV/human proteins, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. We found TGF-beta signaling pathway as one of the potential interactive pathways. Furthermore, potential miRNAs/lncRNAs networks that the virus might engage during infection in human host cells have been shown. Altogether, TGF-beta signaling pathway as well as hub miRNAs, and LncRNAs involve during SARS-CoV pathogenesis can be considered as potential therapeutic targets.","Yousefi, Hassan; Poursheikhani, Arash; Bahmanpour, Zahra; Vatanmakanian, Mousa; Taheri, Mohammad; Mashouri, Ladan; Alahari, Suresh K.",Biomed.

DESIGN: Analysis of a multicentre research network TriNETX was performed including patients more than 10 years of age diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: Outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients with concurrent HIV (PLH) were compared with a propensity-matched cohort of patients without HIV (non-PLH). RESULTS: Fifty thousand one hundred and sixty-seven patients with COVID-19 were identified (49,763 non-PLH, 404 PLH). PLH were more likely to be men, African-American, obese and have concurrent hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nicotine dependence compared with non-PLH cohort (all P values <0.05). We performed 1â:â1 matching for BMI, diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung diseases, chronic kidney disease, race, history of nicotine dependence and sex. In unmatched analysis, PLH had higher mortality at 30 days [risk ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.01-2.39] and were more likely to need inpatient services (risk ratio 1.83, 95% CI: 1.496-2.24). After propensity score matching, no difference in mortality was noted (risk ratio 1.33, 95% CI: 0.69-2.57). A higher proportion of PLH group needed inpatient services (19.31 vs. 11.39%, risk ratio 1.696, 95% CI: 1.21-2.38). Mean C-reactive protein, ferritin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels after COVID-19 diagnosis were not statistically different and mortality was not different for PLH with a history of antiretroviral treatment. CONCLUSION: Crude COVID-19 mortality is higher in PLH; however, propensity-matched analyses revealed no difference in outcomes, showing that higher mortality is driven by higher burden of comorbidities. Early diagnosis and intensive surveillance are needed to prevent a 'Syndemic' of diseases in this vulnerable cohort.","Hadi, Yousaf B; Naqvi, Syeda F Z; Kupec, Justin T; Sarwari, Arif R",AIDS,534,3

The purpose of this study was to examine the demographics of the orthopedic patients who utilized TM visits during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify opportunities to improve access. Methods: All patients who underwent orthopedic TM visits at one urban academic medical center between January and April 2020 were included. Demographic data including primary zip code, primary language, and visit type were collected. The demographics of the TM cohort were compared with those of patients seen in the outpatient (OP) setting at the same institution the prior year as well as with patients in the metropolitan area (M). Results: Five thousand thirty-five TM visits met the inclusion criteria. The TM cohort was significantly younger than the OP cohort, with mean age of 48.7 ± 19.0 years for TM and 55.2 ± 18.0 years for OP, and with 22% of TM being 65 or older versus 35% of OP being 65 or older (p = 0.001). The TM cohort had a lower percentage of minority patients (41.3%) than the OP cohort (48.2%). The TM cohort had a significantly lower percentage of black 12.9% versus 14.1%, Asian. 5.1% versus 5.8%, and Spanish/Hispanic 1.9% versus 15.4%, than the M and the OP cohort from the prior year (p < 0.026, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). For socioeconomic status, only 13.8% of TM patients were from ZIP codes with median household incomes <50k. A total of 96.2% of TM visits were performed in English, where only 61% of individuals in the metropolitan area report English as their primary language. Conclusions: As the largest analysis of the use of TM in orthopedics, this study highlights both the future potential of TM and areas of improvement to ensure better access to care for all patient populations. Maintenance of the provisions to allow audio-only visits to be considered TM and billed as such is one important measure.","Lott, Ariana; Sacks, Hayley; Hutzler, Lorraine; Campbell, Kirk A; Lajam, Claudette M",Telemed. j. e. health,534,12

We aimed to assess the number of institutional births, their outcomes (institutional stillbirth and neonatal mortality rate), and quality of intrapartum care before and during the national COVID-19 lockdown in Nepal. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, we collected participant-level data for pregnant women enrolled in the SUSTAIN and REFINE studies between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, from nine hospitals in Nepal. This period included 12·5 weeks before the national lockdown and 9·5 weeks during the lockdown. Women were eligible for inclusion if they had a gestational age of 22 weeks or more, a fetal heart sound at time of admission, and consented to inclusion. Women who had multiple births and their babies were excluded. We collected information on demographic and obstetric characteristics via extraction from case notes and health worker performance via direct observation by independent clinical researchers. We used regression analyses to assess changes in the number of institutional births, quality of care, and mortality before lockdown versus during lockdown. FINDINGS: Of 22â907 eligible women, 21â763 women were enrolled and 20â354 gave birth, and health worker performance was recorded for 10â543 births. From the beginning to the end of the study period, the mean weekly number of births decreased from 1261·1 births (SE 66·1) before lockdown to 651·4 births (49·9) during lockdown-a reduction of 52·4%. The institutional stillbirth rate increased from 14 per 1000 total births before lockdown to 21 per 1000 total births during lockdown (p=0·0002), and institutional neonatal mortality increased from 13 per 1000 livebirths to 40 per 1000 livebirths (p=0·0022). In terms of quality of care, intrapartum fetal heart rate monitoring decreased by 13·4% (-15·4 to -11·3; p<0·0001), and breastfeeding within 1 h of birth decreased by 3·5% (-4·6 to -2·6; p=0·0032). The immediate newborn care practice of placing the baby skin-to-skin with their mother increased by 13·2% (12·1 to 14·5; p<0·0001), and health workers' hand hygiene practices during childbirth increased by 12·9% (11·8 to 13·9) during lockdown (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Institutional childbirth reduced by more than half during lockdown, with increases in institutional stillbirth rate and neonatal mortality, and decreases in quality of care. Some behaviours improved, notably hand hygiene and keeping the baby skin-to-skin with their mother. An urgent need exists to protect access to high quality intrapartum care and prevent excess deaths for the most vulnerable health system users during this pandemic period.

The novel corona virus may affect the kidneys mainly as acute kidney injury (AKI). Also, the outcome of COVID-19 may be different in patients with underlying kidney disease. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of COVID-19 in patients with and without underlying kidney disease. METHODS: This was a retrospective study on 659 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in six centers of Iran. Patients were classified into kidney (chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or kidney transplantation) and non-kidney groups. The clinical conditions and laboratory data were extracted from the charts. Outcome was defined as death during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: Among 659 COVID-19 patients (mean age: 60.7 +/- 16.4, 56% male), 208 were in the kidney group (86 ESKD, 35 kidney transplants, and 87 CKD patients). AKI occurred in 41.8%. Incidence of AKI was 34.7% in non-kidney, 74.7% in CKD, and 51.4% in kidney transplant patients (P &lt; .001). Totally 178 patients (27%) died and mortality rate was significantly higher in CKD patients (50.6 vs. 23.4%, P &lt; .001). AKI was associated with increased mortality rate (OR = 2.588, CI: 1.707 to 3.925). Initial glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 44.2 mL/min and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) had significant association with mortality. CONCLUSION: We showed a higher mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with AKI and CKD. Low initial GFR and elevated LDH and CRP were associated with high mortality in COVID-19 patients.","Najafi, N.; Akbari, R.; Lotfi, Z.; Makhough, A.; Vahedi, M.; Asgharpour, M.; Ghorban Sabagh, M.; Marghoob, B.; Mirzaei Ilali, N.; Saddadi, F.; Shams, Z.; Ossareh, S.",Iranian journal of Kidney Diseases,534,20

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Many centers are currently screening surgical patients for COVID-19 using either chest CT, RT-PCR or both, due to the risk for worsened surgical outcomes and nosocomial spread. The optimal design and yield of such a strategy are currently unknown. METHODS: This multicenter study included consecutive adult patients without COVID-19 symptoms who underwent preoperative screening using chest CT and RT-PCR before elective or emergency surgery under general anaesthesia. RESULTS: A total of 2093 patients without COVID-19 symptoms were included in 14 participating centers; 1224 were screened by CT and RT-PCR and 869 by chest CT only. The positive yield of screening using a combination of chest CT and RT-PCR was 1.5% (95%CI: 0.8-2.1). Individual yields were 0.7% (95%CI: 0.2-1.1) for chest CT and 1.1% (95%CI: 0.6-1.7) for RT-PCR; the incremental yield of chest CT was 0.4%. In relation to COVID-19 community prevalence, up to â¼6% positive RT-PCR was found for a daily hospital admission rate >1.5 per 100,000 inhabitants, and around 1.0% for lower prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: One in every 100 patients without COVID-19 symptoms tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with RT-PCR; this yield increased in conjunction with community prevalence. The added value of chest CT was limited. Preoperative screening allowed us to take adequate precautions for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients in a surgical population, whereas negative patients needed only routine procedures.","Puylaert, Carl A J; Scheijmans, Jochem C G; Borgstein, Alexander B J; Andeweg, Caroline S; Bartels-Rutten, Annemarieke; Beets, Geerard L; Henegouwen, Mark I van Berge; Braak, Sicco J; Couvreur, Roy; Daams, Freek; van Es, Hendrik W; Franken, Lotte C; Grotenhuis, Brechtje A; Hendriks, Eduard R; de Hingh, Ignace H J T; Hoeijmakers, Fieke; Ten Holder, Joris T; Huisman, Peter M; Kazemier, Geert; van Kesteren, Floortje; van Kesteren, Jurre; Keywani, Kammy; Kuiper, Sara Z; Lange, Maurits D J; Lobatto, Mark E; Mée, Arthur du; Poeze, Martijn; van Praag, Elise M; van Rossen, Jorit; van Santvoort, Hjalmar C; Sedee, Wouter J A; Seelen, Leonard W F; Sharabiany, Sarah; Sosef, Nico L; Quanjel, Marian J R; Veltman, Jeroen; Verhagen, Tim; van de Vlasakker, Vincent C J; Weeder, Pepijn D; van Werven, Jochem R; Wesdorp, Nina J; van Dieren, Susan; Han, Alvin X; Russell, Colin A; de Jong, Menno D; Bossuyt, Patrick M M; Ufford, Jet M E Quarles van; Prokop, Mathias W; Gisbertz, Suzanne S; Prins, Jan M",Ann. surg,534,13

In this paper, we optimize the data augmentation and the CNN hyperparameters for detecting COVID-19 from CXRs in terms of validation accuracy. This optimization increases the accuracy of the popular CNN architectures such as the Visual Geometry Group network (VGG-19) and the Residual Neural Network (ResNet-50), by 11.93% and 4.97%, respectively.

The current COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. The aim of this study was to assess the information available on national and international aesthetic surgery society websites on the current pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: National and international aesthetic surgery society websites were assessed with regard to COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thirty-one per cent of nations had aesthetic surgery society websites. Twenty-two per cent of national society websites had a specific COVID-19 section. Seventeen per cent of these websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available; of these websites with guidelines, 77% had a specific COVID-19 section advising to provide only urgent or emergent care and 46% provided their sovereign state's directives to provide only urgent or emergent care. Two international aesthetic surgery society websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines, and one of the two had significant educational resources. CONCLUSION: The availability of COVID-19 clinical guidelines and patient information sheets on national plastic surgery society websites is sparse. In contrast, one international society website carefully analysed national and international recommendations and guidelines and made general recommendations for its members with regularly updated resources. This study suggests that improvement and increase in COVID-19 information provided by many national aesthetic surgery society websites may be improved by links to the ISAPS website.

We also bring attention to another dimension that will most likely exacerbate the severity and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 in impoverished populations, that is, the comorbidities and the presence of tropical infections. Recent Findings: During this first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a poverty-related neglected disease on at least two fronts. First, is its significant impact in low-income neighborhoods in the USA, the epicenter of the pandemic. Second, is its emergence in poor urban areas of South America, and now in Asia and Africa. In both fronts, the pandemic is contributing heavily towards the loss of public health gains that we managed to achieve globally during the last two decades. Specifically, any advances made as part of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (United Nations, 2020) is eroding, and for the first time, the number of people entering extreme poverty is increasing. Adding to this descent into poverty are new disruptions in ongoing disease control programs, routine vaccination strategies, and a reduction of capacity building efforts globally. Therefore, and as highlighted by many others, we support the notion that a way forward to eliminate this coronavirus pandemic should include linking COVID-19 control to other tropical or poverty-related diseases. Summary: COVID-19 is slowing or reversing global health and development gains. To be successful and achieve the global goals including the control of pandemics such as the one seen from the COVID-19, we must rely on strong leadership leading to impactful public policies and global collaborations, including global COVID-19 vaccinations, and potentially linking them to programs for childhood and adult vaccinations and programs for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and neglected tropical disease treatments. Opportunities also include the creation of unique research opportunities and funding models and increase science engagement for international diplomacy. This can only be done with a better understanding of the relationships between coronavirus disease, poverty, and tropical diseases.","Mejia, Rojelio; Hotez, Peter; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",Curr Trop Med Rep,534,33

This downfall may be partially explained by the""water cooler effect"", which holds that higher levels of social interaction lead to higher productivity due to a boost in people's mood. Somewhat paradoxically, however, there are reports of increased productivity in the remote working scenario. Here we address quantitatively this issue using an agent-based model to simulate a workplace with extrovert and introvert agent stereotypes that differ solely on their propensities to initiate a social interaction. We find that the effects of curtailing social interactions depend on the proportion of the stereotypes in the working group: while the social restriction measures always have a negative impact on the productivity of groups composed predominantly of introverts, they may actually improve the productivity of groups composed predominantly of extroverts, which offers then an explanation for the paradox of productivity during quarantine.","Hardy, Peter; Marcolino, Leandro Soriano; Fontanari, Jos'e F.",,534,1

COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory symptoms as well as blood coagulation in the vessels (thrombosis), heart attack and stroke. Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID-19 patients and virus-induced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin-13, dynorphin-13, and products such as angiotensin (1-7), angiotensin (1-9), apelin-12, dynorphin-12 in the human body. Substrates accumulation ultimately induces inflammation, angiogenesis, thrombosis, neuronal and tissue damage while diminished products lead to the loss of the anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and anti-angiogenic responses. In this review, we focus on the viral-induced imbalance between ACE2 substrates and products which exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Considering the roadmap, we propose multiple therapeutic strategies aiming to rebalance the products of ACE2 and to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease.","Mehrabadi, Maryam Eskandari; Hemmati, Roohullah; Tashakor, Amin; Homaei, Ahmad; Yousefzadeh, Masoumeh; Hemati, Karim; Hosseinkhani, Saman",Biomed Pharmacother,534,7

Recently, using three blood biomarkers, an interpretable machine learning model was developed to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. The method was reported to be suffering from performance stability because the identified biomarkers are not consistent predictors over an extended duration. MethodsTo sustain performance, the proposed method partitioned data into three different time windows. For each window, an end-classifier, a mid-classifier and a front-classifier were designed respectively using the XGboost single tree approach. These time window classifiers were integrated into a majority vote classifier and tested with an isolated test data set. ResultsThe voting classifier strengthens the overall performance of 90% cumulative accuracy from a 14 days window to a 21 days prediction window. ConclusionsAn additional 7 days of prediction window can have a considerable impact on a patients chance of survival. This study validated the feasibility of the time window voting classifier and further support the selection of biomarkers features set for the early prognosis of patients with a higher risk of mortality.","GOH, TIONG; Liu, MengJun",,534,0

Such is the case, of the novel coronavirus SARS-Cov-2, which has expanded of exponential way, practically, to whole world population. For this reason, the enhancement of real microscopic images of this coronavirus is of great importance. Of this way, one can highlight the S-spikes and visualizing those areas that show a high density, which are related to active zones of viral germination and major spread of the virus. The SARS-Cov-2 images were captured from nasopharyngeal samples of Cuban symptomatic individuals (RT-PCR positives for SARS-CoV-2) and processed via scanning electron microscopy. However, many times these microscopic images present some blurring problems, and the S-spikes do not look well defined. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose new computational methods to carry out enhancement and segmentation of SARS-Cov-2 high-resolution microscopic images. The proposed strategy obtained very satisfactory results, and we validated its performance, together with specialist physicians, on a set of 1005 images. Due to the importance of the obtained results, this first work will be addressed to the application of the proposed algorithm.

All adult oncology patients referred to the cardio-oncology service at the Cleveland Clinic from January 2011 up to June 2018 were included in the study. Comprehensive clinical information were collected. The impact on survival of temporal trends of cardiovascular disease in oncology patients were assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model and time-varying covariate adjustment for confounders. In total, 6,754 patients were included in the study (median age, 57 years; [interquartile range, 47-65 years]; 3,898 women [58%]; oncology history [60% - breast cancer, lymphoma and leukemia]). Mortality and diagnosis of clinical cardiac disease peaked around the time of chemotherapy. 2,293 patients (34%) were diagnosed with a new cardiovascular risk factor after chemotherapy, over half of which were identified in the first year after cancer diagnosis. Patients with pre-existing and post-chemotherapy cardiovascular disease had significantly worse outcomes than patients that did not develop any cardiovascular disease (p<0.0001). The highest one-year hazard ratios [HR] of post-chemotherapy cardiovascular disease were significantly associated with male [HR 1.81; 95% CI 1.55-2.11; p<0.001] and diabetes [HR 1.51; 95% CI 1.26-1.81; p<0.001]. In conclusion, patients referred to cardio-oncology, first diagnosis of cardiac events peaked around the time of chemotherapy.

High-circulation HVAC systems with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration dramatically reduce exposure to the virus in indoor settings, and surgical masks or N95 respirators further reduce exposure. As an example of our risk assessment model, we consider the precautions needed for a typical experimental physical science group to maintain a low risk of transmission over six months of operation. We recommend that, for environments where fewer than five individuals significantly overlap, work spaces should remain vacant for between one (high-circulation HVAC with HEPA filtration) to six (low-circulation HVAC with no filtration) air exchange times before a new worker enters in order to maintain no more than 1% chance of infection over six months of operation in the workplace.

We created logistic regression models to understand association of clinical characteristics with illness severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The study population comprised 445 patients [67% males, median age 53 (IQR 40-64) years]. Majority of patients (N = 268; 60%) had &#8805; 1 co-morbid [37.5% hypertension, 36.4% diabetes]. In-hospital mortality was 13%.

Recent Findings: The representation of marine biogeochemistry has progressed within the current generation of Earth system models. However, it remains difficult to identify which model updates are responsible for a given improvement. In addition, the full potential of marine biogeochemistry in terms of Earth system interactions and climate feedback remains poorly examined in the current generation of Earth system models.

Since 8 March 2020, the Italian government ordered a nationwide lockdown with unavoidable social isolation. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) represent the most physically and emotionally involved category. The aim of this study is to assess the social distress among HCPs in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this online, totally anonymous survey, 24 multiple choice questions were posed to medical staff employed in the Italian Healthcare System during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection was performed from 30 March to 24 April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 600 HCPs completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents expressed the fear of being at higher risk of contagion than the general population (83.3%) and the weighty concern of infecting their families (72.5%). An insufficient supply of personal protective equipment (PPE; P = 0.0003) and inadequate training about procedures to follow (P = 0.0092) were seen to significantly coincide with these worries. More than two-thirds declared a change in family organisation, which showed a significant correlation with the concern of infecting their relatives (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first Italian survey on social distress among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The unavailability of PPE, screening procedures and adequate training strongly affected HCPs' emotional status. Although there was a predominance of oncologists (especially from the North of Italy), which impairs the generalisation of our findings, this survey underlined the social impact that this health emergency has had on HCPs.","Berardi, R; Torniai, M; Cona, M S; Cecere, F L; Chiari, R; Guarneri, V; La Verde, N; Locati, L; Lorusso, D; Martinelli, E; Giannarelli, D; Garassino, M C",ESMO Open,534,16

Devido à limitada capacidade regenerativa do sistema nervoso central (CNS), causando sequelas funcionais, as MSCs estão sendo investigadas como uma alternativa terapêutica para condições neurológicas inflamatórias, vasculares, traumáticas e degenerativas em diversas espécies animais. A Mieloencefalite protozoária equina (EPM) causada por ambos os protozoários do filo Apicomplexa, Sarcocystis neurona e Neospora hughesi, permanece como uma importante doença neurológica dos equinos nas Américas, embora a maioria dos casos seja devida à infecção por S. neurona. A aplicação da proteômica com sua gama de ferramentas na clínica de equinos pode contribuir significativamente para o entendimento de processos patológicos e facilitar a descoberta de novos alvos terapêuticos ou marcadores diagnósticos. Neste contexto, os objetivos deste estudo foram avaliar o perfil proteômico do líquido cefalorraquidiano (CSF) antes e após múltiplos transplantes intratecal de MSCs em equinos hígidos e o perfil proteômico do CSF de equinos cronicamente afetados pela EPM. Doze cavalos adultos clinicamente saudáveis foram divididos aleatoriamente em três grupos experimentais: grupo DPBS (DPBS ou control; n = 4) onde a solução salina tamponada com fosfato de Dulbecco's (DPBS) foi administrada pela via intratecal; grupo AD-G (AD-G; n = 4), no qual foram realizados transplantes intratecal com MSCs alogênicas de tecido adiposo; e grupo BM-G (BM-G; n = 4), no qual foram realizados transplantes intratecal com MSCs alogênicas de medula óssea. Todos os grupos experimentais receberam três tratamentos seriados (DPBS ou MSCs) com intervalo de 30 dias entre eles. As amostras de CSF foram coletadas dos grupos experimentais imediatamente antes do primeiro tratamento (denominado momento M0 ou Before) e 30 dias após o terceiro tratamento (denominado momento M90 ou After). Ao mesmo tempo, os CSF de 16 equinos clinicamente saudáveis e de 9 equinos cronicamente afetados por EPM foram coletados da subaracnóide, denominados grupo Control (Control; n = 16) e grupo EPM (EPM; n = 9) respectivamente. Cada uma das amostras de CSF do grupo Control e do grupo EPM foram individualmente ressuspendidas e agrupadas em pool, totalizando dois pool representativos de cada um dos grupos experimentais e denominados igualmente (Control e EPM) para avaliar o perfil proteômico dos mesmos. De modo similar, os três grupos que receberam transplantes e coletas de CSF nos dois distintos momentos, foram agrupados em seis pool representativos para cada grupo e momento. Considerando a plataforma proteômica utilizada, os três grupos foram pareadamente comparados: DPBS After vs. Before, AD-G After vs. Before e BM-G After vs. Before, sendo encontradas 208, 211 e 131 proteínas em cada comparação, respectivamente. Do mesmo modo, na comparação pareada do CSF dos grupos EPM e Control, EPM vs. Control, 201 proteínas foram identificadas e 33 proteínas observadas exclusivamente no CSF do grupo EPM. Ademais, também foi observada na comparação pareada dos grupos DPBS, BM-G e EPM, a presença dos três tipos de enolases interagindo entre si (ENO 1, ENO 2 e ENO 3), sendo em DPBS e BM-G como exclusivas do momento After e no grupo EPM como exclusivas dele. Neste contexto, este estudo ao avaliar os perfis proteômico do CSF antes e após múltiplos transplantes intratecal de MSCs em equinos hígidos e do CSF de equinos cronicamente afetados pela EPM permitiu identificar as enolases como potenciais marcadores de lesão neural e/ou de EPM.

Both groups showed a significant increase in antibody titers for all three antigens on D14 and D28 (p < 0.001). jSLE patients had a significantly lower increase in diphtheria titers than the control group (p = 0.007). jSLE patients had a distinct titer increase of tetanus and pertussis antibodies when compared to controls (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). There was a lower frequency of pertussis seroconversion in the jSLE group on D14 (p = 0.009), D28 (p = 0.023), D12m (p = 0.015) and D24m (p = 0.004). Cellular immune response to Bordetella pertussis showed significantly lower levels of IFNÎ³ (p < 0.001) and higher levels of IL10, IL12, IL21 and TNF&#945; in jSLE patients than controls. CONCLUSIONS: jSLE patients had good response to Tdap booster dose for the tetanus antigen, but not for diphtheria and pertussis. This vaccine was safe in relation to adverse events and absence of disease reactivation.","Peracchi, Octávio Ab; Nicácio, Aline Alencar Mf; Yamada, Juliana; Len, Claudio Arnaldo; Moraes-Pinto, Maria Isabel de; Terreri, Maria Teresa",Lupus,534,16

Only two DPP-4 inhibitors, linagliptin and sitagliptin, were able to inhibit ACE. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we investigated if other inhibitors of ACE or DPP-4 could simultaneously inhibit the activities of both DPP-4 and ACE. METHODS: Forty Sprague Dawley rats were used. The control group received saline only. The other three groups were treated with anagliptin, ramipril, or lisinopril. Two different doses were tested, separated with a 6-day drug-free interval. Angiotensin II (ang II) levels, the activities of ACE, and DPP-4 were measured from blood samples at baseline and days 1, 10, and 14. After the oral glucose challenge, levels of the active form of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were measured. RESULTS: Regardless of the dose, anagliptin did not show any inhibitory effect on the activity of ACE or ang II levels. For ramipril and lisinopril, only a high dose of lisinopril was able to produce a modest reduction of the DPP-4 activity, but it was not enough to inhibit the inactivation of GLP-1. CONCLUSION: It seems that while most ACE inhibitors cannot affect DPP-4 activity, inhibitors of DPP-4 vary in their effect on ACE activity. The selection of DPP-4 inhibitors under different clinical situations should take into account the action of these drugs on ACE.","Abouelkheir, Mohamed",Current molecular pharmacology (Online),534,16

The magnetic neutron scattering from the Cr ions exhibits significant changes with temperature and dominates at low momentum transfer regime. Ab initio calculations performed including magnetic interactions show that the effect of magnetic interactions is very significant on the low- as well as high-energy phonon modes. We have also shown that the inelastic neutron spectrum of YCrO3 mimics the magnon spectrum from a G-type antiferromagnetic system, which is consistent with previously reported magnetic structure in the compound. The pressure-dependent ab initio lattice dynamics calculations are used to calculate the anisotropic thermal expansion behaviour in orthorhombic YCrO3, which is in excellent agreement with the available experimental data in the paramagnetic phase. We identify that the low energy anharmonic phonon modes involving Y vibrations contribute maximum to the thermal expansion behaviour.","Gupta, Mayanak K; Mittal, Ranjan; Mishra, Sanjay K; Goel, Prabhatasree; Singh, Baltej; Rols, Stephane; Chaplot, Samrath L",J Phys Condens Matter,534,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All initial chest CTs of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at our emergency department between March 25 and April 25, 2020, were identified (n = 120). Three patient management groups were defined: group 1 (outpatient), group 2 (general ward), and group 3 (intensive care unit [ICU]). Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning. Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered. Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed. The potential of these parameters to predict patients' needs for intensive care (yes/no) was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans. RESULTS: While demographic parameters alone (sex and age) were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone (including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.97) and laboratory findings alone (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin; AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) were good classifiers. Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85-0.98). Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.66-0.88). CONCLUSION: Chest CT of patients with COVID-19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis. These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management.","Weikert, Thomas; Rapaka, Saikiran; Grbic, Sasa; Re, Thomas; Chaganti, Shikha; Winkel, David J; Anastasopoulos, Constantin; Niemann, Tilo; Wiggli, Benedikt J; Bremerich, Jens; Twerenbold, Raphael; Sommer, Gregor; Comaniciu, Dorin; Sauter, Alexander W",Korean J Radiol,534,25

Following research evidence that global media coverage presents the benefits of testing healthy people far more frequently than harms, and gives little coverage to overdiagnosis, we sought to examine journalists' views on media reporting of tests, overdiagnosis, and strategies to improve critical reporting on tests. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews. Interviews were conducted between February and March 2020 and were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Framework thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Twenty-two journalists (mainly specialising in health reporting, average 14.5 years' experience) based in Australia. RESULTS: This sample of journalists acknowledged the potential harms of medical tests but felt that knowledge of harms was low among journalists and the public at large. Most were aware of the term overdiagnosis, but commonly felt that it is challenging to both understand and communicate in light of strong beliefs in the benefits of early detection. Journalists felt that newsworthiness in the form of major public health impact was the key ingredient for stories about medical tests. The journalists acknowledged that factors, like the press release and 'click bait culture' in particular, can influence the framing of coverage about tests. Lack of knowledge and training, as well as time pressures, were perceived to be the main barriers to critical reporting on tests. Journalists felt that training and better access to information about potential harms would enable more critical reporting. CONCLUSIONS: Effectively communicating overdiagnosis is a challenge in light of common beliefs about the benefits of testing and the culture of current journalism practices. Providing journalists with training, support and better access to information about potential harms of tests could aid critical reporting of tests.","O039,; Keeffe, Mary; Nickel, Brooke; Dakin, Thomas; Maher, Chris G; Albarqouni, Loai; McCaffery, Kirsten; Barratt, Alexandra; Moynihan, Ray",BMJ Open,534,18

Previously, we showed plasminogen itself is a key regulator in fibrin degradation, wound healing and infection. AIM: We aimed to investigate whether plasminogen can improve lung lesions and hypoxemia of COVID-19. DESIGN: Thirteen clinically moderate, severe or critical COVID-19 patients were treated with atomization inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen. METHODS: Levels of their lung lesions, oxygen saturation and heart rates were compared before and after treatment by computed tomography scanning images and patient monitor. RESULTS: After plasminogen inhalation, conditions of lung lesions in five clinically moderate patients have quickly improved, shown as the decreased range and density of 'ground glass' opacity. Improvements of oxygen saturation were observed in six clinically severe patients. In the two patients with critical conditions, the oxygen levels have significantly increased from 79-82% to 91% just about 1 h after the first inhalation. In 8 of 13 patients, the heart rates had slowed down. For the five clinically moderate patients, the difference is even statistically significant. Furthermore, a general relief of chest tightness was observed. CONCLUSION: Whereas it is reported that plasminogen is dramatically increased in adults with ARDS, this study suggests that additional plasminogen may be effective and efficient in treating lung lesions and hypoxemia during COVID-19 infections. Although further studies are needed, this study highlights a possible hope of efficiently combating this rapid epidemic emergency.","Wu, Y; Wang, T; Guo, C; Zhang, D; Ge, X; Huang, Z; Zhou, X; Li, Y; Peng, Q; Li, J",QJM,534,29

Unfortunately, there is no specific prevention and treatment strategy for this disease. We aim to explore the potential role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in this regard through this literature review. As a crucial enzyme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 not only mediates the virus entry but also affects the pathophysiological process of virus-induced acute lung injury (ALI), as well as other organs' damage. As interaction of COVID-19 virus spike and ACE2 is essential for virus infection, COVID-19-specific vaccine based on spike protein, small molecule compound interrupting their interaction, human monoclonal antibody based on receptor-binding domain, and recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhuACE2) have aroused the interests of researchers. Meanwhile, ACE2 could catalyze angiotensin II (Ang II) to form angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), thus alleviates the harmful effect of Ang II and amplifies the protection effect of Ang1-7. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) have been shown to increase the level of expression of ACE2 and could be potential strategies in protecting lungs, heart, and kidneys. ACE2 plays a very important role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection. Strategies targeting ACE2 and its ligand, COVID-19 virus spike protein, may provide novel method in the prevention and management of novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Liu, Mengyuan; Wang, Ting; Zhou, Yun; Zhao, Yutong; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianping",J.Transl.

Following infection, patients receiving ICHD frequently develop circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, even with asymptomatic infection. Here, we investigated the durability and functionality of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients receiving ICHD. Three hundred and fifty-six such patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were regularly screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies, and those who became seronegative at six months were screened for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at time zero, of whom 127 also had detectable anti-RBD. Significantly, at six months, 71/111 (64.0%) and 99/116 (85.3%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive, respectively. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels were reduced significantly after six months. Eleven patients who were anti-NP seropositive at time zero, had no detectable antibody at six months; of whom eight were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at six months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following six months.

Following infection, patients receiving ICHD frequently develop circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, even with asymptomatic infection. Here, we investigated the durability and functionality of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients receiving ICHD. Three hundred and fifty-six such patients were longitudinally screened for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and underwent routine PCR-testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic infection. Patients were regularly screened for nucleocapsid protein (anti-NP) and receptor binding domain (anti-RBD) antibodies, and those who became seronegative at six months were screened for SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses. One hundred and twenty-nine (36.2%) patients had detectable antibody to anti-NP at time zero, of whom 127 also had detectable anti-RBD. Significantly, at six months, 71/111 (64.0%) and 99/116 (85.3%) remained anti-NP and anti-RBD seropositive, respectively. For patients who retained antibody, both anti-NP and anti-RBD levels were reduced significantly after six months. Eleven patients who were anti-NP seropositive at time zero, had no detectable antibody at six months; of whom eight were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific T cell responses. Independent of antibody status at six months, patients with baseline positive SARS-CoV-2 serology were significantly less likely to have PCR confirmed infection over the following six months. Thus, patients receiving ICHD mount durable immune responses six months post SARS-CoV-2 infection, with fewer than 3% of patients showing no evidence of humoral or cellular immunity.","Clarke, Candice L; Prendecki, Maria; Dhutia, Amrita; Gan, Jaslyn; Edwards, Claire; Prout, Virginia; Lightstone, Liz; Parker, Eleanor; Marchesin, Federica; Griffith, Megan; Charif, Rawya; Pickard, Graham; Cox, Alison; McClure, Myra; Tedder, Richard; Randell, Paul; Greathead, Louise; Guckian, Mary; McAdoo, Stephen P; Kelleher, Peter; Willicombe, Michelle",Kidney Int,534,16

In this study, we investigated the effect of anti-TNF-&#945; monoclonal antibodies on the cellular entry mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and increasing the risk of COVID-19 development. We focused on the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), type II transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS2)/TNF-&#945; converting enzyme (TACE) ratio. We also investigated the involvement of Notch-1 signaling and its downstream influence on IL-6, myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1(MCL-1) in the anti-TNF-&#945; mode of action and increased the susceptibility to Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. Surprisingly, anti-TNF-&#945; downregulated ACE2 expression by 0.46-fold and increased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 44% in THP-1 macrophages. Treatment of macrophages with rIL-6 also downregulated ACE2 and increased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 54%. Interestingly, anti-TNF-&#945; treatment upregulated Notch-1, IL-6, and MCL-1 by 1.3, 1.2, and 1.9-fold, respectively, and increased viability and burden of MAP infection in macrophages. Blocking Notch signaling doubled ACE2 expression, decreased TMPRSS2/TACE ratio by 38%, and reduced MAP viability by 56%. In a small group of patients, ACE2 level was significantly lower in the plasma from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on anti-TNF-&#945; treatment compared to healthy control. The data in this critical study demonstrated that through Notch-1/IL-6 signaling, anti-TNF-&#945; agents decreased ACE2 expression and shedding through TMPRSS2/TACE modulation and increased the susceptibility to infection. Overall, this study warns against anti-TNF-&#945; therapy in some patients with underlining inflammatory conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings should impact current guidelines regarding treatment decisions of patients on anti-TNF-&#945; during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Keewan, Esra039; Beg, Shazia; Naser, Saleh A",Front Immunol,534,16

Although telemedicine is not a novel technology, previous studies have offered mixed opinions surrounding its utilization. However, there exists a dearth of research on how these opinions have evolved over the course of the current pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate how the language and sentiment surrounding telemedicine has evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets published between January 1, 2020, and April 24, 2021, containing at least one telemedicine-related and one COVID-19-related search term (""telemedicine-COVID"") were collected from the Twitter full archive search (N=351,718). A comparator sample containing only COVID-19 terms (""general-COVID"") was collected and sampled based on the daily distribution of telemedicine-COVID tweets. In addition to analyses of retweets and favorites, sentiment analysis was performed on both data sets in aggregate and within a subset of tweets receiving the top 100 most and least retweets. RESULTS: Telemedicine gained prominence during the early stages of the pandemic (ie, March through May 2020) before leveling off and reaching a steady state from June 2020 onward. Telemedicine-COVID tweets had a 21% lower average number of retweets than general-COVID tweets (incidence rate ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99; P=.04), but there was no difference in favorites. A majority of telemedicine-COVID tweets (180,295/351,718, 51.3%) were characterized as ""positive,"" compared to only 38.5% (135,434/351,401) of general-COVID tweets (P<.001). This trend was also true on a monthly level from March 2020 through April 2021. The most retweeted posts in both telemedicine-COVID and general-COVID data sets were authored by journalists and politicians. Whereas the majority of the most retweeted posts within the telemedicine-COVID data set were positive (55/101, 54.5%), a plurality of the most retweeted posts within the general-COVID data set were negative (44/89, 49.4%; P=.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, opinions surrounding telemedicine evolved to become more positive, especially when compared to the larger pool of COVID-19-related tweets. Decision makers should capitalize on these shifting public opinions to invest in telemedicine infrastructure and ensure its accessibility and success in a postpandemic world.","Pollack, Catherine C; Gilbert-Diamond, Diane; Alford-Teaster, Jennifer A; Onega, Tracy",J Med Internet Res,534,16

However, recently, there has been drastic reduction, both in gross anatomy teaching hours and its context. Additionally, a decrease in the number of trained anatomists and an increase in the costs associated with procuring human cadavers have been noted, causing a diminution of cadaveric dissections in anatomy education. OBJECTIVE: To address these challenges, there is an ardent need for a pedagogical framework such that anatomy education can be disseminated through active learning principles, within a fixed time frame, using a small team of anatomists and a small number of cadaveric specimens (for live on-site sessions) as well as collaborative learning principles. The latter is particularly important when anatomy education is delivered through distance learning, as is the case currently during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Here, we have blueprinted a pedagogical framework blending the instructional design models of Gagne's 9 events of instruction with Peyton's 4-step approach. The framework's applicability was validated through the delivery of anatomical concepts, using an exemplar from the structure-function course Head and Neck during the normal and COVID-19-mandated lockdown periods, employing the archetype of Frey syndrome. Preliminary evaluation of the framework was pursued using student feedback and end-of-course feedback responses. The efficiency of the framework in knowledge transfer was also appraised. RESULTS: The blueprinted instructional plan designed to implement the pedagogical framework was successfully executed in the dissemination of anatomy education, employing a limited number of cadaveric specimens (during normal times) and a social media application (SMA)-integrated ""interactome"" strategy (during the COVID-19 lockdown). Students' response to the framework was positive. However, reluctance was expressed by a majority of the faculty in adopting the framework for anatomy education. To address this aspect, a strategy has been designed using Mento's 12-step change management model. The long-term benefits for any medical school to adopt the blended pedagogical framework have also been explicated by applying Bourdieu's Theory of Practice. Additionally, through the design of an SMA interactome model, the framework's applicability to the delivery of anatomy education and content during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was realized. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the study effectively tackles some of the contemporary key challenges associated with the delivery of anatomy content in medical education during normal and unprecedented times.","Naidoo, Nerissa; Akhras, Aya; Banerjee, Yajnavalka",JMIR Med Educ,534,1

We find a clear balance-unbalance transition for six of the nine countries, following the August 2011 Black Monday in the US, when the Economic Policy Uncertainty index for this country reached its highest monthly level before the COVID-19 crisis. This sudden loss of balance is mainly caused by a reorganization of the market networks triggered by a group of low capitalization stocks belonging to the non-financial sector. After the transition, the stocks of companies in these groups become all negatively correlated between them and with most of the rest of the stocks in the market.

As part of a primary care placement, the authors (two medical students and a lead general practitioner) directly promoted the Reducing Weight with Intensive Dietary Support (REWIND) programme to patients in Northwest London and collected feedback on the promotion. Methods: The team developed and delivered three remote interventions: a redesigned patient-facing information leaflet, phone calls and text messages, and a live, interactive webinar, to directly engage patients and raise awareness about REWIND. Feedback was collected pre- and post-webinar using an anonymised, online survey (essentially functioning as a 'teaching' evaluation). Results: Mean interest in REWIND had increased from 2.7 (pre-promotion) to 4.7 (post-promotion), knowledge about REWIND had increased from 2.1 to 4, and self-reported likelihood of enrolling had increased from 2.6 to 4.2 (P &lt; 0.01 in all cases). The reported usefulness of the leaflet and webinar was scored 3.7 and 4.4 respectively. Within two weeks of the webinar, two of these patients had joined REWIND. Conclusion: Feedback from the patients and GP revealed that the project successfully raised awareness, improved knowledge, and increased the likelihood of enrolment in REWIND. Diabetes programmes and organisations are encouraged to adapt the methods of this project to their own contexts, especially in light of COVID-19 where remote interventions will remain essential.","Kapadia, S.

We used latent class analysis independently in each cohort to identify subphenotypes based on clinical and laboratory variables. We then analyzed the associations of subphenotypes with 28-day mortality.

They have a strong demand for remote healthcare that despite the great potential of artificial intelligence are not met in the current (e)-health services. Understanding the real needs of these persons is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to contribute with a fine grained understanding of the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms, in order to enhance AI in eHealth services. METHODS: Design research in which a qualitative approach was used to map the patient journey. Data on the home isolation experiences of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms was collected from top viewed personal video stories on YouTube and their additional comment threads. For the analysis this data was transcribed, coded and mapped into the patient journey map. RESULTS: The key findings on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms concern: (a) Considerable awareness period before testing positive and home-recovery period; (b) Less generic but more personal symptoms experiences; (c) Negative mood experience curve; (d) Inadequate home healthcare service support for mild COVID-19 patients through all stages. (e) Benefits and drawbacks of Social media support for mild COVID-19 patients; (f) Several touchpoint needs for home healthcare interaction with AI. CONCLUSIONS: The design of the patient journey map and underlying insights on the home isolation experience of persons with mild COVID-19 symptoms serves Health - and IT professionals to more effectively apply AI technology into eHealth services for mild Covid-19 patients, for which three main service concepts are proposed: (I) Trustful public health information to release stress; (II) Personal Covid-19 health monitoring.

Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the ""social distancing"" guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000â¯µm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16â¯km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83â¯m and 3.05â¯m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05â¯m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5â¯s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers.","Feng, Yu; Marchal, Thierry; Sperry, Ted; Yi, Hang",J Aerosol Sci,534,1

We conducted 131 semistructured phone interviews with households in rural Odisha, India, to understand behavior changes made in WASH practices as a result of the pandemic and challenges that would prevent best practices. Interviews were conducted from May through July 2020 with 73 heads of household, 37 caregivers of children < 5 years old, and 21 members of village water and sanitation committees in villages with community-level piped water and high levels of latrine ownership. The majority of respondents (86%, N = 104) reported a change in their handwashing practice due to COVID-19, typically describing an increase in handwashing frequency, more thorough washing method, and/or use of soap. These improved handwashing practices remained in place a few months after the pandemic began and were often described as a new consistent practice after additional daily actions (such as returning home), suggesting new habit formation. Few participants (13%) reported barriers to handwashing. Some respondents also detailed improvements in other WASH behaviors, including village-level cleaning of water tanks and/or treatment of piped water (48% of villages), household water treatment and storage (17% of respondents), and household cleaning (41% of respondents). However, there was minimal change in latrine use and child feces management practices as a result of the pandemic. We provide detailed thematic summaries of qualitative responses to allow for richer insights into these WASH behavior changes during the pandemic. The results also highlight the importance of ensuring communities have adequate WASH infrastructure to enable the practice of safe behaviors and strengthen resilience during a large-scale health crisis.","Bauza, Valerie; Sclar, Gloria D; Bisoyi, Alokananda; Majorin, Fiona; Ghugey, Apurva; Clasen, Thomas",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,534,24

The patient had subsequent negative tests while on the inpatient psychiatric unit before again testing positive later in his admission. The patient's positive COVID-19 tests appeared to coincide with exacerbations in his mood symptoms, which led to the suicide attempt and psychotic episode that initially caused his admission.

There was a negative influence on anxiety symptoms (standardized coefficient beta = -0.079, p-value = 0.012), but a positive impact on social well-being (standardized coefficient beta = 0.158, p-value < 0.001) and quality of life (standardized coefficient beta = 0.136, p-value < 0.001) among the students even when the situation was improving. To relieve the domino effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' wellness, an updated policy for enhancing awareness and providing updated information is continuously required. Improvements on self and situational awareness may help prevent health risk behaviors and promote health among Thai health professional students.","Tiaprapong, Krueakaew; Sirikul, Achiraporn; Krajangmek, Chamawee; Duangthongkul, Namfon; Pandam, Nichaya; Piya-Amornphan, Nitita",PLoS One,534,1

In Japan, immunoassay-based rapid antigen detection kits are widely used for the detection of RSV. In this study, an ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR method for the rapid detection of RSV was developed using the PCR1100 device based on the US CDC assay in order to detect RSV in comparable time to rapid test kits. The ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR could detect RSV viral RNA in less than 20 min while maintaining sensitivity and specificity comparable to conventional real-time RT-PCR using large installed instruments. Furthermore, combining ultra-rapid real-time RT-PCR with the M1 Sample Prep kit reduced the total working time for the detection of RSV from clinical specimen to less than 25 min, suggesting this method could be used for point-of-care RSV testing.","Shirato, Kazuya; Nao, Naganori; Kawase, Miyuki; Kageyama, Tsutomu",Jpn J Infect Dis,534,18

Questions from the seriousness and breadth of the problem to the effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures have been raised. We assert that the decision sciences have a crucial role to play here, as the questions requiring answers involve complex decision making under both uncertainty and ambiguity. The collection, processing, and analysis of data is critical in providing a useful response-especially as information of fundamental importance to such decision making (base rates and transmission rates) is lacking. We propose that scarce testing resources should be diverted away from confirmatory analysis of symptomatic people, as laboratory diagnosis appears to have little decision value in treatment choice over clinical diagnosis in patients presenting with symptoms. In contrast, the exploratory use of testing resources to reduce ambiguity in estimates of the base rate of infection appears to have significant value and great practical import for public policy purposes. As these stances may be at odds with triage practices among medical practitioners, they highlight the important role the decision analyst can play in responding to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rode, David C; Fischbeck, Paul S",Risk anal,534,16

This deadly disease has average fatality rate of 6.5% and even higher among elderly patients and patients with comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as the entry receptor into host cell. ACE-2, a type-I transmembrane metallocarboxypeptidase, is a critical regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. The entry of SARS-CoV-2 within host cells results in a reduced availability of ACE-2 on the host cell surface followed by significant downregulation of ACE-2 gene expression. As ACE-2 is a well-known cardio-protective molecule, its downregulation could result in severe cardiac disorders. This review deals with a challenging aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who are asymptomatic or have mild syndromes similar to influenza infections. These patients are proving to be the Achilles' heel to combat COVID-19 mainly in developing countries of South Asia, where the average number of tests conducted per million individuals is considerably low. Consequently, there is high possibility that individuals with negligible respiratory trouble will not be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, a huge percentage of the population have the risk of developing cardiovascular disorders as a bystander effect of viral infection apart from being potential reservoir of disease transmission. Based on available demographic as well as molecular data, this review predicts a huge spike in cardiovascular disorders among this undetected reservoir in post COVID-19 era.","Gupta, Shreyasi; Mitra, Arkadeep",Heart fail. rev,534,20

Uncertainty analysis is a stable component of risk assessment and is increasingly used in decision making on complex health issues. Uncertainties should be identified in a structured way and prioritized according to their likely impact on the outcome of scientific conclusions. Uncertainty is inherent to the rare diseases (RD) area, where research and healthcare have to cope with knowledge gaps due to the rarity of the conditions; yet a systematic approach toward uncertainties is not usually undertaken. The uncertainty issue is particularly relevant to multifactorial RD, whose etiopathogenesis involves environmental factors and genetic predisposition. Three case studies are presented: the newly recognized acute multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; the assessment of risk factors for neural tube defects; and the genotype-phenotype correlation in familial Mediterranean fever. Each case study proposes the initial identification of the main epistemic and sampling uncertainties and their impacts. Uncertainty analysis in RD may present aspects similar to those encountered when conducting risk assessment in data-poor scenarios; therefore, approaches such as expert knowledge elicitation may be considered. The RD community has a main strength in managing uncertainty, as it proactively develops stakeholder involvement, data sharing and open science. The open science approaches can be profitably integrated by structured uncertainty analysis, especially when dealing with multifactorial RD involving environmental and genetic risk factors.","Taruscio, Domenica; Mantovani, Alberto",Medicina (Kaunas),534,16

Its decreased level on the cell surface correlates with poor prognosis in several tumor types. Aberrant stromal localization of syndecan-1 is also considered an unfavorable prognostic factor in various human malignancies. In the presented work the question was addressed if changes in syndecan-1 expression are related to the prognosis of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemistry for syndecan-1 extracellular domain was performed on surgical specimens of primary cervical cancer. To follow the communication between tumor cells and stromal fibroblasts, their mono-and co-cultures were studied, detecting the expression of syndecan-1, smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin. Immunohistochemistry of tumorous specimens revealed that while cell surface syndecan-1 expression was reduced on cancer cells, it appeared on the surface of tumor-associated fibroblasts. Until year 7, the cohort with high cell surface syndecan-1 expression had significantly longer survival. No difference in the same time-period could be detected when stromal syndecan-1 expression was analyzed. In vitro analysis revealed, that tumor cells can induce syndecan-1 expression on fibroblast, and fibroblasts showed that fibroblast-like cells are built by two cell types: (a) syndecan-1 positive, cytokeratin negative real fibroblasts, and (b) syndecan-1 and cytokeratin positive epithelial-mesenchymal transformed tumor cells. Syndecan-1 on the surface of cancer cells appears to be a positive prognostic marker. Although syndecan-1 positive fibroblasts promote tumor cell proliferation in vitro, we failed to detect their cancer promoting effect in vivo.","Karászi, Katalin; Vigh, Renáta; Máthé, Miklós; Fullár, Alexandra; Oláh, Lászlóné; Füle, Tibor; Papp, Zoltán; Kovalszky, Ilona",Pathol. oncol. res,534,1

Specifically, changes are measured in chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and case detection among patients aged 14-49 years during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: U.S. chlamydia and gonorrhea testing and positivity were analyzed on the basis of >18.6 million tests (13.6 million tests for female patients and 4.7 million tests for male patients) performed by a national reference clinical laboratory from January 2019 through June 2020. RESULTS: Chlamydia and gonorrhea testing reached a nadir in early April 2020, with decreases (relative to the baseline level) of 59% for female patients and 63% for male patients. Declines in testing were strongly associated with increases in weekly positivity rates for chlamydia (R2=0.96) and gonorrhea (R2=0.85).

ObjectiveTo determine the prevalence of previous infection, risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms following infection among university students. DesignThis was a cross-sectional study that surveyed students about demographics, risk factors, and symptoms, and simultaneously tested their saliva for IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. To estimate the prevalence of previous infection we adjusted our intentional sample of a diverse student population for year in school and age to resemble the composition of the entire student body, and adjusted for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the antibody test. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for infection. SettingA large public university in Athens, Georgia between January 22 and March 22, 2021. ParticipantsUndergraduate and graduate students; 488 completed the survey, 432 had a valid antibody result. and 428 had both. ExposurePrevious infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on measurement of IgA antibodies in saliva and adjustment for sample characteristics and test accuracy. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary outcome was the estimated prevalence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2. Secondary outcomes were independent risk factors for infection, and the prevalence of persistent symptoms among persons reporting a previous symptomatic infection. ResultsThe estimated prevalence of previous infection for 432 participants with valid antibody results was between 41% and 42%. Independent risk factors for infection included male sex, having a roommate with a known symptomatic infection, and having 2 or fewer roommates. More frequent attendance of parties and bars was a univariate risk factor, but not in the multivariate analysis. Of 122 students reporting a previous symptomatic infection, 14 (11.4%) reported persistent symptoms a median of 132 days later. Conclusions and RelevancePrevious infection with SARS-CoV-2, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, was common at a large university. Measures that could prevent resurgence of the infection when students return to campus include mandatory vaccination policies, mass surveillance testing, and testing of sewage for antigen to SARS-CoV-2.

We assessed the impact of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5 °C, and in the most polluted regions. However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19 growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and improve management plans.","Ficetola, Gentile Francesco; Rubolini, Diego",Sci Total Environ,534,16

Beyond the lungs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues, including the kidney, potentially contributing to acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesized that the renal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHODS: The expression of ACE 2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next-generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). RESULTS: Mean ACE 2 messenger RNA was increased approximately 2-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy control subjects (mean ± SD, 13.2±7.9 vs 7.7±3.6 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.001). No difference in transcript abundance was noted between recipients and nonrecipients of agents that block the RAAS (12.2±6.7 vs 16.2±10.7 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Increased ACE 2 messenger RNA in the diabetic kidney may increase the risk and/or severity of kidney infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of COVID-19 disease. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether this diabetes-related overexpression is generalizable to other tissues, most notably the lungs.","Gilbert, Richard E; Caldwell, Lauren; Misra, Paraish S; Chan, Kin; Burns, Kevin D; Wrana, Jeffrey L; Yuen, Darren A",,534,6

It is important to monitor, examine and understand the psychological effects the unprecedented challenge of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had.Aims To compare levels of psychological distress in UK dentists, before and during the pandemic, to determine if this was affected.Materials and methods An online survey collected demographic data, levels of psychological distress (GP-CORE) and experiences from UK dentists during the 'national lockdown' period of the pandemic. Statistical and thematic analyses were performed and data compared with previous research.Results Psychological distress was lower in UK dentists during the national lockdown period when compared to previous research using the same measure. GDPs, those in England and those with mixed commitment reported the highest levels of psychological distress. Most dentists had been affected by the pandemic. Some who were remotely working during this time valued the time away from the profession, relishing the absence of regulatory and contractual stressors, and used lockdown as an opportunity to re-evaluate their lives and careers. Others found the conditions stressful with some previously acknowledged stressors remaining and novel stressors introduced.Conclusions We argue that the altered balance of stressors and the resulting reduced psychological distress is further evidence of the need for reform of the profession to improve working lives. Given the importance of mental health and wellbeing, it is vital that monitoring continues.","Collin, Victoria; O Selmo, Ellena; Whitehead, Penny",Br. dent. j,534,16

It also helps online retailers keep track of the price fluctuations in a certain industry or special discounts on a specific product category. Moreover, an automated classification system may help to pinpoint incorrect or subjective categories suggested by an operator. In this study, we focus on product title classification of the grocery products. We perform a comprehensive comparison of six different text classification models to establish a strong baseline for this task, which involves testing both traditional and recent machine learning methods. In our experiments, we investigate the generalizability of the trained models to the products of other online retailers, the dynamic masking of infeasible subcategories for pretrained language models, and the benefits of incorporating product titles in multiple languages. Our numerical results indicate that dynamic masking of subcategories is effective in improving prediction accuracy. In addition, we observe that using bilingual product titles is generally beneficial, and neural network-based models perform significantly better than SVM and XGBoost models. Lastly, we investigate the reasons for the misclassified products and propose future research directions to further enhance the prediction models.","Jahanshahi, Hadi; Ozyegen, Ozan; Cevik, Mucahit; Bulut, Beste; Yigit, Deniz; Gonen, Fahrettin F.; Bacsar, Aycse",,534,24

Since then, the virus has caused severe morbidity and mortality worldwide and has put pressure on the global medical system. Still, there are limited data regarding the clinical impact of COVID-19 on people living with HIV (PLWH). The primary aim of this study is therefore to systematically review up-to-date studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 amongst HIV patients. Methods: A thorough literature search was carried out using Medline, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library Databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 22 studies were identified. Amongst 730 HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients, 79.4% were males, median age was 51.5 and the number of reported patients receiving Antiretroviral drugs was 708 (97.2%). Most coinfected patients had mild to moderate symptoms including majorly cough 37.75%, fever 37.53% and Dyspnea 24.72%. Among pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension (26.3%) was the most prevalent in HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients, and 87% of coinfected patients have recovered. Conclusion: Based on the existing data in this systematic literature review, HIV patients with pre-existing comorbidities, obesity and of older age should be considered as a high-risk group for COVID-19. Furthermore, coinfected patients appears to have a marginally comparable clinical outcomes with the general population. The study's findings highlight the need for further investigation to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 infection in HIV patients.","Massarvva, Thomas",Epidemiol Health,534,1

They are widely available, cheap, and well-tolerated. Based on statins’ pleiotropic properties, including improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant properties, atherosclerotic plaque stabilization, and inhibition of inflammatory responses, it can be hypothesized that the use of statins, at least as an adjuvant in antiviral therapy, may be justified. All these effects might be especially beneficial in patients with COVID-19, suffering from endothelial dysfunction, microvascular and macrovascular thrombosis, and cytokine storm. Here, we review the recent data regarding the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 activity in host cells, proposed COVID-19 therapy, the pleiotropic activity of statins, and statins in clinical trials in respiratory infections. According to the guidelines of the European and American Cardiac Societies, in patients with cardiovascular disease or high cardiovascular risk with concomitant COVID-19 it is recommended to continue statin treatment. However, the initiation of statin therapy de novo in COVID-19 treatment should only be done as part of a clinical trial.","Olszewska-Parasiewicz, Justyna Szarpak Łukasz Rogula Sylwester Gąsecka Aleksandra Szymańska Urszula Kwiatkowska Maria Jaguszewski Milosz J.; Sierpiński, Radosław Zaczyński Artur Wierzba Waldemar Kosior Dariusz A.",Life,534,20

The pandemic spread across the globe, infecting more than ten million people and disrupting several businesses. Although social distancing and the use of protective masks were suggested all over the world, the cases seem to rise, which led to worldwide lockdown in different phases. The rampant escalation in the number of cases, the global effects, and the lockdown may have a severe effect on the psychology of people. The emergency protocols implemented by the authorities also lead to increased use in the number of multimedia devices. Excessive use of such devices may also contribute to psychological disorders. Hence, hence it is necessary to analyze the state of mind of people during the lockdown. In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis of Twitter data during the pandemic lockdown, i.e., two weeks and four weeks after the lockdown was imposed. Investigating the sentiments of people in the form of positive, negative, and neutral tweets would assist us in determining how people are dealing with the pandemic and its effects on a psychological level. Our study shows that the lockdown witnessed more number positive tweets globally on multiple datasets. This is indicative of the positivity and optimism based on the sentiments and psychology of Twitter users worldwide. The study will be effective in determining people's mental well-being and will also be useful in devising appropriate lockdown strategies and crisis management in the future.","Priyadarshini, Ishaani; Mohanty, Pinaki; Kumar, Raghvendra; Sharma, Rohit; Puri, Vikram; Singh, Pradeep Kumar",Multimed Tools Appl,534,20

Preliminary data suggest that the efficacy of rTMS is reduced in patients taking benzodiazepines (BZD). Here, we use real-world data from a large sample to investigate the influence of lorazepam on the effectiveness of rTMS. METHODS: From a retrospective cohort of clinically depressed patients that were treated with rTMS, we compared 176 patients not taking any BZD with 73 patients taking lorazepam with respect to changes in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS). RESULTS: Both groups improved during rTMS according to HRDS scores, but the amelioration of symptoms was significantly less pronounced in patients taking lorazepam (18% vs. 38% responders in the non-lorazepam group). We could not see any association of intake regimen of lorazepam with response in rTMS. CONCLUSION: Our observational study suggests that intake of lorazepam impedes the response to rTMS. The impact of lorazepam and other BZD on rTMS should receive more attention and be further investigated in prospective, hypothesis-based treatment studies to determine causal relationships between medication treatments and outcome. This could lead to specific recommendations for pharmacological treatment for depressed patients undergoing rTMS.","Deppe, M; Abdelnaim, M; Hebel, T; Kreuzer, P M; Poeppl, T B; Langguth, B; Schecklmann, M",Eur. arch. psychiatr. clin. neurosci,534,1

This paper describes the incidence and factors associated with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malawi. METHODOLOGY: This was a retrospective study of public data analysing geopolitical and immigration activities that occurred between 02 April and 08 September 2020. The Chi-square test of independence was used to tabulate sex and age-related fatality ratios among deaths due to COVID-19-related complications. RESULTS: The drivers for COVID-19 spread were mass gatherings secondary to the country's political landscape and repatriation of citizens from high-risk areas coupled with minimum use of public health interventions. The prevalence was higher in people aged 50-59 years, males and in urban areas. Men had an increased risk of COVID-19-related deaths (Case Fatality Ratio: 1.58 (95% CI 1.11-2.22) compared with women. Furthermore, men and women aged &#8805;40 years were 16.1 times and 7.1 times more likely to die of COVID-related complications, respectively. Men aged &#8805;40 years had a 62% increased risk of deaths compared with women of the same age group. CONCLUSION: Mass political gatherings and cross-border immigration from high-risk areas were drivers for infection. Males, older age and urban residence were associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

We aimed to evaluate the impact on mortality of an early assessment of cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Humanitas Clinical and Research Hospital (Rozzano-Milan, Lombardy, Italy) is a tertiary centre that has been converted to the management of COVID-19. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were entered in a dedicated database for cohort observational analyses. Outcomes were stratified according to elevated levels (ie, above the upper level of normal) of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-TnI), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or both measured within 24 hours after hospital admission. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 397 consecutive patients with COVID-19 were included up to 1 April 2020. At the time of hospital admission, 208 patients (52.4%) had normal values for cardiac biomarkers, 90 (22.7%) had elevated both hs-TnI and BNP, 59 (14.9%) had elevated only BNP and 40 (10.1%) had elevated only hs-TnI. The rate of mortality was higher in patients with elevated hs-TnI (22.5%, OR 4.35, 95% CI 1.72 to 11.04), BNP (33.9%, OR 7.37, 95% CI 3.53 to 16.75) or both (55.6%, OR 18.75, 95% CI 9.32 to 37.71) as compared with those without elevated cardiac biomarkers (6.25%). A multivariate analysis identified concomitant elevation of both hs-TnI and BNP as a strong independent predictor of all-cause mortality (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.06 to 9.93). CONCLUSIONS: An early detection of elevated hs-TnI and BNP predicts mortality in patients with COVID-19. Cardiac biomarkers should be systematically assessed in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospital admission in order to optimise risk stratification.","Stefanini, Giulio G; Chiarito, Mauro; Ferrante, Giuseppe; Cannata, Francesco; Azzolini, Elena; Viggiani, Giacomo; De Marco, Andrea; Briani, Martina; Bocciolone, Monica; Bragato, Renato; Corrada, Elena; Gasparini, Gabriele L; Marconi, Manuel; Monti, Lorenzo; Pagnotta, Paolo A; Panico, Cristina; Pini, Daniela; Regazzoli, Damiano; My, Ilaria; Kallikourdis, Marinos; Ciccarelli, Michele; Badalamenti, Salvatore; Aghemo, Alessio; Reimers, Bernhard; Condorelli, Gianluigi",Heart,534,16

In this context, a Slovak nationwide survey on forests was conducted, with the main objective of casting light on possible changes in NFV as a coping mechanism or behavioral response to the discomfort and severe restrictions stemming from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the related measures. The survey was administered on a statistically representative sample after the pandemic's first wave ebbed and restrictions were eased in the summer months of 2020. Collected data were assessed using ANOVA, the results of which supported the importance of forests as places providing opportunities for restoration of mental and physical resources. Forest accessibility as represented by forest coverage and settlement size emerged as a paramount factor affecting NFV rates both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and its accompanying measures affected the relationships between NFV and average per capita income, type of employment, and most importantly age, highlighting possible vulnerabilities and disadvantages in certain population segments.","Pichlerová, Magdaléna; Önkal, Dilek; Bartlett, Anthony; Výbostok, Jozef; Pichler, Viliam",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),534,26

Moreover, up to 63% of patients experience persistent symptoms, including fatigue, after acute illness. Endocrine systems are vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 as many glands express the ACE2 receptor, used by the SARS-CoV-2 virion for cellular access. However, the effects of COVID-19 on adrenal and thyroid gland function after acute COVID-19 remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to evaluate adrenal and thyroid gland function in COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A prospective, observational study was undertaken at the Clinical Research Facility, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust, including 70 patients &#8805;18 years of age, at least 3 months after diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants attended a research study visit (8:00-9:30 am), during which a short Synacthen test (250 µg IV bolus) and thyroid function assessments were performed. RESULTS: All patients had a peak cortisol &#8805;450 nmol/L after Synacthen, consistent with adequate adrenal reserve. Basal and peak serum cortisol did not differ according to disease severity or history of dexamethasone treatment during COVID-19. There was no difference in baseline or peak cortisol after Synacthen or in thyroid function tests, or thyroid status, in patients with fatigue (nâ =â 44) compared to those without (nâ =â 26). CONCLUSION: Adrenal and thyroid function &#8805;3 months after presentation with COVID-19 was preserved. While a significant proportion of patients experienced persistent fatigue, their symptoms were not accounted for by alterations in adrenal or thyroid function. These findings have important implications for the clinical care of patients after COVID-19.","Clarke, Sophie A; Phylactou, Maria; Patel, Bijal; Mills, Edouard G; Muzi, Beatrice; Izzi-Engbeaya, Chioma; Choudhury, Sirazum; Khoo, Bernard; Meeran, Karim; Comninos, Alexander N; Abbara, Ali; Tan, Tricia; Dhillo, Waljit S",J Clin Endocrinol Metab,534,16

Roche's cobas® Liat® SARS-CoV-2 & Influenza A/B Nucleic Acid Test used on the cobas® Liat® was granted approval under FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for nasopharyngeal (NP) and nasal swabs collected in viral/universal transport medium (VTM/UTM). However, there is a critical need for media that inactivates the virus, especially when specimens are collected in decentralized settings. This study aimed to investigate the use of PrimeStore Molecular Transport Medium® (PS-MTM®), designed to inactivate/kill and stabilize RNA/DNA for ambient transport and pre-processing of collected samples. METHODS: A limit of detection (LOD) using serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PS-MTM® and routine UTM was established using standard qPCR. Additionally, a clinical panel of NP and oral swabs collected in PS-MTM® collected during the 2020 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were evaluated on the cobas® Liat® and compared to 'gold standard' qPCR on an ABI-7500 instrument. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 RNA LOD using standard qPCR was equivalent on the cobas® Liat® instrument. cobas® Liat® detection from oral/NP swabs in PS-MTM® media exhibited equivalent positive percent agreement (100%) and negative percent agreement (96.4%). CONCLUSION: PS-MTM® and the Roche cobas® Liat® are compatible and complimentary devices for respiratory specimen collection and rapid disease detection, respectively. PS-MTM® is equivalent to standard VTM/UTM with the added benefit of safe, non-infectious sample processing for near-patient testing.","Daum, Luke T; Fischer, Gerald W",,534,15

The aim of this study was to explore experiences of CIM and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspectives of children and their parents. We completed 21 family (at least one parent and one child aged 7-12) semi-structured interviews with 45 participants living in small urban and rural areas of British Columbia, Canada. Three themes were identified through a reflexive thematic analysis: (1) keeping everyone safe from COVID-19; (2) change in pattern and types of activity; (3) social impacts with family, friends, and community. Participants expressed a perceived increase in unstructured activity and a decrease in structured physical activity during the pandemic, which many parents viewed as a positive change. Parents and children indicated negative feelings due to spending less time with peers and reflected positively about spending more time with family. Parents and children expressed fear and anxiety in trying to keep their families safe from virus spread and creativity in adapting play behaviours. Findings highlight the impact of the pandemic on social friendship networks for families and a shift in activity patterns for children toward unstructured play.","Pelletier, Chelsea A; Cornish, Katie; Sanders, Caroline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),534,22

We have recently shown that a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) strain LaSota expressing the spike (S) protein of IBV strain Mass-41 (rLaSota/IBV-S) was a promising vaccine candidate for IBV. Here we evaluated a novel chimeric rNDV/avian paramyxovirus serotype 2 (rNDV/APMV-2) as a vaccine vector against IBV. The rNDV/APMV-2 vector was chosen because it is much safer than the rNDV strain LaSota vector, particularly for young chicks and chicken embryos. In order to determine the effectiveness of this vector, a recombinant rNDV/APMV-2 expressing the S protein of IBV strain Mass-41 (rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S) was constructed. The protective efficacy of this vector vaccine was compared to that of the rNDV vector vaccine. In one study, groups of one-day-old specific-pathogenic-free (SPF) chickens were immunized with rLaSota/IBV-S and rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S and challenged four weeks later with the homologous highly virulent IBV strain Mass-41. In another study, groups of broiler chickens were single (at day one or three weeks of age) or prime-boost (prime at day one and boost at three weeks of age) immunized with rLaSota/IBV-S and/or rNDV-APMV-2/IBV-S. At weeks six of age, chickens were challenged with a highly virulent IBV strain Mass-41. Our challenge study showed that novel rNDV/APMV-2/IBV-S provided similar protection as rLaSota/IBV-S in SPF chickens. However, compared to prime-boost immunization of chickens with chimeric rNDV/APMV-2, rLaSota/IBV-S and/or a live IBV vaccine, single immunization of chickens with rLaSota/IBV-S, or live IBV vaccine provided better protection against IBV. In conclusion, we have developed the novel rNDV/APMV-2 vector expressing S protein of IBV that can be a safer vaccine against IB in chickens. Our results also suggest a single immunization with a LaSota vectored IBV vaccine candidate provides better protection than prime-boost immunization regimens.","Shirvani, Edris; Samal, Siba K",Viruses,534,26

To our surprise, many people have been tested positive twice. Few cases of true reinfections involved genetic alterations in the virus. Appearance of multiple positive tests may be due to human errors or remnant genetic material, but genetic modification in virus represents very serious issue of controlling this pandemic. It is the need of the day that all the gaps and deficiencies, represented by variable response of adaptive immune system toward this infection, be filled and rectified. We have discussed reinfections with variable outcomes along with the possible reasons for variable response. Phenomena such as T cell memory, absence of cross-reactive immunity, T cell exhaustion, drawbacks pertaining to neutralizing antibodies, and immune enhancement are crucial areas by which adaptive immune response can weaken considerably. Earlier and stronger herd immunity is also at the mercy of strong adaptive immune system to avoid future pandemics by the same microorganism. Likewise, consequences of this phenomenon should also be considered during vaccine development as resources worth billions are being used and staked. Many countries have entered the second/third waves of COVID-19. Therefore, we need to come up with ways toward uniform strengthening of adaptive immune response to fight off this pandemic. Also, to develop and maintain constant resistance to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the mentioned weakened links in the chain of adaptive immunity may be explored to keep viral invasion and physiological damage to minimum.","Ahsan, Haseeb; Sonn, Jong Kyung; Lee, Young Sup; Islam, Salman Ul; Khalil, Saifullah Khan",Viral immunol,534,24

We developed a rapid practice improvement project to allow for a hybrid virtual medical SRP/in-person medical SRP to decrease exposure risk. A retrospective review comparing this virtual SRP to a historical in-person SRP cohort to the same combatant command was then performed. PROCEDURES: A virtual medical SRP was completed for 204 soldiers in preparation for deployment within 24 hours of receiving the deployment roster. Each soldier had their MEDPROS data sheet printed and reviewed for deficiencies. Soldiers were then divided into two groups. Group 1 required hybrid SRP with need for in-person labs or vaccinations. Group 2 had no deficiencies noted on MEDPROS review, and the entire medical SRP was done virtually. Pre-deployment health assessment (pre-DHA) was completed over the phone for both groups. The provider then determined whether the soldier was a GO or NO GO, and this information was passed to the unit's medical staff. Comparative data analysis was performed using t-tests assuming unequal variances and chi-square tests. INFORMATION FOUND: A total of 204 soldiers were expected to complete the virtual SRP process. Of those 204, 191 MEDPROS records were reviewed (93%). Seventy-seven of the 191 soldiers (40%) required level one labs and immunizations, had not completed their pre-DHA, or had a combination of these factors. One hundred and fourteen soldiers (60%) had these items completed and were given virtual appointments in GENESIS. One hundred and six of the 114 (95%) soldiers were able to complete their medical SRP virtually. Eighty-six soldiers (80%) of this cohort were a GO for deployment at the end of their virtual SRP visit.The novel virtual SRP process was comparable to the historic in-person SRP as evidenced by no statistically significant difference in terms of the number of providers required and the number of soldiers that was seen by any one provider. The groups did show statistically significant differences based on age, gender, and GOs/NO GOs. CONCLUSION: This is the first proof of concept of a virtual medical SRP on literature review. A virtual SRP process that combines a pre-visit record review with a virtual pre-DHA is a viable process for SRP. The ability to utilize providers outside of a confined location or post may allow for optimized utilization of this scarce resource and result in cost savings to the Army. The recreation of this virtual medical SRP within other Army installations may allow for the improvement and standardization of the medical SRP process as a whole.","Ramirez, Ariana; Owshalimpur, David; Mount, Cristin; Schofield, Christina",Mil. med,534,13

Food involvement - the amount of time we spend on food beyond the immediate act of eating and tasting - is key to the human food experience. We took a biological approach to test whether food-related behaviors, together capturing food involvement, have genetic components and are partly due to inherited variation. We collected data via an internet survey from a genetically informative sample of 419 adult twins (114 monozygotic twin pairs, 31 dizygotic twin pairs, and 129 singletons). Because we conducted this research during the pandemic, we also ascertained how many participants had experienced COVID-19-associated loss of taste and smell. Since these respondents had previously participated in research in person, we measured their level of engagement to evaluate the quality of their online responses. Additive genetics explained 16-44% of the variation in some measures of food involvement, most prominently various aspects of cooking, suggesting some features of the human food experience may be inborn. Other features reflected shared (early) environment, captured by respondents twin status. About 6% of participants had a history of COVID-19 infection, many with transitory taste and smell loss, but all but one had recovered before the survey. Overall, these results suggest that people may have inborn as well as learned variations in their involvement with food. We also learned to adapt to research during a pandemic by considering COVID-19 status and measuring engagement in online studies of human eating behavior.","Hannum, Mackenzie E.; Lin, Cailu; Bell, Katherine A; Toskala, Aurora K; Koch, Riley R; Galaniha, Tharaka; Nolden, Alissa; Reed, Danielle R.; Joseph, Paule Valery",,534,1

METHODS: Fifty first-year dental hygiene students were randomly divided into three groups using ultrasound toothbrushes with different frequencies (1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 MHz) twice a day (3-min sessions) for 8 weeks. Plaque index (PlI) and gingival index (GI) scores were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks. RESULTS: Changes in GI scores from baseline to 8 weeks tended to differ among the groups (p = 0.0862). The GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 and 4.8 MHz groups at 8 weeks (3.2 MHz group: p < 0.01, 4.8 MHz group: p < 0.05). At 4 weeks, the GI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group (p < 0.05) and tended to be lower in the 4.8 MHz group (p = 0.07). The PlI was significantly lower in the 3.2 MHz group at 8 weeks (p < 0.01) and tended to be lower in the 1.6 and 4.8 MHz groups (1.6 MHz: p = 0.07, 4.8 MHz: p = 0.05). In addition, the PlI was significantly lower in the 4.8 MHz group at 4 weeks (p < 0.05). No significant differences in the changes in any measurements were observed among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that ultrasound toothbrushes with different frequencies probably have different effects on oral hygiene. However, it is difficult to conclude strongly that higher frequency ultrasound toothbrushes are more effective as there were some limitations.","Takenouchi, Akane; Otani, Etsuyo; Satoho, Yukiko; Kakegawa, Yumiko; Arai, Hiroe; Matsukubo, Takashi",Int. j. dent. hyg,534,29

PMD commonly has an acute course and may be associated with Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the epidemiological and clinical data, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome of CMV-associated PMD. The medical charts of the patients with PMD and CMV infection diagnosed at our hospital have been reviewed. Then, a systematic literature's review of all the cases of PMD and a selection of those associated with CMV infection have been performed. Three previously healthy boys were admitted for vomiting and oedema. Endoscopy showed hypertrophic gastric folds and CMV infection was diagnosed. Albumin was administered in all cases, with clinical resolution within few weeks. In literature, PMD has been described in 150 children and the association between CMV and PMD was found in 89 cases. Clinical and laboratory data, radiological and histological exams, therapy and outcome were reviewed.Conclusions: Basing on the present experience and on the current knowledge, PMD has a benign course without long-term sequelae. Although PMD is rare in children, we recommend paediatricians to consider CMV-related PMD when facing children with vomiting and diffuse oedema. What is Known: â¢ Paediatricians should consider Menetrier disease (MD) when facing oedematous child complaining of abdominal symptoms with hypoalbuminemia, without proteinuria and liver dysfunction. â¢ Typical ultrasound features (hypertrophic gastric folds) suggest such condition which requires endoscopy and biopsy for definitive diagnosis. What is New: â¢ A familial susceptibility to CMV gastric infection has been recently suggested; thus when suspecting MD, the family history of gastric diseases should be investigated. â¢ Menetrier disease has been found associated with other unusual conditions either benign (such as gastric bezoar) or malign as neoplasms (acute lymphatic leukaemia and adenocarcinoma) even in children.","Barbati, Federica; Marrani, Edoardo; Indolfi, Giuseppe; Lionetti, Paolo; Trapani, Sandra",Eur. j. pediatr,534,25

Yet, few studies have examined risk factors unique to adult development. The present study examined how changes in life roles (educational, marital, and parental status) predicted disordered eating as participants transitioned from their 20s to their 50s. Participants (N = 624 women and N = 276 men) completed baseline assessments in college and at 10-, 20-, and 30-year follow-up, with 72% of women and 67% of men completing 30-year follow-up. Multilevel models examined how changes in life roles predicted changes in disordered eating. For women, obtaining a graduate degree predicted decreased eating pathology initially but over time predicted subsequent increases in Drive for Thinness. Men's eating pathology was not affected by obtaining a graduate degree. Changes in marital status demonstrated no significant association with disordered eating for either gender. Becoming a parent predicted a significant decrease in Drive for Thinness at the subsequent assessment but no further declines with age, whereas those who never had children showed significant decreases in both Drive for Thinness and Bulimia with age. For both women and men, becoming a parent may decrease the importance of shape and weight as sources of self-evaluation. However, women obtaining advanced degrees and parents may experience shifts in eating pathology related to the ""Career-and-Care-Crunch"" according to Mehta and colleagues' (2020) recent conceptualization of adult developmental stages. Pending independent replication, future research might design interventions for those whose role transitions put them at greater risk for disordered eating during midlife.

Several deep learning-based artificial intelligence systems can be used in diagnosis, one of the most popular is using the previously proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which has promising accuracy in detecting COVID-19 confirmed patients using CXR images. In this study, to detect COVID-19 confirmed patients by classifying them into 4 classes, we propose a modified combination of two CNN architectures named Xception and ResNet50V2 which makes the system powerful using multiple feature extraction capabilities the proposed method achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, reaching 93.412%, 96.6%, 99.6%, and 98%, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be used as an automatic diagnosis system that can be utilized by clinical practitioners and radiologists to diagnose, validate, and follow-up of COVID-19 suspected cases. © 2021 IEEE.","Fitriasari, H.

The H-2 blocker famotidine has been suggested as an FDA-approved drug that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. Famotidine has since been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce symptom severity in patients acutely ill with COVID-19. Other studies have suggested that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) might have an association with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether famotidine or any other antireflux medications have a prophylactic or detrimental effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection when taken regularly for the management of acid reflux. METHODS: An anonymous, web-based survey was distributed via email to adult otolaryngology patients to collect demographic data, past medical history, medication history, incidence of symptoms associated with COVID-19, potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and results of any PCR or serological testing. Associations between reflux medications and incidence of COVID-19 cases were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Chi-square with Fisher's exact test, Point-Biserial correlation, Kendall's-tau-b, independent samples t test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate. A binary logistic regression model was fit to determine probability of COVID-19 cases after adjustment for other risk factors. RESULTS: There were 307 patients who responded to the survey. The average age of respondents was 52.63 ± 17.03. Famotidine use was not associated with incidence of laboratory-confirmed (P= 0.717) or symptomatically suspected (P= 0.876) COVID-19. No other reflux medications were found to be significant predictors for laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (P> 0.05). Younger age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.020-1.065, P< 0.001), high risk obesity (OR = 4.005, 95% CI: 1.449-11.069, P= 0.007), and use of a corticosteroid nasal spray (OR = 3.529, 95% CI: 1.352-9.211, P= 0.010) were significant predictors for symptomatically suspected COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between incidence of COVID-19 and use of reflux medications, including famotidine at doses used orally to manage reflux and high dose PPIs. Reflux medications did not protect against or increase the risk of COVID-19.","Balouch, Bailey; Vontela, Swetha; Yeakel, Heather; Alnouri, Ghiath; Sataloff, Robert T",J. voice,534,13

This study explored experiences of individuals who underwent institutional quarantine in Uganda to inform measures to increase its effectiveness and reduce its associated negative impact. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative description study using in-depth interviews with 20 purposively selected individuals who had spent time in institutional quarantine facilities. These were mainly phone-based interviews that were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Electronic data coding was conducted using Atlas.ti 7 software. Thematic content analysis was used to synthesize the findings with similar codes grouped to form sub-themes and ultimately study themes. The findings are presented thematically with typical participant quotes. RESULTS: Study participants spent between 14 to 25 days in institutional quarantine. Four themes emerged describing the experiences of study participants during institutional quarantine, which determined whether participants' experiences were positive or negative. These themes were: quarantine environment including facility related factors and compliance with COVID-19 measures; quarantine management factors of entity paying the costs, communication and days spent in quarantine; individual factors comprising attitude towards quarantine, fears during and post-quarantine and coping mechanisms; and linkage to other services such as health care and post-quarantine follow-up. CONCLUSION: The planning, management and implementation of the quarantine process is a key determinant of the experiences of individuals who undergo the measure. To improve the experience of quarantined individuals and reduce its associated negative impact, the pre-quarantine process should be managed to comply with standards, quarantined persons should be provided as much information as possible, their quarantine duration should kept short and costs of the process ought to be minimised. Furthermore, quarantine facilities should be assessed for suitability and monitored to comply with guidelines while avenues for access to healthcare for the quarantined need to be arranged and any potential stigma associated with quarantine thoroughly addressed.","Ndejjo, Rawlance; Naggayi, Gloria; Tibiita, Ronald; Mugahi, Richard; Kibira, Simon P S",BMC Public Health,534,0

Polypharmacy increases the probability of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Amongst these, DDIs involving clopidogrel, the most commonly utilized platelet P2Y12 inhibitor, is a topic of potential clinical concern. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews DDIs between clopidogrel and drugs which are widely used in clinical practice. In particular, drugs shown to interfere with the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of clopidogrel and the clinical implications of these findings are reviewed. These drugs include inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, statins, calcium channel blockers, antidiabetic agents, and antimicrobial agents. For the references, we searched PubMed, EMBASE, or the Cochrane Library. EXPERT OPINION: Clopidogrel-drug interactions are common. Most of these DDIs are limited to laboratory findings showing an impact on clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects. While variability in clopidogrel-induced antiplatelet effects is known to affect clinical outcomes, with high platelet reactivity being associated with thrombotic complications among patients undergoing coronary stenting, most studies assessing the clinical implications of clopidogrel-drug interactions have not shown to significantly affect outcomes. However, awareness of these DDIs remains important for optimizing the selection of concomitant therapies.","Lee, Chang Hoon; Franchi, Francesco; Angiolillo, Dominick J",Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,534,29

The viral infection initiates inflammatory responses leading to endothelial damage and coagulation cascade dysfnction. Spread of COVID-19 has been associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and subsequent coagulopathy. Initially coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients result in significant elevation of D-dimer, fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and abnormalities in coagulatory parameters, which resulting in formation of thrombus and eventually death. METHODOLOGY: Present report intends to summarize the information of the research reports available so far on the complications of formation of unusal blood clots (thrombosis) during COVID-19 infection and its therapeutic strategies. Extensive web search was done for various reports associating COVID-19 infection with increased coagulopathy and abnormal coagulatory parameters such as PT, PTT, and platelet counts; along with increased D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Findings of these research reports were summarized to recommend cautions for clinicians while treating COVID-19 patient. Screening of coagulatory parameters upon admission and during entire course of treatment is recommended, especially those who are at increased risk of thrombosis. Also, anticoagulant treatment can be used as thromboprophylaxis measure. Dose and duration of anticoagulation treatment requirement may vary and thus regular monitoring is needed.","Srivastava, Swati; Garg, Iti; Bansal, Anju; Kumar, Bhuvnesh",Clin Chim Acta,534,17

We investigated the prevalence and correlates of STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak (March-July 2020). METHODS: Data come from the baseline assessment of a cohort of Spanish hospital workers (n = 5450), recruited from 10 hospitals just after the height of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak (May 5-July 23, 2020). Web-based self-report surveys assessed 30-day STB, individual characteristics, and potentially modifiable contextual factors related to hospital workers' work and financial situation. RESULTS: Thirty-day STB prevalence was estimated at 8.4% (4.9% passive ideation only, 3.5% active ideation with or without a plan or attempt). A total of n = 6 professionals attempted suicide in the past 30 days. In adjusted models, 30-day STB remained significantly associated with pre-pandemic lifetime mood (odds ratio [OR] = 2.92) and anxiety disorder (OR = 1.90). Significant modifiable factors included a perceived lack of coordination, communication, personnel, or supervision at work (population-attributable risk proportion [PARP] = 50.5%), and financial stress (PARP = 44.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Thirty-day STB among hospital workers during the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 outbreak was high.

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD: The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS: The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm ± 1.99 and 0.94 ± 0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1% ± 0.115 and 98.5% ± 0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3% ± 0.110 and 96.1% ± 0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8% ± 0.09 and 14% ± 0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.","Xu, Guoping; Udupa, Jayaram K; Tong, Yubing; Odhner, Dewey; Cao, Hanqiang; Torigian, Drew A",Med. phys,534,24

Current efforts to treat Covid-19 are based on this strategy. The first drugs used in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were antimalarial drugs. It is their mechanism of action, i. e., rise in endosomal pH, which recommends them against the new coronavirus. Disregarding their side effects, the study of their antiviral activity provides valuable hints for the choice and design of drugs against SARS-CoV-2. One prominent drug candidate is thymoquinone, an antimalarial substance contained in Nigella sativa - most likely one of the first antimalarial drugs in human history. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the number of articles relating thymoquinone to Covid-19 continuously increases. Here, we use it as an exemplary model drug, compare its antiviral mechanism with that of conventional antimalarial drugs and establish an irreducible parametric scheme for the identification of drugs with a potential in Covid-19.Translation into the laboratory is simple. Starting with the discovery of Nigella sativa seeds in the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, we establish a physicochemical model for the interaction of thymoquinone with both coronavirus and cells. Exploiting the predictive capability of the model, we provide a generalizable scheme for the systematic choice and design of drugs for Covid-19. An unexpected offshoot of our research is that Tutankhamun could not have died of malaria, a finding contrary to the mainstream theory.","Sommer, Andrei P; Försterling, Horst-Dieter; Sommer, Katlin E",Drug Res (Stuttg),534,26

PSO providers work with patients undergoing treatment, experiencing treatment delays and/or immuno-suppression in the context of a global pandemic. There is evidence to support the acceptability of telepsychology among cancer patients and an emerging need for data to inform the design and provision of telepsychology PSO care during the pandemic and beyond. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: This study examined engagement in telepsychology PSO care at an outpatient community cancer center. METHODS: The current study analyzed practice data from a PSO department from March 2020 through September 2020. The sample included 354 patients (91 established; 263 newly referred). Descriptive, correlational, and comparative analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Among established patients, 93% continued with telepsychology PSO care after the pandemic and 94% completed at least one telepsychology appointment. Among newly referred patients, 50.6% scheduled a telepsychology appointment, consistent with the scheduling rate for the proceeding calendar year (50%). Across patients scheduling telepsychology PSO appointments (N = 194), 68 initially engaged in phone-based services with 20 converting to video, for a total of 127 (76.5%) patients utilizing video-based PSO services. Common reasons for phone-based services included 'patient preference' (N = 14), 'lack of access' (N = 9), and 'technology barriers' (N = 8). During this timeframe, 18% had at least one no-show, which is significantly less than the preceding year (23%). Phone-based patients were significantly older (p =.007). A greater proportion of males engaged in phone-based services compared to females (p = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychology PSO engages new and existing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. There may be an increased demand for services and increased utilization in the context of the pandemic and the availability of telepsychology. There are disparities and access issues that should be considered and addressed.","Myers Virtue, Shannon; Howrey, Hillary L; Duffy, Nicole M; Wallace, Meaghan",J Psychosoc Oncol,534,14

Potential antiviral drugs used for the SARS-CoV-2 in clinical treatments have side effects. However, emergency vaccines are in use but despite that increase in the coronavirus cases are alarming. Thus, it is utmost need of safer antiviral agent to treat or inhibit the viral infection. Forskolin has been reported as a possible antiviral-agent. This molecule was docked with ACE2 receptor of human which is the target for the binding of S1 unit of viral S protein of SARSCoV-2. In silico docking was carried out on SwissDock, PatchDock and FireDock servers. The docked ACE2 structure was further docked with the RBD of the spike protein. Forskolin is able to H-bond with the hACE2 and ACE2-forskolin fails to interact with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Instead, viral RBD is repulsed by the diterpene molecule through obliteration and reciprocated binding. We report first that forskolin plays a crucial role in the inhibition of proteinprotein interaction of RBD and ACE2 when docked with either of the protein.

Confirmatory testing reduces overdiagnosis and nosocomial infection and enables real-world estimates of test specificity and positive predictive value. This study estimates these parameters to evaluate the impact of confirmatory testing and to improve clinical diagnosis, epidemiological estimation and interpretation of vaccine trials. METHODS: Over 1 month we took all respiratory samples from our laboratory with a patient's first detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay or in-house RT-PCR platform), and repeated testing using two platforms. Samples were categorized by source, and by whether clinical details suggested COVID-19 or corroborative testing from another laboratory. We estimated specificity and positive predictive value using approaches based on maximum likelihood. RESULTS: Of 19 597 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 107; 52 corresponded to first-time detection (0.27% of tests on samples without previous detection). Further testing detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA once or more ('confirmed') in 29 samples (56%), and failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA ('not confirmed') in 23 (44%). Depending upon assumed parameters, point estimates for specificity and positive predictive value were 99.91-99.98% and 61.8-89.8% respectively using the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay, and 97.4-99.1% and 20.1-73.8% respectively using an in-house assay. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleic acid amplification testing for SARS-CoV-2 is highly specific. Nevertheless, when prevalence is low a significant proportion of initially positive results fail to confirm, and confirmatory testing substantially reduces the detection of false positives. Omitting additional testing in samples with higher prior detection probabilities focuses testing where it is clinically impactful and minimizes delay.","Skittrall, Jordan P; Wilson, Michael; Smielewska, Anna A; Parmar, Surendra; Fortune, Mary D; Sparkes, Dominic; Curran, Martin D; Zhang, Hongyi; Jalal, Hamid",Clin. microbiol. infect,534,16

Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus' replication. Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses. In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results. Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 µM, respectively.","Gimeno, Aleix; Mestres-Truyol, Júlia; Ojeda-Montes, María José; Macip, Guillem; Saldivar-Espinoza, Bryan; Cereto-Massagué, Adrià; Pujadas, Gerard; Garcia-Vallvé, Santiago",,534,6

Activated neutrophils also release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in response to a variety of stimuli. These NETs are net-like complexes composed of cell-free DNA, histones and neutrophil granule proteins. Besides the evolutionarily conserved mechanism to capture and eliminate pathogens, NETs are also associated with pathophysiological processes of various diseases. Here, we elucidate the mechanisms of NET formation and their different implications in disease. We focused on autoinflammatory and cardiovascular disorders as the leading cause of death. Neutrophil extracellular traps are not only present in various cardiovascular diseases but play an essential role in atherosclerotic plaque formation, arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Furthermore, NETosis can be considered as a source of autoantigens and maintains an inflammatory milieu promoting autoimmune diseases. Indeed, there is further need for research into the balance between NET induction, inhibition, and degradation in order to pharmacologically target NETs and their compounds without impairing the patient's immune defense. This review may be of interest to both basic scientists and clinicians to stimulate translational research and innovative clinical approaches.","Klopf, Johannes; Brostjan, Christine; Eilenberg, Wolf; Neumayer, Christoph",Int. j. mol. sci.

Due to the hazardous nature, infectious waste requires the design of a multi-tiered system to provide cost-efficient and eco-friendly services of waste collection, transportation, treatment, and final disposal. However, the impact of uncertainties has not been well studied in the existing literature. Considering the presence of random waste generation during a pandemic, we aim to answer the following questions: 1) where to locate temporary transfer stations and temporary treatment centers;2) how to plan collection tours among the small generation nodes and temporary transfer stations;3) how to plan the direct transportation from large generation nodes to treatment centers;4) how to transport waste from temporary transfer stations to treatment centers, and 5) how to transport wastes from treatment centers to disposal facilities. The relevant cost and associated risk are respectively formulated and assessed using a scenario-based bi-objective robust approach. The complexity of the resulting mathematical model motivated the adaption and comparison of three multi-objective optimization approaches, including the goal programming method, a lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff approach, and an augmented ɛ-constraint solution technique. A case study based on the real situation in Wuhan, China, during the COVID-19 outbreak is conducted to demonstrate the workability of the proposed model and provide managerial insights for infectious waste management. The computational results show that our proposed model can more than double the demand fulfillment rate at an approximately 40% lower cost when facing a distinctively high increment in infectious waste amount.","Zhao, Jiahong Wu Biaohua Ke Ginger Y.",Journal of Cleaner Production,534,26

The course was titled ""English for Pandemics"" and was administered via a Learning Management System (Edmodo). Materials/methods: Needs Analysis was (informally) deployed to trace participants' needs, preferences, and wants in order to shape the landscape of the treatment. The researcher employed a quasi-experimental design (a one-group, pretest-posttest design). Participants were pretested prior to the treatment. The treatment consisted of online exposure to eight units (English for Pandemics), capitalizing on Edmodo in content delivery, receipt, mastery, and assessment. Following the treatment, after 8 weeks, the participants were post-tested. Results: Quantitative results revealed a statistically significant difference in the participants' content knowledge regarding epidemiology and COVID-19. Qualitative findings divulged that participants highly appreciated Edmodo interactive features (simplicity, functionality, control, communal learning, and real-time feedback), and voiced their readiness to opt for Edmodo in future learning experiences. Conclusion: Based on empirical evidence, the current study argues that the Edmodo learning management system has the potential to push content delivery, receipt, mastery, and assessment in ESP courses to the next level.","El Messaoudi, Mohammed",Educational Process: International Journal,534,6

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and gain important new insights of a group interviewing method with vulnerable people and their support group, adapted and transferred online during COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: This research examines the experiences of 35 participants (nine family groups composed of parents and young people), involved in a research project that explores a sensitive topic, youth alcohol consumption and family communication, that was moved online during lockdown. Researcher reflections on running group interviews face-to-face prior to COVID- 19 and online during lockdown are included in the data. Findings: Thematic analysis of participant interviews and researcher reflections reveals four key benefits and three limitations of online group interviews with vulnerable people and their support group. The benefits include being comfortable, non-intrusive and safe; engaging and convenient; online communication ease and easy set-up. The limitations relate to lack of non-verbal communication, poor set-up, and privacy and access issues. Practical implications: The global environment is uncertain and being able to implement effective qualitative research online is essential for TSR and service research in the future. This paper provides a step by step procedure for an innovative online group interviewing technique that can be used by TSR and qualitative service researchers. Originality/value: Conducting research during a pandemic has provided unprecedented insights into qualitative research approaches and methodology. This paper contributes to literature on service and TSR methodology by providing a framework for researchers to investigate vulnerable groups online in an effective, safe and non-intrusive way. The framework also has the potential to be applied to other service contexts.","Dodds, Sarah; Hess, Alexandra Claudia",J. Serv. Manage.,534,16

Compounding this threat is the near certainty that novel coronaviruses with pandemic potential will emerge in years to come. Pan-coronavirus drugs-agents active against both SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses-would address both threats. A strategy to develop such broad-spectrum inhibitors is to pharmacologically target binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are highly conserved in other known coronaviruses, the assumption being that any selective pressure to keep a site conserved across past viruses will apply to future ones. Here we systematically mapped druggable binding pockets on the experimental structure of 15 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and analyzed their variation across 27 &#945;- and ß-coronaviruses and across thousands of SARS-CoV-2 samples from COVID-19 patients. We find that the two most conserved druggable sites are a pocket overlapping the RNA binding site of the helicase nsp13 and the catalytic site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12, both components of the viral replication-transcription complex. We present the data on a public web portal (https://www.thesgc.org/SARSCoV2_pocketome/), where users can interactively navigate individual protein structures and view the genetic variability of drug-binding pockets in 3D.","Yazdani, Setayesh; De Maio, Nicola; Ding, Yining; Shahani, Vijay; Goldman, Nick; Schapira, Matthieu",J Proteome Res,534,8

Couples’ relational wellbeing continues to be impacted by these COVID-19 related stressors. Protecting both personal and relational wellbeing is therefore particularly important at this time. Using a preventative intervention approach, the current paper argues the theoretical benefit of the Positive Massage programme and reports a qualitative analysis of stressed but healthy couples’ experience of engaging in the programme. Thirty-four participants completed 3 weekly classes and home-based practice of massage exchange. Data from an open text online questionnaire completed every week of the programme and again 3 weeks afterwards were analysed using thematic analysis. The identified themes included “holistic stress relief”, “relationship-promotion”, and “selves-care skill”. Couples perceived Positive Massage as an effective mutual support skill to relax and help one another by de-stressing, both emotionally and physically through verbal and nonverbal communication, creating gratitude, deeper connection and self-efficacy via quality time together and pleasurable touch. Theoretically and experientially, Positive Massage can be an effective preventative selves-care skill. Promoting the concept of selves-care and its practical application through Positive Massage would be beneficial for couples’ personal and relational wellbeing in a touch-deprived era. © 2021 by the authors.

We described characteristics of novel coronavirus infection cases and analyzed risk factors for severe outcomes.MethodsCases were persons with laboratory-confirmed novel coronavirus infection reported under national surveillance between January and March 2020. Clinical characteristics were described, and factors associated with severe outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, invasive ventilation/death) were analyzed using Poisson regression.ResultsAmong the 516 cases analyzed, median age was 60 years (range: 1-97 years) and 285 (55%) were male. Common symptoms/signs were fever (375/475, 79%), cough (353/465, 76%), and pneumonia (245/387, 63%). Ten (2%) cases died. Of the 348 cases with data, 50 (14%) required invasive ventilation. Adjusted for each other, male gender and 1-year increase in age were associated with ICU admission (risk ratio (RR) 4.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-10.32 and RR 1.05; 95%CI, 1.03-1.08, respectively) and invasive ventilation/death (RR 2.79; 95%CI, 1.49-5.21 and RR 1.06; 95%CI, 1.04-1.08). Diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lung diseases were also associated with severe outcomes. Of the 80 cases asymptomatic at hospitalization, 40 developed symptoms and five of them >70 years of age required invasive ventilation.ConclusionsThe early stage of the novel coronavirus epidemic in Japan disproportionately affected the elderly. Older age, male gender, and underlying conditions were associated with severe outcomes.

This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and prognosis of COPD patients among the population with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with positive PCR test were included in our multicentered, retrospective study. Patients with airway obstruction (previous spirometry) were included in 'COPD group'. RESULTS: The prevalence of COPD in COVID-19 patients was 4.96%(53/1069). There was a significant difference between COPD and non-COPD COVID-19 patients in terms of gender, mean age, presence of dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia and presence of pneumonia. The mortality rate was 13.2% in COPD, 7% in non-COPD patients(p = 0.092). The significant predictors of mortality were higher age, lymphopenia (p < 0.001), hypoxemia (p = 0.028), high D-dimer level (p = 0.011), and presence of pneumonia (p = 0.043) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our research is one of the first studies investigating characteristics of COPD patients with COVID-19 in Turkey. Although COPD patients had some poor prognostic features, there was no statistical difference between overall survival rates of two groups. Age, status of oxygenization, serum D-dimer level, lymphocyte count and pneumonia were significantly associated parameters with mortality in COVID-19.","Turan, Onur; Arpinar Yigitbas, Burcu; Turan, Pakize Ayse; Mirici, Arzu",Expert Rev Respir Med,534,21

In this work, we propose rapid production methods of an extended segment of the Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in HEK293SF cells cultured in suspension, in serum-free media, as a major component of a COVID-19 subunit vaccine under development. The expression of RBD, engineered with a sortase-recognition motif for protein-based carrier coupling, was achieved at high yields by plasmid transient transfection or human type-5-adenoviral infection of the cells, in a period of only two and three weeks, respectively. Both production methods were evaluated in 3L-controlled bioreactors with upstream and downstream bioprocess improvements, resulting in a product recovery with over 95% purity. Adenoviral infection led to over 100 µg/mL of RBD in culture supernatants, which was around 7-fold higher than levels obtained in transfected cultures. The monosaccharide and sialic acid content was similar in the RBD protein from the two production approaches. It also exhibited a proper conformational structure as recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against key native Spike epitopes. Efficient direct binding to ACE2 was also demonstrated at similar levels in RBD obtained from both methods and from different production lots. Overall, we provide bioprocess-related data for the rapid, scalable manufacturing of low cost RBD based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, with the added value of making a functional antigen available to support further research on uncovering mechanisms of virus binding and entry as well as screening for potential COVID-19 therapeutics.","Farnós, Omar; Venereo-Sánchez, Alina; Xu, Xingge; Chan, Cindy; Dash, Shantoshini; Chaabane, Hanan; Sauvageau, Janelle; Brahimi, Fouad; Saragovi, Uri; Leclerc, Denis; Kamen, Amine A",,534,20

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with anaemia, and to further explore the relationship between anaemia and the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective, observational study, a total of 222 confirmed patients admitted to Wuhan Ninth Hospital from December 1, 2019 to March 20, 2020 were recruited, including 79 patients with anaemia and 143 patients without anaemia. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, disease progression and prognosis were collected and analyzed. Risk factors associated with the severe illness in COVID-19 were established by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. RESULT: In our cohort, compared to patients without anaemia, patients with anaemia were more likely to have one or more comorbidities and severe COVID-19 illness. More patients demonstrated elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and creatinine in anaemia group. Levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), D-dimer, myoglobin, T-pro brain natriuretic peptide (T-pro-BNP) and urea nitrogen (BUN) in patients with anaemia were significantly higher than those without. In addition, the proportion of patients with dyspnoea, elevated CRP and PCT was positively associated with the severity of anaemia. The Odd Ratio (OR) of anaemia related to the severe condition of COVID-19 was 3.47(95% CI: 1.02-11.75, P=0.046) and 3.77 (95% CI:1.33-10.71, P=0.013) after adjustment for baseline date and laboratory indices, respectively. CONCLUSION: Anaemia is an independent risk factor associated with the severe illness of COVID-19, and healthcare professionals should be more sensitive to the haemoglobin levels of COVID-19 patients on admission. Awareness of anemia as a risk factor for COVID-19 was of great significance.

People with diabetes and related comorbidities are at increased risk of its complications and of COVID-19-related death. Older age, multi-morbidity, hyperglycaemia, cardiac injury and severe inflammatory response are predictors of poor outcome. The complex interplay between COVID-19, diabetes and the effects of related therapies is being explored. Most patients experience a mild illness with COVID-19, while people with diabetes are at increased risk of severe disease. Optimising glycaemic control and adopting measures to prevent disease spread are critical aspects. The management of mild disease is supportive, while very many immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies are being investigated for the treatment of severe disease. Several of these agents have specific considerations for use in people with diabetes. Since mass population lockdowns are considered a key step in controlling disease spread, it follows that, in addition to the direct vulnerability to severe COVID-19, people with diabetes can be affected by limited access to healthcare, insulin, other medications and blood glucose monitoring equipment. Measures to prevent disease spread at the individual and community level are the key to mitigating the rapidly escalating pandemic, while agents for chemoprophylaxis and vaccines are being explored. People with diabetes should be recognised as a vulnerable group for complicated disease and are at risk during times of disturbed social systems. Strategies are needed to safeguard the health of patients with diabetes during the pandemic.

To prevent the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and treat patients with mild symptoms, sports stadiums and convention centers were reconstructed into mobile hospitals. Research Question: It is unknown whether a mobile cabin hospital can provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. Study Design and Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 421 patients with COVID-19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan from February 9, 2020, to March 5, 2020. Clinical data comprised patient age, sex, clinical presentation, chest imaging, nucleic acid testing, length of hospitalization, and outcomes. Results: Of the patients who were discharged from the cabin hospital, 362 (86.0%) were categorized as recovered; 14.0% developed severe symptoms and were transferred to a designated hospital. The most common presenting symptoms were fever (60.6%) and cough (52.0%); 5.2% exhibited no obvious symptoms. High fever (> 39.0°C) was more common in severe cases than in recovered cases (18.6% vs 6.6%). The distribution of lung lesions was peripheral in 85.0% of patients, multifocal in 69.4%, and bilateral in 68.2%. The most common pattern was ground-glass opacity (67.7%), followed by patchy shadowing (49.2%). The incidence of patchy shadowing was higher in patients with severe disease (66.1%) than in those who recovered (31.8%, P < .0001). The median length of hospitalization was 17 days (interquartile range, 14-19 days), and the median time taken for positive real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results to become negative in recovered patients was 8 days (interquartile range, 6-10 days). Interpretation: Mobile cabin hospitals provide a safe treatment site for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms and offer an effective isolation area to prevent the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.","Wang, Wei; Xin, Can; Xiong, Zhongwei; Yan, Xixi; Cai, Yuankun; Zhou, Keyao; Xie, Chuanshun; Zhang, Tingbao; Wu, Xiaohui; Liu, Kui; Li, Zhiqiang; Chen, Jincao",Chest,534,26

With the evolution of the pandemic, skin lesions were observed. However, there is little information about the evolution of the lesions at this moment. The authors report a case of a patient who had more than one exposure to the coronavirus during the evolution of the disease and manifested different types of edematous lesions. The lesions started in the prodromal period and changed their presentation and localization during the evolution of COVID-19. The lesions regressed quickly with the use of corticoid cream and antihistamine. Viral skin lesions are frequent causes of exanthema. However, viral etiology is not always investigated in acute urticarial and atypical erythematous-edematous conditions. The immunological basis of acute urticaria has points in common with COVID-19, justifying the appearance of lesions. Investigation of viral etiology should always be remembered in acute urticarial and edematous conditions.","de Medeiros, Vanessa Lucilia Silveira; Silva, Lucas Fagundes Teixeira",Arch. dermatol. res,534,33

Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed. RESULTS: Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery. CONCLUSION: The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.","Dhiman, Yashaswi; Coshic, Poonam; Pandey, Hem Chandra; Khatiwada, Basanta; Singh, Jasmeet; Mehta, Vikas; Gupta, Sanjay",Transfus Med,534,24

Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance. Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes. The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes. This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience? METHODS: Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews. The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data. The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes. RESULTS: Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience. COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation. This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic. If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A326).","Sutter-Leve, Rachel; Passint, Emily; Ness, Debra; Rindflesch, Aaron",J Neurol Phys Ther,534,1

The current antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapeutic approaches are only supportive, have limited efficacy, and the prevention in reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is the best hope for public health. It is presumed that an effective vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection could mobilize the innate and adaptive immune responses and provide a protection against severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. As the race for the effective and safe vaccine has begun, different strategies were introduced. To date, viral vector-based vaccines, genetic vaccines, attenuated vaccines, and protein-based vaccines are the major vaccine types tested in the clinical trials. Over 80 clinical trials have been initiated; however, only 18 vaccines have reached the clinical phase II/III or III, and 4 vaccine candidates are under consideration or have been approved for the use so far. In addition, the protective effect of the off-target vaccines, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and measles vaccine, is being explored in randomized prospective clinical trials with SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. In this review, we discuss the most promising anti-COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and different vaccination strategies in order to provide more clarity into the ongoing clinical trials.","Strizova, Zuzana; Smetanova, Jitka; Bartunkova, Jirina; Milota, Tomas",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,534,1

The World Health Organisation has suggested that governments take a proactive response to vaccine hesitancy 'hotspots' based on social and behavioural insights. METHODS: Representative longitudinal online survey of over 3000 adults from Australia that examines the demographic, attitudinal, political and social attitudes and COVID-19 health behavior correlates of vaccine hesitance and resistance to a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: Overall, 59% would definitely get the vaccine, 29% had low levels of hesitancy, 7% had high levels of hesitancy and 6% were resistant. Females, those living in disadvantaged areas, those who reported that risks of COVID-19 was overstated, those who had more populist views and higher levels of religiosity were more likely to be hesitant or resistant while those who had higher levels of household income, those who had higher levels of social distancing, who downloaded the COVID-Safe App, who had more confidence in their state or territory government or confidence in their hospitals, or were more supportive of migration were more likely to intend to get vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that vaccine hesitancy, which accounts for a significant proportion of the population can be addressed by public health messaging but for a significant minority of the population with strongly held beliefs, alternative policy measures may well be needed to achieve sufficient vaccination coverage to end the pandemic.","Edwards, Ben; Biddle, Nicholas; Gray, Matthew; Sollis, Kate",PLoS One,534,6

Therefore, management of aGVHD is important for successful transplantation. Mucosal damage and alteration of the gut microbiota after allo-HSCT are key factors in the development of aGVHD. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the ability of prebiotics, which can alleviate mucosal damage and manipulate the gut microbiota, to mitigate posttransplantation complications, including aGVHD. Resistant starch (RS) and a commercially available prebiotics mixture, GFO, were administered to allo-HSCT recipients from pretransplantation conditioning to day 28 after allo-HSCT. Prebiotic intake mitigated mucosal injury and reduced the incidence of all aGVHD grades combined and of aGVHD grades 2 to 4. The cumulative incidence of skin aGVHD was markedly decreased by prebiotics intake. Furthermore, the gut microbial diversity was well maintained and butyrate-producing bacterial population were preserved by prebiotics intake. In addition, the posttransplantation fecal butyrate concentration was maintained or increased more frequently in the prebiotics group. These observations indicate that prebiotic intake may be an effective strategy for preventing aGVHD in allo-HSCT, thereby improving treatment outcomes and the clinical utility of stem cell transplantation approaches.

The behavioral changes caused by isolation have ranged from adaptation of consumption, work, and teaching routines to leisure options to occupy idle time at home. Such transformations can be positive by expanding the use of digital technologies, but they can also have serious future physical and emotional consequences if there is no conscious use of technological devices. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to validate the BCSDTSD instrument for assessing behavioral changes related to the use of digital technologies during social distancing. METHOD: Validation of the BCSDTSD in 5 phases: 1. construction of an initial scale with 10 questions; 2. evaluation of the questions by a panel of experts; 3. application to 1,012 volunteers via the internet; 4. statistical analysis of the results; and 5. preparation of the validated final version of the BCSDTSD. Data analysis used the dplyr, psy, and paran packages and the REdaS statistical program. Three statistical criteria were used in the factor analysis (FA). RESULTS: FA confirmed the maintenance of the 10 questions in the questionnaire, confirming its robust construction, and Cronbach's alpha reinforced the internal consistency with a value of 0.725, which is satisfactory for first-application questionnaires.

Private contact tracing (PCT) is one of the promising techniques for the purpose. However, the recently proposed Bluetooth-based PCT has several limitations in terms of functionality and flexibility. The existing systems are only able to detect direct contact (i.e., human-human contact), but cannot detect indirect contact (i.e., human-object, such as the disease transmission through surface). Moreover, the rule of risky contact cannot be flexibly changed with the environmental situation and the nature of the virus. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient trajectory-based PCT system using trusted hardware. We formalize trajectory-based PCT as a generalization of the well-studied Private Set Intersection (PSI), which is mostly based on cryptographic primitives and thus insufficient. We solve the problem by leveraging trusted hardware such as Intel SGX and designing a novel algorithm to achieve a secure, efficient and flexible PCT system. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can achieve high performance and scalability. Specifically, our system (one single machine with Intel SGX) can process thousands of queries on 100 million records of trajectory data in a few seconds.","Kato, Fumiyuki; Cao, Yang; Yoshikawa, Masatoshi",,534,16

Eighty-nine papers meeting the inclusion criteria, i.e., ""Legionella pneumophila"" and ""resistance to antibiotics"", were evaluated according to pre-defined validity criteria. Sixty articles referred to clinical isolates, and 18 articles reported water-related L. pneumophila isolates, while 11 articles included both clinical and water isolates. Several methods have been proposed as suitable for the determination of MICs, such as the E-test, broth and agar dilution, and disk diffusion methods, in vivo and in vitro, using various media. The E-test method proposed by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (EUCAST) seems to be the second most frequently used method overall, but it is the preferred method in the most recent publications (2000-2019) for the interpretation criteria. Erythromycin has been proved to be the preference for resistance testing over the years. However, in the last 19 years, the antibiotics ciprofloxacin (CIP), erythromycin (ERM), levofloxacin (LEV) and azithromycin (AZM) were the ones that saw an increase in their use.

The disease as at the point of writing this paper has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The application of mathematical models, artificial intelligence, big data, and similar methodologies are potential tools to predict the extent of the spread and effectiveness of containment strategies to stem the transmission of this disease. In societies with constrained data infrastructures, modeling and forecasting COVID-19 becomes an extremely difficult endeavor. Nonetheless, we propose an online forecasting mechanism that streams data from the Nigeria Center for Disease Control to update the parameters of an ensemble model which in turn provides updated COVID-19 forecasts every 24 hours. The ensemble combines an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Prophet - an additive regression model developed by Facebook, and a Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model combined with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH). The outcomes of these efforts are expected to provide academic thrust in guiding the policymakers in the deployment of containment strategies and/or assessment of containment interventions in stemming the spread of the disease in Nigeria.","Abdulmajeed, Kabir; Adeleke, Monsuru; Popoola, Labode",Data Brief,534,22

Current guidelines and alternative ways of ensuring adequate service provision are discussed. Restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 are likely to continue for many months, and child and adolescent mental health services need to find new ways to provide a sustainable service to young people in Ireland.

Diagnosis is complex and requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, radiological, and histological investigations, along with exclusion of known causes of lung fibrosis. The current understanding of the disease etiology suggests an interaction between genetic factors and epigenetic alterations in susceptible, older individuals. Prognosis is dismal and current treatment options include anti-fibrotic agents that only slow down disease progression and carry considerable side effects that hamper patients' quality of life. Therefore, there is a need for new, more effective treatments, alone or in combination with existing pharmacotherapy. Regenerative medicine, the potential use of cell therapies to treat destructive diseases that cause architectural distortion to the target organ, has also emerged as an alternative therapeutic for lung diseases with unfavorable prognosis such as IPF. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s) have been used and their safety has been demonstrated. In the case of MSCs, both homogenic and allogeneic sources have been used and both are considered viable options without immunosuppressive therapy, taking into consideration the absence of immunogenicity and HLA response. AEC2s have been used in one trial with promising results but their use requires a deceased donor and immunosuppressive pre-treatment. In this review, we briefly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of IPF, and the background and rationale for using MSCs or AEC2s as potential treatment options. We list and describe the clinical trials completed to date and provide a comparison of their methods and results as well as a possible way forward.","Ntolios, Paschalis; Steiropoulos, Paschalis; Karpathiou, Georgia; Anevlavis, Stavros; Karampitsakos, Theodoros; Bouros, Evangelos; Froudarakis, Marios E; Bouros, Demosthenes; Tzouvelekis, Argyrios",BioDrugs,534,5

The programme monitors those with an aneurysm, and early intervention for large aneurysms reduces ruptures and AAA-related mortality. AAA screening services have been disrupted following COVID-19 but it is not known how this may impact AAA-related mortality, or where efforts should be focussed as services resume. METHODS: We repurposed a previously validated discrete event simulation model to investigate the impact of COVID-19-related service disruption on key outcomes. This model was used to explore the impact of delayed invitation and reduced attendance in men invited to screening. Additionally, we investigated the impact of temporarily suspending scans, increasing the threshold for elective surgery to 7cm and increasing drop-out in the AAA cohort under surveillance, using data from NAAASP to inform the population. FINDINGS: Delaying invitation to primary screening up to two years had little impact on key outcomes whereas a 10% reduction in attendance could lead to a 2% lifetime increase in AAA-related deaths. In surveillance patients, a 1-year suspension of surveillance or increase in the elective threshold resulted in a 0.4% increase in excess AAA-related deaths (8% in those 5-5.4cm at the start). Longer suspensions or a doubling of drop-out from surveillance would have a pronounced impact on outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Efforts should be directed towards encouraging men to attend AAA screening service appointments post-COVID-19. Those with AAAs on surveillance should be prioritised as the screening programme resumes, as changes to these services beyond one year are likely to have a larger impact on surgical burden and AAA-related mortality.","Kim, Lois G; Sweeting, Michael J; Armer, Morag; Jacomelli, Jo; Nasim, Akhtar; Harrison, Seamus C",PLoS One,534,20

Here we show that a single intramuscular injection of Adeno-Associated Virus-6 (AAV6) or AAV9 encoding a modified, N-terminal domain deleted ({Delta}NTD) spike protein induces robust cellular immunity and provides long-term protection in k18-hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge, associated weight loss and pneumonia independent of vaccine-induced neutralizing humoral immunity. In both mice and macaques, vaccine-induced cellular immunity results in the clearance of transduced muscle fibers coincident with macrophage and CD8+ cytotoxic T cell infiltration at the site of immunization. Additionally, mice demonstrate a strong Type-1 polarized cellular immunophenotype and equivalent ex vivo T cell reactivity to peptides of wt and alpha (B.1.1.7) variant spike. These studies demonstrate not only that AAV6 and AAV9 can function as effective vaccine platforms, but also that vaccines can provide long-term efficacy primarily through the induction of cellular immunity.

METHODS: In this retrospective, cohort study, confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at a COVID Health Centre in New Delhi between April 29 and June 17, 2020 were given conventional and homeopathic treatment. Patients were grouped into mild, moderate or severe categories of disease. Their symptomatologic profiles were analyzed to identify indicated homeopathic medicines. RESULTS: A total of 196 COVID-19 patients were admitted. One hundred and seventy-eight patients had mild symptoms; eighteen patients had moderate symptoms; no patients with severe symptoms were included as they were referred to tertiary care centers with ventilatory support. The mean age of patients with mild symptoms was significantly lower (38.6 years; standard deviation or SD ± 15.8) compared with patients in the moderate category (66.0 years; SD ± 9.09). The most important symptoms identified were fever (43.4%), cough (47.4%), sore throat (29.6%), headache (18.4%), myalgia (17.9%), fatigue (16.8%), chest discomfort (13.8%), chills (12.6%), shortness of breath (11.2%) and loss of taste (10.2%).

JMV5038 was first characterized through physico-chemical tests and it exhibited high melting point and logP value, an important pH-sensitivity that led to the formation of well-identified degradation products at low pH, as well as a substantial solubility value in silylated castor oil (ICO). Then, JMV5038-loaded HNP were formulated through a thermostabilized emulsion process based on the sol-gel cross-linking of ICO. They showed high loading efficiency and their in vitro release kinetic assessed in a biorelevant PBS/octanol biphasic system showed a constant sustained release over one month. The cytotoxic activity and cytocompatibility of HNP were evaluated on A375 melanoma cells and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively. JMV5038-loaded HNP exhibited a slightly enhanced cytotoxic activity of JMV5038 on melanoma cells while demonstrating their safety on NIH 3T3 cells. In conclusion, JMV5038-loaded HNP proved to be an efficient and safe drug subcutaneous delivery system that will be interesting to evaluate through preclinical studies.","Doufène, Koceïla; Malki, Yohan; Vincent, Laure-Anaïs; Cuq, Pierre; Devoisselle, Jean-Marie; Masurier, Nicolas; Aubert-Pouëssel, Anne",J. pharm. sci,534,16

However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks elsewhere. METHODS: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process-based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. RESULTS: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in flight volumes and destination population densities creates a non-uniform distribution of the risk that different airports pose of acting as the source of an outbreak. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of outbreak risk can therefore facilitate optimal allocation of resources for effective targeting of public health interventions.","Daon, Yair; Thompson, Robin N; Obolski, Uri",J. travel med,534,24

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX electronic health record data of subjects aged <18 years who were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code U07.1). Pulmonary embolism was identified by using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, code I26. We additionally collected data on age, sex, race, ethnicity, all diagnostic codes, medications, procedures, laboratory results, comorbidities, and outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period, 24 723 pediatric subjects were reported to have a COVID-19 infection diagnosis among 41 health care organizations, of which 693 (2.8%) were hospitalized. Eight subjects (0.03% overall and 1.2% of hospitalized patients) were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism. The median age (25th to 75th percentile) of patients diagnosed with pulmonary embolism was 16.5 years, and median (25th to 75th percentile) BMI was 22.1 (19.6-47.9). Three (37.5%) received critical care services, and 1 (12.5%) underwent mechanical ventilation. Five (62.5%) subjects had potentially significant risk factors (obesity, malignancy, recent surgery, and oral contraceptive use). All patients received anticoagulation, but none underwent thrombolysis. There were no reported deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Although pulmonary embolism is diagnosed less commonly in children than in adults, its occurrence appears to be more frequent in children hospitalized with COVID-19, as compared with previous reports in hospitalized children in general. All patients survived, with only 1 requiring mechanical ventilation.","Chima, Melissa; Williams, Duane; Thomas, Neal J; Krawiec, Conrad",Hosp. pediatr. (Online),534,33

In this study, the predictors of ARDS were investigated and a score that can predict progression to ARDS in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was developed. All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, at five university hospitals in Korea were enrolled. Their demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics and the outcomes were collected using the World Health Organization COVID-19 Case Report Form. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors for ARDS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for the scoring model. Of the 166 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 37 (22.3%) patients developed ARDS. The areas under the curves for the infiltration on a chest X-ray, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and age, for prediction of ARDS were 0.91, 0.90, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively (all P < 0.001). The COVID-19 ARDS Prediction Score (CAPS) was constructed using age (&#8805;60 years old), C-reactive protein (&#8805;5 mg/dL), and the infiltration on a chest X-ray (&#8805;22%), with each predictor allocated 1 point. The area under the curve of COVID-19 ARDS prediction score (CAPS) for prediction of ARDS was 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.95; P < 0.001). It provided 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity when the CAPS score cutoff value was 2 points.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 1·5, 2·0, and 3·0 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0·001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. FINDINGS: We included 3â862â012 individuals (1â957â935 [50·7%] women and 1â904â077 [49·3%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 13·7% were older than 70 years and 6·3% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 4·46% (95% CI 4·41-4·51). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 1·5, four with an RR of 2·0, and seven with an RR of 3·0. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18â374 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 36â749 with an RR of 2·0, and 73â498 with an RR of 3·0. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146â996 excess deaths with an RR of 1·5, 293â991 with an RR of 2·0, and 587â982 with an RR of 3·0. INTERPRETATION: We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population in the Asian and European countries. The COVID-19 data from two different time points, that is, May 30 and June 30, 2020 for the Asian population and May 15 and June 15, 2020 for the European population, were analyzed to determine the correlation with the estimated zinc deficiency for these two continents. The prevalence of zinc deficiency was about two times higher in the Asian population (mean 17.5%) than in the European population (mean 8.9%). A significant positive correlation (p < .05) was observed between the prevalence of zinc deficiency and COVID-19 cases at both time periods for the Asian population. However, the correlation between zinc deficiency prevalence and COVID-19 deaths was not significant in the Asian population. In contrast, a significant but negative correlation (p < .05 for all cases) was observed for zinc deficiency with both COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population at both time periods in the European countries. Considering the direct antiviral properties of zinc, it can be suggested that zinc supplementation may be beneficial for most of the population, especially older people and those who are at risk of COVID-19 infections. In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between individual zinc status and COVID-19 infections and mortality. Therefore, cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are required to test this hypothesis.","Ali, Nurshad; Fariha, Khandaker A; Islam, Farjana; Mohanto, Nayan C; Ahmad, Iftekhar; Hosen, Mohammad J; Ahmed, Shamim",J Med Virol,534,26

To improve our knowledge in this field, we collected data from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed COVID-19 infection. Methods: We performed a monocentric observational longitudinal study and collected data retrospectively from patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases who developed a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection between 3 March and 10 June 2020. Results: A total of 23 patients developed COVID-19 infection. Seven patients needed hospitalization [female 57%, mean age 59 +/- 9 years], and 16 patients were followed as outpatients [female 80%, mean age 50 +/- 14 years]. All hospitalized patients had more than one co-morbidity. At the time of infection, all patients were on immunosuppressive therapy consisting of either conventional synthetic DMARDs and/or biotherapy, with or without CSs. A minority received Corticoids (CSs) only. The most common symptoms of COVID-19-infected patients were fever, dyspnoea, cough and fatigue. PCR and chest CT were performed in all hospitalized patients to confirm the diagnosis (100% positive PCR, 71% positive CT). All outclinic patients were diagnosed clinically (confirmed by PCR in only one). The mean length of hospital stay was 21 +/- 19 days. Three patients developed an ARDS, including one who died.

Hospital mortality at 40% remains unacceptably high underlining the need to continue to develop and test therapies for this devastating clinical condition. The purpose of the review is to critically appraise the current status of promising emerging pharmacological therapies for patients with ARDS and potential impact of these and other emerging therapies for COVID-19-induced ARDS. We focus on drugs that: (1) modulate the immune response, both via pleiotropic mechanisms and via specific pathway blockade effects, (2) modify epithelial and channel function, (3) target endothelial and vascular dysfunction, (4) have anticoagulant effects, and (5) enhance ARDS resolution. We also critically assess drugs that demonstrate potential in emerging reports from clinical studies in patients with COVID-19-induced ARDS. Several therapies show promise in earlier and later phase clinical testing, while a growing pipeline of therapies is in preclinical testing. The history of unsuccessful clinical trials of promising therapies underlines the challenges to successful translation. Given this, attention has been focused on the potential to identify biologically homogenous subtypes within ARDS, to enable us to target more specific therapies 'precision medicines.' It is hoped that the substantial number of studies globally investigating potential therapies for COVID-19 will lead to the rapid identification of effective therapies to reduce the mortality and morbidity of this devastating form of ARDS.","Horie, Shahd; McNicholas, Bairbre; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Pham, Tài; Curley, Ger; McAuley, Danny; O039,; Kane, Cecilia; Nichol, Alistair; Dos Santos, Claudia; Rocco, Patricia R M; Bellani, Giacomo; Laffey, John G",Intensive care med,534,1

In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we recently developed an infectious complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The reverse genetic system can be used to rapidly engineer viruses with desired mutations to study the virus in vitro and in vivo. Viruses can also be designed for live-attenuated vaccine development and engineered with reporter genes to facilitate serodiagnosis, vaccine evaluation and antiviral screening. Thus, the reverse genetic system of SARS-CoV-2 will be widely used for both basic and translational research. However, due to the large size of the coronavirus genome (~30,000 nucleotides long) and several toxic genomic elements, manipulation of the reverse genetic system of SARS-COV-2 is not a trivial task and requires sophisticated methods. Here, we describe the technical details of how to engineer recombinant SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the process includes six steps: (i) prepare seven plasmids containing SARS-CoV-2 cDNA fragment(s), (ii) prepare high-quality DNA fragments through restriction enzyme digestion of the seven plasmids, (iii) assemble the seven cDNA fragments into a genome-length cDNA, (iv) in vitro transcribe RNA from the genome-length cDNA, (iv) electroporate the genome-length RNA into cells to recover recombinant viruses and (vi) characterize the rescued viruses. This protocol will enable researchers from different research backgrounds to master the use of the reverse genetic system and, consequently, accelerate COVID-19 research.","Xie, Xuping; Lokugamage, Kumari G; Zhang, Xianwen; Vu, Michelle N; Muruato, Antonio E; Menachery, Vineet D; Shi, Pei-Yong",Nat Protoc,534,23

MethodsThis is an experimental study with COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals wards being considered eligible. The study outcomes were assessed between patients undergoing the rehabilitation protocol (Dique Filipeia group) and patients who did not receive the protocol (control group). The rehabilitation protocol consisted in classifying patients daily into four levels of severity through peripheral oxygen saturation. Severity was classified by the oxygen flow needed to maintain a saturation greater than or equal to the cut-off point of 93%. A standardized ventilatory support and functional rehabilitation exercises were performed for each severity level patient, followed by an attempt to wean oxygen. ResultsA total of 727 patients were analyzed in the study. The Dique Filipeia group presented a lower total (132.7 {+/-} 35.3 vs 307.0 {+/-} 114.3 m3/patient; effect size 1.73) and daily (2.9 {+/-} 1.0 vs 6.8 {+/-} 3.1 m3/day/patient; effect size 1.46) oxygen expenditure than the control group. The Dique Filipeia patients presented higher hospital discharge (64.9 {+/-} 9.3 vs 35.4 {+/-} 7.5%; effect size 3.46) and lower length of stay (15.8 {+/-} 4.2 vs 29.1 {+/-} 3.4 days; effect size 3.47) than the control group.

This article reports the novel binding of nigellidine and subsequent blockage of angiotensin-binding proteins. The ACEs-blocking could restore Angiotensin-level, restrict vaso-turbulence in Covid patients and receptor-blocking might stop inflammatory/vascular impairment.

Clinical and histopathological findings suggested a congenital blistering disease with a split formation within the basal cell layer of the epidermis and oral mucous epithelium. The genetic investigation revealed a homozygous nonsense variant in the KRT14 gene (c.979C>T, p.Gln327*). Immunohistochemistry showed a complete absence of keratin 14 staining in all epithelia present in the biopsy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of feline EBS, and the first report of a spontaneous pathogenic KRT14 variant in a non-human species. The homozygous genotype in the affected cat suggests an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.","Dettwiler, M; Leuthard, F; Bauer, A; Jagannathan, V; Lourenço, A M; Pereira, H; Leeb, T; Welle, M M",Anim Genet,534,24

While many SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are asymptomatic or experience respiratory symptoms, extrapulmonary manifestations, including neurological symptoms and conditions, are increasingly recognized. There remains no clear understanding of the mechanisms that underlie neurological symptoms in COVID-19 and whether SARS-CoV-2 has the potential for neuroinvasion in humans. In this minireview, we discuss what is known from human autopsies in fatal COVID-19, including highlighting studies that investigate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in brain and olfactory tissue, and summarize the neuropathological consequences of infection. Incorporating microscopic and molecular findings from brain tissue into what we know about clinical disease will inform best practice management guidance and direct research priorities as it relates to neurological morbidity from COVID-19.","Mukerji, Shibani S; Solomon, Isaac H",Neurosci Lett,534,8

As compared to previous works, a high aragonite/biopolymer interfacial strength is observed (~298 MPa). The crack propagation path is investigated via experiment and finite element modelling and compared with the fracture mechanics analysis. It is confirmed that crack deflection to the aragonite/biopolymer interface contributes to a high overall toughness.

The Department of Urology of our Healthcare Institution consists of two Urology Units, one at 'L.Sacco' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19 hospital) and one at 'Fatebenefratelli' Hospital (hereinafter referred to as Covid-19-free hospital). The Healthcare System's Administration communicated to all personnel the implementation of a planned 'biological risk protocol' at the Covid-19 hospital, while the Covid-19-free hospital followed regular government recommendations. We evaluated the risk of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients treated for surgical or invasive urologic procedures during the epidemic in the two different hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the Covid-19 hospital, 12 patients underwent surgery and 51 patients invasive diagnostic procedures between 22 February and 8 March 2020; in the same period, at the Covid-19-free hospital, 21 patients underwent surgery and 56 patients invasive diagnostic procedures. We compared the incidence of Sars-Cov-2 infection among the patients who were accessed in the two Urology Units in the period of different restrictive measures after the outbreak of the epidemic. RESULTS: We registered no cases of Sars-Cov-2 infection in the patients hospitalized in that period in Covid-19 hospital, despite three cases of swab positivity in the Covid-19-free hospital. CONCLUSION: The early implementation of extraordinary measures to restrict the spread of the virus offers a good protection also in a Covid-19 referral Hospital. The adoption of safety measures may be considered even after the end of the pandemic in all the health systems.","Antonio Maria, Granata; Vasileios, Petrainas; Giacomo Piero, Incarbone; Ai Ling Loredana, Romanò; Marco, Rosso; Giulia, Garelli; Stefania, Ranzoni; Federica, Marchesotti; Gregori, Andrea",Urologia,534,30

Using the example of a clinic for orthopaedics and trauma surgery, the performance development of the first 5 weeks in comparison to last year and an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law will be evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison is made between the period 16.03 to 17.04.2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case-mix index and day-mix index, as well as the occupancy days are recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act are applied to these changes, and the adequacy is evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to last year, there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of nâ¯= 307 patients in the observation period. As a result, there was a decrease of 595 points in case mix and 2320 days of occupancy. This results in a decrease in revenue of approximately EUR 1.9 million. The flat rate for empty beds represents the largest monetary compensation for the loss of revenue. It amounts to approximately EUR 1.3 million. Taking into account further support and an adjustment for variable costs, a deficit of EUR 382,069 remains for 5 weeks. DISCUSSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important pillar for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to insufficient compensation for orthopaedics and trauma surgery.","von Dercks, Nikolaus; Körner, Christian; Heyde, Christoph-E; Theopold, Jan",Orthopade,534,16

Recently, machine learning(ML) methods have become increasingly popular and achieved promising results for price movement forecasting in both academia and industry. Most existing ML solutions formulate the forecasting problem as a classification(to predict the direction) or a regression(to predict the return) problem in the entire set of training data. However, due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data, good trading opportunities are extremely scarce. As a result, without careful selection of potentially profitable samples, such ML methods are prone to capture the patterns of noises instead of real signals. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework-LARA(Locality-Aware Attention and Adaptive Refined Labeling), which contains the following three components: 1)Locality-aware attention automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples by attending to their label information in order to construct a more accurate classifier on these selected samples. 2)Adaptive refined labeling further iteratively refines the labels, alleviating the noise of samples. 3)Equipped with metric learning techniques, Locality-aware attention enjoys task-specific distance metrics and distributes attention on potentially profitable samples in a more effective way. To validate our method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world financial markets: ETFs, the China's A-share stock market, and the cryptocurrency market. LARA achieves superior performance compared with the time-series analysis methods and a set of machine learning based competitors on the Qlib platform. Extensive ablation studies and experiments demonstrate that LARA indeed captures more reliable trading opportunities.","Zeng, Liang; Wang, Lei; Niu, Hui; Li, Jian; Zhang, Ruchen; Dai, Zhonghao; Zhu, Dewei; Wang, Ling",,534,10

Regarding COVID-19, handwashing and social distancing through stay-at-home orders or quarantine measures are effective at slowing the spread of illness. Use of proper face masks (not gaiters or bandanas) is also effective at preventing trans- mission. This is important because the virus can infect others during the presymptomatic phase. Aspirin can no longer be recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Human papillomavirus vaccination is strongly associated with reduced risk of invasive cervical cancer, especially in women who were vaccinated before 17 years of age. When a woman who is postmenopausal has a screening bone mineral density test, rechecking the test after three years does not help to identify those who will have a fragility fracture. A higher daily step count is associated with lower all-cause mortality. After one year of follow-up, physical therapy is preferred to glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee;acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain or pain due to knee or hip osteoarthritis;and adding a muscle relaxant to ibuprofen does not improve functional outcomes or pain in people reporting moderate to severe back pain one week after starting treatment. Although short-term antibiotics and steroids are effective in treating acute exacerbations of COPD, not much else is. Successful communication with patients seeking an antibiotic for a flulike illness can be achieved with combinations of messaging, including information on antibiotic resistance and the self-limiting nature of the illness. A new prediction rule effectively identifies patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a low likelihood of positive findings on allergy testing. Low-value screening tests in asymptomatic, low-risk patients often lead to further testing, diagnostic procedures, or referrals. A new tool helps determine the amount of change needed to signify a real difference between two laboratory values in the same person over time.

Many of these flaws are attributed to the current workflow: LaTeX to PDF to reviewers to camera ready PDF. This has understandably resulted in the desire for new forms of publications; ones that can increase inclusively, accessibility and pedagogical strength. However, this venture fails to address the origins of these inadequacies in the contemporary paper workflow. The paper, being the basic unit of academic research, is merely how problems in the publication and research ecosystem manifest; but is not itself responsible for them. Not only will simply replacing or augmenting papers with different formats not fix existing problems; when used as a band-aid without systemic changes, will likely exacerbate the existing inequities. In this work, we argue that the root cause of hindrances in the accessibility of machine learning research lies not in the paper workflow but within the misaligned incentives behind the publishing and research processes. We discuss these problems and argue that the paper is the optimal workflow. We also highlight some potential solutions for the incentivization problems.","Lockwood, Owen",,534,32

This AI-driven study is focused on segmentation, morphology, and distribution patterns of GGOs. MethodWe use an AI-driven unsupervised machine learning approach called PointNet++ to detect and quantify GGOs in CT scans of COVID-19 patients and to assess the severity of the disease. We have conducted our study on the ""MosMedData"", which contains CT lung scans of 1110 patients with or without COVID-19 infections. We quantify the morphologies of GGOs using Minkowski tensors and compute the abnormality score of individual regions of segmented lung and GGOs. ResultsPointNet++ detects GGOs with the highest evaluation accuracy (98%), average class accuracy (95%), and intersection over union (92%) using only a fraction of 3D data. On average, the shapes of GGOs in the COVID-19 datasets deviate from sphericity by 15% and anisotropies in GGOs are dominated by dipole and hexapole components. These anisotropies may help to quantitatively delineate GGOs of COVID-19 from other lung diseases. ConclusionThe PointNet++ and the Minkowski tensor based morphological approach together with abnormality analysis will provide radiologists and clinicians with a valuable set of tools when interpreting CT lung scans of COVID-19 patients. Implementation would be particularly useful in countries severely devastated by COVID-19 such as India, where the number of cases has outstripped available resources creating delays or even breakdowns in patient care. This AI-driven approach synthesizes both the unique GGO distribution pattern and severity of the disease to allow for more efficient diagnosis, triaging and conservation of limited resources. Key PointsOur approach to GGO analysis has four distinguishing features: O_LIWe combine an unsupervised computer vision approach with convex hull and convex points algorithms to segment and preserve the actual structure of the lung. C_LIO_LITo the best of our knowledge, we are the first group to use PointNet++ architecture for 3D visualization, segmentation, classification, and pattern analysis of GGOs. C_LIO_LIWe make abnormality predictions using a deep network and Cox proportional hazards model using lung CT images of COVID-19 patients.

Celery is the main source of dietary fiber, but its quality and production are limited by various abiotic stresses. Here, AgNAC1 containing the NAM domain was identified from celery. AgNAC1 was found to be a nuclear protein. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants hosting AgNAC1 have longer root lengths and stomatal axis lengths than the wide type (WT). The evidence from lignin determination and expression levels of lignin-related genes indicated that AgNAC1 plays a vital role in lignin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the results of the physiological characterization and the drought and salt treatments indicate that AgNAC1-overexpressing plants are significantly resistive to salt stress. Under drought and salt treatments, the AgNAC1 transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants presented increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and size of stomatal apertures relatively to the WT plants.

This study analyzes data of 355 teleworkers in Hanoi (Vietnam) during April 2020, the period of social distancing, to examine various factors associated with (1) complete home-based telework (HBT), (2) the perception of HBT, and (3) the attitude toward the combination between HBT and conventional work at workplace post-COVID-19. It finds that the company's closure policy and the frequency of working from a distance before the social distancing period were the primary determinants of exclusively teleworking. Regarding the perception of HBT, while the fear of COVID-19 was a strong positive factor, difficulties in focusing on work and accessing data were negative factors. Regarding the attitude toward the future development of HBT, attitudinal factors, commute distance, gender, children in household, and the perception of HBT in the social distancing period were the main predictors. The presence of more than one child negatively affected the perception of telework but positively affected the attitude toward establishing the hybrid work mechanism. The findings suggested that HBT has the potential to alleviate traffic congestion in developing countries and it can be promoted by emphasizing its environment-related benefits.

There is little information about community pharmacists' on occupational exposure, symptoms development, and testing practices in the community pharmacist cohort. METHODS: Between April 30th and May 10th, a questionnaire was administered through social media to Italian community pharmacists. From 67000 pharmacists currently working in community pharmacies, 1632 answered the survey. RESULTS: The survey population reflected the general Italian community pharmacists population in terms of age, gender, and number of co-workers. Protective measures were adopted in up to 99.9% of pharmacies. 624 pharmacists (38.2%) developed at least one COVID-19 related symptom in the period between February 28th and May 10th. Also, 102 pharmacists (6.2%) were tested for COVID-19 and 15, the 15% of the tested population and 0.92% of the whole survey population, resulted positive on nasopharyngeal swab. However, while the number of symptomatic pharmacists decreased, a higher number of tests were performed, thus COVID-19 prevalence among community pharmacists could have been underestimated and is probably intermediate between other healthcare workers and the general population (0.31%). CONCLUSION: Community pharmacists have probably been one of the first categories to experience increased contact risk to SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 prevalence among pharmacists could have been underestimated. In addition, the rates of protection measures adoption might have helped to reduce the spread of COVID-19 among co-workers and the community.","Cabas, Paolo; Di Bella, Stefano; Giuffrè, Mauro; Rizzo, Michele; Trombetta, Carlo; Luzzati, Roberto; Antonello, Roberta Maria; Parenzan, Ketty; Liguori, Giovanni",Res. soc. adm. pharm,534,24

By increasing the salt-to-surfactant concentration ratio, these systems display two peaks in the zero-shear viscosity and relaxation time, which are indicative of transitions from linear to branched micellar networks. The goal of this work is to assess the sensitivity of NMR diffusometry to different types of micellar microstructures and identify the mechanism(s) of surfactant self-diffusion in micellar solutions. At low salt-to-surfactant concentration ratios, for which wormlike micelles are linear, the surfactant self-diffusion is best described by a mean squared displacement, Z2, that varies as Z2 ~ Tdiff 0.5, where Tdiff is the diffusion time. As the salt concentration increases to establish branched micelles, Z2 ~ Tdiff, indicating a Brownian-like self-diffusion of surfactant molecules in branched micelles. This result indicates that NMR diffusometry is capable of differentiating various types of micellar microstructure. In addition, the self-diffusion coefficient of the surfactant molecules in linear and branched micelles are determined, for the first time, by comparing to the existing restricted diffusion models, and shown to be much slower than the diffusion of proton molecules in the bulk. Moreover, in linear and moderately branched wormlike micelles, the dominant mechanism of surfactant self-diffusion is through the curvilinear diffusion of the surfactant molecules along the contour length of the micelles, whereas in the branched micelles, before the second viscosity maxima, the surfactant self-diffusion could arise from a combination of micellar breakage, exchange between micelles and/or the bulk.","Holder, Samuel W.; Grant, Samuel C.; Mohammadigoushki, Hadi",,534,29

Significant inter- and intra- patient variability in lung mechanics and condition makes managing MV difficult. Accurate prediction of patient-specific response to changes in MV settings would enable optimised, personalised, and more productive care, improving outcomes and reducing cost. This study develops a generalised digital clone model, or in-silico virtual patient, to accurately predict lung mechanics in response to changes in MV. METHODS: An identifiable, nonlinear hysteresis loop model (HLM) captures patient-specific lung dynamics identified from measured ventilator data. Identification and creation of the virtual patient model is fully automated using the hysteresis loop analysis (HLA) method to identify lung elastances from clinical data. Performance is evaluated using clinical data from 18 volume-control (VC) and 14 pressure-control (PC) ventilated patients who underwent step-wise recruitment maneuvers. RESULTS: Patient-specific virtual patient models accurately predict lung response for changes in PEEP up to 12 cmH2O for both volume and pressure control cohorts. R2 values for predicting peak inspiration pressure (PIP) and additional retained lung volume, Vfrc in VC, are R2=0.86 and R2=0.90 for 106 predictions over 18 patients. For 14 PC patients and 84 predictions, predicting peak inspiratory volume (PIV) and Vfrc yield R2=0.86 and R2=0.83. Absolute PIP, PIV and Vfrc errors are relatively small. CONCLUSIONS: Overall results validate the accuracy and versatility of the virtual patient model for capturing and predicting nonlinear changes in patient-specific lung mechanics. Accurate response prediction enables mechanically and physiologically relevant virtual patients to guide personalised and optimised MV therapy.","Zhou, Cong; Chase, J Geoffrey; Knopp, Jennifer; Sun, Qianhui; Tawhai, Merryn; Möller, Knut; Heines, Serge J; Bergmans, Dennis C; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Desaive, Thomas",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,534,21

While large-scale quarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is unsustainable over long periods as it exerts enormous costs on societies. As a result, governments which have been able to partially control the spread of the disease have been deciding to reopen businesses. However, the WHO has warned about the risks of re-opening prematurely, as is playing out in some countries such as Spain, France and various states in the US such as California, Florida, Arizona, and Texas. Thus, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy that limits transmission without requiring large scale and damaging quarantines. Here, we have designed a multi-level quarantine process based on the mobility patterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in the US. By identifying the natural boundaries of social mobility, policymakers can impose travel restrictions that are minimally disruptive to social and economic activity. The dynamics of social fragmentation during the COVID-19 outbreak are analyzed by applying the Louvain method with modularity optimization to weekly mobility networks. In a multi-scale community detection process, using the locations of confirmed cases, natural break points as well as high risk areas for contagion are identified.

The objective of this study was to describe India's biennial HIV estimation 2017 process, data inputs, tool, methodology and epidemiological assumptions used to generate the HIV estimates and trends of key indicators for 2010-2017 at national and State/Union Territory levels. Methods: Demographic Projection (DemProj) and AIDS Impact Modules (AIM) of Spectrum 5.63 software recommended by the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS Global Reference Group on HIV Estimates, Modelling and Projections, were used for generating HIV estimations on key indicators. HIV sentinel surveillance, epidemiological and programme data were entered into Estimation Projection Package (EPP), and curve fitting was done using EPP classic model. Finally, calibration was done using the State HIV prevalence of two rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) -3 and -4 and Integrated Biological and Behavioural Surveillance (IBBS), 2014-2015. Results: The national adult prevalence of HIV was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2017. Mizoram, Manipur and Nagaland had the highest prevalence over one per cent. An estimated 2.1 million people were living with HIV in 2017, with Maharashtra estimated to have the highest number. Of the 88 thousand annual new HIV infections estimated nationally in 2017, Telangana accounted for the largest share. HIV incidence was found to be higher among key population groups, especially people who inject drugs. The annual AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 69 thousand nationally. For all indicators, geographic variation in levels and trends between States existed. Interpretation & conclusions: With a slow decline in annual new HIV infections by only 27 per cent from 2010 to 2017 against the national target of 75 per cent by 2020, the national target to end AIDS by 2030 may be missed; although at the sub-national level some States have made better progress to reduce new HIV infection. It calls for reinforcement of HIV prevention, diagnosis and treatment efforts by geographical regions and population groups.","Sahu, Damodar; Kumar, Pradeep; Chandra, Nalini; Rajan, Shobini; Shukla, D K; Venkatesh, S; Nair, Saritha; Kumar, Anil; Singh, Jitenkumar; Reddy, Srikanth; Godbole, Sheela; Elangovan, A; Saha, M K; Rai, Sanjay; Lakshmi, P V M; Gambhir, T; Ammassari, Savina; Joshi, Deepika; Das, Amitabh; Bakshi, Poonam; Chakraborty, Sabyasachi; Palkar, Amol; Singh, S K; Reddy, D C S; Kant, Shashi; Pandey, Arvind; Vardhana Rao, M Vishnu",Indian J Med Res,534,20

No study has yet looked at the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on the surgical research community. In this study, we sought to understand the impact of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on academic surgeons. METHODS: We surveyed members of the Association for Academic Surgery and the Society of University Surgeons. Survey questions included demographics, current challenges to basic and clinical research activities, attitudes toward remote work and productivity maintenance, and the solutions implemented to maintain productivity. RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel as a result of social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs and chairs more likely to report a negative impact (P = .001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing, and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family as a result of fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSION: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","Keswani, Sundeep G; Parikh, Umang M; Gosain, Ankush; Ghaferi, Amir A; Thomas, Jayshree S; Dudeja, Vikas; Kim, Eugene S; Zuckerbraun, Brian S; Goldstein, Allan M",Surgery (St. Louis),534,16

A UK study of 2200 COVID-19 patients found no relationship of ABO blood type to disease severity. A Danish study identified ABO blood group as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but not for hospitalization or death from COVID-19. AIM: In the current study, we wished to analyze the relationship of ABO blood group and the ABO genetic locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality in subjects from the UK Biobank (UKB). METHODS: ABO blood type is from UKB data field 23165. Blood type was imputed for genotyped UK Biobank participants using three SNPs (rs505922, rs8176719, and rs8176746) in the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2. We analyzed the chromosome 9 snp rs657152 to assess the relationship of the ABO locus to COVID-19 test positivity and mortality. RESULTS: COVID-19 test results (negative or positive) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.977, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.548). COVID-19 outcomes (alive or died) were not related to blood group in males (p = 0.102, two tailed Fisher exact test) or females (p = 0.226).

As stated in the FDA PRO Guidance for Medical Product Development (2009), one way to lend meaning and interpretation to such a PRO measure is to dichotomize between values where within-patient changes are considered clinically important and those that are not. But even a PRO scale with a cutoff score that discriminates well between responder and non-responders is fraught with some misclassification. METHODS: Using estimates of sensitivity and specificity on classification of responder status from a PRO instrument, formulas are provided to correct for such responder misclassification under the assumption of no treatment misclassification. Two case studies from sexual medicine illustrate the methodology. RESULTS: Adjustment formulas on cell counts for responder misclassification are a direct extension of correction formulas for misclassification on disease from a two-way cross-classification table of disease (yes, no) and exposure (yes, no). Unadjusted and adjusted estimates of treatment effect are compared in terms of odds ratio, response ratio, and response difference. In the two case studies, there was considerable underestimation of treatment effect. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The methodology can be applied to different therapeutic areas. Limitations of the methodology, such as when adjusted cell estimates become negative, are highlighted. The role of anchor-based methodology is discussed for obtaining estimates of sensitivity and specificity on responder classification. Correction for treatment effect bias from misclassification of responder status on PRO measures can lead to more trustworthy interpretation and effective decision-making.

We sought to demonstrate the reduction in hospital room utilization after implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive surgery. METHODS: We included all minimally invasive reconstructive surgical procedures in this retrospective cohort study within a large managed care organization of 4.5 million members (2008-2018). We queried the system-wide medical record for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for all included procedures and patient perioperative data. Categorical variables were compared using &#967;2 test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Of the 13,445 patients undergoing pelvic reconstructive surgery, 5,506 were discharged the same day, whereas 7,939 were discharged the next day. Over the 10-year period, patients without hysterectomy had outpatient surgery rates increase from 31.2% to 76.4% (+45.2%), whereas those with hysterectomy increased from 3% to 56.4% (+53.4%). Hospital room utilization decreased by 45,200 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures without hysterectomy and 53,400 room days/100,000 reconstructive procedures with hysterectomy. When compared to 2008, in 2018 after more widespread adoption of outpatient elective surgery, for the 738 patients undergoing surgery without hysterectomy, 334 less room days were used, whereas 335 less room days were used among the 640 patients who had a surgical procedure with hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of outpatient pelvic reconstructive procedures leads to a significant reduction in hospital room utilization. Same-day discharge decreases hospital resource utilization, therefore improving hospital access, which may be essential for the delivery of routine care during times of resource scarcity such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Berger, Alexander A; Tan-Kim, Jasmine; Menefee, Shawn A",Female pelvic med. reconstr. surg.

Methods: A review of primary data sources in the US was conducted. The data were summarized to describe national and state-level trends in the spread of COVID-19 and in policy and technology solutions. Results: COVID-19 cases and deaths initially peaked in late March and April, but after a brief reduction in June cases and deaths began rising again July and continued to climb into early August. The US policy response is best characterized by its federalist, decentralized nature. The national government has led in terms of economic and fiscal response, increasing funding for scientific research into testing, treatment, and vaccines, and in creating more favorable regulations for the use of telemedicine. State governments have been responsible for many of the containment, testing, and treatment responses, often with little federal government support. Policies that favor economic re-opening are often followed by increases in state-level case numbers, which are then followed by stricter containment measures, such as mask wearing or pausing re-opening plans. Conclusions: While all US states have begun to ""re-open"" economic activities, this trend appears to be largely driven by social tensions and economic motivations than an ability to effectively test and surveil populations.","Bergquist, Savannah; Otten, Thomas; Sarich, Nick",,534,32

The uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-6, is associated with ARDS. This constituted the first study to report on the variability in physicochemical properties of ß-glucans extracts from the same edible mushroom Lentinus edodes on the reduction of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Specifically, the impact on the immunomodulatory and cytoprotective properties of our novel in 'house' (IH-Lentinan, IHL) and a commercial (Carbosynth-Lentinan, CL) Lentinan extract were investigated using in vitro models of lung injury and macrophage phagocytosis. CL comprised higher amounts of &#945;-glucans and correspondingly less ß-glucans. The two lentinan extracts demonstrated varying immunomodulatory activities. Both Lentinan extracts reduced cytokine-induced NF-&#954;B activation in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, with the IHL extract proving more effective at lower doses. In contrast, in activated THP-1 derived macrophages, the CL extract more effectively attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production (TNF-&#945;, IL-8, IL-2, IL-6, IL-22) as well as TGF-ß and IL-10. The CL extract attenuated oxidative stress-induced early apoptosis, while the IHL extract attenuated late apoptosis.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of tolvaptan, a vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, in Japanese HD patients. METHODS: A total of 124 patients (24-h urine volume &#8805;500 mL) on thrice-weekly HD were randomized to receive oral tolvaptan 15 mg/day (n = 40), tolvaptan 30 mg/day (n = 40) or placebo (n = 44) for 24 weeks. Efficacy endpoints were change from baseline in 24-h urine volume, total fluid removal by HD per week and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG). Safety was assessed via the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). RESULTS: At treatment end, the difference (95% confidence interval) from the placebo group in the mean change from baseline in 24-h urine volume was significant in the tolvaptan 15 mg {429.1 mL [95% confidence interval (CI) 231.0, 627.2]; P < 0.0001} and 30 mg [371.6 mL (95% CI 144.1, 599.2); P = 0.0017] groups. The mean changes from baseline in total fluid removal by HD and IDWG were not significantly different in the tolvaptan groups versus the placebo group. Although the proportion of patients with TEAEs was lower in the placebo group (77.3%) than in the tolvaptan groups (92.3%), tolvaptan was safe and well-tolerated during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Tolvaptan significantly sustained diuretic action for 24 weeks in HD patients but did not reduce total fluid removal by HD per week and IDWG to the same extent.","Ogata, Hiroaki; Shimofurutani, Naoko; Okada, Tadashi; Nagamoto, Hisashi; Akizawa, Tadao",,534,2

Many studies have used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA on surfaces, but seldom has viable virus been detected. This paper investigates the viability over time of SARS-CoV-2 dried onto a range of materials and compares viability of the virus to RNA copies recovered and whether virus viability is concentration dependent. Viable virus persisted for the longest time on surgical mask material and stainless steel, with a 99.9% reduction in viability by 122 and 114 h, respectively. Viability of SARS-CoV-2 reduced the fastest on a polyester shirt, with a 99.9% reduction within 2.5 h. Viability on the bank note was reduced second fastest, with 99.9% reduction in 75 h. RNA on all surfaces exhibited a 1-log reduction in genome copy number recovery over 21 days. The findings show that SARS-CoV-2 is most stable on nonporous hydrophobic surfaces. RNA is highly stable when dried on surfaces, with only 1-log reduction in recovery over 3 weeks. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 viability reduced more rapidly, but this loss in viability was found to be independent of starting concentration. Expected levels of SARS-CoV-2 viable environmental surface contamination would lead to undetectable levels within 2 days. Therefore, when RNA is detected on surfaces, it does not directly indicate the presence of viable virus, even at low cycle threshold values. IMPORTANCE This study shows the impact of material type on the viability of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. It demonstrates that the decay rate of viable SARS-CoV-2 is independent of starting concentration. However, RNA shows high stability on surfaces over extended periods. This has implications for interpretation of surface sampling results using RT-PCR to determine the possibility of viable virus from a surface, where RT-PCR is not an appropriate technique to determine viable virus. Unless sampled immediately after contamination, it is difficult to align RNA copy numbers to quantity of viable virus on a surface.","Paton, Susan; Spencer, Antony; Garratt, Isobel; Thompson, Katy-Anne; Dinesh, Ikshitaa; Aranega-Bou, Paz; Stevenson, David; Clark, Simon; Dunning, Jake; Bennett, Allan; Pottage, Thomas",Appl Environ Microbiol,534,25

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 66 melanoma patients, examined with contrast-enhanced 18F-FDG PET/CT before scheduled metastasectomy without any prior systemic therapy, were included in this single-centre retrospective analysis under IRB waiver. The largest, resected metastasis in each patient was assessed with CT texture analysis and semiquantitative 18F-FDG PET parameters. Correlation between imaging parameters and histopathological mutations (BRAF- and NRAS- genes) were calculated. RESULTS: Attenuation standard deviation (SD) within target lesion indicated a weak correlation with its SUVpeak (rho -0.292, p 0.017). However, no correlation between CT texture analysis, metabolic 18F-FDG PET parameters and tumour cell mutation could be established. CONCLUSION: CT texture parameters cannot replace the diagnostic value of 18F- FDG PET/CT for metabolic information in melanoma patients.

To date, it is highly controversial whether such capability can be adapted in mammalian species as another site for gas exchange. Here, we report the advent of the intestinal breathing phenomenon in mammalians by exploiting EVA (enteral ventilation via anus). Methods Two different modes of EVA were investigated in an experimental model of respiratory failure: intra-rectal oxygen O2 gas ventilation (g-EVA) or liquid ventilation (l-EVA) with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. After induction of type 1 respiratory failure, we analyzed the effectiveness of g-EVA and I-EVA in mouse and pig, followed by preclinical safety analysis in rat. Findings Both intra-rectal O2 gas and oxygenated liquid delivery were shown to provide vital rescue of experimental models of respiratory failure, improving survival, behavior, and systemic O2 level. A rodent and porcine model study confirmed the tolerable and repeatable features of an enema-like l-EVA procedure with no major signs of complications. Conclusions EVA has proven effective in mammalians such that it oxygenated systemic circulation and ameliorated respiratory failure. Due to the proven safety of perfluorochemicals in clinics, EVA potentially provides an adjunctive means of oxygenation for patients under respiratory distress conditions.

Elevated troponin may signify myocardial damage and is predictive of mortality. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of troponin above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) for mortality, and factors affecting the relationship. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus and Embase was undertaken, from inception of the databases until 16 December 2020. The key exposure was elevated serum troponin, defined as troponin (of any type) above the 99th percentile URL. The outcome was mortality due to any cause. RESULTS: In total, 12,262 patients from 13 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The mortality rate was 23% (20-26%). Elevated troponin was observed in 31% (23-38%) of patients. Elevated troponin was associated with increased mortality [odds ratio (OR) 4.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.07-5.53; P < 0.001; I2 = 19.9%]. Meta-regression showed that the association did not vary with age (P = 0.218), male gender (P = 0.707), hypertension (P = 0.182), diabetes (P = 0.906) or coronary artery disease (P = 0864). The association between elevated troponin and mortality had sensitivity of 0.55 (0.44-0.66), specificity of 0.80 (0.71-0.86), positive likelihood ratio of 2.7 (2.2-3.3), negative likelihood ratio of 0.56 (0.49-0.65), diagnosis odds ratio of 5 (4-5) and area under the curve of 0.73 (0.69-0.77). The probability of mortality was 45% in patients with elevated troponin and 14% in patients with non-elevated troponin. CONCLUSION: Elevated troponin was associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 with 55% sensitivity and 80% specificity.","Wibowo, Arief; Pranata, Raymond; Akbar, Mohammad Rizki; Purnomowati, Augustine; Martha, Januar Wibawa",Int J Infect Dis,534,4

Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies.

PED virus (PEDV) spread for the first time into the USA in 2013 and has caused severe economic losses. Retrospectively, it was found that two different strains of PEDV have been introduced into the United States, both are closely related to strains circulating in China where a new wave of the disease occurred from 2010 onwards. Since autumn 2014, new outbreaks of PED have occurred in Europe. In this study, weaned piglets were inoculated with an early European isolate (Br1/87) or faecal/intestinal suspensions derived from pigs infected with a recent European strain of PEDV (from Germany) or a US strain of PEDV. No evidence for infection resulted from inoculation of pigs with the German sample that contained high levels of PEDV RNA; there were no clinical signs, excretion of viral RNA or anti‐PEDV antibody production. In contrast, all the pigs in the other two groups showed evidence of infection. Mild clinical signs of disease, mainly diarrhoea, occurred in piglets inoculated with the Br1/87 and US PEDV strains. PEDV RNA was detected throughout the intestine in euthanized animals at 4 days post‐inoculation. In addition, within these animals, low levels of viral RNA were detected in lungs and livers with higher levels in spleens. Seroconversion against PEDV occurred in all surviving infected animals within 10 days. PEDV RNA excretion occurred for at least 2 weeks. The US PEDV RNA was detected at low levels in serum samples on multiple days. It is apparent that current diagnostic systems can detect infection by the different virus strains.","Lohse, L.; Krog, J.

Although many efforts have already been put forward for developing potential vaccines, however, most of them are proved to possess negative consequences. Therefore, in this study, immunoinformatics methods were exploited to design a novel epitope-based subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, targeting four essential proteins of the virus i.e., spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein. The highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, non-human homolog, and 100% conserved (across other isolates from different regions of the world) epitopes were used for constructing the vaccine. In total, fourteen CTL epitopes and eighteen HTL epitopes were used to construct the vaccine. Thereafter, several in silico validations i.e., the molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (including the RMSF and RMSD studies), and immune simulation studies were also performed which predicted that the designed vaccine should be quite safe, effective, and stable within the biological environment. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation studies were also conducted to design an effective mass production strategy of the vaccine. However, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required on the predicted vaccine to finally validate its safety and efficacy.","Sarkar, Bishajit; Ullah, Md.

Virus-induced cytoskeletal dynamics are thought to be closely related to this type of nerve damage. Currently, the regulation pattern of the actin cytoskeleton and its molecular mechanism remain unclear when PHEV enters the host cells. Here, we demonstrate that entry of PHEV into N2a cells induces a biphasic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and a dynamic change in cofilin activity. Viral entry is affected by the disruption of actin kinetics or alteration of cofilin activity. PHEV binds to integrin α5β1 and then initiates the integrin α5β1-FAK signaling pathway, leading to virus-induced early cofilin phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization. Additionally, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and downstream regulatory gene p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are recruited as downstream mediators of PHEV-induced dynamic changes of the cofilin activity pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PHEV utilizes the integrin α5β1-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway to cause an actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to promote its own invasion, providing theoretical support for the development of PHEV pathogenic mechanisms and new antiviral targets. IMPORTANCE PHEV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a typical neurotropic virus that primarily affects the nervous system of piglets to produce typical neurological symptoms. However, the mechanism of nerve damage caused by the virus has not been fully elucidated. Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and serves as the first obstacle to the entry of pathogens into host cells. Additionally, the morphological structure and function of nerve cells depend on the dynamic regulation of the actin skeleton. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of neuronal injury induced by PHEV from the perspective of the actin cytoskeleton not only helps elucidate the pathogenesis of PHEV but also provides a theoretical basis for the search for new antiviral targets. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from cytoskeleton pathways and the mechanism of PHEV invading nerve cells.","Lv, Xiaoling; Li, Zi; Guan, Jiyu; Hu, Shiyu; Zhang, Jing; Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Lu, Huijun; Song, Deguang; He, Hongbin; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Journal of Virology,534,11

Namibia demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by applying government-led strategic rabies vaccination campaigns to reduce both human and dog rabies incidences in the Northern Communal Areas of Namibia since 2016. The lessons learnt using paper-based form for data capturing and management of mass dog vaccination campaign during the pilot and roll out phase of the project (2016–2018) led to the implementation of a simple and accurate data collection tool in the second phase (2019–2022) of the rabies elimination program. In this paper, we describe the implementation of such custom-developed vaccination tracking device, i.e. the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC) Data Logger (GDL), and the integration of the collected data into a website-based rabies surveillance system (Rabies Epidemiological Bulletin—REB) during 2019 and 2020 campaigns. A total of 10,037 dogs and 520 cats were vaccinated during the 2019 campaign and 13,219 dogs and 1,044 cats during the 2020 campaign. The vaccination data were recorded with the GDL and visualized via REB. Subsequent GIS-analysis using gridded population data revealed a suboptimal vaccination coverage in the great majority of grid cells (82%) with a vaccination coverage below 50%. Spatial regression analysis identified the number of schools, estimated human density, and adult dog population were associated with the vaccination performance. However, there was an inverse correlation to human densities. Nonetheless, the use of the GDL improved data capturing and monitoring capacity of the campaign, enabling the Namibian government to improve strategies for the vaccination of at-risk areas towards achieving adequate vaccination coverage which would effectively break the transmission of rabies.","Athingo, Rauna; Tenzin, Tenzin; Coetzer, Andre; Hikufe, Emmanuel H.; Peter, Josephat; Hango, Laina; Haimbodi, Tangeni; Lipinge, Johannes; Haufiku, Frenada; Naunyango, Matias; Kephas, Magano; Shilongo, Albertina; Shoombe, Kenneth K.; Khaiseb, Siegfried; Letshwenyo, Moetapele; Pozzetti, Patricia; Nake, Lorenz; Nel, Louis H.; Freuling, Conrad M.; Müller, Thomas; Torres, Gregorio",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,534,21

METHODS: IgM and IgG antibody levels were assessed via chemiluminescence immunoassay in 338 COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: IgM levels increased during the first week after SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, peaked 2 weeks and then reduced to near‐background levels in most patients. IgG was detectable after 1 week and was maintained at a high level for a long period. The positive rates of IgM and/or IgG antibody detections were not significantly different among the mild, severe and critical disease groups. Severe and critical cases had higher IgM levels than mild cases, whereas the IgG level in critical cases was lower than those in both mild and severe cases. This might be because of the high disease activity and/or a compromised immune response in critical cases. The IgM antibody levels were slightly higher in deceased patients than recovered patients, but IgG levels in these groups did not significantly differ. A longitudinal detection of antibodies revealed that IgM levels decreased rapidly in recovered patients, whereas in deceased cases, either IgM levels remained high or both IgM and IgG were undetectable during the disease course. CONCLUSION: Quantitative detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS‐CoV‐2 quantitatively has potential significance for evaluating the severity and prognosis of COVID‐19.","Hou, Hongyan; Wang, Ting; Zhang, Bo; Luo, Ying; Mao, Lie; Wang, Feng; Wu, Shiji; Sun, Ziyong",Clin Transl Immunology,534,16

The class objectives focused on the IPEC competencies of Role/Responsibility and Interprofessional Communication. Discussion revolved around the discharge planning process for an elderly patient with multiple medical problems, as this is a time when interprofessional collaboration has a clear benefit to patients. Twenty-eight nursing students and eleven medical students attended a 90 min session via Zoom.

This systematic review with meta-analysis aims to analyse the clinical features, proposed pathogenesis and current treatment options for effective management of children with this novel entity. Electronic databases (Medline, Google Scholar, WHO, CDC, UK National Health Service, LitCovid, and other databases with unpublished pre-prints) were extensively searched, and all articles on MIS-C published from January 1, 2020, to October 10, 2020, were retrieved. English language studies were included. This systematic review analysed 17 studies with 992 MIS-C patients from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and developed countries (France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Chile and the US CDC data). Fever (95%) was the most common clinical manifestation followed by gastrointestinal (78%), cardiovascular (75.5%), and respiratory system (55.3%) involvement. Laboratory or epidemiologic evidence of inflammation and SARS-CoV-2 infection was present. Though the exact pathogenesis remains elusive, virus-induced post-infective immune dysregulation appears to play a predominant role. Features resembling Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome or macrophage activation syndrome were present; 49% had shock; 32% had myocarditis; 18% had coronary vessel abnormalities and 9% had congestive cardiac failure. Sixty-three percent of the patients were admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU); 63% received intravenous immunoglobulin, 58% received corticosteroids and 19% received alternate agents like tocilizumab; there were 22 (2.2%) deaths. Only 9/144 children in LMICs received tocilizumab that was significantly less than children in developed countries (p < 0.0001). This systematic review delineates and summarises recently published data on MIS-C from LMICs and developed countries. Although most needed PICU admission and received treatment with IVIG and steroids, most of the patients survived. Significantly fewer patients in developing countries received tocilizumab therapy than those in developed countries. It is crucial for clinician to recognise MIS-C, to differentiate it from other defined inflammatory conditions and initiate early treatment. Further studies are needed for long-term prognosis, especially relating to cardiac complications of MIS-C.

Among these receptors, the Dendritic Cell-Specific ICAM-3-Grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN/CD209) has become a hot topic due to its ability to bind and facilitate the infections processes of several pathogens. Although well characterized in mammals, little documentation exists about the receptor in salmonid fishes. Here, we report the sequence and expression analysis of eight DC-SIGN-like genes in Salmo salar. Each receptor displays structural similarities to DC-SIGN molecules described in mammals, including internalization motifs, a neck region with heptad repeats, and a Ca(+2)-dependent carbohydrate recognition domain. The receptors are expressed in multiple tissues of fish, and fish cell lines, with differential expression upon infection with viral and bacterial pathogens. The identification of DC-SIGN-like receptors in Salmo salar provides new information regarding the structure of the immune system of salmon, potential markers for cell subsets, as well as insights into DC-SIGN conservation across species.","Ojeda, Nicolás; Salazar, Carolina; Cárdenas, Constanza; Marshall, Sergio",Dev Comp Immunol,534,8

MAIN METHODS: Eighty-five Gulf War veterans (21 women, mean age: 54 years, range 46–72 years) who met the Kansas GWI case definition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for Chronic Multisymptom Illness (CMI), and research diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder were randomly assigned to CBT-I or monitor-only wait list control. Eight weekly sessions of individual CBT-I were administered via telephone by Ph.D. level psychologists to study participants. Outcome measures included pre-, mid-, and post-treatment assessments of GWI and insomnia symptoms, subjective sleep quality, and continuous sleep monitoring with diary. Outcomes were re-assessed 6-months post-treatment in participants randomized to CBT-I. KEY FINDINGS: Compared to wait list, CBT-I produced significant improvements in overall GWI symptom severity, individual measures of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety, insomnia severity, subjective sleep quality, and sleep diary outcome measures. The beneficial effects of CBT-I on overall GWI symptom severity and most individual GWI symptom measures were maintained 6-months after treatment. SIGNIFICANCE: GWI symptoms have historically been difficult to treat. Because CBT-I, which is associated with low stigma and is increasingly readily available to veterans, improved both sleep and non-sleep symptoms of GWI, these results suggest that a comprehensive approach to the treatment of GWI should include behavioral sleep interventions.","Chao, Linda L.; Kanady, Jennifer C.; Crocker, Nicole; Straus, Laura D.; Hlavin, Jennifer; Metzler, Thomas J.; Maguen, Shira; Neylan, Thomas C.",Life Sci,534,16

Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, obesity was characterized as a risk factor that could predict severe infection outcomes to viral infection. Amidst the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, obesity has remained a significant risk factor for severe viral disease as obese patients have a higher likelihood for developing severe symptoms and requiring hospitalization. However, the mechanism by which obesity enhances viral disease is unknown. In this study, we utilized a diet-induced obesity mouse model of West Nile virus (WNV) infection, a flavivirus that cycles between birds and mosquitoes and incidentally infects both humans and mice. Likelihood for severe WNV disease is associated with risk factors such as diabetes that are comorbidities also linked to obesity. Utilizing this model, we showed that obesity-associated chronic inflammation increased viral disease severity as obese female mice displayed higher mortality rates and elevated viral titers in the central nervous system. In addition, our studies highlighted that obesity also dysregulates host acute adaptive immune responses, as obese female mice displayed significant dysfunction in neutralizing antibody function. These studies highlight that obesity-induced immunological dysfunction begins at early time points post infection and is sustained through memory phase, thus illuminating a potential for obesity to alter the differentiation landscape of adaptive immune cells.","Geerling, Elizabeth; Stone, E.

Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of “human antibodies” based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as therapeutic antibodies.","Boorla, Veda Sheersh; Chowdhury, Ratul; Maranas, Costas D.",bioRxiv,534,1

While partially compensatory for each other, isoform-specific intracellular distribution, cell-type expression patterns, and regulatory mechanisms suggest different channel isoforms confer distinct properties to the cell. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Briefly, established TPC/TRPML functions and interaction partners (‘interactomes’) are discussed. Novel TRPML3 interactors are shown, and a meta-analysis of experimentally obtained channel interactomes conducted. Accordingly, interactomes are compared and contrasted, and subsequently described in detail for TPC1, TPC2, TRPML1, and TRPML3. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: TPC interactomes are well-defined, encompassing intracellular membrane organisation proteins. TRPML interactomes are varied, encompassing cardiac contractility- and chaperone-mediated autophagy proteins, alongside regulators of intercellular signalling.

However, setting up or maintaining a robust SARI surveillance system has been challenging. Similar to other countries, surveillance data on hospitalisations for SARI in the Netherlands are still limited, in contrast to the robust surveillance data in primary care. The objective of this narrative review is to provide an overview, evaluation, and challenges of already available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands, which might be used for near real-time surveillance of severe respiratory infections. Seven available surveillance systems or datasets in the Netherlands were reviewed. The evaluation criteria, including data quality, timeliness, representativeness, simplicity, flexibility, acceptability and stability were based on United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) guidelines for public health surveillance. We added sustainability as additional evaluation criterion. The best evaluated surveillance system or dataset currently available for SARI surveillance is crude mortality monitoring, although it lacks specificity. In contrast to influenza-like illness (ILI) in primary care, there is currently no gold standard for SARI surveillance in the Netherlands. Based on our experience with sentinel SARI surveillance, a fully or semi-automated, passive surveillance system seems most suited for a sustainable SARI surveillance system. An important future challenge remains integrating SARI surveillance into existing hospital programs in order to make surveillance data valuable for public health, as well as hospital quality of care management and individual patient care.","Marbus, S.

To gain further insights into this enzyme, the first crystal structures of the native and inhibitor-bound forms of the ACE2 extracellular domains were solved to 2.2- and 3.0-Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of these structures revealed a large inhibitor-dependent hinge-bending movement of one catalytic subdomain relative to the other (∼16°) that brings important residues into position for catalysis. The potent inhibitor MLN-4760 ((S,S)-2-{1-carboxy-2-[3-(3,5-dichlorobenzyl)-3H-imidazol4-yl]-ethylamino}-4-methylpentanoic acid) makes key binding interactions within the active site and offers insights regarding the action of residues involved in catalysis and substrate specificity.

The virus belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with mild-to-severe respiratory illness. The currently available diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of COVID-19 are mainly based on molecular assays. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction is the only diagnostic method currently recommended by the World Health Organization for COVID-19. With the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary to utilize other tests, which would determine the burden of the disease as well as the spread of the outbreak. Considering the need for the development of such a screening test, an attempt was made to develop and evaluate an IgG-based ELISA for COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 513 blood samples (131 positive, 382 negative for SARS-CoV-2) were collected and tested by microneutralization test (MNT). Antigen stock of SARS-CoV-2 was prepared by propagating the virus in Vero CCL-81 cells. An IgG capture ELISA was developed for serological detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in serum samples. The end point cut-off values were determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Inter-assay variability was determined. RESULTS: The developed ELISA was found to be 92.37 per cent sensitive, 97.9 per cent specific, robust and reproducible. The positive and negative predictive values were 94.44 and 98.14 per cent, respectively.

These drugs are also used in immune mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). We performed a systematic review about seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with IMIDs and impact of various drugs on seroconversion rates. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to identify relevant studies reporting seroconversion rates following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in IMIDs. We calculated the pooled seroconversion rates after a single or two doses of vaccination, pooled seroconversion rates in patients with specific IMIDs, and rates in patients on various drugs/drug classes. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. The pooled seroconversion rates after two doses of mRNA vaccination were higher (83.1, 95%CI: 74.9–89.0, I(2) = 90%) as compared to a single dose (69.3, 52.4–82.3, I(2) = 95%). The odds of seroconversion were lower in IMIDs as compared to healthy controls (0.05, 0.02–0.13, I(2) = 21%). The seroconversion rates in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (95.2, 95%CI: 92.6–96.9, I(2) = 0%), spondyloarthropathy (95.6, 95% CI: 83.4–98.9, I(2) = 35%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (90.7, 95%CI: 85.4–94.2, I(2) = 0%) were higher as compared to rheumatoid arthritis (79.5, 95% CI: 65.1–88.9, I(2) = 85%), and vasculitis (70.5, 95% CI: 52.9–83.5, I(2) = 51%). The seroconversion rates following double dose of mRNA were excellent (>90%) in those on anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF), anti-integrin (vedolizumab), anti-IL 17 (secukinumab), anti-IL6 (Tocilizumab) and anti-IL12/23 (Ustekinumab) therapies but attenuated (<70%) in patients on anti-CD20 (Rituximab) or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA-4) therapies (Abatacept).

Combination of anti-TNF with immunomodulators (azathioprine, 6-meracptopurine, methotrexate) resulted in an attenuated vaccine response as compared to anti-TNF monotherapy. CONCLUSION: Seroconversion rates after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are lower in patients with IMIDs. Certain therapies (anti-TNF, anti-integrin, anti-IL 17, anti-IL6, anti-12/23) do not impact seroconversion rates while others (anti-CD20, anti-CTLA-4) result in poorer responses.","Jena, Anuraag; Mishra, Shubhra; Deepak, Parakkal; Kumar-M, Praveen; Sharma, Aman; Patel, Yusuf I.; Kennedy, Nicholas A.; Kim, Alfred H.J.; Sharma, Vishal; Sebastian, Shaji",Autoimmun Rev,534,1

RESULTS: Systolic BP (p < .0001; effect size (ES) = 0.62), diastolic BP (p < .0001; ES = 0.71), grip strength of the right (p < .05; ES = 0.43) and left hand (p < .05; ES = 0.49), performance in six-minute walk test (p < .05; ES = 0.46), free time physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.40), domestic physical activity levels (p < .05; ES = 0.39), platelet count (p < .0001; ES = 0.48), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (p < .0001; ES = 1.14) reduced in comparison to the period before the pandemic. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin levels (p < .0001; ES = 0.77), triglycerides (p < .05; ES = 0.40), and insulin levels (p < .05; ES = 0.60) increased in comparison to the period before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the general health status of physically inactive women aged 50 to 70, potentially increasing their susceptibility to comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia.","Ribeiro de Lima, João G.; Abud, Gabriela F.; Freitas, Ellen C. de; Bueno Júnior, Carlos R.",Exp Gerontol,534,24

Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams (PERT) have previously been associated with improved outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether PERT utilization, recommendations, and outcomes for patients diagnosed with acute PE changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients with acute PE who received care at an academic hospital system in New York City between March 1st and April 30th, 2020. These patients were compared against historic controls between March 1st and April 30th, 2019. PE severity, PERT utilization, initial management, PERT recommendations, and outcomes were compared. There were more cases of PE during the pandemic (82 vs. 59), but less PERT activations (26.8% vs. 64.4%, p < 0.001) despite similar markers of PE severity. PERT recommendations were similar before and during the pandemic; anticoagulation was most recommended (89.5% vs. 86.4%, p = 0.70). During the pandemic, those with PERT activations were more likely to be female (63.6% vs. 31.7%, p = 0.01), have a history of DVT/PE (22.7% vs. 1.7%, p = 0.01), and to be SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative (68.2% vs. 38.3% p = 0.02). PERT activation during the pandemic is associated with decreased length of stay (7.7 ± 7.7 vs. 13.2 ± 12.7 days, p = 0.02). PERT utilization decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic and its activation was associated with different biases. PERT recommendations and outcomes were similar before and during the pandemic, and led to decreased length of stay during the pandemic.

METHODS: An open-label non-randomized trial in 90 patients with COVID-19 of moderate severity was conducted between May and October 2020. The primary endpoint was defined at the end of treatment (EOT) as no need for hospital re-admission and no progression into lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) for patients with upper respiratory tract infection and as at least 50% decrease of the respiratory symptoms score without progression into severe respiratory failure (SRF) for patients with LRTI. Viral load, biomarkers, the function of mononuclear cells and safety were assessed. RESULTS: The primary endpoint was attained in 86.7% of patients treated with clarithromycin (95% CIs 78.1–92.2%); this was 91.7% and 81.4% among patients starting clarithromycin the first 5 days from symptoms onset or later (odds ratio after multivariate analysis 6.62; p 0.030). The responses were better for patients infected by non-B1.1 variants. Clarithromycin use was associated with decreases in circulating C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6; by increase of production of interferon-gamma and decrease of production of interleukin-6 by mononuclear cells; and by suppression of SARS-CoV-2 viral load. No safety concerns were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Early clarithromycin treatment provides most of the clinical improvement in moderate COVID-19.

Viral sequencing data provides additional information regarding potential transmission clusters, but the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 can make interpretation using standard phylogenetic methods difficult. METHODS: We developed a novel statistical method and sequence reporting tool (SRT) that combines epidemiological and sequence data in order to provide a rapid assessment of the probability of HCAI among HOCI cases (defined as first positive test >48 hr following admission) and to identify infections that could plausibly constitute outbreak events. The method is designed for prospective use, but was validated using retrospective datasets from hospitals in Glasgow and Sheffield collected February–May 2020. RESULTS: We analysed data from 326 HOCIs. Among HOCIs with time from admission ≥8 days, the SRT algorithm identified close sequence matches from the same ward for 160/244 (65.6%) and in the remainder 68/84 (81.0%) had at least one similar sequence elsewhere in the hospital, resulting in high estimated probabilities of within-ward and within-hospital transmission. For HOCIs with time from admission 3–7 days, the SRT probability of healthcare acquisition was >0.5 in 33/82 (40.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The methodology developed can provide rapid feedback on HOCIs that could be useful for infection prevention and control teams, and warrants further prospective evaluation. The integration of epidemiological and sequence data is important given the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 and its variable incubation period.

Developing a new kind of MUPC with portable cooling devices to improve medical workers’ thermal comfort and protection performance of MUPC is imminent. In this paper, an integrated MUPC with a portable vortex tube cooling device was studied with experimental method. In a phytotron, a manikin wearing the MUPC was experimentally studied in terms of the influence of environment temperature and cool air supply conditions. On the basis of experiments, the MUPC inside air temperature and relative humidity, skin temperature of human body was studied with simulation method. Overall thermal sensation vote (TSV) and local TSV of human body were calculated, based on simulation results, to evaluate human thermal sensation. The results showed that, first, 50L/min cool air flowrate with 18∼20℃ supply temperature can create a good MUPC inside thermal sensation environment, for both head supply and body supply conditions. Both body supply condition and head supply condition cannot create a uniform MUPC inside thermal sensation environment. Second, MUPC inside air relative humidity is around or lower than 60% for most body parts, except for air supply position and body parts that air is difficult to reach. Thirdly, with cool air supplied into MUPC, a micro-positive pressure environment can be obtained, and the protection performance of MUPC can be improved.","Su, Xing; Tian, Shaochen; Li, He; Zhang, Xu; Shao, Xiaolu; Gao, Jun; Ye, Hai",Energy Build,534,1

OBJECTIVES: To examine factors associated with antibiotic prescribing for suspected respiratory tract infection (RTI) and evaluate the nature and dynamics of prescribing in hospitalized patients with suspected and proven COVID-19 infection. METHODS: An antibiotic point prevalence survey in hospitalized adult patients was conducted in designated COVID-19 clinical areas (including critical care) in 15 Scottish hospitals. Antibiotics prescribed for RTI and factors associated with prescribing were investigated. RESULTS: Of 820 surveyed patients, 272 (prevalence 33.3%) received antibiotics for suspected RTI on the survey day and 58.8% were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Antibiotics were empirical in 91.9% and amoxicillin (24.6%), doxycycline (20.5%) and co-amoxiclav (15%) were most frequently prescribed. Oral antibiotics were prescribed in 54.5% and duration was recorded in 76.7% on wards for a median of 5 days. IV to oral switch occurred after a median of 2 days. Prescribing for RTI was independently and positively associated with COPD/chronic lung disease, purulent/bloody sputum, abnormal chest X-ray, and CRP ≥ 100 mg/L. Probable and definite hospital-acquired COVID-19 and diabetes were associated with a lower odds of receiving an antibiotic for RTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prescribing for suspected RTI was commonly observed and predominantly empirical in suspected or proven COVID-19.

Although novel, SARS-CoV-2 shares commonalities in transmission dynamics with other viral respiratory pathogens where similar disparities in morbidity and mortality have been documented. However, to date, there has not been a systematic review of disparities in viral respiratory pathogens. In response, this review aims to synthesize data on racial and ethnic disparities in morbidity and mortality due to viral acute respiratory infections (ARI) other than SARS-CoV-2. In particular, this review will focus on understanding structural health and social factors outside of race and ethnicity driving these disparities in the United States. Methods : We will conduct a systematic review of studies published between January 1, 2002 and September 30, 2020 that capture data on racial and ethnic disparities associated with increased incidence, disease severity, risk of hospitalization and/or death in viral ARI in the United States. Data characterizing individual-, community-, and structural-level factors associated with these disparities will be abstracted to better understand the underlying structural inequities contributing to racial disparities in ARI. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines will be used with reviewers employing COVIDENCE to conduct two independent rounds of title/abstract and full text reviews for all articles. A built-in tool in COVIDENCE will be used for data abstraction. Discussion : Findings from this systematic review will shed light on patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in viral ARI in the United States. Leveraging these data can support predictive studies of the differential impacts of COVID-19 across the United States as well as adaptive intervention strategies mitigating structural inequities, including structural racism, driving both incidence and disparities in marginalized communities. Moreover, data emerging from this review may reignite pandemic preparedness focused on vulnerable communities given structural inequities, facilitating improved future pandemic responses to novel or endemic viral respiratory pathogens in the United States.

OBJECTIVE To determine if child maltreatment reporting and substantiation differ between periods when schools are routinely closed compared to in session. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING Child maltreatment reporting and substantiation among all U.S. States and the District of Columbia from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2017. METHODS Two-week intervals during periods of routine school closure (early January, June through mid-August, late November, and late December) were compared to all other 2-week intervals. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations compared rates of reporting and substantiation, resulting in incidence rate ratios (IRR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS Compared to when school was in session, reporting was 16.0% (IRR 0.84 [95% CI: 0.83, 0.85]) lower during school closures and substantiations were 12.3% (IRR 0.88 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.89]) lower. The largest reductions in reporting were observed among education personnel (-42.1%; IRR 0.58 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.62]), children aged 5-17 years (-18.6%; IRR 0.81 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.83), and for physical abuse (-19.6%; IRR 0.80 [95% CI: 0.79, 0.82]). Reductions during closure periods were not matched by increases during two-week intervals immediately following closure periods. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that the detection of child maltreatment may be diminished during periods of routine school closure. Findings may inform prevention planning and risk-benefit analyses for future school closures. Further study should disentangle the issue of decreased detection versus decreased prevalence of maltreatment during school closures.","Puls, Henry T; Hall, Matthew; Frazier, Terra; Schultz, Kelly; Anderst, James D",Child abuse & neglect,534,24

To protect both the patient and medical staff from harm, double gloving or changing gloves routinely at certain intervals during surgery is recommended. However, whether these protective measures are also necessary for laparoscopic colorectal surgery is unknown because the actual perforation rate during laparoscopic procedures is unclear. METHODS: Seventy-seven laparoscopic colorectal surgeries were evaluated, and a total of 616 surgical gloves used in the surgeries were collected for analysis. The presence of glove perforation was tested by the standard water-leak test method (EN455-1). RESULTS: Seven perforations were detected (1.1%). The duration of the laparoscopic procedure was not a statistically significant risk factor for glove perforation (p = 0.41). Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) were observed in 12 cases (15.6%), but there was no significant correlation between the presence of glove perforation and SSI (p = 0.92). According to the bacterial cultivation results, the majority of causative agents of SSI were enterobacteria, which belong to the major gut flora. CONCLUSION: Although the perforation rate was considerably lower than that in open surgery, surgical glove perforation occurred during laparoscopic procedures. Double gloving in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is recommended not to prevent SSI but to protect medical workers from harmful infections after direct contact with the patient.","Matsuoka, Shinsei; Kondo, Takayuki; Seishima, Ryo; Okabayashi, Koji; Tsuruta, Masashi; Shigeta, Kohei; Ishida, Takashi; Hasegawa, Hirotoshi; Kitagawa, Yuko",Surg Endosc,534,20

The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives’ actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety.

Study Selection: All studies providing ethnicity-aggregated data on the pre-specified outcomes, except case reports or interventional trials Data Extraction: Pairs of investigators independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS), and rated certainty of evidence following GRADE framework. Data Synthesis: Seventy-two articles (59 cohort studies with 17,950,989 participants; 13 ecological studies; 54 US-based and 15 UK-based; 41 peer-reviewed) were included for systematic review and 45 for meta-analyses. Risk of bias was low, with median NOS of 7 (interquartile range 6-8). In the unadjusted analyses, compared to white ethnicity, all-cause mortality risk was similar in Black (RR:0.96 [95%CI: 0.83-1.08]), Asian (RR:0.99 [0.85-1.16]) but reduced in Hispanic ethnicity (RR:0.69 [0.57-0.84]). Age and sex-adjusted-risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR:1.38 [1.09-1.75]) and Asian (HR:1.42 [1.15-1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR:1.14 [0.93-1.40]). Further adjusting for comorbidities attenuated these association to non-significance; Black (HR:0.95 [0.72-1.25]); Asian (HR:1.17 [0.84-1.63]); Hispanic (HR:0.94 [0.63-1.44]). Similar results were observed for other outcomes. In subgroup analysis, there is a trend towards greater disparity in outcomes for UK ethnic minorities, especially hospitalisation risks. Limitations: Paucity of evidence on native ethnic groups, and studies outside US and UK. Conclusions: Currently available evidence cannot confirm ethnicity as an independent risk factor for severe Covid-19 illness, but indicates that disparity may be partially attributed to greater burden of comorbidities.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the CORONA‐CODOMO Survey, a web‐based survey conducted from April to May 2020 in Japan, targeting children aged 7–17 and parents/guardians of children aged 0–17. We focused on self‐reports from children, including two open‐ended questions asking their needs and opinions. The results were analyzed according to the five categories of rights defined by the CRC: education, health, safety, play, and participation. RESULTS: Among the 2,591 children who participated in the survey, 1,292 children (49.9%) answered at least one of the two open‐ended questions. The most frequent concern was COVID‐19 infecting members of their families (78.2%), followed by the inability to see their friends (74.3%). There were 1,523 direct comments from children. The comments covered a wide range of the rights in the CRC, including reopening of schools, disparities in education, access to health information, alternatives for playing and seeing friends, and needs for participation and being heard. Few comments were related to safety whereas a certain proportion of children were victimized within households.

Though this appears to be ubiquitous, the crisis-creativity-well-being relationship has not been sufficiently examined across countries and using a working adult sample. The current study drew on a sample consisting of 1,420 employees from China (n = 489, 40% females), Germany (n = 599, 47% females), and the United States (n = 332, 43% females) to examine whether creativity can function as an effective means to cope with crisis and to achieve both flourishing and social well-being. Multivariate analyses showed that perceived impact of COVID-19 was positively related to creative process engagement, which was positively related to employees’ self-reported creative growth. Creative growth was associated with a higher level of flourishing well-being. This sequential mediation model was significant across the three samples. Creativity also mediated the relationship between perceived impact of COVID-19 and social well-being (social connectedness), but this connection was only found for the Chinese sample. Further data analyses revealed that individualism moderated this serial mediation model in that the positive coping effect of creativity on both flourishing and social well-being was stronger for individuals who hold more collectivistic views. Results of the study have implications for crisis management, personal development, and positive functioning of individuals and society.","Tang, Min; Hofreiter, Sebastian; Reiter-Palmon, Roni; Bai, Xinwen; Murugavel, Vignesh",Front Psychol,534,1

They play most prominent role against desiccation, phagocytosis, cell recognition, phage attack, antibiotics or toxic compounds and osmotic stress. In the last few decades, natural polymers have gained much attention among scientific communities owing to their therapeutic potential. In particular the EPS retrieved from probiotic bacteria with varied carbohydrate compositions possess a plenty of beneficial properties. Different probiotic microbes have unique behavior in expressing their capability to display significant health promoting characteristics in the form of polysaccharides. In this new era of alternative medicines, these polysaccharides are considered as substitutes for synthetic drugs. The EPS finds applications in various fields like textiles, cosmetics, bioremediation, food and therapeutics. The present review is focused on sources, chemical composition, biosynthetic pathways of EPS and their biological potential. More attention has been given to the scientific investigations on antimicrobial, antitumor, anti-biofilm, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities.","Angelin, J.; Kavitha, M.",Int J Biol Macromol,534,11

There are a limited number of COVID-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the increasing cases daily. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent COVID-19 spreading among people. In this study, five pre-trained convolutional neural network-based models (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) have been proposed for the detection of coronavirus pneumonia-infected patient using chest X-ray radiographs. We have implemented three different binary classifications with four classes (COVID-19, normal (healthy), viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia) by using five-fold cross-validation. Considering the performance results obtained, it has been seen that the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the highest classification performance (96.1% accuracy for Dataset-1, 99.5% accuracy for Dataset-2 and 99.7% accuracy for Dataset-3) among other four used models.","Narin, Ali; Kaya, Ceren; Pamuk, Ziynet",Pattern Anal Appl,534,1

We evaluated patient outcomes among ED patients with a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation measurement. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of ED patients seen at New York University Langone Health during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. We identified ED patients who had a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation. We studied the outcomes of high oxygen requirement (defined as >4 liters per minute) and mechanical ventilation among admitted patients and bounceback admissions among discharged patients. We also performed logistic regression and compared the performance of different ambulatory oxygen saturation cutoffs in predicting these outcomes. RESULTS: Between March 15–April 14, 2020, 6194 patients presented with fever, cough, or shortness of breath at our EDs. Of these patients, 648 (11%) had a documented ambulatory oxygen saturation, of which 165 (24%) were admitted. Notably, admitted and discharged patients had similar initial vital signs. However, the average ambulatory oxygen saturation among admitted patients was significantly lower at 89% compared to 96% among discharged patients (p<0.01). Among admitted patients with an ambulatory oxygen saturation, 30% had high oxygen requirements and 8% required mechanical ventilation. These rates were predicted by low ambulatory oxygen saturation (p<0.01). Among discharged patients, 50 (10%) had a subsequent ED visit resulting in admission. Although bounceback admissions were predicted by ambulatory oxygen saturation at the first ED visit (p<0.01), our analysis of cutoffs suggested that this association may not be clinically useful. CONCLUSION: Measuring ambulatory oxygen saturation can help ED clinicians identify patients who may require high levels of oxygen or mechanical ventilation during admission. However, it is less useful for identifying which patients may deteriorate clinically in the days after ED discharge and require subsequent hospitalization.","Akhavan, Arvin R.; Habboushe, Joseph P.; Gulati, Rajneesh; Iheagwara, Oluchi; Watterson, Joanna; Thomas, Shawn; Swartz, Jordan L.; Koziatek, Christian A.; Lee, David C.",West J Emerg Med,534,6

METHODS: Households were followed annually for identification of acute respiratory illness with RT-PCR confirmed HCoV infection. Serum collected before and at two time points post infection were tested using a multiplex binding assay to quantify antibody to seasonal, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and SARS-CoV-2 spike sub-domains and N protein. RESULTS: Of 3418 participants, 40% were followed for ≥3years. A total of 1004 HCoV infections were documented; 303 (30%) were reinfections of any HCoV type. The number of HCoV infections ranged from 1 to 13 per individual. The mean time to reinfection with the same type was estimated at 983 days for 229E, 578 days for HKU1, 615 days for OC43, and 711 days for NL63. Binding antibody levels to seasonal HCoVs were high, with little increase post-infection, and were maintained over time. Homologous, pre-infection antibody levels did not significantly correlate with odds of infection, and there was little cross response to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection with seasonal HCoVs is frequent. Binding anti-spike protein antibodies do not correlate with protection from seasonal HCoV infection.","Petrie, Joshua G; Bazzi, Latifa A; McDermott, Adrian B; Follmann, Dean; Esposito, Dominic; Hatcher, Christian; Mateja, Allyson; Narpala, Sandeep R; O’Connell, Sarah E; Martin, Emily T; Monto, Arnold S",J Infect Dis,534,16

Following the separation of the antibody fraction using a protein-A column, the final yield of the purified antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 NPs was estimated to be 0.26 ± 0.05 % (absolute amount of 143.4 ± 25.2 ng, n=5) from 1 mL of pig sera. The binding activities of the isolated antibodies were confirmed using immunoassay and immunostaining. Based on the specific binding activity to NPs, a quantitative assay was performed using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. From the doseresponse curve, the binding constant (Kd) was calculated to be 185 pM and the limit of detection was estimated to be 1.02 pM. The SPR biosensor with the isolated antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 NPs was applied for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and CoV strain 229E in culture fluid.","Bong, Ji-Hong; Kim, Tae-Hun; Jung, Jaeyong; Lee, Soo Jeong; Sung, Jeong Soo; Lee, Chang Kyu; Kang, Min-Jung; Kim, Hyun Ok; Pyun, Jae-Chul",Biochip J,534,16

However, there has been limited exploration of the impact of differences in epidemiology of key comorbidities, and related healthcare factors, on the course and parameters of the pandemic. We summarise what is known about (a) the pathophysiological processes underlying the interaction of coinfections and comorbidities in shaping prognosis of COVID‐19 patients, (b) the epidemiology of key coinfections and comorbidities, and the state of related healthcare infrastructure that might shape the course of the pandemic, and (c) implications of (a) and (b) for pandemic management and post‐pandemic priorities. There is a critical need to generate empirical data on clinical profiles and the predictors of morbidity and mortality from COVID‐19. Improved protocols for acute febrile illness and access to diagnostic facilities, not just for SARS‐CoV‐2 but also other viral infections, are of urgent importance. The role of malaria, HIV/TB and chronic malnutrition on pandemic dynamics should be further investigated. Although chronic non‐communicable diseases account for a relatively lighter burden, they have a significant effect on COVID‐19 prognosis, and the fragility of care delivery systems implies that adjustments to clinical procedures and re‐organisation of care delivery that have been useful in other regions are unlikely to be feasible. Africa is a large region with local variations in factors that can shape pandemic dynamics. A one‐size‐fits‐all response is not optimal, but there are broad lessons relating to differences in epidemiology and healthcare delivery factors, that should be considered as part of a regional COVID‐19 response framework.","Anjorin, A.A.; Abioye, A.I.; Asowata, O.E.; Soipe, A.; Kazeem, M.I.; Adesanya, I.O.; Raji, M.A.; Adesanya, M.; Oke, F.A.; Lawal, F.J.; Kasali, B.A.; Omotayo, M.O.",Trop Med Int Health,534,28

Official statistics show that there is an increasing number of mistreatments within healthcare due to the improper identification of the patient or the drug administered to the patient. It is believed that the majority of the medical errors caused by misidentifications are preventable by introducing integrated IT infrastructures. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is believed to be the next generation technology for tracking and data-collection and has successfully been applied in several industries such as manufacturing, retail and logistics. RFID technology is also seen as the next disruptive innovation in healthcare and represents several opportunities for increased safety, operational efficiency and cost savings, by tagging inventory, assets, patients and personnel. Even though RFID promises several benefits for the healthcare industry, the adoption of RFID technology in the health sector has not been as striking as anticipated and still lags behind compared to other industries. Through a literature review, this paper attempts to explore the challenges of RFID adoption in healthcare, with a focus on patient safety. Our main findings suggest that high costs of adoption, concerns related to security and privacy, and human safety risks are the main barriers for adoption.","Haddara, Moutaz; Staaby, Anna",Procedia Computer Science,534,15
