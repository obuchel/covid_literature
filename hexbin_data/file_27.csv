33,Globalization and Health,2005-04-22,"This debut editorial of Globalization and Health introduces the journal, briefly delineating its goals and objectives and outlines its scope of subject matter. 'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold: Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health – be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods – have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing. Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve. And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic. A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first.","Martin, Greg",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1143779/,27
627,Emerging viral threats in Gabon: health capacities and response to the risk of emerging zoonotic diseases in Central Africa,2010-06-03,"Emerging infectious diseases (EID) are currently the major threat to public health worldwide and most EID events have involved zoonotic infectious agents. Central Africa in general and Gabon in particular are privileged areas for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs. Indeed, human incursions in Gabonese forests for exploitation purposes lead to intensified contacts between humans and wildlife thus generating an increased risk of emergence of zoonotic diseases. In Gabon, 51 endemic or potential endemic viral infectious diseases have been reported. Among them, 22 are of zoonotic origin and involve 12 families of viruses. The most notorious are dengue, yellow fever, ebola, marburg, Rift Valley fever and chikungunya viruses. Potential EID due to wildlife in Gabon are thereby plentiful and need to be inventoried. The Gabonese Public Health system covers geographically most of the country allowing a good access to sanitary information and efficient monitoring of emerging diseases. However, access to treatment and prevention is better in urban areas where medical structures are more developed and financial means are concentrated even though the population is equally distributed between urban and rural areas. In spite of this, Gabon could be a good field for investigating the emergence or re-emergence of zoonotic EID. Indeed Gabonese health research structures such as CIRMF, advantageously located, offer high quality researchers and facilities that study pathogens and wildlife ecology, aiming toward a better understanding of the contact and transmission mechanisms of new pathogens from wildlife to human, the emergence of zoonotic EID and the breaking of species barriers by pathogens.","Bourgarel, M; Wauquier, N; Gonzalez, J-P",Emerg Health Threats J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167654/,27
1017,Existing health inequalities in India: informing preparedness planning for an influenza pandemic,2011-11-29,"On 11 June 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the world was in phase 6 of an influenza pandemic. In India, the first case of 2009 H1N1 influenza was reported on 16 May 2009 and by August 2010 (when the pandemic was declared over), 38 730 cases of 2009 H1N1 had been confirmed of which there were 2024 deaths. Here, we propose a conceptual model of the sources of health disparities in an influenza pandemic in India. Guided by a published model of the plausible sources of such disparities in the United States, we reviewed the literature for the determinants of the plausible sources of health disparities during a pandemic in India. We find that factors at multiple social levels could determine inequalities in the risk of exposure and susceptibility to influenza, as well as access to treatment once infected: (1) religion, caste and indigenous identity, as well as education and gender at the individual level; (2) wealth at the household level; and (3) the type of location, ratio of health care practitioners to population served, access to transportation and public spending on health care in the geographic area of residence. Such inequalities could lead to unequal levels of disease and death. Whereas causal factors can only be determined by testing the model when incidence and mortality data, collected in conjunction with socio-economic and geographic factors, become available, we put forth recommendations that policy makers can undertake to ensure that the pandemic preparedness plan includes a focus on social inequalities in India in order to prevent their exacerbation in a pandemic.","Kumar, Supriya; Quinn, Sandra C",Health Policy Plan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529628/,27
1094,Economic analysis of pandemic influenza mitigation strategies for five pandemic severity categories,2013-03-08,"BACKGROUND: The threat of emergence of a human-to-human transmissible strain of highly pathogenic influenza A(H5N1) is very real, and is reinforced by recent results showing that genetically modified A(H5N1) may be readily transmitted between ferrets. Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ~30,000 in Australia. Data from the 2009 pandemic was used to derive relationships between the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and hospitalization rates for each of five pandemic severity categories, with CFR ranging from 0.1% to 2.5%. RESULTS: For a pandemic with basic reproduction number R(0) = 1.8, adopting no interventions resulted in total costs ranging from $441 per person for a pandemic at category 1 (CFR 0.1%) to $8,550 per person at category 5 (CFR 2.5%). For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death. CONCLUSIONS: For pandemics in high severity categories the strategies with the lowest total cost to society involve rigorous, sustained social distancing, which are considered unacceptable for low severity pandemics due to societal disruption and cost.","Kelso, Joel K; Halder, Nilimesh; Postma, Maarten J; Milne, George J",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606600/,27
2424,Preparedness for Zika virus testing in the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region,2016-03-31,"On 1 February 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that clusters of microcephaly cases and other neurological disorders occurring in Zika virus (ZIKV)-affected areas constituted a public health emergency of international concern. Increased surveillance of the virus, including the requirement for laboratory confirmation of infection, was recommended. The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific therefore initiated a rapid survey among national-level public health laboratories in 19 countries and areas to determine regional capacity for ZIKV detection. The survey indicated that 16/19 (84%) countries had capacity for molecular detection of ZIKV while others facilitated testing through referral. These results suggest that robust laboratory capacity is in place to support ZIKV surveillance in the Western Pacific Region.","Squires, Raynal C; Konings, Frank",Western Pac Surveill Response J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5052899/,27
2658,Genetic resistance - an alternative for controlling PRRS?,2016-11-16,"PRRS is one of the most challenging diseases for world-wide pig production. Attempts for a sustainable control of this scourge by vaccination have not yet fully satisfied. With an increasing knowledge and methodology in disease resistance, a new world-wide endeavour has been started to support the combat of animal diseases, based on the existence of valuable gene variants with regard to any host-pathogen interaction. Several groups have produced a wealth of evidence for natural variability in resistance/susceptibility to PRRS in our commercial breeding lines. However, up to now, exploiting existing variation has failed because of the difficulty to detect the carriers of favourable and unfavourable alleles, especially with regard to such complex polygenic traits like resistance to PRRS. New hope comes from new genomic tools like next generation sequencing which have become extremely fast and low priced. Thus, research is booming world-wide and the jigsaw puzzle is filling up – slowly but steadily. On the other hand, knowledge from virological and biomedical basic research has opened the way for an “intervening way”, i.e. the modification of identified key genes that occupy key positions in PRRS pathogenesis, like CD163. CD163 was identified as the striking receptor in PRRSV entry and its knockout from the genome by gene editing has led to the production of pigs that were completely resistant to PRRSV – a milestone in modern pig breeding. However, at this early step, concerns remain about the acceptance of societies for gene edited products and regulation still awaits upgrading to the new technology. Further questions arise with regard to upcoming patents from an ethical and legal point of view. Eventually, the importance of CD163 for homeostasis, defence and immunity demands for more insight before its complete or partial silencing can be answered. Whatever path will be followed, even a partial abolishment of PRRSV replication will lead to a significant improvement of the disastrous herd situation, with a significant impact on welfare, performance, antimicrobial consumption and consumer protection. Genetics will be part of a future solution.","Reiner, Gerald",Porcine Health Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382513/,27
3623,Assessing global preparedness for the next pandemic: development and application of an Epidemic Preparedness Index,2019-01-29,"INTRODUCTION: Robust metrics for national-level preparedness are critical for assessing global resilience to epidemic and pandemic outbreaks. However, existing preparedness assessments focus primarily on public health systems or specific legislative frameworks, and do not measure other essential capacities that enable and support public health preparedness and response. METHODS: We developed an Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) to assess national-level preparedness. The EPI is global, covering 188 countries. It consists of five subindices measuring each country’s economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. RESULTS: The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The EPI measures a country’s capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries. The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.","Oppenheim, Ben; Gallivan, Mark; Madhav, Nita K; Brown, Naor; Serhiyenko, Volodymyr; Wolfe, Nathan D; Ayscue, Patrick",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352812/,27
4627,Public-private knowledge transfer and access to medicines: a systematic review and qualitative study of perceptions and roles of scientists involved in HPV vaccine research,2020-03-05,"BACKGROUND: High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) may theoretically provide lung protective ventilation. The negative clinical results may be due to inadequate mean airway pressure (mPaw) settings in HFOV. Our objective was to evaluate the air distribution, ventilatory and hemodynamic effects of individual mPaw titration during HFOV in ARDS animal based on oxygenation and electrical impedance tomography (EIT). METHODS: ARDS was introduced with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage followed by injurious mechanical ventilation in ten healthy male pigs (51.2 ± 1.9 kg). Settings of HFOV were 9 Hz (respiratory frequency), 33% (inspiratory time) and 70 cmH(2)O (∆pressure). After lung recruitment, the mPaw was reduced in steps of 3 cmH(2)O every 6 min. Hemodynamics and blood gases were obtained in each step. Regional ventilation distribution was determined with EIT. RESULTS: PaO(2)/FiO(2) decreased significantly during the mPaw decremental phase (p < 0.001). Lung overdistended regions decreased, while recruitable regions increased as mPaw decreased. The optimal mPaw with respect to PaO(2)/FiO(2) was 21 (18.0–21.0) cmH(2)O, that is comparable to EIT-based center of ventilation (EIT-CoV) and EIT-collapse/over, 19.5 (15.0–21.0) and 19.5 (18.0–21.8), respectively (p = 0.07). EIT-CoV decreasing along with mPaw decrease revealed redistribution toward non-dependent regions. The individual mPaw titrated by EIT-based indices improved regional ventilation distribution with respect to overdistension and collapse (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested personalized optimal mPaw titration by EIT-based indices improves regional ventilation distribution and lung homogeneity during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation.","Liu, Songqiao; Zhao, Zhanqi; Tan, Li; Wang, Lihui; Möller, Knut; Frerichs, Inéz; Yu, Tao; Huang, Yingzi; Pan, Chun; Yang, Yi; Qiu, Haibo",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060304/,27

8599,Manure and Microbes: Public and Animal Health Problem?,2010-04-08,"Fifty-four Holstein and Jersey calves were assigned at 4 days of age within breed and sex to one of four treatments: control consisting of colostrum, milk replacer, and starter; buffered colostrum and replacer (.6% sodium bicarbonate) and starter (2% sodium bicarbonate); acidified colostrum (1% propionic), untreated replacer, and starter; and acidified, buffered colostrum (1% propionic, .6% sodium bicarbonate), buffered replacer (.6% sodium bicarbonate), and starter (2% sodium bicarbonate). The feeding regimen was colostrum once daily, day 4 to 14; milk replacer once daily, day 15 to 28; and calf starter ad libitum, day 4 to 84. Bull calves were fed for 42 days and heifers for 84 days. Calves fed acidified colostrum refused more feed and were less efficient from day 4 to 14 than calves fed buffered colostrum. Bulls were more sensitive to acidified colostrum than heifers. Starter intake, total dry matter intake, and average daily gains were similar for all calves during days 4 to 84. Rumen fluid from calves fed diets with sodium bicarbonate was higher in acetate and lower in propionate and lactate than that from calves fed diets without sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate improved intake of acidified colostrum during the first 2 or 3 days of feeding but had no other effect on gain or feed intake.","Eppard, P.J.; Otterby, D.E.; Lundquist, R.G.; Linn, J.G.",J Dairy Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7130920/,27

11985,Strategies to Improve Health Communication: Can Health Professionals Be Heroes?,2020-06-22,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a sensitive monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect Vip3Aa in genetically modified (GM) crops and their products. RESULTS: Vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vips) are secreted by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and are known to be toxic to Lepidoptera species. Vip3Aa family proteins, Vip3Aa19 and Vip3Aa20, were successfully applied in GM crops to confer an effective and persistent insecticidal resistance. A sensitive monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA was developed to detect Vip3Aa in GM crops and their products. Two monoclonal antibodies were raised against the overexpressed and purified His-Vip3Aa20, were purified from mouse ascites and characterized. A sandwich ELISA method was developed using the 2G3-1D7 monoclonal antibody for capture and the biotin-labeled 1F9-1F5 monoclonal antibody for detection of Vip3Aa20. The linear detection range of the method was found to be approximately 31.25–500 pg/ml, with a sensitivity of 10.24 pg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: The established ELISA was effective for detecting Vip3Aa family proteins other than Vip3Aa8, and was successfully applied in the detection of Vip3Aa20 and Vip3Aa19 expressed in transgenic maize and cotton.","Liu, Weixiao; Liu, Xuri; Liu, Chao; Zhang, Zhe; Jin, Wujun",Biotechnol Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354279/,27
14895,COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean: what is known about the status of school reopening?,2020-12-02,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is one of the major causes of neonatal mortality in Pakistan. This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcomes, antibiotic use and its resistance pattern among neonatal sepsis patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. We also aimed to identify the factors affecting mortality in neonatal sepsis patients. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric wards of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. All eligible neonatal sepsis patients who were registered at the study site from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the study. The data collection form included information on patient’s characteristics, antibiotic use and its sensitivity pattern, laboratory and microbiological data, and final treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes included, discharged (with treatment success), leave against medical advice (LAMA), discharged on request (DOR) and death. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the independent factors associated with death. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the total 586 patients, 398 (67.9%) were male, 328 (56%) were preterm, 415 (70.8%) were diagnosed with early onset sepsis, 299 (51%) were born with low birth weight. Most of the patients (n = 484, 82.6%) were treated with amikacin+cefotaxime at the start of treatment. Culture was positive in 52 (8.9%) patients and the most commonly identified bacteria included, Klebsiella species (n = 19, 36.5%) followed by E. coli (n = 15, 28.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8, 15.4%). The identified bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics initiated at the start of the treatment, while resistance against piperacillin+tazobactam, imipenem, vancomycin and linezolid was very low. Just under half of the patients (n = 280, 47.8%) successfully completed the treatment (i.e., discharged with treatment success), while 123 (21%) patients died during treatment. In multivariable binary logistic regression, the factors which still remained significantly associated with neonatal death included, preterm delivery (AOR 9.59; 95% CI 4.41, 20.84), sub-optimal birth weight (AOR 5.13; 95% CI 2.19, 12.04), early onset sepsis (AOR 2.99; 95% CI 1.39, 6.41) and length of hospital stay (AOR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.88). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate associated with sepsis was high in our study cohort. The bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics started as the empiric therapy. Rational use of antibiotics can decrease the adverse outcomes in neonatal sepsis patients.","Atif, Muhammad; Zia, Rabia; Malik, Iram; Ahmad, Nafees; Sarwar, Sajjad",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806133/,27

It has a strong and steady characteristic learning capability, thus selecting the main influence data that influence the change of graduates' employment data. In this paper, according to the situation embodied by students' employment, a data mining analysis model is set up by using the statistical method based on the model of cluster analysis technology to forecast the employment situation of graduates. In this paper, a forecast technique of graduates' employment situation based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is conceived, including network structure design, network training, and forecast process implementation algorithm. In addition, aiming at minimizing the forecasting error, an LSTM forecasting model parameter optimization algorithm based on multilayer grid search is conceived. It also verifies the applicability and correctness of the LSTM forecasting model and its parameter optimization algorithm in the analysis of graduates' employment situation.","Li, Xing; Yang, Ting",Comput Intell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490037/,27

It will make it possible to carry out the search for potential riboswitches in the genome of other socially important pathogens. For S. enterica, apart from the known 4U RNA thermometer, four hairpin-loop structures were identified which may probably act as additional RNA thermometers. They satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions for formation of RNA thermometers and are highly conservative uncanonical structures, since these highly conservative structures were found in the genome of all 25 isolates of S. enterica.

24619,Old and New Pestilences,2005,"Anemia is common in critically ill patients. More than 90% of patients have subnormal hemoglobin by the third day of ICU admission. Despite the fact that blood transfusions have not been shown to improve the outcome of ICU patients (see below) and that the current guidelines recommend blood transfusion only when the hemoglobin falls below 7.0 g/dl, almost half of all patients admitted to an ICU receive a blood transfusion.(1,2) The etiology of anemia of critical illness is multi-factorial and complex. Repeated phlebotomy, gastrointestinal blood loss, and other surgical procedures contribute significantly to the development of anemia. Red cell production in critically ill patients is often abnormal and is involved in the development and maintenance of anemia. The pathophysiology of this anemia includes decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), impaired bone marrow response to erythropoietin, and reduced red cell survival.","Marik, Paul Ellis",Handbook of Evidence-Based Critical Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120999/,27

25915,"Health Policy, Programmes and Initiatives",2019-10-26,"Challenges that threaten the long-term survival of nonhuman primates (NHP) include habitat fragmentation, hunting, and increasingly, infectious diseases. In addition to direct mortality from noninfectious diseases (e.g., hunting) and infectious diseases (e.g., Ebola), human-driven alterations of environments that support NHP often contribute to a decline in population viability. This decline is frequently the result of physiological stress, poor reproduction, decreased immunity, and exposure to novel pathogens. To better understand the diseases that threaten NHP populations, a conservation medicine approach—the application of medicine to augment the conservation of wildlife and ecosystems—is imperative so that we may provide management solutions to help ensure the long-term survival of NHP. Additionally, it is crucial that we gain a better understanding of pathogens at the interface of nonhuman and human primates since the zoonotic potential may create conservation challenges, or alternatively may provide the impetus for conservation actions to be practiced (e.g., minimize bushmeat trade).","Deem, Sharon L.",Ethnoprimatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122636/,27

In the past two weeks, the American taxpayer has been put on the hook for $8 billion, then $50 billion and now possibly $1 trillion for COVID‐19 — most recently to bail out hotels, airlines and businesses in general, not to mention giving checks to individual Americans. This virus needs to be combatted with everything science can offer, but can we really buy people into acceptance of financial losses while not funding treatment, public health and the safety net the way they always should have been funded? You can expect to see fewer headlines about opioids and more about viruses (in the mainstream media, not in ADAW, of course). As ADAW readers well know, addiction goes on. So does good news like recovery. So keep your eye on the ball and advocate for your patients. There must be something in that $1 trillion for them.

31810,A planetary health perspective on COVID-19: a call for papers,2020-04-03,"A novel coronavirus was identified as the aetiological agent for the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The SARS coronavirus genome encodes for proteins that are common to all members of the coronavirus, i.e. replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) and structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope), as well as eight accessory proteins. The accessory proteins have been designated as open reading frames (ORF) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b, and they do not show significant homology to viral proteins of other known coronaviruses. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the part of the viral genome that encodes for ORF8a and ORF8b showed major variations and the animal isolates contain an additional 29-nucleotide sequence which is absent in most of the human isolates. As a result, ORF8a and ORF8b in the human isolates become one ORF, termed ORF8ab. In this chapter, we will discuss the genetic variation in the ORF8 region, expression of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab during infection, cellular localization and posttranslational modification of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab, participation of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab in viral–viral interactions, their effects on other viral proteins and impact on viral replication and/or pathogenesis.","Keng, Choong-Tat; Tan, Yee-Joo",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176222/,27

Champions of NATO expansion aver that it maintains peace in Europe and promotes democracy in East-Central Europe. They add that Russia has nothing to fear. But Russia’s leaders have always seen NATO expansion differently. The article also examines NATO’s enlargement as it relates to US post-Cold War grand strategy.

Irrespective of sizes of companies, small, medium or large, it is customary to evolve a business strategy, in order to set the future strategic position of the firm in the marketplace in terms of product and service offering, pricing and growth strategy. An organization could have an ideal strategy formulation in place, but without proper implementation mechanism it would be waste of resource and time and a pointless effort that could not produce the expected result. The research methodology employed in this study is literature review of peer reviewed articles published in quality journals. The analysis and discussion led to findings that there is always a room for incremental innovation and customer value proposition that would lead to create a new demand and market space. Moreover, there is no ‘one size fit’ strategy that would give winning edge for businesses, rather situational approach and combined strategy option could be the approach recommended.","Yeshitila, Desalegn; Kitaw, Daniel; Jilcha, Kassu; Muchie, Mamo",JGBC,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7560787/,27

A study of maternal gene expression changes between different delivery modes can add to our understanding of how CS contributes to disease patterns later in life. We evaluated the association of delivery mode with postpartum gene expression using a cross-sectional study of 324 mothers who delivered full-term (≥ 37 weeks) singletons. Of these, 181 mothers had a vaginal delivery and 143 had a CS delivery (60 with and 83 without labor). Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) were upregulated in vaginal delivery compared to CS with or without labor. Peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3), a gene in the antimicrobial peptide pathway and known to be involved in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities, showed a twofold increase in vaginal delivery compared to CS with or without labor (adjusted p-value 1.57 × 10(–11) and 3.70 × 10(–13), respectively). This study evaluates differences in gene expression by delivery mode and provides evidence of antimicrobial peptide upregulation in vaginal delivery compared to CS with or without labor.

To date, there have been no reported cases of A. phagocytophilum infection found in both the biting tick and the patient following a tick bite. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old woman presented with fever following a tick bite, with the tick still intact on her body. The patient was diagnosed with HGA. The tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by morphological and molecular biological detection methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The patient’s blood was cultured after inoculation into the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. A. phagocytophilum growth was confirmed via culture and isolation. A. phagocytophilum was identified in both the tick and the patient’s blood by Anaplasma-specific groEL- and ankA-based nested polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing. Moreover, a four-fold elevation in antibodies was observed in the patient’s blood. CONCLUSION: We report a case of a patient diagnosed with HGA following admission for fever due to a tick bite. A. phagocytophilum was identified in both the tick and the patient, and A. phagocytophilum was successfully cultured. The present study suggests the need to investigate the possible incrimination of I. nipponensis as a vector for HGA in Korea.

Acidic EOW with pH ranging from 2 to 5 is regarded most applicable in the antimicrobial treatment of vegetables and meats. Neutral and alkaline electrolyzed water have also been explored in few studies for their applications in the food industry. Neutral electrolyzed water is proposed to solve the problems related to the storage and corrosion effect of acidic EOW. Recently, the research focus has been shifted toward the application of slightly acidic EOW as more effective with some supplemental physical and chemical treatment methods such as ultrasound and UV radiations. The different applications of electrolyzed water range from drinking water and wastewater to food, utensil, and hard surfaces. The recent studies also conclude that electrolyzed water is more effective in suspensions as compared with the food surfaces where longer retention times are required. The commercialization of EOW instruments is not adopted frequently in many countries due to the potential corrosion problems associated with acidic electrolyzed water. This review article summarizes the EOW types and possible mechanism of action as well as highlights the most recent research studies in the field of antimicrobial applications and cleaning. Electrolyzed water can replace conventional chemical decontamination methods in the industry and household. However, more research is needed to know its actual mechanism of antimicrobial action along with the primary concerns related to EOW in the processing of different food products.","Iram, Attia; Wang, Xinmiao; Demirci, Ali",Food Eng Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7893620/,27

Potential pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CIPN include chronic oxidative stress and subsequent increase in free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines. Approaches for the treatment of CIPN are highly limited in their number and efficacy, although several antioxidant-based therapies have been tried. On the other hand, ozone therapy can induce an adaptive antioxidant and anti-inflammatory response, which could be potentially useful in the management of CIPN. (2) Methods: The aims of this works are: (a) to summarize the potential mechanisms that could induce CIPN by the most relevant drugs (platinum, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and bortezomib), with particular focus on the role of oxidative stress; (b) to summarize the current situation of prophylactic and treatment approaches; (c) to describe the action mechanisms of ozone therapy to modify oxidative stress and inflammation with its potential repercussions for CIPN; (d) to describe related experimental and clinical reports with ozone therapy in chemo-induced neurologic symptoms and CIPN; and (e) to show the main details about an ongoing focused clinical trial. (3) Results: A wide background relating to the mechanisms of action and a small number of experimental and clinical reports suggest that ozone therapy could be useful to prevent or improve CIPN.

Breast cancer surgery remained vital, however, to reduce theatre capacity pressures and re-admission rates the procedures available were rationalised to keep the risk of complications low. Immediate breast reconstruction was stopped. COVID-19 recovery meant careful reintroduction of complex surgeries, with competing interests from different surgical specialities for theatre capacity within the Trust. The psychological effects of breast cancer are significant. Therefore, it was important to advocate for our patients and ensure the reintroduction of this service. METHOD: To strengthen our case, a retrospective audit of all immediate breast reconstruction outcomes was performed for cases during the 12 months preceding COVID-19. RESULTS: 64 patients underwent immediate implant and Acellular Dermal Matrix (ADM) breast reconstruction. Five (7.8%) patients returned to theatre. One (1.5%) returned during their initial in-patient stay due to haematoma. Four patients (6.3%) returned between 3 and 12 weeks following their original surgery date. Infection rates were higher in smokers or those with a BMI >35. CONCLUSIONS: These results were presented to management and the reconstruction services were re-introduced in our Trust with stringent inclusion criteria.

53780,Articles for a Special Issue of Public Organization Review (POR) on the Scientization of Public Decision-Making Processes – the Relevance for the Handling of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-03,"Automatic segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modalities magnetic resonance image data has the potential to enable preoperative planning and intraoperative volume measurement. Recent advances in deep convolutional neural network technology have opened up an opportunity to achieve end-to-end segmenting the brain tumor areas. However, the medical image data used in brain tumor segmentation are relatively scarce and the appearance of brain tumors is varied, so that it is difficult to find a learnable pattern to directly describe tumor regions. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modalities interactive feature learning framework to segment brain tumors from the multi-modalities data. The core idea is that the multi-modality MR data contain rich patterns of the normal brain regions, which can be easily captured and can be potentially used to detect the non-normal brain regions, i.e., brain tumor regions. The proposed multi-modalities interactive feature learning framework consists of two modules: cross-modality feature extracting module and attention guided feature fusing module, which aim at exploring the rich patterns cross multi-modalities and guiding the interacting and the fusing process for the rich features from different modalities. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the BraTS 2018 benchmark, which show that the proposed cross-modality feature learning framework can effectively improve the brain tumor segmentation performance when compared with the baseline methods and state-of-the-art methods.","Wang, Bo; Yang, Jingyi; Peng, Hong; Ai, Jingyang; An, Lihua; Yang, Bo; You, Zheng; Ma, Lin",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8158657/,27

This present work aimed to investigate the protective effects of R. japonica var. glaucocalyx glycoproteins on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the potential mechanism. Methods: Glycoproteins (XPS) were isolated from R. japonica var. glaucocalyx, and homogeneous glycoprotein (XPS5-1) was purified from XPS. ANA-1 cells were used to observe the effect of glycoproteins on the secretion of inflammatory mediators by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry assay, immunofluorescence assay, and Western blot analysis were performed to detect macrophage polarization in vitro. The ALI model was induced by LPS via intratracheal instillation, and XPS (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically 2 h later. The mechanisms of XPS against ALI were investigated by Western blot, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. Results: In vitro, XPS and XPS5-1 downregulated LPS-induced proinflammatory mediators production including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and nitric oxide (NO) and upregulated LPS-induced IL-10 secretion. The LPS-stimulated macrophage polarization was also modulated from M1 to M2. In vivo, XPS maintained pulmonary histology with significantly reducing protein concentration and numbers of mononuclear cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The level of IL-10 in BALF was upregulated by XPS treatment. The level of cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 was downregulated. XPS also decreased infiltration of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in lung. XPS suppressed the expression of key proteins in the TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway. Conclusion: XPS was demonstrated to be a potential agent for treating ALI. Our findings might provide evidence supporting the traditional application of R. japonica var. glaucocalyx in inflammation-linked diseases.","Ren, An-qi; Wang, Hui-jun; Zhu, Hai-yan; Ye, Guan; Li, Kun; Chen, Dao-feng; Zeng, Tao; Li, Hong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8333617/,27

Logistics Service Quality (LSQ) is becoming a more important aspect for LSPs and logistics service customers. In recent years, there has been an increase in the studies on service quality in logistics. Researchers have been trying to identify aspects of LSQ and its dimensions in order to create a measurement model that could be used in overall logistics services. However, there is still neither a unified nor agreed LSQ measurement model in the literature and researchers have been debating continuously on the proposed models. This paper targets to investigate and suggest LSQ measurement dimensions obtained from previous studies by analyzing the findings within a systematic approach and improving the findings with semi-structured interviews. In this study, systematic literature analysis has been conducted to research papers published in selected academic databases with specific keyword and keyword cluster searches to identify the related articles published within a specified period. Papers have been selected in accordance with the predefined criteria. As a result, a total of 59 articles have been determined for the search criteria and the findings obtained were analyzed. Most frequently used research trends and methods on service quality in logistics have been identified. In addition, the most frequently used LSQ dimensions and factors have been reviewed. Moreover, the most frequently used service quality approaches and measurement models have been analyzed. The results received from systematic literature review have been composed and dimensions have been identified. Semi-structured interviews with LSPs and customers of LSPs in Germany-based companies have been conducted to strengthen the findings gained from systematic literature review. 5 LSQ dimensions and 24 factors have been formed with the help of semi-structured interviews.

A proactive treatment regimen, given in response to signal within the niche but before symptoms appeared, substantially reduced disease. This technology offers a new approach to monitor organ-specific autoimmunity, and represents a platform to analyze immune dysfunction within otherwise inaccessible target tissues.","Morris, Aaron H; Hughes, Kevin R; Oakes, Robert S; Cai, Michelle M; Miller, Stephen D; Irani, David N; Shea, Lonnie D",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17629-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747712/,27

Based on the backpropagation algorithm, a feedforward neural network was established to estimate and forecast the outlet flow temperature of SFPC. To identify the most appropriate model, the ANN topology hidden layer, the number of hidden neurons, iteration, and statistical indicators were analyzed. In the first ANN modeling (CASE I), five parameters, including solar radiation, inlet flow temperature, flow rate, ambient temperature, and wind speed, were applied in the input layer of the network, while the output flow temperature (subsequently efficiency) was in the output layer. In the second artificial neural network modeling (CASE II), the wind speed was omitted from the input of the ANN model. Results showed that the ANN with four inputs yields more accurate results for both estimation and prediction of outlet flow temperature.","Shafiey Dehaj, Mohammad; Zamani Mohiabadi, Mostafa; Hosseini, Seyed Mohammad Sadegh",Environmental monitoring and assessment,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08738-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215263/,27

This study evaluated the short-term and long-term results and predictors of success of below-knee popliteal artery endovascular interventions. METHODS This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained endovascular lower extremity database of all patients with below-knee popliteal interventions from 2004 to 2012. Patient demographics, angiographic findings, interventions, primary and secondary patency, limb loss, and mortality were recorded. Analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier life-table and multivariate analysis, with P < .05 indicating significance. RESULTS There were 221 patients (56% male) with below-knee popliteal/P3 artery lesions. Mean age was 73 ± 11.2 years. Claudication was present in 22% and critical limb ischemia (CLI) in 78%. Mean lesion length was 10 ± 8.5 cm, with 45% having total occlusions. Treatment included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or without a stent (47%), atherectomy (ATH) with or without PTA/stent (52%), and stenting with PTA and ATH (3%). Complications included embolization (0.4%), hematoma (2.7%), pseudoaneurysm (1.3%), and dissection (7%). Freedom from restenosis (peak systolic velocity ratio >2.4) was 65% at 1 year. Independent predictors of restenosis were CLI (hazard risk [HR], 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-9.9) and stenting combined with PTA and ATH (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.01-7.4). Primary assisted and secondary patencies were 95% and 85% at 1 year. ATH with PTA had lower short-term restenosis in diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic patients (95% vs 78% at 4 months). Limb loss was 18% at 4 years. Mortality was 24% at 4 years. Statin use was protective against primary restenosis (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.67) and death (HR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.28-1.0). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular intervention for lesions involving the below-knee popliteal artery is a safe and effective therapy for claudication and CLI. Diabetic patients benefit most from ATH with PTA. Statin use is protective against restenosis and mortality and should be the standard of care in patients undergoing peripheral endovascular interventions.","Siracuse, Jeffrey J; Gill, Heather L; Cassidy, Stephen P; Messina, Mark D; Catz, Diana; Egorova, Natalia; Parrack, Inkyong; McKinsey, James F",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2014.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650745/,27

The complementary learning systems (CLS) framework explains this with the small difference in familiarity strength between targets and foils. The framework, however, also predicts that familiarity values of targets and corresponding similar foils are directly comparable - as long as they are presented side by side in a forced-choice corresponding (FCC) test. This is because in each trial, targets tend to be more familiar than their corresponding foils. In contrast, when forced-choice displays contain non-corresponding foils (FCNC) which are similar to other studied items, familiarity values are not directly comparable (as in yes/no-tasks). In a recognition memory task with pictures of objects, we found that the putative ERP correlate of familiarity, the mid-frontal old/new effect for targets vs. foils, was significantly larger in FCC compared to FCNC displays. Moreover, single-trial target-foil amplitude differences predicted the accuracy of the recognition judgment. This study supports the assumption of the CLS framework that the test format can influence the diagnostic reliability of familiarity. Moreover, it implies that the mid-frontal old/new effect does not reflect the difference in the familiarity signal between studied and non-studied items but the task-adequate assessment of this signal.","Bader, Regine; Mecklinger, Axel; Meyer, Patric",Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2020.107659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069793/,27

Previously, the DCB showed favorable 1-year outcomes compared with conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), yet durability of the treatment effect with DCBs remains unknown. OBJECTIVES This study sought to investigate the longer-term outcomes of a paclitaxel-eluting DCB compared to PTA for femoropopliteal lesions. METHODS We enrolled 331 patients with symptomatic (Rutherford 2 to 4) femoropopliteal lesions up to 18 cm in length. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with DCB or PTA. The 24-month assessments included primary patency, freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), major adverse events, and quality of life and functional outcomes as assessed by the EuroQOL-5D quality-of-life questionnaire, walking impairment questionnaire, and 6-min walk test. RESULTS At 24 months, patients treated with DCB showed significantly higher primary patency when compared with PTA (78.9% vs. 50.1%; p < 0.001). The rates of CD-TLR were 9.1% and 28.3% (p < 0.001) for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively. The overall mortality rate in the DCB group was 8.1% versus 0.9% in the PTA group (p = 0.008). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths and no major amputations in either group through 24-month follow-up. The rate of vessel thrombosis was low (1.5% DCB vs. 3.8% PTA; p = 0.243), with no new events reported between 1 and 2 years. Both groups showed similar functional improvement at 2 years, although DCB patients achieved this level of function with 58% fewer reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS The 24-month outcomes from the trial demonstrate a durable and superior treatment effect of DCB versus PTA with significantly higher primary patency, lower CD-TLR, and similar functional status improvement with fewer repeat interventions.

METHODS Mortality data were obtained from the Department of Health and hospitalization data from the Hospital Authority, Hong Kong. Incidence/prevalence data were obtained from local registries or local studies. Trends of mortality and hospitalization rates of various respiratory diseases from 1997 and 2005 were calculated after age standardization and were tested for significance using negative binomial regression analysis. Age standardized mortality rates in Hong Kong were compared with those of the UK and globally. RESULTS Respiratory disease was the most common cause of mortality and hospitalization in Hong Kong in 2005. Globally and in the UK, cardiovascular disease ranked first in mortality. Respiratory infections ranked first in respiratory mortality, followed by respiratory tract cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease. Respiratory infections also ranked first followed by chronic obstructive lung disease in the utilization of respiratory inpatient bed-days. While mortality rates from all respiratory diseases decreased in the past decade, hospitalization rates remained unchanged. Unlike other respiratory diseases, mortality from respiratory infections have increased since 2001. Smoking is the most important risk factor in non-communicable respiratory diseases.

Cleft lip and palate repair was classified as low acuity, and nasoalveolar molding (NAM) clinics were closed. Anticipating the consequences of delayed cleft care and the additional burden this would cause families, we reassessed our risk-stratification and perioperative algorithms. We hypothesized we could safely optimize nasolabial repair without burdening our care systems and without increasing COVID-19-related morbidity/mortality. METHODS Our multidisciplinary cleft team reevaluated patient selection to maximize surgical impact. Perioperative protocols were adjusted, and COVID-19 preoperative testing was utilized before nasolabial repair and prior to suture removal under anesthesia. RESULTS Early in the pandemic, unilateral cleft repair was prioritized and successfully completed on 9 patients. There were no complications related to COVID-19. Nasoalveolar molding clinic was reopened after total patient volume was significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS We offer an approach for surgical management of nasolabial clefts during a global pandemic.

This qualitative study describes behavioral health provider perspectives on the use of telebehavioral health before and during the pandemic and how policy changes impacted access to and utilization of behavioral health services in Michigan. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 31 licensed and nonlicensed behavioral health providers operating in Michigan participated in semi-structured interviews between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using inductive methods. Results: The thematic analysis resulted in four overarching themes: (1) increased access to care; (2) maintenance of quality of care; (3) minimal privacy concerns; and (4) client and provider satisfaction. Discussion: During and post-pandemic, providers need flexibility to determine whether in-person or telebehavioral health services, including audio-only, best meet client needs. Providers identified several populations for which telebehavioral health was less accessible: clients with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, those with no broadband Internet access, children, and older adults. Additional training in telebehavioral health service provision can positively impact quality of care. Conclusion: Policies that support reimbursement parity and expand provider use of telebehavioral health services should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic ends to avoid imposing barriers to accessing behavioral health care barriers post-pandemic.","Schoebel, Victoria; Wayment, Caitlyn; Gaiser, Maria; Page, Cory; Buche, Jessica; Beck, Angela J",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028302/,27

However, it is not known whether these distinctions can be refined by added information about co-morbid conditions. The current report presents results on this question. METHOD Data came from 8261 respondents with lifetime DSM-IV MDD in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Outcomes included four retrospectively reported measures of persistence/severity of course (years in episode; years in chronic episodes; hospitalization for MDD; disability due to MDD). Machine learning methods (regression tree analysis; lasso, ridge and elastic net penalized regression) followed by k-means cluster analysis were used to augment previously detected subtypes with information about prior co-morbidity to predict these outcomes. RESULTS Predicted values were strongly correlated across outcomes. Cluster analysis of predicted values found three clusters with consistently high, intermediate or low values. The high-risk cluster (32.4% of cases) accounted for 56.6-72.9% of high persistence, high chronicity, hospitalization and disability. This high-risk cluster had both higher sensitivity and likelihood ratio positive (LR+; relative proportions of cases in the high-risk cluster versus other clusters having the adverse outcomes) than in a parallel analysis that excluded measures of co-morbidity as predictors. CONCLUSIONS Although the results using the retrospective data reported here suggest that useful MDD subtyping distinctions can be made with machine learning and clustering across multiple indicators of illness persistence/severity, replication with prospective data is needed to confirm this preliminary conclusion.","Wardenaar, K J; van Loo, H M; Cai, T; Fava, M; Gruber, M J; Li, J; de Jonge, P; Nierenberg, A A; Petukhova, M V; Rose, S; Sampson, N A; Schoevers, R A; Wilcox, M A; Alonso, J; Bromet, E J; Bunting, B; Florescu, S E; Fukao, A; Gureje, O; Hu, C; Huang, Y Q; Karam, A N; Levinson, D; Medina Mora, M E; Posada-Villa, J; Scott, K M; Taib, N I; Viana, M C; Xavier, M; Zarkov, Z; Kessler, R C",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291714000993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25066141/,27

METHOD We reviewed the literature to investigate clinical outcomes and the rates of recanalization, symptomatic intracerebral hematoma, and mortality in mechanical thrombectomy performed using second-generation thrombectomy devices. We compared the outcomes between patients treated for M2 and M1 occlusions. RESULTS Seven studies involving 805 patients with M2 thrombectomy were included in this meta-analysis. The functional independence rate 90 days after thrombectomy (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was 59.3% (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.74-1.88). The recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 0-2) was 84.16% (OR 2.32, 95% CI 2.08-2.29). The symptomatic intracerebral hematoma rate was 4.9% (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.09). The mortality was 7.7% (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13). The outcomes were better in patients with M2 occlusion than in those with M1 occlusion. In a subgroup analysis, we found that among patients with hypertension, mechanical thrombectomy achieved better functional outcomes and recanalization in M2 occlusion than M1 occlusion. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy performed with second-generation thrombectomy devices for M2 occlusion can provide a good functional outcome as well as satisfying recanalization. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the symptomatic intracerebral hematoma and mortality rates, suggesting this procedure is as safe in M2 occlusion as in M1 occlusion.","Li, Guangshuo; Huang, Rui; Li, Weishuai; Zhang, Xiaotian; Bi, Guorong","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019919886405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684784/,27

The foreign body was found endoscopically, stuck between the nasal septum and the superior turbinate tail at the upper level of the left choana and removed under general anesthesia in a negative pressure operating room with the health care personnel wearing personal protective equipment. Unpleasant complications like the one described can happen when the swab is collected without the necessary knowledge of nasal anatomy or conducted inappropriately, especially in noncooperative patients. Moreover, the design of currently used viral swabs may expose to accidental rupture, with risk of foreign body retention in the nasal cavities. In such cases, diagnosis and treatment are endoscopy-guided procedures performed in an adequate setting to minimize the risk of spreading of the pandemic.","Gaffuri, Michele; Capaccio, Pasquale; Torretta, Sara; Daga, Marco; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo; Pignataro, Lorenzo","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561321993933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634718/,27
71415,Defining Moments: A Nurse's Touch.,2020-08-26,"OBJECTIVE In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Israeli government strategy initially focused on containment. The Ministry of Health mandated isolation of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and instructed healthcare institutions to make necessary arrangements. As the second Israeli hospital to establish a COVID-19 department, this article describes our experience in its rapid establishment, while maintaining normal medical center activities. SETTING Establishing the COVID-19 department involved planning, set-up, and implementations phases, each one based on knowledge available regarding the pandemic and established medical standards for isolation and protection of patients and staff. Wherever possible, new innovative technologies were utilized to provide maximum protection for both patients and staff, together with special online training that was developed for medical teams. RESULTS A COVID-19 department was successfully established on the hospital campus, remote from other ongoing patient activities. A novel methodology of disease-adapted medicine was implemented successfully among the department's medical staff, who underwent training tailored to expected clinical scenarios. The COVID-19 department is receiving patients, with no contamination of medical personnel to date. A recent survey of COVID-19 patients revealed a very high patient satisfaction rate. CONCLUSION Based on the experience described herein and lessons learned, the hospital is preparing for a potential large-scale COVID-19 wave, aimed at full readiness through utilization of a fortified underground emergency hospital to treat up to 900 COVID-19 patients, and establishment of versatile in-hospital infrastructure for quick conversion from standard conditions to COVID-19 appropriate conditions.","Berger, Gidon; Horowitz, Netanel A; Shachor-Meyouhas, Yael; Gepstein, Vardit; Hussein, Khetam; Weismann, Avi; Hyams, Gila; Geffen, Yuval; Mekel, Michal; Halberthal, Michael",American journal of disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.5055/ajdm.2021.0384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954973/,27
71423,Racialization as a Barrier to Achieving Health Equity for Native Americans.,2020-10-01,"The aim of the study is to compare the utility and efficacy of the LigaSure system and standard surgical clips for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The medical records of 473 patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy between May 2011 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. The patients were divided into the LigaSure (n = 125) and Hem-o-lok (n = 348) groups, based on the device used to ligate the vascular pedicle. Owing to differences in the patient characteristics, a 1:2 propensity score matching was performed. In the final matched cohort, 375 patients were included for analysis. The median initial prostate-specific antigen level was not significantly different between the two groups. The median surgical and console times were significantly shorter for the LigaSure group than for the Hem-o-lok group (p < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins was significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (24.8 vs 40.8%, p = 0.002). The number of specimens with positive surgical margins for pathological stage T2 cases was also significantly lower in the LigaSure group than in the Hem-o-lok group (17.0 vs 37.5%, p < 0.001). However, non-focal positive surgical margins and biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 1 year postoperatively were not significantly different (11.2 vs 18.4%, p = 0.075 and 91.2 vs 92.8%, p = 0.565, respectively). The LigaSure system was associated with fewer positive surgical margins and shorter operation time, indicating that it could be a useful alternative to Hem-o-lok clips for controlling the prostatic pedicle in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, despite its high costs.","Hamamoto, Shuzo; AbdelRazek, Mostafa; Naiki, Taku; Taguchi, Kazumi; Etani, Toshiki; Iwatsuki, Shoichiro; Ando, Ryosuke; Okada, Atsushi; Kawai, Noriyasu; Yasui, Takahiro",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-020-01180-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33426579/,27

However, a recent meta-analysis based on low-quality trials suggested no evidence of supplementation benefit. A systematic review and meta-analysis of high-quality observational cohort studies should provide us further evidences. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE, and WEB-of-SCIENCE databases were systematically searched to identify eligible studies published before October 2018. Prospective cohort studies assessing the associations of serum 25(OH)D levels with MS relapses, radiological inflammatory lesions, or changes in expanded disability status scale in adults (≥18 years) with MS were included. Pooled RRs were calculated using fixed-effect or random-effects model depending on heterogeneity. RESULTS Thirteen studies and 3498 patients were included. Each 25 nmol/L increase in serum 25(OH)D levels was associated with a reduction in (1) clinical relapse rate [RR = 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.99], (2) gadolinium-enhancing lesions (RR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.60-0.79), (3) new/enlarging T2 lesions (RR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77-0.95), and (4) new active lesions (RR = 0.81; 95% CI = 0.74-0.89) in the magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). CONCLUSIONS Serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a modest decrease in relapse rate and radiological inflammatory activities in patients with MS.

Postoperative apathy cannot always be related to a dose reduction of dopaminergic medication and stimulation itself may play a role. OBJECTIVE We studied whether apathy in DBS-treated PD patients could be a stimulation effect. METHODS In 26 PD patients we acquired apathy scores before and >6 months after DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Magnetoencephalography recordings (ON and OFF stimulation) were performed >6 months after DBS placement. Change in apathy severity was correlated with (i) improvement in motor function and dose reduction of dopaminergic medication, (ii) stimulation location (merged MRI and CT-scans) and (iii) stimulation-related changes in functional connectivity of brain regions that have an alleged role in apathy. RESULTS Average apathy severity significantly increased after DBS (p<0.001) and the number of patients considered apathetic increased from two to nine. Change in apathy severity did not correlate with improvement in motor function or dose reduction of dopaminergic medication. For the left hemisphere, increase in apathy was associated with a more dorsolateral stimulation location (p=0.010). The increase in apathy severity correlated with a decrease in alpha1 functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p=0.006), but not with changes of the medial orbitofrontal or the anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS The present observations suggest that apathy after STN-DBS is not necessarily related to dose reductions of dopaminergic medication, but may be an effect of the stimulation itself. This highlights the importance of determining optimal DBS settings based on both motor and non-motor symptoms.","Boon, Lennard I; Potters, Wouter V; Zoon, Thomas J C; van den Heuvel, Odile A; Prent, Naomi; Bie, Rob M A de; Bot, Maarten; Schuurman, P Richard; van den Munckhof, Pepijn; Geurtsen, Gert J; Hillebrand, Arjan; Stam, Cornelis J; Rootselaar, Anne-Fleur van; Berendse, Henk W",Brain stimulation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brs.2020.12.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385593/,27

Here, we report about our local experience in a region with high COVID-19 prevalence and dynamically increasing infection rates. Methods: Within the 8 day period of March 16-24, 2020, hybrid imaging studies of asymptomatic patients who underwent 18F-FDG-PET/CT or 131I-SPECT/CT for standard oncologic indications at our institution in Brescia, Italy, were analyzed for findings suggestive of COVID-19. Presence, radiological features and metabolic activity of interstitial pneumonia were identified, correlated with subsequent short-term clinical course and described in a case series. Results: Six of 65 patients (9%) that underwent PET/CT for various malignancies showed unexpected signs of interstitial pneumonia on CT and elevated regional FDG-avidity. Additionally, 1 of 12 patients who received radioiodine for differentiated thyroid carcinoma also showed interstitial pneumonia on SPECT/CT. 5/7 patients had subsequent proof of COVID-19 by RT-PCR. The remaining 2 patients were not tested immediately but underwent quarantine and careful monitoring. Conclusion: Incidental findings suggestive of COVID-19 may not be infrequent in hybrid imaging of asymptomatic patients, in regions with expansive spread of SARS-CoV-2.

But is diabetes per se a risk factor that increases the probability of getting the virus? This paper will discuss this point. There are not many research data on antidiabetic drugs in this context. The potential influence of glucose-lowering agents on the severity of COVID-19 has not been described yet. Dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a cell surface protein ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and it is also a soluble molecule found in serum/plasma fluids. DPP-4 is involved in infection of cells by some viruses. This paper reviews data about the use of DPP-4 inhibitors and others diabetes drugs on COVID-19 patients. As such, no available evidence has yet suggested that glucose-lowering drugs - including those targeting DPP4-related pathways - produce any significant harm or benefit in the context of human infections. However, insulin must remain the first-choice agent in the management of critically ill-hospitalized patients, while it is recommended to suspend other agents in unstable patients. This paper provides related French and international recommendations for people with diabetes who got infected by COVID-19 and upholds that infections may alter glucose control and may require additional vigilance.","Bouhanick, Béatrice; Cracowski, Jean-Luc; Faillie, Jean-Luc",Therapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32471607/,27

Taxonomic boundaries and relationships within flying squirrels remain an area of active research in mammalogy. The discovery of new specimens of Pteromys ( Hylopetes) leonardi Thomas, 1921 previously considered a synonym of Hylopetes alboniger, in Yunnan Province, China allowed a morphological and genetic reassessment of the status of this taxon. Phylogenetic reconstruction was implemented using sequences of two mitochondrial (12S ribosomal DNA and 16S ribosomal DNA) and one nuclear (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein) gene fragments. Morphological assessments involved examinations of features preserved on skins, skulls, and penises of museum specimens, supplemented with principal component analysis of craniometric data. Together these assessments revealed that this taxon should be recognized not only as a distinct species, and should also be placed within a new genus, described here as Priapomys.","Li, Quan; Cheng, Feng; Jackson, Stephen M; Helgen, Kristofer M; Song, Wen-Yu; Liu, Shao-Ying; Sanamxay, Daosavanh; Li, Song; Li, Fei; Xiong, Yun; Sun, Jun; Wang, Hong-Jiao; Jiang, Xue-Long",Zoological research,https://doi.org/10.24272/j.issn.2095-8137.2021.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047079/,27

These unemployment figures are a feature of the COVID-19 recession that is characterized by sharp gross domestic product (GDP) growth decline. Despite the greatly damaging impact of the opioid crisis over 2015 to 2017 resulting in a decrease in life expectancy over these three years, the long-term increases in average GDP per capita from 1999 to 2018 managed to save lives on average (i.e., age-adjusted mortality rates declined in the United States). For example, during 1999 to 2018, the average GDP per capita annually increased 1.2%, whereas the related age-adjusted mortality rate has shown an annual decrease of approximately 1% on average (0.99%).

Moreover, smoking is associated with a poor tuberculosis treatment outcome. OBJECTIVES In this study, we focus on the effects of cigarette smoke on an infected cell culture treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cytotoxicity on THP-1, J774A.1 and MH-S cell lines and growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposed to a reference or a commercial cigarette was evaluated. THP-1 cell line was exposed to cigarette smoke, infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Apoptosis and death cell were also tested on M. bovis BCG infected cells. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of anti-tuberculosis drugs were analyzed. RESULTS All cells lines showed viability values higher than 80% when exposed to cigarette smoke extract. However, THP-1 cell line infected with M. bovis BCG and exposed to Marlboro cigarette smoke showed up to a 54% reduction of apoptotic cells than cells unexposed to smoke. M. tuberculosis exposed to Marlboro cigarette smoke for 11 days had an optical density 16% lower than unexposed bacteria. When cells were infected with M. tuberculosis, the intracellular recovery of CFUs showed up to a 0.66 log reduction in cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract because of a potential impairment in the phagocytosis. Macrophages treated with drugs showed up to a 2.55 log reduction in the intracellular load burden compared with non-treated ones. Despite poor treatment outcome on TB smoker patients, minimal inhibitory concentration of rifampicin increased only 2-fold in M. tuberculosis exposed to cigarette smoke.

This can lead to timely reoperations and flap salvage. Both arteries and veins are monitored postoperatively with implantable ultrasound Dopplers based on surgeon preference with no consensus as to which method is best. This systematic review and meta-analysis compared arterial to venous implantable Dopplers for postoperative monitoring of microsurgical free flap reconstruction. METHODS Five databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically and independently searched. PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines were strictly followed. Clinical characteristics, donor and recipient sites, specific arterial or venous vessels, diagnostic data, outcomes, and complications were recorded. RESULTS The seven studies included in the meta-analysis were published from 1994 to 2018, with results from 38 of the possible 64 outcomes and complications queried. A total of 763 flaps with implantable Doppler probes on 527 arteries and 388 veins were included in the study. Compared to patients monitored with venous implantable Dopplers, arterial monitoring was associated with a risk of false-positives reduced by 74% (RR:0.26, 95% CI:0.12, 0.55, I2 = 40%, p = .0004) and risk of signal loss reduced by 63% (RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.24, 0.59, I2 = 26%, p < .0001).

The aims of this study were (1) to describe global and segmental myocardial work in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), (2) to assess the correlation between myocardial work and other echocardiographic parameters, and (3) to evaluate the association of myocardial work with adverse outcomes. METHODS One hundred ten patients with nonobstructive HCM (mean age, 55 ± 15 years; 66% men), with different phenotypes (apical, concentric, and septal hypertrophy), and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects were included. The following myocardial work indices were included: myocardial work index, constructive work (CW), wasted work, and cardiac efficiency. The combined end point included all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, heart failure hospitalization, aborted sudden cardiac death, and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy. RESULTS Mean global CW (1,722 ± 602 vs 2,274 ± 574 mm Hg%, P < .001), global cardiac efficiency (93% [89%-95%] vs 96% [96%-97%], P < .001), and global MWI (1,534 ± 551 vs 1,929 ± 473 mm Hg%) were significantly reduced, while global wasted work (104 mm Hg% [66-137 mm Hg%] vs 71 mm Hg% [49-92 mm Hg%], P < .001) was increased in patients with HCM compared with control subjects. Segmental impairment in CW colocalized with maximal wall thickness (HCM phenotype), and global CW correlated with LV wall thickness (r = -0.41, P < .001), diastolic function (r = -0.27, P = .001), and QRS duration (r = -0.28, P = .001).

81333,How Can Reasoned Transparency Enhance Co-Creation in Healthcare and Remedy the Pitfalls of Digitization in Doctor-Patient Relationships?,2021-01-02,"Background: The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced dermatology practices to rapidly adopt or expand teledermatology services. To date, teledermatology clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have not been evaluated for quality. This may hinder the implementation and sustainability of high-quality teledermatology services. The objective of this study is to evaluate teledermatology CPGs by using a comprehensive, validated appraisal tool and provide actionable recommendations for improvement for future guideline developers. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify all CPGs published in teledermatology. Identified guidelines meeting inclusion criteria were scored for guideline quality by three researchers using the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation tool (AGREE II). Results: Three guidelines met inclusion criteria, including guidelines published by the American Telemedicine Association, the British Association of Dermatologists, and the Australian College of Dermatologists and the University of Queensland. Each of these guidelines exhibited unique strengths and areas for improvement. Areas of strength include clear objective statements, stakeholder involvement, and clarity of presentation. Areas for improvement include rigor of guideline development, applicability, and editorial independence. Conclusions: All guidelines were determined to be of sufficient quality for adoption based on AGREE scoring. Adoption of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence appraisal framework would improve the rigor of development of each guideline. Administering and publishing questionnaires to assess financial competing interests and external review processes would shed more light on the presence and/or extent of author bias.

83322,Lifestyle Changes Among Medical Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicenter Study Across Nine Countries.,2021-05-28,"This research communication describes (1) the comparison of acute-phase protein (APP) concentrations in transition dairy cows on different farms using both pooled and individual blood samples, and (2) the association among different APP and clinical health parameters. The first hypothesis was that early postpartum dairy cows from different farms differ in the level of inflammation, which might be determined using APP assays in both pooled and individual blood samples. The second hypothesis was that the APP haptoglobin (Hp) might be the most sensitive parameter to detect cows at risk of excessive postpartum inflammation concomitant with systemic disease. Serum concentrations of Hp, serum amyloid-A (SAA), total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), coeruloplasmin (Cp) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 100 fresh lactating cows (within 0-8 d postpartum) from 10 farms were compared and associated to clinical health parameters (rectal body temperature, vaginal discharge (Metricheck™ score), rumen fill, vulvovaginal laceration) using both pooled and individual blood samples. Mean serum concentrations of Hp, SAA and TP revealed significant differences among farms. Pooled serum samples of farms showed high correlations with the mean of individual samples. Only Hp was significantly positively correlated to both body temperature and Metricheck™ score. In conclusion, Hp differentiates dairy farms regarding the inflammatory state of transition cows using individual and pooled serum samples within the first week postpartum. It also mirrors the individual degree of inflammation, thus proving to be a diagnostic parameter of high interest during the periparturient period.","Schmitt, Ruth; Pieper, Laura; Gonzalez-Grajales, L Antonio; Swinkels, Jantijn; Gelfert, Carl-Christian; Staufenbiel, Rudolf",The Journal of dairy research,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022029921000078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594968/,27
83635,Protecting healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: respirator shortages and health policy responses in South America.,2020,"BACKGROUND In the midst of the SARS-CoV 2 pandemic basic healthcare challenges arise as lockdowns and social isolation are implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. In order to overcome these challenges, the Polish the National Health Fund has facilitated telemedical consultations. AIMS The aim of this study was to compare teleconsultations to regular ambulatory clinic of implantable devices (ACIM) visits and to assess whether teleconsultations would be an adequate replacement during a time when face-to-face contact should be limited. METHODS Teleconsultations in the ACIM were introduced for patients without the possibility of remote control cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED). Prior to planned visits physicians made phone calls and interviewed the patient about their health. Further treatment decisions were made based on the interview and available documentation. RESULTS Teleconsultations were performed during a 3.5-week period (13.03.2020 to 01.04.2020). Of the 400 patients planned for visits in the ACIM, 349 were consulted by phone. 299 patients confirmed stable health. 14/349 patients reported some symptoms and 4/349 patients were hospitalized; 2/349 patients changed their primary ACIM and were no longer under our care, 1/349 patient was undergoing quarantine, 15/349 patients required additional intervention and 15 patients had died prior to contact. In general patients gave positive feedback on their teleconsultations. CONCLUSIONS Teleconsultations are a much-needed solution during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are an effective way to decrease interpersonal contact and to overcome sudden changes to the visitation scheme which may otherwise have put an overwhelming burden on the ACIM.","Paskudzka, Diana; Kołodzińska, Agnieszka; Cacko, Andrzej; Stolarz, Przemysław; Łyżwiński, Łukasz; Opolski, Grzegorz; Grabowski, Marcin",Kardiologia polska,https://doi.org/10.33963/kp.15392; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32469189/,27
83816,Introducing 'One Health' as an overlooked concept in Iran.,2014,"OBJECTIVES Vasectomy is a popular and effective male surgical contraceptive method. Different techniques have been proposed to reduce failure rates and complications. In this study, we sought to compare vas deferens occlusion rates using both standard occlusion techniques and LigaSure (LSVS) for vasectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of nine patients underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy at our institution. During the procedure, a total of 125 fresh vas deferens samples were obtained and divided into four groups as follows: Group 1: ligation (n = 22), Group 2; ligation and electrocauterization (n = 18), Group 3; 5 mm LSVS (n = 44), Group 4; 10 mm LSVS (n = 41). All specimens were harvested during surgery and subsequent histopathological assessments were performed to assess the luminal status of the vas deferens. RESULTS Histopathological evaluation revealed that the majority of vas lumens with LSVS (79.5% of Group 3 and 89.4% of Group 4) were totally occluded. With standard techniques, however, the majority of vas lumens (86.4 and 77.8% of Groups 1 and 2, respectively) maintained a tiny patency. CONCLUSIONS On histopathological review, the application of LSVS resulted in better occlusion rates, compared to standard ligation methods. These findings suggest a higher occlusive role for LSVS for vasectomy. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of this technique.","Guzelburc, Vahit; Baran, Caner; Yafi, Faysal A; Cakir, Asli; Kiremit, Murat Can; Boz, Mustafa Yucel; Horuz, Rahim; Guven, Selcuk; Hellstrom, Wayne J G; Albayrak, Selami",International journal of impotence research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41443-018-0066-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30154455/,27

Primary cardiac (dysrhythmic) and asphyxial causes together are responsible for most cases of cardiac arrest at all age groups. The purpose of this article is to review the pathophysiologic differences between dysrhythmic and asphyxial cardiac arrest in the prearrest period, during the no-flow state, and after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS The electronic databases of PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane were searched for relevant literature and studies. RESULTS/DISCUSSION Significant differences exist between dysrhythmic and asphyxial cardiac arrest regarding their pathophysiologic pathways and affect consequently the postresuscitation period. Laboratory data indicate that asphyxial cardiac arrest leads to more widespread postresuscitation brain damage compared with dysrhythmic cardiac arrest. Regarding postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction, few studies have addressed a comparison of the 2 conditions with controversial results. CONCLUSIONS Asphyxial cardiac arrest differs significantly from dysrhythmic cardiac arrest with regard to pathophysiologic mechanisms, neuropathologic damage, postresuscitation organ dysfunction, and response to therapy. Both conditions should be considered and treated in a different manner.","Varvarousis, Dimitrios; Varvarousi, Giolanda; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; D'Aloja, Ernesto; Gulati, Anil; Xanthos, Theodoros",The American journal of emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2015.06.066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26233618/,27

Whether aducanumab succeeds, other disease-modifying therapies for AD will follow, and the health-care system is unprepared for the reimbursement and access challenges. Novel AD therapies are much needed, but we cannot assume substantial cost offsets. With forethought and preparation, however, the health-care system can accommodate new AD drugs. First, we urge the use of cost-effectiveness of new Alzheimer's treatments as a starting point for setting value-based prices. Second, payments for new AD therapies should ideally incorporate a performance warranty, which helps apportion risk associated with initial therapy value estimates between drug manufacturers and payers.

However, this cohort was excluded from vaccine-trials and yet shares the same vaccination scheme with the general population. Here, we explore trends of immune response-proportions among end-stage renal disease patients on renal replacement therapy for up to four weeks post-vaccination completion with Pfizer/Moderna vaccines. From inception to 10th-July-2021, we searched six online-databases for articles reporting humoral and cellular immune response proportions for up to four weeks post booster-vaccination. We pooled the responders' proportions by meta-analysis and conducted a meta-regression stratifying outcomes by significant confounders. Twenty-seven eligible studies reported 2789 end-stage renal disease patients. 1337, 1452, and 477 were on haemodialysis, received kidney transplantation, and healthy controls, respectively. Haemodialysis patients' proportions of humoral and cellular immune responses varied from 87.29%[80.77-93.81]-88.78%[86.76-90.80] and 62.86%[56.56, 69.17]-85.78%[78.99, 92.57], respectively, between first- and fourth-weeks. Kidney transplant patients' proportions of humoral and cellular immune responses ranged from 2.6%[0.06-13.48]-29.87%[27.68,32.07] and 5.13%[0.63-17.3]-59.84%[54.57-65.10], respectively, between first- and fourth-weeks. All healthy controls maintained ≥93% proportions of both responses throughout the follow-up. Study design and country of study influenced the pooled response proportions. Conclusively, haemodialysis and kidney transplant patients have lower proportions of humoral and cellular immune responses than healthy controls. However, haemodialysis patients' response proportions improve, reaching near healthy-control levels by the fourth week. Kidney transplant patients' lower responses' proportions also improve but remain significantly lower than healthy controls throughout four-weeks.

Polycaprolactone (PCL) and hydrogel were used with nasal epithelial and auricular cartilage cells in the printing process. An artificial trachea was transplanted into 15 rabbits and a PCL scaffold without the addition of cells was transplanted into 6 rabbits (controls). All animals were followed up with radiography, CT, and endoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months. In the control group, 3 out of 6 rabbits died from respiratory symptoms. Surviving rabbits in control group had narrowed tracheas due to the formation of granulation tissue and absence of epithelium regeneration. In the experimental group, 13 of 15 animals survived, and the histologic examination confirmed the regeneration of epithelial cells. Neonatal cartilage was also confirmed at 6 and 12 months. Our artificial trachea was effective in the regeneration of respiratory epithelium, but not in cartilage regeneration.

The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on job organization, exploring the effects of lockdown measures on the psychological distress and perceived well-being of workers experiencing telework. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A web-based cross-sectional survey has been used to collect data. The participants answered the questionnaire from April 1 to April 30, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, which investigated: 1) demographic and occupational variables, 2) lifestyle and habits variables, 3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been used to evaluate psychological distress and the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to explore subjective well-being. RESULTS Psychological distress was associated with educational level, with habits, and with reporting poor well-being. Poor well-being was associated with a higher job demand during pandemic, lifestyle and habits variables, and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first studies exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the perceived well-being and psychological distress of workers experiencing telework.

After confirming the first case the Ethiopian government has been working a lot to prevent transmission. Most of the reported cases were identified from traveling abroad. Effective prevention and control practices depend on awareness and compliance among the population at all levels. The main objective of this study is to determine the knowledge level and its association with sources of information towards COVID-19 and its prevention techniques in the Gedeo Zone of Southern Ethiopia.Methods: There are 10 knowledge questions regarding COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. The maximum knowledge score for each question was 1 and the minimum 0, where 0 was scored for incorrect and 1 for correct answers. The overall knowledge score ranges from 0 to 10, where a score of 0-5 as poor knowledge and a score from 6-10 as good knowledge. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine the association between dependent and independent variables. The adjusted odds ratio with their 95% CI was used to show the strength of association. P-value <0.05 was used to declare a statistically significant association.Results: Among 1170 study participants, 58.1% of the study participants were male. Protestant constitutes 50.6% of the study participants in religion. Regarding knowledge level, 60.5% have good knowledge about COVID-19 and its prevention techniques. Concerning sources of information about COVID-19 and its prevention; internet, family/peer, religious and health workers contributes less <20% whereas telecommunication and television/Radio contributes the largest 56.1% and 85.8% as a source of information respectively.

91336,"Artists on the Research Team: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Team Science, Research Rigor, and Creative Dialogue.",2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND The MERS-CoV is a novel human coronavirus causing respiratory syndrome since April 2012. The replication of MERS-CoV is mediated by ORF 1ab and viral gene activity can be modulated by RNAi approach. The inhibition of virus replication has been documented in cell culture against multiple viruses by RNAi approach. Currently, very few siRNA against MERS-CoV have been computationally designed and published. METHODS In this review, we have discussed the computational designing and delivery of potential siRNAs. Potential siRNA can be designed to silence a desired gene by considering many factors like target site, specificity, length and nucleotide content of siRNA, removal of potential off-target sites, toxicity and immunogenic responses. The efficient delivery of siRNAs into targeted cells faces many challenges like enzymatic degradation and quick clearance through renal system. The siRNA can be delivered using transfection, electroporation and viral gene transfer. Currently, siRNAs delivery has been improved by using advanced nanotechnology like lipid nanoparticles, inorganic nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. CONCLUSION The efficacy of siRNA-based therapeutics has been used not only against many viral diseases but also against non-viral diseases, cancer, dominant genetic disorders, and autoimmune disease. This innovative technology has attracted researchers, academia and pharmaceuticals industries towards designing and development of highly effective and targeted disease therapy. By using this technology, effective and potential siRNAs can be designed, delivered and their efficacy with toxic effects and immunogenic responses can be tested against MERS-CoV.","Sohrab, Sayed Sartaj; El-Kafrawy, Sherif Aly; Mirza, Zeenat; Kamal, Mohammad Amjad; Azhar, Esam Ibraheem",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612823666171109112307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29119921/,27

However, available data on the therapeutic window of tocotrienols remains controversial. It is important to understand the absorption and bioavailability mechanisms before conducting in-depth investigations into the therapeutic efficacy of tocotrienols in humans. In this review, we updated current evidence on the bioavailability of tocotrienols from human studies. Available data from five studies suggested that tocotrienols may reach its target destination through an alternative pathway despite its low affinity for α-tocopherol transfer protein. This was evident when studies reported considerable amount of tocotrienols detected in HDL particles and adipose tissues after oral consumption. Besides, plasma concentrations of tocotrienols were shown to be higher when administered with food while self-emulsifying preparation of tocotrienols was shown to enhance the absorption of tocotrienols. Nevertheless, mixed results were observed based on the outcome from 24 clinical studies, focusing on the dosages, study populations and formulations used. This may be due to the variation of compositions and dosages of tocotrienols used, suggesting a need to understand the formulation of tocotrienols in the study design. Essentially, implementation of a control diet such as AHA Step 1 diet may influence the study outcomes, especially in hypercholesterolemic subjects when lipid profile might be modified due to synergistic interaction between tocotrienols and control diet. We also found that the bioavailability of tocotrienols were inconsistent in different target populations, from healthy subjects to smokers and diseased patients. In this review, the effect of dosage, composition and formulation of tocotrienols as well as study populations on the bioavailability of tocotrienols will be discussed.","Fu, Ju-Yen; Che, Hui-Ling; Tan, Doryn Meam-Yee; Teng, Kim-Tiu",Nutrition & metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-7075-11-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24410975/,27

Hemiarthroplasty was safely performed after disease activity was reduced with systemic corticosteroids. Tissue-protective wound closure was used together with perioperative corticosteroids and antibiotics. No signs of pyoderma gangrenosum developed at the surgical wound site, and the axillary lesions showed constant improvement until healing with scar tissue. CONCLUSIONS In our patient, the preoperative steroid treatment, perioperative antibiotics, and soft tissue protective surgical technique led to successful management of this rare coincidence.","Antoni, Anna; Trautinger, Franz; Heinz, Thomas; Hajdu, Stefan",Journal of medical case reports,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13256-019-2329-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31931877/,27
94493,Dying in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: Contextual considerations and clinical recommendations.,2020-06-11,"COVID-19 has resulted in broad impacts on the economy and aspects of daily life including our collective mental health and well-being. The Australian health care system already faces limitations in its ability to treat people with mental health diagnoses. Australia has responded to the COVID-19 outbreak by, among other initiatives, providing reimbursement for telehealth services. However, it is unclear if these measures will be enough to manage the psychological distress, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic distress shown to accompany infectious disease outbreaks and economic shocks. Decision making has focused on the physical health ramifications of COVID-19, the avoidance of over-burdening the health care system and saving lives. We propose an alternative framework for decision making that combines life years saved with impacts on quality of life. A framework that simultaneously includes mental health and broader economic impacts into a single decision-making process would facilitate transparent and accountable decision making that can improve the overall welfare of Australian society as we continue to address the considerable challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic is creating.","Mihalopoulos, Cathrine; Chatterton, Mary Lou; Engel, Lidia; Le, Long Khanh-Dao; Lee, Yong Yi",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420963724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008268/,27

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS SoliMix, a 26-week, open-label, multicenter study, randomized adults with suboptimally controlled basal insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (HbA1c ≥7.5 % and ≤10 %) to once-daily iGlarLixi or twice-daily BIAsp 30. Primary efficacy endpoints were non-inferiority in HbA1c reduction (margin 0.3 %) or superiority in bodyweight change for iGlarLixi versus BIAsp 30 RESULTS: Both primary efficacy endpoints were met: after 26 weeks, baseline HbA1c (8.6 %) was reduced by 1.3 % with iGlarLixi and 1.1 % with BIAsp 30, meeting non-inferiority (least squares [LS] mean difference [97.5% CI]: -0.2 [-0.4, -0.1] %; p<0.001). iGlarLixi was also superior to BIAsp 30 for bodyweight change (LS mean difference [95% CI] -1.9 [-2.3, -1.4] kg) and percentage of participants achieving HbA1c <7 % without weight gain and HbA1c <7 % without weight gain and without hypoglycemia (all p<0.001). iGlarLixi was also superior versus BIAsp 30 for HbA1c reduction (p<0.001). Incidence and rates of ADA Level 1 and 2 hypoglycemia were lower with iGlarLixi versus BIAsp 30. CONCLUSIONS Once-daily iGlarLixi provided better glycemic control with weight benefit and less hypoglycemia than twice-daily premix BIAsp 30. iGlarLixi is a more efficacious, simpler, and well-tolerated alternative to premix BIAsp 30 in suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes requiring treatment beyond basal insulin plus OAD therapy.","Rosenstock, Julio; Emral, Rifat; Sauque-Reyna, Leobardo; Mohan, Viswanathan; Trescolí, Carlos; Sifri, Saud Al; Lalic, Nebojsa; Alvarez, Agustina; Picard, Pascaline; Bonnemaire, Mireille; Demil, Nacima; McCrimmon, Rory J",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc21-0393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183429/,27

This pilot study aims to teach the ultrasound-guided SAPB to emergency medicine (EM) residents using a mastery learning approach. Methods A 19-item checklist was created and mastery was determined to be 17 of 19 items correct. This pass score was established using a Mastery Angoff standard-setting exercise with a group of EM experts. Learners participated in baseline testing on a simulated model and performance was assessed by two raters. Learners then watched an instructional video and participated in an individualized teaching session. Learners underwent deliberate practice followed by posttesting until mastery was achieved. Score differences in baseline testing and posttesting were analyzed using a paired t-test. Pre- and posttesting surveys were also completed by participants. Results Twenty-eight PGY-1 to -4 residents volunteered to participate in the study. The range of reported SAPBs seen previously was 0 to 5. The mean (±SD) number of items correct on the checklist for initial testing was 8.5 of 19 (±2.7), while the mean (±SD) final score was 18 of 19 (±0.6; p < 0.001). All participants met mastery standards after the curriculum intervention. Median self-reported procedural confidence was 2 out of 5 on a 5-point Likert scale before the session and 5 out of 5 after the session (Z = -4.681, p < 0.001). Conclusions Using a mastery learning approach and simulated model, we were able to successfully train EM residents to perform the SAPB at a level of mastery and increase their overall confidence in executing this procedure.","Rider, Ashley C; Miller, Danielle T; Ashenburg, Nicholas; Duanmu, Youyou; Lobo, Viveta; Schertzer, Kimberly; Sebok-Syer, Stefanie S",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041432/,27
97682,Factors affecting the adoption of telemedicine during COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"To penetrate host cells through their membranes, pathogens use a variety of molecular components in which the presence of heptad repeat motifs seems to be a prevailing element. Heptad repeats are characterized by a pattern of seven, generally hydrophobic, residues. In order to initiate membrane fusion, viruses use glycoproteins-containing heptad repeats. These proteins are structurally and functionally similar to the SNARE proteins known to be involved in eukaryotic membrane fusion. SNAREs also display a heptad repeat motif called the ""SNARE motif"". As bacterial genomes are being sequenced, microorganisms also appear to be carrying membrane proteins resembling eukaryotic SNAREs. This category of SNARE-like proteins might share similar functions and could be used by microorganisms to either promote or block membrane fusion. Such a recurrence across pathogenic organisms suggests that this architectural motif was evolutionarily selected because it most effectively ensures the survival of pathogens within the eukaryotic environment.","Wesolowski, Jordan; Paumet, Fabienne",Virulence,https://doi.org/10.4161/viru.1.4.12195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21178463/,27

DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search of PUBMED, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases was performed. REVIEW METHODS Relevant articles were independently assessed by 2 reviewers according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS Thirty-five articles assessing CF (27 articles), LF (4 articles), ZF (3 articles), and/or rhomboid plasty frenotomy (1 article) were included. A high level of outcome heterogeneity prevented pooling of data. All 7 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were of low quality. Both CF (5 articles with 589 patients) and LF (2 articles with 78 patients) were independently shown to reduce maternal nipple pain on a visual analog or numeric rating scale. There were reports of improvement with breastfeeding outcomes as assessed on validated assessment tools for 88% (7/8) of CF articles (588 patients) and 2 LF articles (78 patients). ZF improved breastfeeding outcomes on subjective maternal reports (1 article with 18 infants) only. One RCT with a high risk of bias concluded greater speech articulation improvements with ZF compared to CF. Only minor adverse events were reported for all frenotomy techniques. CONCLUSIONS Current literature does not demonstrate a clear advantage for one frenotomy technique when managing children with ankyloglossia. Recommendations for future research are provided to overcome the methodological shortcomings in the literature. We conclude that all frenotomy techniques are safe and effective for treating symptomatic ankyloglossia.","Khan, Usman; MacPherson, Jake; Bezuhly, Michael; Hong, Paul",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820917619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482127/,27

The risk for severe RSV infection is highest in infants and older adults. A safe and effective RSV vaccine for older adults represents a serious unmet medical need due to higher morbidity and mortality in this age group. In this randomized, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of an investigational messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine encoding the RSV fusion protein (F) stabilized in the prefusion conformation. The study was conducted in healthy younger adults (ages ≥18 and ≤49 years) and healthy older adults (ages ≥60 and ≤79 years). Participants received mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo as a single intramuscular dose. For each dose level, three sentinel participants were administered open-label mRNA-1777 (V171). Seventy-two younger adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, or 200 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo, and 107 older adults were randomized and administered 25, 100, 200 or 300 µg mRNA-1777 (V171) or placebo. Primary objectives were safety and tolerability and secondary objectives included humoral and cell-mediated immunogenicity. All dose levels of mRNA-1777 (V171) were generally well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to the vaccine were reported. Immunization with mRNA-1777 (V171) elicited a humoral immune response as measured by increases in RSV neutralizing antibody titers, serum antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, D25 competing antibody titers to RSV prefusion F protein, and cell-mediated immune responses to RSV-F peptides.","Aliprantis, Antonios O; Shaw, Christine A; Griffin, Paul; Farinola, Nicholas; Railkar, Radha A; Cao, Xin; Liu, Wen; Sachs, Jeffrey R; Swenson, Christine J; Lee, Heather; Cox, Kara S; Spellman, Daniel S; Winstead, Colleen J; Smolenov, Igor; Lai, Eseng; Zaks, Tal; Espeseth, Amy S; Panther, Lori",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2020.1829899; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33121346/,27

Our aim was to investigate the yield of neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 undergoing CT or MR imaging of the brain and to describe associated imaging findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 2054 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 presenting to 2 hospitals in New York City between March 4 and May 9, 2020, of whom 278 (14%) underwent either CT or MR imaging of the brain. All images initially received a formal interpretation from a neuroradiologist within the institution and were subsequently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists in consensus, with disputes resolved by a third neuroradiologist. RESULTS The median age of these patients was 64 years (interquartile range, 50-75 years), and 43% were women. Among imaged patients, 58 (21%) demonstrated acute or subacute neuroimaging findings, the most common including cerebral infarctions (11%), parenchymal hematomas (3.6%), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (1.1%). Among the 51 patients with MR imaging examinations, 26 (51%) demonstrated acute or subacute findings; notable findings included 6 cases of cranial nerve abnormalities (including 4 patients with olfactory bulb abnormalities) and 3 patients with a microhemorrhage pattern compatible with critical illness-associated microbleeds.

Mothers with infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) face additional risk for PPD, coupled with risk factors extending beyond a NICU admision a NICU admission. The novelty of this review is the focus on maternal PPD for mothers with infants admitted to the NICU. Interventions aimed at limiting and preventing PPD in this population include: prenatal and postpartum PPD screening, PPD symptom awareness and monitoring, and trauma-informed care. RECENT FINDINGS PPD, the most frequent complication of childbirth, affects approximately 10-15% of mothers worldwide. Prevalence rates increase to 40% for mothers whose infant is admitted to the NICU. PPD can affect maternal and child health across the life course and predispose future generations. Prevalence rates are higher for racial and ethnic minorities, immigrant and refugee populations, and mothers in rural locations. Trauma-informed care is suggested at individual and organizational levels, leading to better care for those with and without a trauma history. SUMMARY Increasing PPD symptom awareness, screening for PPD, and connections with resources should begin during prenatal visits.

While scientist are working to find a vaccine, current epidemiological data shows that the most common comorbidities for patients with the worst prognosis, hypertension and diabetes, are often treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Body Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs induce overexpression of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which has been identified as the main receptor used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to enter into the alveolar cells of the lungs. While cannabinoids are known to reduce hypertension, the studies testing the hypotensive effects of cannabinoids never addressed their effects on ACE-2 receptors. However, some studies have linked the endocannabinoid system (ECS) with the renin angiotensin system (RAS), including a cross-modulation between the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) and angiotensin II levels. Conclusion Since there are around 192 million people using cannabis worldwide, we believe that the mechanism underlying the hypotensive properties of cannabinoids should be urgently studied to understand if they can also lead to ACE-2 overexpression as other antihypertensive drugs do.","Sainz-Cort, Alberto; Heeroma, Joost H",Journal of cannabis research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s42238-020-00030-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835160/,27

Furthermore, the predictive and prognostic utility of resistin-like molecule beta (RELM-β) in patients with CAP is uncertain. This study investigated the role of RELM-β in patients with CAP and evaluated its correlation with disease severity and the risk of death. A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 2017, and admission serum levels of RELM-β were detected using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A total of 114 and 112 patients with severe CAP (SCAP) and non-severe CAP (NSCAP) were enrolled, respectively, with 15 healthy controls. Patients with SCAP, especially non-survivors, had significantly higher levels of serum RELM-β than patients with NSCAP. RELM-β levels positively correlated with severity scores and consistently predicted SCAP in patients with CAP (area under the curve = 0.794). Increased levels of RELM-β were closely related to the severity and prognosis of patients with CAP. The accuracy of 30-day mortality predictions of CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age ≥ 65 years) can be significantly improved when combined with RELM-β levels. The level of RELM-β can assist clinicians in risk stratification of patients with CAP in early stages.","Chen, Li; Luo, Qiongzhen; Shang, Ying; He, Xinwei; Xu, Yu; Gao, Zhancheng",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33503890/,27

METHODS Between March 2014 and December 2016, laparoscopic urachal resection was carried out on 45 patients with complaints of urachal remnants. After extraction of the specimen and closure of the fascia at the umbilical site, a 1-cm square section of dermal regeneration sheet (TERUDERMIS®, Olympus) was suture retained between the fascia and the skin. Patient satisfaction with cosmesis was scored prospectively using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Perioperative records were reviewed to assess surgical outcomes. RESULTS Laparoscopic urachal resection was successfully conducted via the transperitoneal approach. Postoperative bleeding was experienced in one patient (2.2%), which was subsequently controlled laparoscopically. Infection subsided with symptomatic relief in all patients. No symptomatic recurrences were encountered. Over 80% of patients (37/45) rated the cosmetic outcome of the plasty as good to excellent, with the median scores of 8 (range 5-10). CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic urachal resection is safe and curative with reasonable risk of complications. Novel umbilicoplasty using dermal regenerative graft is very simple technique and offers satisfactory cosmetic outcomes.

106694,Obligations of Australian health services as employers during COVID-19.,2021-05-03,"Abnormal environmental conditions induce polyploidization and exacerbate vulnerability to agricultural production. Polyploidization is a pivotal event for plant adaption to stress and the expansion of transcription factors. NACs play key roles in plant stress resistance and growth and development, but the adaptive mechanism of NACs during plant polyploidization remain to be explored. Here, we identified and analyzed NACs from 15 species and found that the expansion of NACs was contributed by polyploidization. The regulatory networks were systematically analyzed based on polyomics. NACs might influence plant phenotypes and were correlated with amino acids acting as nitrogen source, indicating that NACs play a vital role in plant development. More importantly, in quinoa and Arabidopsis thaliana, NACs enabled plants to resist stress by regulating flavonoid pathways, and the universality was further confirmed by the Arabidopsis population. Our study provides a cornerstone for future research into improvement of important agronomic traits by transcription factors in a changing global environment.","Liu, Moyang; Sun, Wenjun; Ma, Zhaotang; Yu, Guolong; Li, Jiahao; Wang, Yudong; Wang, Xu",Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916257/,27

STUDY DESIGN We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 100 consecutive women who underwent SPLM without any combined surgery between January 2010 and July 2011. The medical records were reviewed and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. Single port entry was established using a wound retractor and a surgical glove. After myoma was enucleated from myometrium, intracorporeal suturing and knot tying was done for myometrium repair. Enucleated myoma was extracted through umbilicus using tissue morcellator. Factors investigated included operation time, blood loss, postoperative hospital stay and complications. RESULTS Mean patient age and BMI were 40.4±7.1 years and 23.1±3.5kg/m(2). Mean diameter of largest myoma and number of myomas were 6.6±2.2 (range 2-12) cm and 1.6±1.2 (range 1-7), respectively. Mean weight of myoma was 136.9±118.4 (range 4-684)g. Type of the main myomas were intramural (80/100), submucosal (5/100), subserosal (12/100), and intraligamentary (3/100). Location of the main myomas were anterior (36/100), posterior (24/100), fundal (30/100), and lateral (10/100). Mean operation time and estimated blood loss were 116.3±36.8min and 94.6±74.5mL. Mean hospital stay after the operation was 2±0.4 days. Conversion to double port surgery (one more trocar inserted on suprapubic site) was occurred in 1 patient due to severe pelvic adhesion. No patient experienced major complications, including bowel, ureter, or bladder injuries, or incisional hernia. CONCLUSION SPLM is safe and acceptable for various myoma sites and sizes up to 12cm. Intracorporeal suture-tying and transumbilical morcellation are key technical points of SPLM.","Lee, Jung Ryeol; Lee, Ji Hyun; Kim, Ju Yeong; Chang, Hye Jin; Suh, Chang Suk; Kim, Seok Hyun","European journal of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2014.07.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150961/,27
107234,The necessity of diplomacy in brain health.,2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE Better prediction of tissue prognosis in acute stroke might improve treatment decisions. We hypothesized that there are metabolic ischemic disturbances measurable noninvasively by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) that occur earlier than any structural changes visible on diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), which may therefore serve for territorial identification of tissue at risk. METHODS We performed multivoxel (1)H MRS plus DTI within a maximum of 26 hours, and DTI at 3-7 days, after ischemic stroke. We compared choline, lactate, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine concentrations in normal-appearing voxels that became infarcted (infarct expansion) with normal-appearing voxels around the infarct that remained ""healthy"" (nonexpansion) on follow-up DTI. Each infarct expansion voxel was additionally classified as either complete infarct expansion (infarcted tissue on follow-up DTI covered > or =50% of the voxel) or partial infarct expansion (<50% of voxel). RESULTS In 31 patients (NIH Stroke Scale score 0-28), there were 108 infarct nonexpansion voxels and 113 infarct expansion voxels (of which 80 were complete expansion and 33 partial expansion voxels). Brain choline concentration increased for each change in expansion category from nonexpansion, via partial expansion to complete expansion (2,423, 3,843, 4,158 IU; p < 0.05). Changes in lactate, N-acetylaspartate, and creatine concentrations in expansion category were insignificant although for lactate there was a tendency to such association. CONCLUSIONS Choline concentration measurable with (1)H MRS was elevated in peri-ischemic normal-appearing brain that became infarcted by 3-7 days. The degree of elevation was associated with the amount of infarct expansion. (1)H MRS might identify DTI-normal-appearing tissue at risk of conversion to infarction in early stroke.","Karaszewski, B; Thomas, R G R; Chappell, F M; Armitage, P A; Carpenter, T K; Lymer, G K S; Dennis, M S; Marshall, I; Wardlaw, J M",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0b013e3181f11bf1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20819997/,27

This study aimed to investigate the assumption that patients with urgent problems currently avoid the ER. METHODS Electronic health records from the ER of a large Swiss university hospital were extracted for three periods: first, the awareness phase (ap) from the publication of the national government’s initiative “How to protect ourselves” on 1 March 2020 to the lockdown of the country on 16 March; second, the mitigation phase (mp) from 16–30 March; finally, patients presenting in March 2019 were used as a control group. We compared parameters including a critical illness as the discharge diagnosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, sepsis and ER death) using logistic and linear regression, as well as 15-day bootstrapped means and 95% confidence intervals for the control group. RESULTS In the three periods, a total of 7143 patients were treated. We found a 24.9% (42.5%) significant decline in the number of patients presenting during the ap (mp). Patients presenting during the mp were more likely to be critically ill. There was an increase of 233% and 367% (ap and mp, respectively) of ER deaths (none related to COVID-19) compared with the control period. Apart from polytrauma (increase of 5% in the mp), all other critical illnesses as discharge diagnosis showed a lower incidence in descriptive analysis. Significantly more patients died in the ER in both the ap and mp. CONCLUSIONS Barriers to seeking emergency care during COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Healthcare authorities and hospitals must ensure low barriers to treatment and business as usual for all patients.","Hautz, Wolf E; Sauter, Thomas C; Exadakytlos, Aristomenis K; Krummrey, Gert; Schauber, Stefan; Müller, Martin",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799308/,27

This article describes the different approaches taken towards optimal fallow periods in Canadian jurisdictions. METHODS We searched publicly available information from dentist and dental hygiene regulator websites across the 10 provinces and 3 territories in Canada. We also searched for guidance documents on dental associations' websites or through personal communication with government officials. We extracted and tabulated information on fallow period recommendations or guidance, when available. RESULTS Nine jurisdictions (6 provinces and all 3 territories) acknowledge or provide guidance on fallow periods following aerosol-generating procedures. Among those who have provided guidance regarding a fallow period, recommendations follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance if the air changes per hour (ACH) in the dental operatory is known. CONCLUSION The evidence for deciding on optimal fallow period is limited and still being explored, resulting in substantial variation across Canadian jurisdictions.

To prepare for the approaching diverse environments, educational institutions must create programs that allow underrepresented groups thrive in higher education; and logistically to be sustaining, the recruitment programs must begin at the student level. One approach is the integration of the history (the linking of past-heroes with present-heroes) of science; which is an interesting and important paradigm that can be implemented.

Its antiviral properties have been studied for years; regarding the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), it has been shown that HCQ may act at multiple levels. These extend from the initial attachment of the virus to the respiratory epithelium to the inhibition of its replication by the alkalinisation of the phagolysosome's microenvironment and the post-translational modification of certain viral proteins. Preliminary clinical evidence from China and France showed significant virological and clinical benefit in HCQ-treated patients, while other studies, mostly including critically ill patients, did not show favorable results. In this review, we critically appraise the existing evidence on HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with particular emphasis on its protective and therapeutic role. Safety concerns that are relevant to the short-term HCQ use are also discussed. In the context of the rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic that strains the health care systems worldwide and considering limited population-wide testing rates in most of the vulnerable countries, early empiric short-term administration of HCQ in symptomatic individuals, may be a promising, safe and low-cost strategy.","Tselios, Konstantinos; Skendros, Panagiotis",European journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.5152/eurjrheum.2020.2064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32432527/,27

We analysed time to ileostomy closure across the UK and investigated factors delaying closure. METHODS Retrospective cohort: We assessed time to closure and incidence of non-closure for patients who underwent anterior resection with defunctioning ileostomy during 2015. Multivariate linear/ cox-regression analyses were performed. Prospective cohort: We captured patients undergoing ileostomy closure during a 3-month period to validate retrospective findings. RESULTS Retrospective cohort: Of 788 patients, 669 (84.9%) had bowel continuity restored, median time to closure 259 days. Recognised factors associated with delay and risk of non-closure, included anastomotic leak (HR 3.65, 2.61-5.08), chemotherapy (HR 2.62, 2.17-3.15) and cancer progression (HR 2.05, 1.62-2.58). Crucially, specific aspects of the surgical pathway were associated with time to closure, e.g. waiting list entry prior to outpatient clinic review/imaging was associated with an estimated 133-day shorter interval to closure (P < 0.001). Prospective cohort: 288 patients underwent closure, at median 271 days. Chemotherapy use and cancer progression were associated with delay to closure while listing for surgery prior to clinic and imaging was associated with estimated shorter interval to closure of 168 days (P=0.008). CONCLUSIONS Delays to closure of ileostomy are common in the UK. Listing patients for surgery only after follow-up outpatient appointment, imaging or chemotherapy, delays closure. Findings will inform consensus guidelines towards an optimum treatment pathway to reduce delay and improve post-closure QOL.","Vaughan-Shaw, Peter",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15531; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33452859/,27

Unfortunately, the blockades have entailed hefty socioeconomic costs. In order to contrast the spread of the virus, states have used contact tracing technology, in the form of mobile phone applications designed to track close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has shown the effectiveness of this solution, particularly when used in conjunction with manual tracking. Nonetheless, the contact tracing app raises concerns due to the potential privacy implications.

119030,Staffing policy in aged care must look beyond the numbers.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Indonesia is a tropical country, warm and humid, with numerous environmental fungi. Data on fungal disease burden helps policy makers and clinicians. OBJECTIVES We have estimated the incidence and prevalence of serious fungal diseases. METHODS We found all published and unpublished data and estimated the incidence and prevalence of fungal diseases based on populations at risk. HIV data were derived from UNAIDS (2017), pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) data from 2013-2019, data on chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) was used to estimate CPA prevalence and likely deaths, COPD data from Hammond (2020), lung cancer incidence was from Globocan 2018, and fungal rhinosinusitis was estimated using community data from India. RESULTS Overall ~7.7 million Indonesians (2.89%) have a serious fungal infection each year. The annual incidence of cryptococcosis in AIDS was 7,540. Pneumocystis pneumonia incidence was estimated at 15,400 in HIV and an equal number in non-HIV patients. An estimated 1% and 0.2% of new AIDS patients have disseminated histoplasmosis or Talaromyces marneffei infection. The incidence of candidemia is 26,710. The annual incidence of invasive aspergillosis was estimated at 49,500 and the prevalence of CPA is at 378,700 cases. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis prevalence in adults is estimated at 336,200, severe asthma with fungal sensitization at 443,800, and fungal rhino sinusitis at 294,000. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated at 5 million/ year (15 - 50 years old). The incidence of fungal keratitis around 40,050. Tinea capitis prevalence in schoolchildren about 729,000.

We conducted a pilot study for evaluating the efficacy and safety of abatacept, a cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA4), for acute hepatitis B. Five patients with severe acute hepatitis B (prothrombin activity ≤60%) were treated for immunosuppression by abatacept. Four patients received abatacept concurrently with methylprednisolone, and another patient was treated with abatacept alone. Rapid decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, increase in prothrombin activity, and improvement of general condition were obtained in four out of five patients. The patient with the most severe hepatitis underwent liver transplantation due to exacerbation of hepatitis in spite of treatment with both abatacept and methylprednisolone. None of the patients developed significant adverse events associated with the use of abatacept. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) became negative in all five patients. The effect of abatacept and methylprednisolone for severe hepatitis B was compared using a mouse model. Rapid reduction in mouse serum HBV DNA and human albumin levels and elevation of serum interferon-gamma and granzyme A levels were observed in HBV-infected human hepatocyte-transplanted immunodeficient mice that were administered human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These hepatocyte injuries were inhibited to a greater extent by abatacept compared to methylprednisolone. Abatacept might be an effective therapy alternative to methylprednisolone to reduce acute massive liver damage for patients with severe acute hepatitis caused by HBV infection.","Yuji, Teraoka; Imamura, Michio; Uchida, Takuro; Ohya, Kazuki; Morio, Kei; Fujino, Hatsue; Ono, Atsushi; Nakahara, Takashi; Murakami, Eisuke; Yamauchi, Masami; Kawaoka, Tomokazu; Miki, Daiki; Tsuge, Masataka; Hiramatsu, Akira; Abe-Chayama, Hiromi; Hayes, C Nelson; Aikata, Hiroshi; Chayama, Kazuaki",Journal of viral hepatitis,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197288/,27

But a critical gap remains: capacities to detect and respond to disease outbreaks that could constitute a public health emergency of international concern, as required by the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Afghan Ministry of Public Health seeks to build these capacities, but conflict and scarcity of resources hinder public health surveillance and response, diagnostic laboratory and clinical management capacity is limited, and massive international population movements could permit outbreaks to cross international borders. Several diseases covered by the IHR, such as polio, are endemic in Afghanistan, and risk of novel disease emergence may be elevated in some areas. The security forces of the United States and other countries with military presence in Afghanistan are potential partners for the government of Afghanistan in strengthening the public health capacity. They could extend specialized disease surveillance and response capabilities to the Afghan military and civilian sectors and could integrate surveillance and response capacity building into ongoing development programs, especially in insecure areas. The World Health Organization could provide the forum for coordinating military and civilian contributions to public health capacity strengthening in Afghanistan and could help ensure that international health sector development efforts address Afghan public health priorities in addition to IHR requirements.","Chrétien, Jean-Paul; Yingst, Samuel L; Thompson, Donald","Biosecurity and bioterrorism : biodefense strategy, practice, and science",https://doi.org/10.1089/bsp.2009.0058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825338/,27

Uncertainty about COVID-19 contributes to the complexity of the burden on the health, social, economic, and cultural influences of COVID-19. In this context, all related disciplines are working together to mitigate the negative influences of the disease. In particular, health promotion, a discipline of public health, matters to the pandemic as it may address the threats at different levels. Health promotion strategies mostly use solution-oriented efforts with inter- and multidisciplinary approaches. Nevertheless, as the COVID-19 burden has many time-critical determinants, these approaches cannot be sufficient to overcome the problem.

Here we aimed to raise awareness about this SARS-CoV-2 related syndrome. METHODS Children diagnosed with MIS-C and followed in Pediatric Clinic between November 2020 and January 2021, were included in study. Data about patients' demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings, treatment and outcomes were collected from medical records. RESULTS The median age of 20 children with MIS-C was 80.5 months, 11 of them were male. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (100%), abdominal pain (70%), myalgia (50%), and rash (50%). Lymphopenia, elevated inflammatory markers and cardiac enzymes were their main laboratory findings. Cardiac involvement (90%) consisted of myopericarditis, valvulitis, left ventricular dysfunction, and coronary arteritis. Symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis and ileus were due to gastrointestinal involvement (50%). Macular rash on the trunk, erythema on upper eyelids were striking. Empiric antibiotics and intravenous immunoglobulin were used in all patients, glucocorticoids (90%), anti-thrombotic (65%) and vasoactive (45%) agents were used according to severity of disease. Response to IVIG treatment was poor, whereas glucocorticoids have dramatic affect. Seven patients (35%) were monitored in intensive care unit, none of them required intubation, mechanic ventilation or ECMO. The median recovery time, that is, the period when fever subside and inflammatory markers returned to normal was 9.5 days. CONCLUSIONS Glucocorticoids has critical role in treatment of MIS-C, early recognition and treatment may decrease need for intensive care by providing rapid recovery.","Öcal Demir, Sevliya; Tosun, Öykü; Öztürk, Kübra; Duyu, Muhterem; Bucak, Abdülmelik; Akkuş, Gökhan; Bayraktar, Ali C; Demirel, Hande N; Arslanoğlu, Sertaç; Ovali, Fahri",Minerva pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-5276.21.06327-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33890746/,27

This study assessed the association between household food insecurity and self-perceived mental health status and anxiety symptoms among Canadians in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. DATA AND METHODS The Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 2 collected cross-sectional data from May 4 to 10, 2020, on Canadians aged 15 years or older residing in the ten provinces. The brief six-item Household Food Security Survey Module was used to measure participants' households as food secure or marginally, moderately or severely food insecure within the previous 30 days. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between food security status and self-perceived fair or poor mental health and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, adjusting for sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS Approximately one in seven Canadians (14.6%) lived in a household that experienced some level of food insecurity. Of these individuals, 9.3% reported recently accessing free food from a community organization. About one in five Canadians self-perceived their mental health as fair or poor (22.0%), or self-reported moderate or severe anxiety symptoms (18.2%). With covariate adjustment, individuals in households with moderate food insecurity had nearly three times higher odds of reporting fair or poor mental health, and moderate or severe anxiety symptoms, compared with individuals in food-secure households. Among those with severe food insecurity, adjusted odds ratios were 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.0 to 7.9) for fair or poor mental health, and 7.6 (95% CI: 3.9 to 14.7) for moderate or severe anxiety symptoms. DISCUSSION In the early period of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, household food insecurity was independently associated with poorer mental health outcomes. Monitoring both food insecurity and mental health will be important as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Polsky, Jane Y; Gilmour, Heather",Health reports,https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202001200001-eng; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33325672/,27

125929,Autonomic testing for prediction of competition performance in Paralympic athletes.,2018,"BACKGROUND Immunotoxin is a hybrid protein consisting of a toxin moiety that is linked to a targeting moiety for the purpose of specific elimination of target cells. Toxins used in traditional immunotoxins are practically difficult to be produced in large amount, have poor tissue penetration and a complex internalization process. We hypothesized that the smaller HALT-1, a cytolysin derived from Hydra magnipapillata, can be used as the toxin moiety in construction of a recombinant immunotoxin. RESULTS In this study, pro-inflammatory macrophage was selected as the target cell due to its major roles in numerous inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We aimed to construct macrophage-targeted recombinant immunotoxins by combining HALT-1 with anti-CD64-scFv in two orientations, and to assess whether their cytotoxic activity and binding capability could be preserved upon molecular fusion. The recombinant immunotoxins, HALT-1-scFv and scFv-HALT-1, were successfully constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our data showed that HALT-1 still exhibited significant cytotoxicity against CD64+ and CD64- cell lines upon fusion with anti-CD64 scFv, although it had half cytotoxic activity as compared to HALT-1 alone. As positioning HALT-1 at N- or C-terminus did not affect its potency, the two constructs demonstrated comparable cytotoxic activities with IC50 lower in CD64+ cell line than in CD64- cell line. In contrast, the location of targeting moieties anti-CD64 scFv at C-terminal end was crucial in maintaining the scFv binding capability. CONCLUSIONS HALT-1 could be fused with anti-CD64-scFv via a fsexible polypeptide linker. Upon the successful production of this recombinant HALT-1 scFv fusion protein, HALT-1 was proven effective for killing two human cell lines. Hence, this preliminary study strongly suggested that HALT-1 holds potential as the toxin moiety in therapeutic cell targeting.","Jiemy, William F; Hiew, Lih Fhung; Sha, Hong Xi; In, Lionel L A; Hwang, Jung Shan",BMC biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-020-00628-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552895/,27

While data exists on the use of FNB needles in solid pancreatic lesions, very few studies looked at the utility of FNB in solid extrapancreatic lesions. Our aim was to study and compare the technical success and feasibility of EUS-FNB in evaluating solid pancreatic and extrapancreatic lesions using a novel FNB needle. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with solid masses or lesions needing EUS-guided core biopsy at the University of Utah between May 2016 and November 2017. All core biopsies were obtained using an Acquire™Fine Needle Biopsy Device (Boston Scientific Corporation, Natick MA, USA). Rapid on-site evaluation was performed by a board-certified cytopathologist in all cases. Results One hundred thirty-two patients (87 male) were included. Ninety-nine (73.3%) of the lesions were located in the pancreas. All needle sizes (19 G, 22 G and 25 G) had similar yield. The mean number of passes needed was 2.28±0.7. EUS-FNB of the pancreatic lesions had a diagnostic accuracy of 97.9%, comparable to the 97.2% for the biopsied extra-pancreatic lesions. Only 3 of 132 cases needed re-biopsy at a later date. No immediate adverse events were reported. Conclusion In this large, single-center study, EUS-FNB with a novel Franseen-design needle was proven to be an effective modality for tissue acquisition from both pancreatic and extrapancreatic solid lesions.","Haseeb, Abdul; Taylor, Linda Jo; Adler, Douglas G",Annals of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.20524/aog.2018.0313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386126/,27

As a consequence, these new findings prompt questions regarding the potential for cross-species transmissions of hepaciviruses. The closest relatives to HCV discovered to date are the non-primate hepaciviruses (NPHVs), which have been described to infect horses. To evaluate the risk of a potential zoonotic transmission, we analysed NPHV RNA and antibodies in humans with occupational exposure to horses in comparison with a low-risk group. Both groups were negative for NPHV RNA, even though low seroreactivities against various NPHV antigens could be detected irrespective of the group.

STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who delivered at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC from April 8, 2020 to July 31, 2020. Starting April 8, 2020, universal testing for COVID-19 infection was initiated for all women admitted to labor and delivery. Women who declined universal testing were excluded. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were diagnosed based on American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Task Force definitions.1 Maternal demographics, clinical characteristics, and labor and delivery outcomes were examined. Neonatal outcomes were also collected. Laboratory values from admission were evaluated. Our primary outcome was the incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy among women who tested positive for COVID-19. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was compared between women who tested positive for COVID-19 and women who tested negative. RESULTS Of the 1,008 women included in the analysis, 73 (7.2%) women tested positive for COVID-19, of which 12 (16.4%) were symptomatic at the time of admission. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 34.2% among women who tested positive for COVID-19 and 22.9% women who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for race, antenatal aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and body mass index >30, the risk of developing any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 1.58 [0.91-2.76]). CONCLUSION After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who tested positive for COVID-19 compared with women who tested negative for COVID-19 was not significantly different.

The objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the longitudinal literature that describes these associations. METHODS Six electronic databases were searched for articles published through March 2018. Eligible articles were published in the English language, peer-reviewed, and had prospective cohort study designs. Articles eligible for inclusion examined positive and negative parenting practices of parents and/or guardians when study subjects were between 0 and 9 years of age, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing symptoms when subjects were between 10 and 19 years of age. Heterogeneity of included articles precluded meta-analysis: findings were reported narratively. RESULTS 4558 references were screened for inclusion, and 19 articles met eligibility criteria and were included for review. Ten articles examined positive parenting practices, and four demonstrated statistically significant associations between positive parenting practices and lower risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. Fifteen articles examined negative parenting practices, and five demonstrated significant associations between negative parenting practices and higher risk of adolescent depression, anxiety, and/or internalizing symptoms. CONCLUSION This review demonstrates that the evidence base supporting longitudinal associations between parenting practices in childhood and adolescent symptoms of depression, anxiety, and internalizing problems is inconsistent. Findings from this review highlight limitations of the existing literature and identify understudied parenting dimensions that require further investigation.","Clayborne, Zahra M; Kingsbury, Mila; Sampasa-Kinyaga, Hugues; Sikora, Lindsey; Lalande, Kathleen M; Colman, Ian",Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01956-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32892249/,27
132650,The international response of primary health care to COVID-19: document analysis in selected countries.,2020,"Limited studies have been done on the interactions between subunits of self-assembling protein cages. E2 protein cage from Bacillus stearothermophilus was investigated in this work to impart pH-sensitive disassembly profile. Key amino acids were identified at the intratrimer and intertrimer interfaces, and histidine residues were introduced to these key sites to probe for their influences on the E2 assembly. We found that both the intratrimer- and the intertrimer-modified mutant proteins have the same quaternary structures as the wild type (E2-WT) at physiological pH of 7.4. At pH 5.0, the intratrimer-modified protein maintained its spherical structure. In contrast, the intertrimer modified protein lost its integrity, as observed under the electron microscope, whereas it remained soluble and nondenatured. The identified interactions between the intertrimers are critical in the formation of E2 protein cage. The pH-controlled disassembly of E2 protein cage in soluble and nondenatured form make it promising in nanoscale applications, especially for drug delivery and release in the endosomes.","Peng, Tao; Lim, Sierin",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/bm2005438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21797220/,27
132767,[COVID-19: Special Challenges for Theoretical and Practical Public Health].,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Placement of a heat moisture exchanger (HME) between aerosol generator and patient has been associated with greatly reduced drug delivery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of filtered and nonfiltered HMEs placed between nebulizer and patient on aerosol deposition and airway resistance (Raw) in simulated ventilator-dependent adults. METHODS An in vitro lung model was developed to simulate a mechanically ventilated adult (Vt 500 mL, RR 15/min, and PEEP 5 cmH2O, using two inspiratory flow rates 40 and 50 L/min) using an intubated adult manikin with an endotracheal tube (8 mmID). The bronchi of the manikin were connected to a Y-adapter through a collecting filter (Respirgard II) attached to a test lung through a heated humidifier (37°C producing 100% relative humidity) to simulate exhaled humidity. For treatment conditions, a nonfiltered HME (ThermoFlo™ 6070; ARC Medical) and filtered HMEs (ThermoFlo™ Filter; ARC Medical and PALL Ultipor; Pall Medical) were placed between the ventilator circuit at the endotracheal tube and allowed to acclimate to the exhaled heat and humidity for 30 minutes before aerosol administration. Airway resistance (cmH2O/L/s) was taken at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after HME placement and after each of four aerosol treatments. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was administered with jet (Misty Max 10; Airlife) and mesh (Aerogen Solo; Aerogen) nebulizers positioned in the inspiratory limb proximal to the Y-adapter. Control consisted of nebulization with no HME. Drug was eluted from filter at the end of the trachea and measured using spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS Greater than 60% of the control dose was delivered through the ThermoFlo. No significant difference was found between the first four treatments given by the jet (p = 0.825) and the mesh (p = 0.753) nebulizers. There is a small increase in Raw between pre- and post-four treatments with the jet (p = 0.001) and mesh (p = 0.015) nebulizers. Aerosol delivery through filtered HMEs was similar (<0.5%) across the four treatments. Airway resistance was similar using the ThermoFlo Filter. With the PALL Ultipor, changes in Raw increased with mesh nebulizer after treatment (p = 0.005). Changes in resistance pre- and post-treatment were similar with both filtered HMEs. CONCLUSION The ThermoFlo™ nonfilter HME allowed the majority of the control dose to be delivered to the airway. Increases in Raw would likely not be outside of a tolerable range in ventilated patients. In contrast, filtered HMEs should not be placed between nebulizers and patient airways. Further research with other HMEs and materials is warranted.","Ari, Arzu; Dang, Truong; Al Enazi, Fahad H; Alqahtani, Mohammed M; Alkhathami, Abdulrahman; Qoutah, Rowaida; Almamary, Ahmad S; Fink, James B",Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1089/jamp.2016.1347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28829202/,27
133455,Importance of Digital Literacy in the Process of Confronting the Stress During COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-27,"Medulloblastoma is a rare brain malignancy. Patients after puberty are rare and bear an intermediate prognosis. Standard treatment consists of maximal resection plus radio-chemotherapy. Treatment toxicity is high and produces disabling long-term side effects. The sonic hedgehog (SHH) subgroup is highly overrepresented in the post-pubertal and adult population and can be targeted by smoothened (SMO) inhibitors. No practice-changing prospective randomized data have been generated in adults. The EORTC 1634-BTG/NOA-23 trial will randomize patients between standard-dose vs. reduced-dosed craniospinal radiotherapy and SHH-subgroup patients between the SMO inhibitor sonidegib (OdomzoTM, Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc., New York, USA) in addition to standard radio-chemotherapy vs. standard radio-chemotherapy alone to improve outcomes in view of decreased radiotherapy-related toxicity and increased efficacy. We will further investigate tumor tissue, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid as well as magnetic resonance imaging and radiotherapy plans to generate information that helps to further improve treatment outcomes. Given that treatment side effects typically occur late, long-term follow-up will monitor classic side effects of therapy, but also health-related quality of life, cognition, social and professional outcome, and reproduction and fertility. In summary, we will generate unprecedented data that will be translated into treatment changes in post-pubertal patients with medulloblastoma and will help to design future clinical trials.","Hau, Peter; Frappaz, Didier; Hovey, Elizabeth; McCabe, Martin G; Pajtler, Kristian W; Wiestler, Benedikt; Seidel, Clemens; Combs, Stephanie E; Dirven, Linda; Klein, Martin; Anazodo, Antoinette; Hattingen, Elke; Hofer, Silvia; Pfister, Stefan M; Zimmer, Claus; Kortmann, Rolf-Dieter; Sunyach, Marie-Pierre; Tanguy, Ronan; Effeney, Rachel; von Deimling, Andreas; Sahm, Felix; Rutkowski, Stefan; Berghoff, Anna S; Franceschi, Enrico; Pineda, Estela; Beier, Dagmar; Peeters, Ellen; Gorlia, Thierry; Vanlancker, Maureen; Bromberg, Jacoline E C; Gautier, Julien; Ziegler, David S; Preusser, Matthias; Wick, Wolfgang; Weller, Michael",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13143451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34298664/,27

These tests had negligible source depletion throughout the monitoring period, indicating limited contaminant partitioning and diffusion through the LLDPE. At 483 days, 23 °C receptor PFOA and PFOS concentrations, cr, were <8 μg/L (cr/co < 3.2 × 10-4) for all tests, and at 399 days elevated temperature receptor concentrations were < 0.4 μg/L (cr/co < 1.6 × 10-5) at 35 °C and <0.5 μg/L (cr/co < 2.0 × 10-5) at 50 °C for both PFOA and PFOS.

137039,Introducing a Navigation Algorithm for Reducing the Spread of Diseases in Public Transport Networks.,2021-05-07,"OBJECTIVES Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of medium-sized (3-5 cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is suboptimal. Switching monopolar RFA (SW-RFA) enlarges the ablative volume to better cover larger tumors. This study aims to compare the long-term outcomes of medium-sized HCC treated by either SW-RFA or single-monopolar RFA (S-RFA). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed 139 cases (147 medium-size HCC) between 2008 and 2014. Under propensity score matching, a total of 43 paired patients with medium-size HCC and balanced clinical variables treated by either SW-RFA or S-RFA were selected for comparison. RESULTS SW-RFA showed a higher rate of achieving an adequate safety margin (p = 0.002). After a mean follow-up period of 40.4 months, SW-RFA produced significantly lower global RFA failure rates (p < 0.001) and better overall survival (p = 0.005) compared to S-RFA. SW-RFA was independently associated with a decreased risk of global RFA failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.136, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.030-0.607, p = 0.009) and improved overall survival (HR: 0.337, 95% CI: 0.152-0.747, p = 0.007). By last follow-up, the SW-RFA group maintained a superior tumor-free rate (p = 0.010) and fewer progressions to Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage C (p = 0.011). Major complication rates were comparable in both groups (SW-RFA: 2.3% vs. S-RFA: 4.7%, p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS The switching multi-monopolar ablation technique could be beneficial for patients with medium-sized HCCs given sustained control of larger tumors with better overall survival. KEY POINTS • Switching monopolar ablation could provide a sustained local tumor control and better overall survival than single-monopolar ablation for the medium-sized hepatocellular carcinoma. • Compared to single-monopolar ablation, switching monopolar ablation could create a larger homogeneous coagulation volume by using a shorter total ablation time to achieve a higher rate of adequate safety margin for a medium-sized HCC. • Patients with medium-sized HCC can be maintained at a higher rate of tumor-free status and at a lower risk of progression into BCLC stage C in the follow-up period after ablation by switching monopolar than by single-monopolar ablation.","Lin, Chen-Chun; Lui, Kar-Wai; Chen, Wei-Ting; Hsieh, Yi-Chung; Cheng, Ya-Ting; Teng, Wei; Lin, Shi-Ming",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07729-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895858/,27

Confronted by the exigencies of the Covid-19 surge that struck New York, he questions the task force's decision not to give any degree of preference to health care workers who might become ill. He posits that they are due a compensatory ethic and some deference given the risks they have assumed, often with inadequate protective gear. Reflecting on his ambivalence, he asks if his change of heart reflects the impact of experiential learning or the erosion of nomos-or governing norms-described by Thucydides when the plague struck Athens.","Fins, Joseph J",The Hastings Center report,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596885/,27

Using a square-root operation, it has been suggested that a square-root HOTI may emerge in a hybrid honeycomb-kagome lattice. Here, we report the first experimental realization of the square-root HOTI in topological LC circuits. We show theoretically and experimentally that the square-root HOTI inherits the feature of wave function from its parent, with corner states pinned to non-zero energies. The topological feature is fully characterized by the bulk polarization. To directly measure the finite-energy corner modes, we introduce extra grounded inductors to each node, which shifts corner states to zero-energy without affecting their spatial distributions. Our results experimentally substantiate the emerging square-root HOTI and pave the way to realizing exotic topological phases that are challenging to observe in condensed matter physics.","Song, Lingling; Yang, Huanhuan; Cao, Yunshan; Yan, Peng",Nano letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.0c03049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940479/,27
137840,Extending social cognition models of health behaviour.,2011,"The term telehealth is often used interchangeably with telemedicine. Telemedicine involves the electronic exchange of medical information between two remote sites for the optimization of patient care, whereas telehealth is the application of all electronic communication and delivery systems in the provision of healthcare. Telehealth gives patients an opportunity to communicate with their healthcare providers and, overall, access ambulatory care that otherwise is not available in their area of residence. Several telehealth delivery systems are available for electronic communication. Telehealth and other communications technologies used in the delivery of healthcare services are regulated at both the federal and state levels. Coverage and payment policies vary among the different insurers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private plans), and policies may further be defined by state telehealth parity laws. Telenutrition involves the use of digital technology to provide nutrition care to patients and caregivers and shows potential to optimize nutrition care and outcomes. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has contributed to sweeping legislative and regulatory changes that allowed the temporary expansion of telehealth delivery and reimbursement to maintain continuity of care for patients who were not able to come in for an in-person office visit with their healthcare provider. The purpose of this review is to introduce key concepts of telehealth delivery systems including policy, legal, and regulatory considerations for ambulatory care as well as the role of telenutrition in nutrition care, and highlight the evolving role of telehealth in optimizing patient and nutrition care during a pandemic and beyond.","Shah, Neha D; Krupinski, Elizabeth A; Bernard, Jordana; Moyer, Meagan F",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1002/ncp.10641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33734469/,27

Although RT-PCR is the most reliable technique to detect ongoing infections, serological tests are frequently proposed as tools in heterogeneous screening strategies. OBJECTIVES to analyse the performance of a screening strategy proposed by the local government of Tuscany (Central Italy), which first uses qualitative rapid tests for antibody detection, and then RT-PCR tests on the positive subjects. METHODS a simulation study is conducted to investigate the number of RT-PCR tests required by the screening strategy and the undetected ongoing infections in a pseudo-population of 500,000 subjects, under different prevalence scenarios and assuming a sensitivity of the serological test ranging from 0.50 to 0.80 (specificity 0.98). A compartmental model is used to predict the number of new infections generated by the false negatives two months after the screening, under different values of the infection reproduction number. RESULTS assuming a sensitivity equal to 0.80 and a prevalence of 0.3%, the screening procedure would require on average 11,167 RT-PCR tests and would produce 300 false negatives, responsible after two months of a number of contagions ranging from 526 to 1,132, under the optimistic scenario of a reproduction number between 0.5 to 1. Resources and false negatives increase with the prevalence. CONCLUSIONS the analysed screening procedure should be avoided unless the prevalence and the rate of contagion are very low. The cost and effectiveness of the screening strategies should be evaluated in the actual context of the epidemic, accounting for the fact that it may change over time.","Baccini, Michela; Mattei, Alessandra; Rocco, Emilio; Vannucci, Giulia; Mealli, Fabrizia",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412810/,27

Traditional LUR models mostly use predefined buffers, which have the disadvantage of not matching high-resolution data well. In order to get a better-fitting model, a few researches have proposed new buffer selection methods. To solve this problem, we propose a new optimal buffer selection method based on the dichotomy to improve the correlation between predicted variables and pollutant concentration. For some socioeconomic data with high spatial resolution that cannot be obtained, for example, building data is used instead of population density data. Compared with the model with the predefined buffers, the model with our buffer selection strategy explained additional 5% variability in measured concentrations, in terms of the R2 of the final model. Our model explained 98% of the samples, and the deviation (1.78%) and root mean square error (5.17 μg/m) were small. It means that the LUR model with our buffer selection strategy can be used as a fit method to better describe spatial variability in atmospheric pollutant levels, which will be conducive to epidemiological research and urban environmental planning.","Liu, Zeyu; Guan, Qingyu; Lin, Jinkuo; Yang, Liqin; Luo, Haiping; Wang, Ning",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11770-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411307/,27
142266,Social representations of the coronavirus and causal perception of its origin: The role of reasons for fear.,2021-03-22,"Intra-amniotic infection and inflammation are major causes of preterm birth (PTB). However, intra-amniotic inflammation is often detected in the absence of infection. This may partly be due to the culturing methods employed in hospital laboratories, which are unable to detect the uncultivated species. In this study, intra-amniotic microbial infections associated with PTB were examined by both culture and 16S rRNA-based culture-independent methods and were corroborated by the presence of intra-amniotic inflammation. Amniotic fluid (AF) specimens from 46 pregnancies complicated by PTB and 16 asymptomatic women were analyzed. No bacterial DNA was amplified in AF collected from the asymptomatic women. Among the 46 samples associated with PTB, bacterial DNA was amplified from all (16/16) of the culture-positive samples and 17% (5/30) of the culture-negative samples. In the culture-positive group, additional species were detected in more than half (9/16) of the cases by PCR and clone analysis. Altogether, approximately two- thirds of the species detected by the culture-independent methods were not isolated by culture. They included both uncultivated and difficult-to-cultivate species, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum, Leptotrichia (Sneathia) spp., a Bergeyella sp., a Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides spp., and a species of the order Clostridiales. To examine intra-amniotic inflammation, an AF proteomic fingerprint (mass-restricted score) was determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Inflammation was detected in all five samples which were culture negative but PCR positive. Women who were PCR positive more often had elevated interleukin-6 levels in their AF, histological chorioamnionitis, and funisitis and delivered neonates with early-onset neonatal sepsis. Previously unrecognized, uncultivated, or difficult-to-cultivate species may play a key role in the initiation of PTB.","Han, Yiping W; Shen, Tao; Chung, Peter; Buhimschi, Irina A; Buhimschi, Catalin S",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01206-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18971361/,27

The procedure we propose may potentially improve patient satisfaction and cosmetic results while diminishing the incidence of trocar-site herniation. We report our initial experience with laparoendoscopic single-site totally extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy for postoperative incisional hernia to determine the procedure's feasibility and safety. METHODS Three patients with incisional hernias after gynecologic surgery underwent laparoendoscopic single-site totally extraperitoneal procedures. We evaluated the patients' preoperative and postoperative condition, as well as the details of their original surgery. We performed the procedure through a 2-cm umbilical incision followed by mesh insertion and transabdominal suture placement in all patients. RESULTS Laparoendoscopic single-site totally extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy was completed in 80 to 120 minutes. No intraoperative complications were encountered, and surgical blood loss was minimal. The duration of hospital stay ranged from 2 to 4 days. One patient had a postoperative wound infection. The patients have shown no sign of recurrence at 9 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION Laparoendoscopic single-site totally extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy appears to be feasible and safe.

145100,Strengths-based behavioral telehealth with sexual and gender diverse clients at Center on Halsted.,2021-02-09,"Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. Objective To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed. Results A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P < .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P < .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13 800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/μL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] μg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs <0.006 [<0.006-0.009] μg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P < .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P < .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P < .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P < .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]).

145464,Impact of nonpharmacological interventions on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in India.,2020-06-01,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease that currently lacks standardized and established laboratory markers to evaluate its severity. In COVID-19 patients, the number of platelets (PLTs) and dynamic changes of PLT-related parameters are currently a concern. The present paper discusses the potential link between PLT parameters and COVID-19. Several studies have identified a link between severe COVID-19 patients and specific coagulation index, in particular, high D-dimer level, prolonged prothrombin time, and low PLT count. These alterations reflect the hypercoagulable state present in severe COVID-19 patients, which could promote microthrombosis in the lungs, as well as in other organs. Further information and more advanced hematological parameters related to PLTs are needed to better estimate this link, also considering COVID-19 patients at different disease stages and stratified in different cohorts based on preexisting co-morbidity, age, and gender. Increasing the understanding of PLT functions in COVID-19 will undoubtedly improve our knowledge on disease pathogenesis, clinical management, and therapeutic options, but could also lead to the development of more precise therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 patients.","Salamanna, Francesca; Maglio, Melania; Landini, Maria Paola; Fini, Milena",Platelets,https://doi.org/10.1080/09537104.2020.1762852; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397915/,27

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have proven prophylactic effect in PEP. However, the patient population that would benefit from this approach has not been defined. STUDY A total of 539 patients undergoing our cannulation protocol with early precut were randomized into a placebo-controlled, prospective, double-blind study to rectally receive either 100 mg indomethacin or placebo. The effect of indomethacin on PEP was stratified based on difficulties of cannulation and analyzed in patients with different risks. RESULTS In 70.3% of patients, biliary intubation was successful in the first 5 atraumatic attempts, PEP rate was low, and indomethacin was ineffective (7.4% in the placebo group and 5.2% in the indomethacin group, P=0.406). In the next phase of intubation using guidewire, the success rate increased up to 83.5%, and PEP rate rose up to 8.7%, the effect of indomethacin was significant (11.9% vs. 5.4%, P=0.018). Applying early precut success rate of biliary cannulation increased up to 98.1% and overall indomethacin diminished the frequency of PEP from 13.8% to 6.7% (P=0.007). Preventive effect of indomethacin was demonstrated in cases with defined procedure-related risk (28.3% vs. 13.8%, P=0.028) and with defined patient-related risk (16.3% vs. 7.0%, P=0.004), but not in patients without risk factors. CONCLUSIONS Rectally administered 100 mg indomethacin results in significantly lower PEP rate, particularly in cases with difficult cannulation and with identifiable patient-related or procedure-related risk factors.","Patai, Árpád; Solymosi, Norbert; Patai, Árpád V",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000000168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25790233/,27
145851,Population ageing and deaths attributable to ambient PM2·5 pollution: a global analysis of economic cost.,2021-06-01,"PURPOSE This study compared the effect of whole lung lavage (WLL) at different time-points early after exposure of the respiratory system to insoluble radioactive particles. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty adult beagles were randomized into a control group and the 3-h, 8-h, 24-h, and 48-h lavage groups (n = 8). A canine model of acute lung injury was established by spraying a depleted uranium (DU) suspension using a superfine fiber bronchoscope, at a dose of 20 mg/kg. The lavage groups were subjected to WLL at 3 h, 8 h, 24 h, and 48 h post-DU exposure, while the control group received no treatment after exposure. Measurement of U in serum was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; measurements in the lavage fluid and left lung tissue were performed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The color of the lavage fluid was analyzed using colorimetry, and shadow changes in the lung were observed using chest computed tomography (CT). RESULTS The lavage groups showed similarly increasing trends for serum U levels from DU exposure to 3 and 7 days after exposure; however, these values were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The U content in the lavage fluid was significantly higher in the 3-h group than in the 8-h, 24-h, and 48-h groups (P < 0.01), while that in the 8-h group was markedly higher than those in the 24-h and 48-h groups (P < 0.05). The average clearance rate of DU in the lungs varied in the range of 0.63‒7.06%. The U content in the left lung tissue of each lavage group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.01), while the content in the 8-h, 24-h, and 48-h groups was significantly higher than that in the 3-h group (P < 0.05). The colorimetric score of the lavage fluid in the 3-h group was significantly lower than those in the 8-h, 24-h, and 48-h groups (P < 0.05). Chest CT showed different degrees of consolidation and ground glass shadow changes in all groups. The score of the left lung shadow volume in the 3-h group was significantly lower than in the control, 8-h, 24-h, and 48-h groups (P < 0.01), while the score in the 8-h group was significantly higher than those in the 48-h and control groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The best effect of WLL after exposure of the respiratory system to insoluble radioactive particles was achieved at 3 h, followed by 8 h; there was no difference in the effectiveness of lung lavage at 24 h and 48 h.","Fu, Weilin; Xiao, Yao; Zeng, Feng; Chen, Xiangyu; Zhu, Yong; Tian, Zhu; Liang, Yi; Li, Rong; Liu, Minghua",International journal of radiation biology,https://doi.org/10.1080/09553002.2021.1928783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085887/,27
146000,Protecting Mental Health Data Privacy in India: The Case of Data Linkage With Aadhaar.,2021-09-30,"INTRODUCTION The pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated pneumonia represent a clinical and scientific challenge. The role of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) in such a crisis remains unclear. METHODS We examined COVID-19 patients who were supported for acute respiratory failure by both conventional mechanical ventilation (MV) and ECMO at a tertiary care institution in Washington DC. The study period extended from March 23 to April 29. We identified 59 patients who required invasive mechanical ventilation. Of those, 13 patients required ECMO. RESULTS Nine out of 13 ECMO (69.2%) patients were decannulated from ECMO. All-cause ICU mortality was comparable between both ECMO and MV groups (6 patients [46.15%] vs. 22 patients [47.82 %], p = 0.92). ECMO non-survivors vs survivors had elevated D-dimer (9.740 mcg/ml [4.84-20.00] vs. 3.800 mcg/ml [2.19-9.11], p = 0.05), LDH (1158 ± 344.5 units/L vs. 575.9 ± 124.0 units/L, p = 0.001), and troponin (0.4315 ± 0.465 ng/ml vs. 0.034 ± 0.043 ng/ml, p = 0.04). Time on MV as expected was significantly longer in ECMO groups (563.3 hours [422.1-613.9] vs. 247.9 hours [101.8-479] in MV group, p = 0.0009) as well as ICU length of stay 576.2 hours [457.5-652.8] in ECMO group vs. 322.2 hours [120.6-569.3] in MV group, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION ECMO is a supportive intervention for COVID-19 associated pneumonia that could be considered if the optimum mechanical ventilation is deemed ineffective. Biomarkers such as D-dimer, LDH, and troponin could help with discerning the clinical prognosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","Alnababteh, Muhtadi; Hashmi, Muhammad D; Vedantam, Karthik; Chopra, Rajus; Kohli, Akshay; Hayat, Fatima; Kriner, Eric; Molina, Ezequiel; Pratt, Alexandra; Oweis, Emil; Zaaqoq, Akram M",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120963885; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021147/,27

Given the critical role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) in embryonic development, we generated a mouse model that overexpresses Fgf8 specifically in the epidermis. Interestingly, these mutant mice exhibited stunted, smaller bodies and severe hypotrichosis. Histological analysis showed that the hair follicles in the mutants were arrested at stage 2 of hair development. The density of hair follicles in the mutant mice was also lower compared to that in the control mice. Overexpression of Fgf8 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal cells and simultaneously promoted apoptosis, leading to the arrest of hair follicle development. Further analysis showed that sonic hedgehog (Shh) and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (Bmp4) were downregulated and upregulated, respectively. To summarize, our study demonstrates that FGF signaling plays an important role in the regulation of hair follicle development.","Wang, Zhengsen; Chen, Yixuan; Chen, Meiyang; Zhang, Yanding",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141445/,27

METHODS From May 2010 to September 2014, 70 MWAs were performed on 51 patients. All major intra- and post-procedural complications (as defined by the classification proposed by the Society of Interventional Radiology) were retrospectively analysed. The results were correlated with a systematic review of the available literature on MWA in the lung. RESULTS Major complications were encountered in 14 out of 70 ablations (20%). Twenty-one separate major complications were encountered (some ablations lead to more than one major complication). One death occurred within 30 days of ablation, though the relationship to the procedure remains uncertain. Other major complications included: nine pneumothoraces requiring drain insertion (12.9%), four cases of large effusion requiring drainage (5.7%), two cases of significant pulmonary haemorrhage altering clinical management (2.9%), two infections (2.9%), one case of mechanical failure (1.4%), one chest wall burn (1.4%) and one case of pleural seeding (1.4%). Major complications were much more likely to occur if the nodule was located within 7 mm from the pleura. CONCLUSION MWA of pulmonary tumours carries moderate risk; nevertheless, the usually manageable complications should not deter from undertaking a potentially curative therapy for poor surgical candidates.","Splatt, Alexander M; Steinke, Karin",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.12345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26238653/,27

A Mixed-Methods Reasoned Action Approach Applied to Health Communication.,2020-10-02,"CONTEXT Despite liberal abortion laws, safe abortion access in Zambia is impeded by limited legal awareness, lack of services, and restrictive clinical policies. As in many countries with restricted abortion access, women frequently seek abortions informally from pharmacies. METHODS We conducted 16 in-depth interviews in 2019 to understand the experiences and motivations of pharmacy workers who sell medication abortion (MA) drugs in Lusaka. RESULTS We found that pharmacy staff reluctantly assume a gatekeeper role for MA due to competing pressures from clients and from regulatory constraints. Pharmacy staff often decide to provide MA, motivated by their duty of care and desire to help clients, as well as financial interests. However, pharmacy workers' motivation to protect themselves from legal and business risk perpetuates inequalities in abortion access, as pharmacy workers improvise additional eligibility criteria based on personal risk and values such as age, partner approval, reason for abortion, and level of desperation. CONCLUSION These findings highlight how pharmacy staff informally determine women's abortion access when laws and policies prevent comprehensive access to safe abortion. Reform of clinical guidelines, public education, strengthened public sector availability, task sharing, and improved access to prescription services are needed to ensure women can legally access safe abortion.","Footman, Katharine; Chelwa, Nachela; Douthwaite, Megan; Mdala, James; Mulenga, Drosin; Brander, Caila; Church, Kathryn",Studies in family planning,https://doi.org/10.1111/sifp.12151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826147/,27

154476,Contributions and Challenges in Health Lifestyles Research.,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND Evidence from previous studies comparing lung ultrasound to thoracic computed tomography (CT) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is limited due to multiple methodologic weaknesses. While addressing methodologic weaknesses of previous studies, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound in a tertiary ICU population. METHODS This is a single-center, prospective diagnostic accuracy study conducted at a tertiary ICU in the Netherlands. Critically ill patients undergoing thoracic CT for any clinical indication were included. Patients were excluded if time between the index and reference test was over eight hours. Index test and reference test consisted of 6-zone lung ultrasound and thoracic CT, respectively. Hemithoraces were classified by the index and reference test as follows: consolidation, interstitial syndrome, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio were estimated. RESULTS In total, 87 patients were included of which eight exceeded the time limit and were subsequently excluded. In total, there were 147 respiratory conditions in 79 patients. The estimated sensitivity and specificity to detect consolidation were 0.76 (95%CI: 0.68 to 0.82) and 0.92 (0.87 to 0.96), respectively. For interstitial syndrome they were 0.60 (95%CI: 0.48 to 0.71) and 0.69 (95%CI: 0.58 to 0.79). For pneumothorax they were 0.59 (95%CI: 0.33 to 0.82) and 0.97 (95%CI: 0.93 to 0.99). For pleural effusion they were 0.85 (95%CI: 0.77 to 0.91) and 0.77 (95%CI: 0.62 to 0.88). CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, lung ultrasound is an adequate diagnostic modality in a tertiary ICU population to detect consolidations, interstitial syndrome, pneumothorax and pleural effusion. Moreover, one should be careful not to interpret lung ultrasound results in deterministic fashion as multiple respiratory conditions can be present in one patient.

154687,Nursing is a health equity and social justice movement.,2021-04-04,"Blood circulates through nearly every organ including tumors. Therefore, plasma is a logical source to search for tumor-derived proteins and peptides. The challenge with plasma is that it is a complex bodily fluid composed of high concentrations of normal host proteins that obscure identification of tumor-derived molecules. To simplify plasma, we examined a low molecular weight (LMW) fraction (plasma peptidome) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods. In the plasma peptidome of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (DAP), a prominent peptide was identified from the QSOX1 parent protein. This peptide is stable in whole blood over 24 h and was present in 16 of 23 DAP patients and 4 of 5 patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). QSOX1 peptides were never identified in the plasma peptidome from 42 normal healthy donors using the same methods. Immunohistochemical staining of DAP tissue sections with anti-QSOX1 antibody shows overexpression of QSOX1 in tumor but not in adjacent stroma or normal ducts. Three of four pancreas tumor cell lines also express QSOX1 protein by Western blot analysis. This is the first report of QSOX1 peptides in plasma from DAP patients and makes the rare connection between a peptide in plasma from cancer patients and overexpression of the parent protein in tumors.","Antwi, Kwasi; Hostetter, Galen; Demeure, Michael J; Katchman, Benjamin A; Decker, G Anton; Ruiz, Yvette; Sielaff, Timothy D; Koep, Lawrence J; Lake, Douglas F",Journal of proteome research,https://doi.org/10.1021/pr900414f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19795908/,27

Currently, intermittent manual assessment of respiratory rate is the standard of care on the GCF. This technique has several clinically-relevant shortcomings, including the following: (1) it is not a continuous measurement, (2) it is prone to observer error, and (3) it is inefficient for the clinical staff. We report here on an algorithm designed to meet clinical needs by providing respiratory rate through a standard pulse oximeter. Finger photoplethysmograms were collected from a cohort of 63 GCF patients monitored during free breathing over a 25-min period. These were processed using a novel in-house algorithm based on continuous wavelet-transform technology within an infrastructure incorporating confidence-based averaging and logical decision-making processes. The computed oximeter respiratory rates (RRoxi) were compared to an end-tidal CO2 reference rate (RRETCO2). RRETCO2 ranged from a lowest recorded value of 4.7 breaths per minute (brpm) to a highest value of 32.0 brpm. The mean respiratory rate was 16.3 brpm with standard deviation of 4.7 brpm. Excellent agreement was found between RRoxi and RRETCO2, with a mean difference of -0.48 brpm and standard deviation of 1.77 brpm. These data demonstrate that our novel respiratory rate algorithm is a potentially viable method of monitoring respiratory rate in GCF patients. This technology provides the means to facilitate continuous monitoring of respiratory rate, coupled with arterial oxygen saturation and pulse rate, using a single non-invasive sensor in low acuity settings.","Addison, Paul S; Watson, James N; Mestek, Michael L; Ochs, James P; Uribe, Alberto A; Bergese, Sergio D",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-014-9575-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796734/,27

METHODS The HP-CSS was translated into Turkish following an international instrument translation guideline. A convenience sample of 394 health professionals participated in this study. Internal consistency reliability, content validity, test-retest reliability and convergent validity were assessed. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the construct validity. RESULTS The Turkish version of HP-CSS comprised four factors (empathy, informative communication, respect and social skill). The HP-CSS-TR demonstrated adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's values 0.72-0.79). In terms of the content validity, the scale-level CVI was 0.94, and the item-level CVI ranged from 0.83 to 1.00. The HPCSS- TR showed good test-retest reliability (ICCs were above 0.82). No statistically significant difference was found between the applications. There was a good agreement between the HP-CSS-TR and CSI scales. Confirmatory factor analysis results (×²/df, GFI, AGFI, IFI, TLI, CFI, RMSEA and SRMR) showed a good fit for the original 4-factor model. CONCLUSIONS Results showed that the Turkish version of the HP-CSS is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of communication skills of health professionals in Turkey. The use of the HP-CSS-TR measure in clinical settings could be useful in enhancing the quality of care by identifying inadequacies and improving communication skills.","Mendi, Onur; Yildirim, Nurdan; Mendi, Basak",Asian nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anr.2020.09.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937201/,27

In contrast, about one in 30 adults were Medicaid eligible in nonexpansion states. While eligibility rates differed substantially by expansion status, participation rates among Medicaid-eligible adults were similar in both sets of states (44% to 46%).

160549,Lifetime perspective on alcohol and brain health.,2020-12-03,"INTRODUCTION Total gastrectomy is the standard treatment for tumours arising in the proximal stomach and for diffuse cancer according to the Lauren classification. Laparoscopic approach is progressively accepted and provides encouraging results. In order to reduce complications associated to the esophago-jejunal anastomosis, the concept of the 95 % open gastrectomy was developed in Japan, in the early 1980s. This procedure provides the spearing of a small remnant gastric stump of 2 cm and allows performing a gastro-jejunal anastomosis. Unlike the 7/8 gastrectomy, the 95 % gastrectomy allows the complete resection of the gastric fundus and an optimized pericardial lymph node dissection (group 1 and 2). We herein describe, step-by-step, our technique of full laparoscopic 95 % gastrectomy (G95 %), with D2 lymphadenectomy, including complete lymphadenectomy of the cardial nodes. DISCUSSION When it is possible to respect the oncologic criteria regarding proximal resection margin, 95 % gastrectomy would offer best short-term results, such as lower anastomotic leak rate and a better quality of life, limiting the effect of disruption of the eso-gastric junction. CONCLUSION In selected patients, laparoscopic G95 % is feasible and safe; it could be performed without any additional technical difficulties. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm the encouraging results of the cases series, recently reported in literature.","Arru, Luca; Azagra, Juan Santiago; Facy, Olivier; Makkai-Popa, Silviu Tiberiu; Poulain, Virginie; Goergen, Martine",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-015-1283-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25702139/,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS MW ablations were performed at power outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W using a 915-MHz frequency generator and a 2-cm active tip antenna. RF ablations were performed with a bipolar RF system with 2- and 3-cm active tip electrodes. Tissue temperatures were continuously monitored during ablation. RESULTS The mean short-axis diameters of the coagulation zones were 1.34 ± 0.14, 1.45 ± 0.13, and 1.74 ± 0.11 cm for MW ablation at outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W. For RF ablation, the corresponding values were 1.16 ± 0.09 and 1.26 ± 0.14 cm with electrodes having 2- and 3-cm active tips, respectively. The mean coagulation volumes were 2.27 ± 0.65, 2.85 ± 0.72, and 4.45 ± 0.47 cm(3) for MW ablation at outputs of 25W, 35W, and 45W and 1.18 ± 0.30 and 2.29 ± 0.55 cm(3) got RF ablation with 2- and 3-cm electrodes, respectively. MW ablations at 35W and 45W achieved significantly longer short-axis diameters than RF ablations (P < 0.05). The highest tissue temperature was achieved with MW ablation at 45W (P < 0.05). On histological examination, the extent of the ablation zone in MW ablations was less affected by tissue heterogeneity than that in RF ablations. CONCLUSION MW ablation appears to be advantageous with respect to the volume of ablation and the shape of the margin of necrosis compared with RF ablation in an ex vivo bovine udder.","Tanaka, Toshihiro; Westphal, Saskia; Isfort, Peter; Braunschweig, Till; Penzkofer, Tobias; Bruners, Philipp; Kichikawa, Kimihiko; Schmitz-Rode, Thomas; Mahnken, Andreas H",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-011-0253-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21833802/,27

This study explored the relationship between crisis awareness and medical waste separation behavior shown by urban residents during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. The results of a questionnaire survey data (N = 668) were subjected to statistical analyses, regression analyses, and cross-analyses. In terms of medical waste separation, the detection rate was 12.65%, among which, the waste separation behavior by citizens was the highest (24.56%). In terms of the relationship between crisis awareness and medical waste separation behavior, the crisis awareness generated by the environmental situation is significantly related to individuals' participation in the separation of medical waste. In particular, individual spontaneous crisis awareness only had a significant positive correlation with the waste separation behavior for the decision factor. The residents were clustered into ""sensitive"", ""conscious"", ""passive"", and ""insensitive"" types based on the original crisis awareness characteristics. The ""sensitive"" group was more actively involved in the separation of medical waste, while the ""insensitive"" group showed the worst performance for the separation of medical waste. A comparison of the separation behaviors shown by the ""conscious"" group and the ""passive"" group confirmed that environment-driven crisis awareness has a higher correlation with the separation of medical waste by residents.","Chen, Feiyu; Lou, Jingxuan; Hu, Jiangxin; Chen, Hong; Long, Ruyin; Li, Wenbo",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989867/,27

CS may trigger mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extrusion into the cytosol, extracellular space, or foster its transfer by extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present study aimed to elucidate whether mtDNA is released upon CS exposure and in COPD. We measured cell-free mtDNA (cf-mtDNA) in the plasma of former smokers affected by COPD, in the serum of mice that developed CS-induced emphysema, and in the extracellular milieu of human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Further, we characterized cells exposed to sublethal and lethal doses of CSE by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential and dynamics, superoxide production and oxidative stress, cell cycle progression, and cytokine expression. Patients with COPD and mice that developed emphysema showed increased levels of cf-mtDNA. In cell culture, exposure to a sublethal dose of CSE decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased superoxide production and oxidative damage, dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics, and triggered mtDNA release in extracellular vesicles. The release of mtDNA into the extracellular milieu occurred concomitantly with increased expression of DNase III, DNA-sensing receptors (cGAS, NLRP3), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, CXCL2), and markers of senescence (p16, p21). Exposure to a lethal dose of CSE preferentially induced mtDNA and nuclear DNA release in cell debris. Our findings demonstrate that CS-induced stress triggers mtDNA release and is associated with COPD, supporting cf-mtDNA as a novel signaling response to CS exposure.","Giordano, Luca; Gregory, Alyssa D.; Verdaguer, Mireia Perez; Ware, Sarah A.; Harvey, Hayley; DeVallance, Evan; Brzoska, Tomasz; Sundd, Prithu; Zhang, Yingze; Sciurba, Frank C.; Shapiro, Steven D.; Kaufman, Brett A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.04.462069,27

176175,Resúmenes,2021,"Background Globally, critical illness results in millions of deaths every year. Although many of these deaths are potentially preventable, the basic, life-saving care of critically ill patients can be overlooked in health systems. Essential and Emergency Care (EECC) has been devised as the care that should be provided to all critically ill patients in all hospitals in the world. EECC includes the effective care of low-cost and low-complexity for the identification and timely treatment of critically ill patients across all medical specialities. This study aimed to specify the content of EECC and additionally, given the surge of critical illness in the ongoing pandemic, the essential diagnosis-specific care for critically ill patients with COVID-19. Methods A Delphi process was conducted to seek consensus (>90% agreement) among a diverse panel of global clinical experts. The panel was asked to iteratively rate proposed treatments and actions based on previous guidelines and the WHO Basic Emergency Care. The output from the Delphi was adapted iteratively with specialist reviewers into a coherent, user-friendly, and feasible EECC package of clinical processes plus a list of hospital resource requirements. Results The 272 experts in the Delphi panel had clinical experience in different acute medical specialties from 59 countries and from all resource settings. The agreed EECC package contains 40 clinical processes and 67 hospital readiness requirements. The essential diagnosis-specific care of critically ill COVID-19 patients has an additional 7 clinical processes and 9 hospital readiness requirements. Conclusion The study has specified the content of the essential emergency and critical care that should be provided to all critically ill patients. Implementation of EECC could be an effective strategy to reduce preventable deaths worldwide. As critically ill patients have high mortality rates in all hospital settings, especially where trained staff or resources are limited, even small improvements would have a large impact on survival. EECC has a vital role in the effective scale-up of oxygen and other care for critically ill patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. Policy makers should prioritise EECC, increase its coverage in hospitals, and include EECC as a component of universal health coverage.","Schell, C. O.; Khalid, K.; Wharton-Smith, A.; Oliwa, J.

We show this network comprises genes homologous to those directing midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) formation in vertebrates and their closest chordate relatives. Genetic tracing reveals that the embryonic DTB gives rise to adult midbrain circuits that in flies control auditory and vestibular information processing and motor coordination, as do MHB-derived circuits in vertebrates. DTB-specific gene expression and function is directed by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) of developmental control genes that include homologs of mammalian Zinc finger of the cerebellum and Purkinje cell protein 4. Moreover, Drosophila DTB-specific CREs correspond to regulatory sequences of human ENGRAILED-2, PAX-2 and DACHSHUND-1 that direct MHB-specific expression in the embryonic mouse brain. Together, these findings imply ancestral regulatory mechanisms mediating the genetic specification of midbrain-cerebellar circuitry for balance and motor control that may predated the radiation of cephalic nervous systems across the animal kingdom.","Bridi, Jessika C.; Ludlow, Zoe N.; Kottler, Benjamin; Hartmann, Beate; Broeck, Lies Vanden; Dearlove, Jonah; Göker, Markus; Strausfeld, Nicholas J.; Callaerts, Patrick; Hirth, Frank",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/820555,27
183151,"The Trojan Horse: Digital Health, Human Rights, and Global Health Governance",2020-12-11,"Study Objectives: Consolidation of health care systems in the United States has created integrated enterprises with large geographical reach and complex interacting components. Specialty services vary among sites, and patients often need to travel between facilities for different aspects of care. Network science is an established method employed to investigate these complex systems, and can be used to identify bottlenecks, opportunities to increase value and patient-centeredness in health care. The COVID-19 pandemic changed care demand patterns unexpectedly. We wanted to investigate if network analysis would allow us to better understand these changes and challenges - where our patients receive hospital-based care, what services they used and how far they travelled. We focused this analysis on a multispecialty, tertiary care academic center emergency department (“AC_ED”), with 70,000 patient visits annually. Methods: We extracted patient location information from electronic health records, including originating location and level of care, to create a network representation of all care pathways that passed through our ED. The volume of transfers between nodes and the distance travelled were encoded as weighted/colored edge attributes, with edges between nodes in closer proximity being darker. Nodes include: communities within our service area, EDs, and academic center units, and an outcome of mortality. They are sized/colored by betweenness centrality, reflecting the importance of the node in the integrity of the network. Results: The figure shows the overall network structure was similar for pre- and post-pandemic onset with some changes in details. AC_ED receives patients from many home locations and referring hospitals. A large proportion of visits come from the local area reflected by M16 and M12. There are many patients who travel far to access emergency care at AC_ED, bypassing local EDs though the average distance travelled to access care reduced from 114 to 85 miles. During the pandemic there was more traffic to the AC_ED from the local area (M16), fewer connections to surrounding hospitals and disproportionately reduced visits from distant areas (O and OT). Low ED volumes and restricted outpatient clinic availability during the pandemic time frame likely affected this. Inter-hospital transfer volumes declined overall, several sites transferred very few patients to AC_ED post-pandemic start, and other sites increased their transfer rate (eg, CAH13). Conclusions: Looking at hospital systems through the lens of network science can reveal changes in patterns of referrals, allows for identification of unexpected results by presenting data visually and can assist identifying crucial components of a health care system. Application of this methodology to other variables has the potential to identify new areas of improvement to increase value, outcomes and services to improve patient-oriented care.

184722,Are virtual communities good for our health?,2006,"Background Israeli has vaccinated over 80% of its adult population, with two doses of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine. This intervention has been highly successful in curtailing the coronavirus 2 outbreak. One major concern is the ability of the virus to mutate which potentially can cause SARS-CoV-2 to partially escape from the immune system. Here we evaluate the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the B.1.351 variant. Methods The Ministry of Health, initiated sequencing of selected positive swab samples identified as being of interest. We used logistic regression, with variant type as the dependent variable, vaccination status as the main explanatory variable, controlling for age, sex, subpopulation, place of residence and time of sample, to estimate the odds ratio for a vaccinated case to have the B. 1.351 versus the B.1.1.7 variant, within vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who tested positive. Findings There were 19 cases of B.1.351 variant (3.2%) among those vaccinated more than 14 days before the positive sample and 88 (3.5%) among the unvaccinated. The estimated odds ratio was 1.29 [95% CI: 0.66-2.50]. From this result, assuming the efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant to be 95%, the estimated efficacy against the B.1.351 variant was 94% [95% CI: 87-97%]. Interpretation Despite the concerns caused by the B.1.351 variant, the BNT162b2 vaccine seems to provide substantial immunity against both that variant and the B.1.1.7. Our results suggest that from 14 days following the second vaccine dose the efficacy of BNT162b2 vaccine is at most marginally affected by the B.1.351 variant.

Importantly, the pathways by which fibrin generation is elicited in viral hepatitis may be mechanistically distinct from the classical pathways of coagulation induced by mechanical trauma or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In the setting of murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) infection, a member of the Coronaviridae, activated endothelial cells and macrophages express distinct cell-surface procoagulants, including a novel prothrombinase, Fgl2/fibroleukin, which are important for both the initiation and localization of fibrin deposition. To assess the role of Fgl2/fibroleukin in murine viral hepatitis we generated a Fgl2/fibroleukin-deficient mouse. Peritoneal macrophages isolated from Fgl2/fibroleukin-/- mice did not generate a procoagulant response when infected with MHV-3. Fibrin deposition and liver necrosis were markedly reduced, and survival was increased in mice infected with MHV-3. To address the relevance of Fgl2/fibroleukin in human chronic viral hepatitis we studied patients with minimal and marked chronic hepatitis B. We detected robust expression of Fgl2/fibroleukin mRNA transcripts and protein in liver tissue isolated from patients with marked chronic hepatitis B. Fibrin deposition was strongly associated with Fgl2/fibroleukin expression. Collectively, these data indicate a critical role for Fgl2/fibroleukin in the pathophysiology of experimental and human viral hepatitis.","Marsden, Philip A; Ning, Qin; Fung, Laisum S; Luo, Xioping; Chen, Yue; Mendicino, Michael; Ghanekar, Anand; Scott, Jeremy A; Miller, Teresa; Chan, Camie W Y; Chan, Mathew W C; He, Wei; Gorczynski, Reginald M; Grant, David R; Clark, David A; Phillips, M James; Levy, Gary A",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12840059/,27

Therefore, persistent infection has the potential to amplify RV interference with research. As a step toward determining underlying mechanisms of persistence, we compared acute and persistent RV infections in infant euthymic and athymic rats inoculated oronasally with the University of Massachusetts strain of RV. Rats were assessed by virus isolation, in situ hybridization, and serology. Selected tissues also were analyzed by Southern blotting or immunohistochemistry. Virus was widely disseminated during acute infection in rats of both phenotypes, whereas vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) were the primary targets during persistent infection. The prevalence of virus-positive cells remained moderate to high in athymic rats through 8 weeks but decreased in euthymic rats by 2 weeks, coincident with seroconversion and perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells. Virus-positive pneumocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells also were detected through 8 weeks, implying that kidney and lung excrete virus during persistent infection. Viral mRNA was detected in SMC of both phenotypes through 8 weeks, indicating that persistent infection includes virus replication. However, only half of the SMC containing viral mRNA at 4 weeks stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein expressed in cycling cells. The results demonstrate that vasculotropism is a significant feature of persistent infection, that virus replication continues during persistent infection, and that host immunity reduces, but does not eliminate, infection.","Jacoby, R O; Johnson, E A; Paturzo, F X; Ball-Goodrich, L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11090184/,27

In rotavirus infected calves, IFN synthesis could be detected in the intestine and in the blood at the time of the diarrheic symptoms. A kinetic study on canulated calves suggested that systemic IFN is of intestinal origin. During TGEV infection (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus) of the newborn piglet, an acute disease which leads to 100% mortality, IFN was found at very high titres (1 000-20 000 u/ml) in the intestine, blood, urine and other organs. Intestinal IFN synthesis started some hours after the onset of diarrhea and was very transient, i.e. no more detectable two days p.i. Unlike the calf situation, IFN response in the serum lasted much longer suggesting an extra-intestinal origin. As a confirmation, piglets infected with cell-adapted strains had high levels of circulating IFN before the onset of intestinal IFN and of diarrhea. Virus and IFN were found in the lungs, due to a so far unrecognized tropism of TGEV for the macrophages. These findings indicate that the pathogenesis of TGEV is more complex than previously claimed.","La Bonnardière, C; Laude, H",Annales de recherches veterinaires.

We present a retrospective analysis of laparoscopic gastric bypass by comparing 2 techniques of circular-stapled gastrojejunostomy; Orvil(TM) and hand-made Orvil. METHODS Patients who were subjected to LRYGB without any concomitant procedures were observed over a 13-months period at the ""Obesity clinic of a University"". A total of 94 patients with morbid obesity were subjected to LRYGB. Gastrojejunostomy with circular-stapler and Orvil(TM) (CS-O) was performed to 58 patients and 36 patients underwent through the surgery with circular-stapler and hand-made Orvil (CS-HMO). Demographics, clinic, intraoperative data, postoperative complications, and the length of hospital stay were evaluated. RESULTS Ninety-four patients with mean age of 37.2 years and average body mass index of 58.1 kg/m(2) underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Laparoscopic surgeries of all patients were successful and major intraoperative complications were not reported. Demographic data and complication rates were similar in both groups. The operative time in group CS-HMO was significantly higher (P=0.03) when compared to group CS-O. There was no anastomotic leak in both groups. CONCLUSION The use of hand-made Orvil is a technically feasible and safe method for performing the gastrojejunostomy.

194171,Decolonizing Health Governance: A Uganda Case Study on the Influence of Political History on Community Participation.,2021-06-01,"RNA virus genomes contain cis-acting sequence and structural elements that participate in viral replication. We previously identified a bulged stem-loop secondary structure at the upstream end of the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of the genome of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This element, beginning immediately downstream of the nucleocapsid gene stop codon, was shown to be essential for virus replication. Other investigators discovered an adjacent downstream pseudoknot in the 3' UTR of the closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This pseudoknot was also shown to be essential for replication, and it has a conserved counterpart in every group 1 and group 2 coronavirus. In MHV and BCoV, the bulged stem-loop and pseudoknot are, in part, mutually exclusive, because of the overlap of the last segment of the stem-loop and stem 1 of the pseudoknot. This led us to hypothesize that they form a molecular switch, possibly regulating a transition occurring during viral RNA synthesis. We have now performed an extensive genetic analysis of the two components of this proposed switch. Our results define essential and nonessential components of these structures and establish the limits to which essential parts of each element can be destabilized prior to loss of function. Most notably, we have confirmed the interrelationship of the two putative switch elements. Additionally, we have identified a pseudoknot loop insertion mutation that appears to point to a genetic interaction between the pseudoknot and a distant region of the genome.","Goebel, Scott J; Hsue, Bilan; Dombrowski, Todd F; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14694098/,27

While its precise function is not clearly defined, E is a pivotal player in the morphogenesis of the virion envelope. Expression of the E protein alone results in its incorporation into vesicles that are released from cells, and the coexpression of the E protein with the membrane protein M leads to the assembly of coronavirus-like particles. We have previously generated E gene mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that had marked defects in viral growth and produced virions that were aberrantly assembled in comparison to wild-type virions. We have now been able to obtain a viable MHV mutant in which the entire E gene, as well as the nonessential upstream genes 4 and 5a, has been deleted. This mutant (Delta E) was obtained by a targeted RNA recombination method that makes use of a powerful host range-based selection system. The Delta E mutant produces tiny plaques with an unusual morphology compared to plaques formed by wild-type MHV. Despite its low growth rate and low infectious titer, the Delta E mutant is genetically stable, showing no detectable phenotypic changes after several passages. The properties of this mutant provide further support for the importance of E protein in MHV replication, but surprisingly, they also show that E protein is not essential.","Kuo, Lili; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663766/,27
199588,The Pearl River Declaration: a timely call for enhancing health security through fostering a regional one health collaboration in the Asia-Pacific,2020,"Apoptosis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of reovirus encephalitis and myocarditis in infected animals. Differences in apoptosis efficiency displayed by reovirus strains are linked to the viral mu1-encoding M2 gene segment. Studies using pharmacologic inhibitors of reovirus replication demonstrate that apoptosis induction by reovirus requires viral disassembly in cellular endosomes but not RNA synthesis. Since the mu1 protein functions to pierce endosomal membranes during this temporal window, these findings point to an important role for mu1 in activating signaling pathways that lead to apoptosis. To understand mechanisms used by mu1 to induce apoptosis, a panel of mu1 mutant viruses generated by reverse genetics was analyzed for the capacities to penetrate host cell membranes, activate proapoptotic signaling pathways, evoke cell death, and produce encephalitis in newborn mice. We found that single amino acid changes within the delta region of mu1 reduce the efficiency of membrane penetration. These mutations also diminish the capacities of reovirus to activate proapoptotic transcription factors NF-kappaB and IRF-3 and elicit apoptosis. Additionally, we observed that following intracranial inoculation, an apoptosis-deficient mu1 mutant is less virulent in newborn mice in comparison to the wild-type virus. These results indicate a critical function for the membrane penetration activity of mu1 in evoking prodeath signaling pathways that regulate reovirus pathogenesis.","Danthi, Pranav; Kobayashi, Takeshi; Holm, Geoffrey H; Hansberger, Mark W; Abel, Ty W; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959662/,27
199589,The Pearl River Declaration: a timely call for enhancing health security through fostering a regional one health collaboration in the Asia-Pacific,2020,"The envelope glycoproteins of the mammalian type C retroviruses consist of two subunits, a surface (SU) protein and a transmembrane (TM) protein. SU binds to the viral receptor and is thought to trigger conformational changes in the associated TM protein that ultimately lead to the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. For Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV), the envelope protein probably exists as a trimer. We have previously demonstrated that the coexpression of envelope proteins that are individually defective in either the SU or TM subunits can lead to functional complementation (Y. Zhao et al., J. Virol. 71:6967-6972, 1997). We have now extended these studies to investigate the abilities of a panel of fusion-defective TM mutants to complement each other. This analysis identified distinct complementation groups within TM, with implications for interactions between different regions of TM in the fusion process. In viral particles, the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the MoMuLV TM (the R peptide) are cleaved by the viral protease, resulting in an increased fusogenicity of the envelope protein. We have examined the consequences of R peptide cleavage for the different TM fusion mutants and have found that this enhancement of fusogenicity can only occur in cis to certain of the TM mutants. These results suggest that R peptide cleavage enhances the fusogenicity of the envelope protein by influencing the interaction of two distinct regions in the TM ectodomain.","Zhao, Y; Zhu, L; Benedict, C A; Chen, D; Anderson, W F; Cannon, P M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9620993/,27

Veterans are a highly trauma-exposed population, and VHA has long offered effective telemental health services. Natural disasters and pandemics like COVID-19 are known to be traumatic. Those with preexisting trauma exposure and mental health conditions are often at greater risk than the general population for long-term adverse health sequelae. Application of trauma-informed principles to telehealth care is critical and timely. Observations Trauma-focused care (including telemental health) refers to evidence-based treatment models that directly facilitate recovery from trauma-related conditions like posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite the widespread availability of trauma-focused treatment in VHA, not all veterans chose to engage in it. In contrast, trauma-informed care (TIC) is a global, ""universal precautions"" approach to providing strengths-based, collaborative quality medical care in any discipline or location. In this article the authors, all primary care and mental health clinicians at VHA, advocate for the application of the 6 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration principles of trauma-informed care to telehealth. Using examples from telehealth research conducted in trauma-exposed patient populations, we illustrate the characteristics of telehealth that are well suited to delivery of trauma-informed care and suggest readily applicable strategies that can be used across disciplines including primary care and medical/surgical specialties. A primary care patient case scenario is included to illustrate how telehealth visits can be trauma-informed. Conclusions Telehealth expansion has occurred nationally out of necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trauma-informed virtual care has the potential to ensure and even expand continuity of medical care by fostering safe and collaborative interactions between patients and the health care team.","Gerber, Megan R; Elisseou, Sadie; Sager, Zachary S; Keith, Jessica A","Federal practitioner : for the health care professionals of the VA, DoD, and PHS",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908333/,27
199618,Food Insecurity During COVID-19: An Acute Crisis With Long-Term Health Implications,2020,"The detection of viral pathogens is of critical importance in biology, medicine, and agriculture. Unfortunately, existing techniques to screen for a broad spectrum of viruses suffer from severe limitations. To facilitate the comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in a given biological setting, we have developed a genomic strategy for highly parallel viral screening. The cornerstone of this approach is a long oligonucleotide (70-mer) DNA microarray capable of simultaneously detecting hundreds of viruses. Using virally infected cell cultures, we were able to efficiently detect and identify many diverse viruses. Related viral serotypes could be distinguished by the unique pattern of hybridization generated by each virus. Furthermore, by selecting microarray elements derived from highly conserved regions within viral families, individual viruses that were not explicitly represented on the microarray were still detected, raising the possibility that this approach could be used for virus discovery. Finally, by using a random PCR amplification strategy in conjunction with the microarray, we were able to detect multiple viruses in human respiratory specimens without the use of sequence-specific or degenerate primers. This method is versatile and greatly expands the spectrum of detectable viruses in a single assay while simultaneously providing the capability to discriminate among viral subtypes.","Wang, David; Coscoy, Laurent; Zylberberg, Maxine; Avila, Pedro C; Boushey, Homer A; Ganem, Don; DeRisi, Joseph L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12429852/,27
202546,How to Keep the United States in the Who: Immediate Withdrawal Would Be a Global Health and a Legal Disaster,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the spread of which has led to a pandemic. An effective preventive vaccine against this virus is urgently needed. As an essential step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to engage with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells1,2. Here we show that a recombinant vaccine that comprises residues 319-545 of the RBD of the spike protein induces a potent functional antibody response in immunized mice, rabbits and non-human primates (Macaca mulatta) as early as 7 or 14 days after the injection of a single vaccine dose. The sera from the immunized animals blocked the binding of the RBD to ACE2, which is expressed on the cell surface, and neutralized infection with a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Notably, vaccination also provided protection in non-human primates to an in vivo challenge with SARS-CoV-2. We found increased levels of RBD-specific antibodies in the sera of patients with COVID-19. We show that several immune pathways and CD4 T lymphocytes are involved in the induction of the vaccine antibody response. Our findings highlight the importance of the RBD domain in the design of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and provide a rationale for the development of a protective vaccine through the induction of antibodies against the RBD domain.","Yang, Jingyun; Wang, Wei; Chen, Zimin; Lu, Shuaiyao; Yang, Fanli; Bi, Zhenfei; Bao, Linlin; Mo, Fei; Li, Xue; Huang, Yong; Hong, Weiqi; Yang, Yun; Zhao, Yuan; Ye, Fei; Lin, Sheng; Deng, Wei; Chen, Hua; Lei, Hong; Zhang, Ziqi; Luo, Min; Gao, Hong; Zheng, Yue; Gong, Yanqiu; Jiang, Xiaohua; Xu, Yanfeng; Lv, Qi; Li, Dan; Wang, Manni; Li, Fengdi; Wang, Shunyi; Wang, Guanpeng; Yu, Pin; Qu, Yajin; Yang, Li; Deng, Hongxin; Tong, Aiping; Li, Jiong; Wang, Zhenling; Yang, Jinliang; Shen, Guobo; Zhao, Zhiwei; Li, Yuhua; Luo, Jingwen; Liu, Hongqi; Yu, Wenhai; Yang, Mengli; Xu, Jingwen; Wang, Junbin; Li, Haiyan; Wang, Haixuan",Nature,,27

It is a system oriented approach to point out the main influencing factors on the development of shredder plants in scrap and metal recycling. Those factors are being merged into a superordinate system concept used to support strategic management decisions regarding future investments in the waste treatment sector.Under the given legal circumstances, the shredder process itself has to be resource-friendly, energy- and cost-efficient while still following the stated emission limit values.Therefore, the conceptual focus lies in the argumentation and evaluation of technical challenges as a major result of the implementation of national and international legal terms in the age of volatile market conditions, present recession, and value decline in prematerial compositions. The system concept is the result of a research project from October 2016 to December 2019â¯at the TSR Recycling GmbH & Co. KG, Lünen, Germany.The concept itself forms a base for the development of plant technology in other metal recycling fields, such as e­waste recycling. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the model is extended to other and further influencing factors and helps to understand the short lifespan of theoretical modelling within the field of scrap metal recycling.","Kraffczyk, Torben; Pomberger, Roland",Berg Huttenmannische Monatshefte,,27

Quaternary ammonium compounds have been demonstrated to have antiviral effects and may be of use against SARS-CoV-2 infections. DESIGN: In this double-blind, single-center study, we enrolled patients with positive PCR test and/or CT findings for COVID-19. The participants of each group were randomly assigned to Diphenhydramine Compound (Diphenhydramine + Ammonium Chloride) plus standard of care or to Diphenhydramine alone and standard of care groups. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes include viral burden, clinical status, assessed by a 5-point ordinal scale, and length of stay in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included in the trial, 60 of which were assigned to Ammonium Chloride group. The primary endpoint was not statistically different between the two groups (HR: 3.02 (95% CI, 0.57-16.06; p = 0.195)). Recovery time and viral burden was significantly lower in Ammonium Chloride group corresponding to odds ratios of 1.8 (95% CI, 1.15-2.83; p = 0.01) and 7.90 (95% CI, 1.62-14.17; p = 0.014), respectively.

METHODS: Eleven subjects in the HSCT group and seven age-matched non-training controls (CON) were recruited. The HSCT group trained 3 times per week for 8â¯weeks, while CON performed no formal training. One eye of each subject in both groups was imaged at baseline and at an 8-week follow-up, using a Retinal Function Imager to measure retinal blood flow (RBF). Retinal tissue perfusion (RTP) was calculated as RBF divided by the corresponding tissue volume. Cognitive function was assessed during both visits using the NIH Toolbox Fluid Cognition Battery. RESULTS: RTP was 2.99 ± 0.91â¯nl·s-1·mm-3 (mean ± SD) at baseline and significantly increased to 3.77 ± 0.86â¯nl·s-1·mm-3 after training (P < 0.001) in the HSCT group, reflecting an increase of 26%. In the HSCT group, the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test (PAT) and Fluid Cognition Composite Score (FCS) were significantly increased after HSCT (P = 0.01). Furthermore, the changes in Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (FLNK) were positively correlated to increases in RTP (r = 0.80, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective study to demonstrate that the increased RTP after HSCT was related to improved cognition in cognitively-normal elders, indicating RTP could be an imaging marker for monitoring cognitive changes due to physical activity in the elderly.","Zhang, Juan; Strand, Keri; Totillo, Matthew; Chen, Qi; Signorile, Joseph F; Jiang, Hong; Wang, Jianhua",Exp Gerontol,,27

223272,When Blackness Does Not Fade After a Pandemic: An Appeal to Acknowledge the Unequal Burden of Social Isolation,2020,"The world is experiencing one of the most difficult moments in history with the COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus. Virus infectivity is mediated by the binding of Spike transmembrane glycoprotein to specific protein receptors present on cell host surface. Spike is a homotrimer that emerges from the virion, each monomer containing two subunits named S1 and S2, which are related to cell recognition and membrane fusion, respectively. S1 is subdivided in domains S1A (or NTD) and S1B (or RBD), with experimental and in silico studies suggesting that the former binds to sialic acid-containing glycoproteins, such as CD147, whereas the latter binds to ACE2 receptor. Recent findings indicate that the ABO blood system modulates susceptibility and progression of infection, with type-A individuals being more susceptible to infection and/or manifestation of a severe condition. Seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this susceptibility, we carried out an extensive bibliographic survey on the subject. Based on this survey, we hypothesize that the correlation between the ABO blood system and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection can be presumably explained by the modulation of sialic acid-containing receptors distribution on host cell surface induced by ABO antigens through carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions, which could maximize or minimize the virus Spike protein binding to the host cell. This model could explain previous sparse observations on the molecular mechanism of infection and can direct future research to better understand of COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Silva-Filho, José Caetano; Melo, Cynthia Germoglio Farias de; Oliveira, Janaína Lima de",Med.

We conducted two nationwide surveys in the United States (n = 2931) and China (n = 2793) assessing volunteers' and health workers' levels of mental distress and happiness. In spite of data being collected at different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak and across two different cultures, the results converged. Volunteers and health workers reported higher mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatization) than the comparison group. However, volunteers and health workers also reported more happiness than the comparison group. More importantly, in a follow-up in China (n = 1914) one month later, health workers still reported heightened happiness but were no longer more distressed than the comparison group. The changes in distress were partially mediated by happiness at the first time point, pointing to the potential role of happiness in coping with distress. In sum, the emotional landscape of volunteers and health workers was complicated-they experienced higher distress but also higher happiness than comparison groups. Future research would do well to include longer follow-up periods to examine how experiencing happiness during highly stressful situations predicts mental health over time.

Still, very little is known about the potential protective dietary factors for the prevention of infection and mortality due to COVID-19. Keeping in view the scarcity of literature/studies available, in this regards present study was undertaken to assess if there is any correlation between mean levels of Vitamin D in various Asia Pacific countries with the infection and mortality caused by COVID-19. We collected data for mean levels of Vitamin D for 37 Asia Pacific countries for which we have also got the data regarding the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. The mean levels of Vitamin D were found to have a significant association with the number of cases/million(r = - 0.394, p value = 0.016) and a weak association with the number of deaths/ million (r = - 0.280, p value = 0.093) due to COVID-19. In conclusion, we found a significant relationship between Vitamin D levels with the number of COVID-19 cases. So further clinical trial/study with a large sample size is needed to elucidate the protective role of Vitamin D in COVID-19.","Yadav, Dharmveer; Birdi, Amandeep; Tomo, Sojit; Charan, Jaykaran; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Sharma, Praveen",Indian J Clin Biochem,,27

236990,Fuzzy Matching for Symptom Detection in Tweets: Application to Covid-19 During the First Wave of the Pandemic in France,2021,"Select single-nucleotide variants in planar cell polarity (PCP) genes are associated with increased risk for neural tube defects (NTDs). However, whether copy number variants (CNVs) in PCP genes contribute to NTDs is unknown. Considering that CNVs are implicated in several human developmental disorders, we hypothesized that CNVs in PCP genes may be causative factors to human NTDs. DNA from umbilical cord tissues of NTD-affected fetuses and parental venous blood samples were collected. We performed a quantitative analysis of copy numbers of all exon regions in the VANGL1, VANGL2, CELSR1, SCRIB, DVL2, DVL3, and PTK7 genes using a CNVplex assay. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was carried out to confirm the results of CNV analysis. As a result, 16 CNVs were identified among the NTDs. Of these CNVs, 5 loci were identified in 11 NTD probands with CNVs involving DVL2 (exons 1-15), VANGL1 (exons 1-7, exon 8), and VANGL2 (exons 5-8, exons 7 and 8). One CNV (DVL2 exons 1-15) was a duplication and the remaining 15 CNVs were deletions. Eleven CNVs were confirmed by qPCR. One de novo CNV in VANGL1 and one DVL2 were detected from two cases. Compared with unaffected control populations in 1000 Genome, ExAC, MARRVEL, DGV, and dbVar databases, the frequencies of de novo deletion in VANGL1 (1.14%) and de novo duplication in DVL2 (0.57%) were significantly higher in our NTD subjects (p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that de novo CNVs in PCP genes, notably deletions in VANGL1 and gains in DVL2, could contribute to the risk of NTDs.","Tian, Tian; Lei, Yunping; Chen, Yongyan; Guo, Yinnan; Jin, Lei; Finnell, Richard H; Wang, Linlin; Ren, Aiguo",Neurogenetics,,27
238441,Randomization of Clinical Trial Participants via an Integrated Web Service,2021,"A series of crises, culminating with COVID-19, shows that going Beyond GDP is urgently necessary. Social and environmental degradation are consequences of emphasizing GDP as a measure of progress. This degradation created the conditions for the COVID-19 pandemic and limited the efficacy of counter-measures. Additionally, rich countries did not fare the pandemic much better than poor ones. COVID-19 thrived on inequalities and a lack of cooperation. In this article we leverage on defensive growth models to explain the complex relationships between these factors, and we put forward the idea of neo-humanism, a cultural movement grounded on evidence from quality-of-life studies. The movement proposes a new culture leading towards a socially and environmentally sustainable future. Specifically, neo-humanism suggests that prioritizing well-being by, for instance, promoting social relations, would benefit the environment, enable collective action to address public issues, which in turn positively affects productivity and health, among other behavioral outcomes, and thereby instills a virtuous cycle. Arguably, such a society would have been better endowed to cope with COVID-19, and possibly even prevented the pandemic. Neo-humanism proposes a world in which the well-being of people comes before the well-being of markets, in which promoting cooperation and social relations represents the starting point for better lives, and a peaceful and respectful coexistence with other species on Earth.","Sarracino, Francesco; O'Connor, Kelsey J.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.00556v1.pdf,27
239439,An Evaluation of an Experiential Learning Program in Global and Indigenous Health: The University of Manitoba's Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Scholarship Program,2020,"A newly identified virus appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 presents similarities with two previous coronavirus pandemics, MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) and SARS-CoV, concerning phylogenetic origin, structural composition, and clinical symptoms, thus, leading to common pathogenic mechanisms. The purpose of this review is to declare the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of COVID-19 by comparing its effect on SARS-CoV and MERS cases. Increased levels of IL-6 comprise the key for the stimulation of cytokine storm and the progression of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 cases. Especially, in COVID-19 patients, the overactivation of NF-k&#914;, which is caused by the binding of coronavirus spike protein S to alveolar epithelial cells, up-regulates IL-6 and promotes its systematic circulation, causing alveolar damage and extrapulmonary injury. Additionally, IL-6 can be used to evaluate respiratory failure and identify asymptomatic patients. Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal antibody which blocks IL-6 signaling, comprises a remedial option against COVID-19. TCZ improves oxygenation, reduces fever, and decreases levels of IL-6. IL-6 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of cytokine storm and the progression of COVID-19 and may be used as a therapeutic target against COVID-19. However, further research is needed concerning the relation of IL-6 in COVID-19 cases and more clinical trials are required to declare TCZ as a treatment option.","Giannakodimos, Ilias; Gkountana, Georgia-Vasiliki; Lykouras, Dimosthenis; Karkoulias, Kiriakos; Tsakas, Sotiris",Curr. med. chem,,27

We proposed to perform the diagnosis of the functionality of institutionalized elderly people in Portalegre city. We developed a quantitative, descriptive and transversal study with the application of three evaluation instruments (Elderly Nursing Core Set, Mini-Mental State Examination and Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS)). The sample consisted of 89 elderly people, with an average age of 86.6 years-old, most of them are female (71.9%), widowed (77,5%) and illiterate (51.7%). The average of years of institutionalization was 3.5. 45.3% showed cognitive deterioration, and 50% showed moderate to severe deficits on the BDS. It was also found that 7% of the older people had low weight and 79.4% were overweight. It was also found that 7% of them had low weight and 79.4% were overweight. 37% reported they have pain and more than 52% presented moderate to complete disability in daily life activities such as walking, washing, caring for body parts, excretion processes and dressing. However, less than 26% presented some deficiency in eating. Regarding environmental factors 88% of the elderly people reported having some kind of support from family and friends. We concluded that the sample presents functional deficits, including considered cognitive deficiencies, requiring intervention. Considering that the evaluation presented here was made before the pandemic period caused by Covid-19, it is important to re-evaluate this sample after the restrictions of social conviviality to assess the effect of the pandemic on functionality and rethink the model of care for the institutionalized elderly people. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Arco, H.; Pedro, A.; Pinho, L.; Proença, A.","3rd International Workshop on Gerontechnology, IWoG 2020",,27

240801,Health City: Transforming health and driving economic development,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Although use of telemedicine for the treatment of opioid use disorders (Tele-OUD) is growing, there is limited research on how it is actually being deployed in treatment. We explored how health centers across the U.S. are using tele-OUD in treatment as well as reasons for nonadoption. METHODS: We used the 2018 SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator database and literature review to create a sample of community mental health centers and federally qualified health centers with telemental health services. From this list of health centers, we ued maximum diversity sampling to identify and recruit health center leaders to participate in semistructured interviews. We used inductive and deductive approaches to develop site summaries. RESULTS: Twenty-two health centers from 14 different states participated. Of these, 8 offered tele-OUD. Among centers with tele-OUD, medication management was the most common service provided via video. Typically, health centers offered telemedicine visits after an initial, in-person visit with a waivered (prescribing) provider. Some programs only offered counseling via telemedicine. Leading barriers to treatment that tele-OUD program representatives mentioned included regulations on the prescribing of controlled substances, including buprenorphine, and difficulties in sending lab results to distant (prescribing) providers. Nonadopters reported not offering tele-OUD due to regulations in controlled substance prescribing, complexities and regulatory barriers to offering group visits, and the belief that in-person OUD services were meeting patient need. CONCLUSIONS: Tele-OUD is being deployed in a variety of ways. Describing current delivery models can inform strategies to promote and implement tele-OUD to combat the opioid epidemic.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Huskamp, Haiden A",J Subst Abuse Treat,,27

243701,Black US Residents’ Views on Health Policy—Implications for the 2020 Election,2020,"The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) as a routine treatment in stroke patients is still controversial. The efficacy and safety of DAPT may vary with different regiments, initiating treatment time and race. Our study assessed the efficacy and safety of DAPT in patients with stroke and to determine the factors influencing the efficacy and safety of DAPT. Relevant studies published up to May 2019 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library. Randomized controlled trials comparing DAPT with mono antiplatelet therapy (MAPT) for stroke secondary prevention were included. The primary endpoints were stroke recurrence, ischemic stroke recurrence and all-cause death. Subgroup analysis was made according to regiment, initiating treatment time and race. Eighteen studies (n=33353) were included. Comparing with MAPT, short-term DAPT reduced stroke recurrence (RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.60-0.77) and ischemic stroke recurrence (RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but increased major bleeding (RR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.11-2.98). Long-term DAPT had no superiority compared with MAPT. Aspirin plus clopidogrel comparing with aspirin and early initiating treatment time comparing with MAPT decreased stroke recurrence (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.83; RR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.61-0.78) and ischemic stroke recurrence ( RR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.64-0.79; RR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.77) but also increased major bleeding (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.38-2.09; RR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.07-2.85). DAPT reduced stroke and ischemic stroke recurrence in non-Asian group but only reduced ischemic stroke recurrence in Asian group. As stroke secondary prevention, short-term DAPT rather than long-term DAPT could be a better choice. Patients could benefit more from aspirin plus clopidogrel or given DAPT within 72 h after symptoms onset. Race may be a factor influencing the efficacy of DAPT.","Fu-Sang, Wang; Xiao-Han, Zheng; Yang, Zou; Ting-Ting, Chen; Chao, Sun; Jing-Yi, Ling; Jian-Jun, Zou",Pharmazie,,27

While the innate immune response serves as the first line of defense, viral clearance requires activation of adaptive immunity, which employs B and T cells to provide sanitizing immunity. SARS-CoV-2 has a potent arsenal of mechanisms used to counter this adaptive immune response through processes, such as T cells depletion and T cell exhaustion. These phenomena are most often observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, pointing towards a link between T cell function and disease severity. Moreover, neutralizing antibody titers and memory B cell responses may be short lived in many SARS-CoV-2 patients, potentially exposing these patients to re-infection.

Leisure is a life-politic that hides: dominant lifestyles, harmful environmental engagement, and political regimes. But in the midst of pandemic, there are two enemies, at the mirco- and macro-level to the life of a person via leisure that are becoming exposed at this time: 1) Person to Person; and, 2) The State to Person. With the coronavirus pandemic, it reveals a need to depart from a happiness and titillation orientation of leisure, and more a collective life-giving requisite in our research, instruction, and advocacy. For with COVID-19, leisure (as it is predominantly conceived) is the enemy.","Mowatt, Rasul A.",Leis. Sci.,,27
248778,When Stay-at-Home Orders Leave Victims Unsafe at Home: Exploring the Risk and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Three leading infectious disease experts in China were invited to share their bedside observations in the management of COVID-19 patients. Professor Taisheng Li was sent to Wuhan to provide frontline medical care. He depicts the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients. For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient.","Li, Taisheng; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Wenhong",Emerg Microbes Infect,,27
251614,Towards Transparency in the Selection of Published Health Utility Inputs in Cost-Utility Analyses: The Health Utility Application Tool (HAT),2021,"Introduction: Phosphate is a critical anion in maintaining cellular functions. Notably, most important use of phosphate is for ATP production. Thus, a reduction of phosphate levels is detrimental to every organ system. In this case, we describe a patient who presented with rhabdomyolysis caused by hypophosphatemia, which was worsened due to his DKA. Case: A 67 year old male with past medical history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gout, and prostate cancer diagnosed 1 year before presentation presented to the emergency department for complaints of 1 week of weakness, acutely manifested by the patient falling and being found unresponsive on the bathroom floor. He never lost a pulse and was transferred to a facility where he was found to have COVID-19 and labs concerning for diabetic ketoacidosis. He was then intubated for airway protection and transferred to a higher level of care facility. Upon admission into hospital, patient was found to be in septic shock with hypotension, febrile at 38.9°C and leukocytosis up to 15,000, and was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, an insulin drip, and fluid resuscitation. What was notable was his phosphorous level was below 1mg/dL, and rhabdomyolysis manifested with a CK level of around 40,000, and acute renal failure with oliguria and a creatinine of 5.45mg/dl. He also had a pH of 7.27, and a bicarb of 12. He was eventually started on CRRT due to need for dialysis while being hypotensive on pressors. He was kept in the ICU for 9 days where he was treated for multiple organ system failures including shock liver, NSTEMI, multiple ischemic strokes, and kidney failure. Eventually, the patient's family decided to pursue comfort care and stop all lifesaving measures on day 9 and the patient passed away that evening. Discussion: We discuss a rare case in which a patient with DM2 developed DKA, and as a result developed hypophosphatemia, thus causing rhabdomyolysis that required CRRT in a COVID-19 positive patient. Hypophosphatemic rhabdomyolysis induced by DKA is a rare complication not often seen, which makes the management difficult. Hypophosphatemia is usually managed with oral and IV replacement therapy. However, when treating the DKA, the insulin administered also causes the phosphate to move intracellular, thus further reducing serum concentration of phosphate. Our case highlights the difficulty with dealing with a rare complication of hypophosphatemia such as rhabdomyolysis and efforts used to manage such a patient.","Azeem, A.; Salat, H.; Haragsim, L.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,,27
252689,An Empirical Study on the Equity Performance of China's Health Insurance Companies During the COVID-19 Pandemic-Based on Cases of Dominant Listed Companies,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has changed health care rapidly and dramatically. OBJECTIVE: To provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on the pandemic's implications for psychiatric practice. METHODS: A rapid literature review was undertaken to identify scientific literature linking psychiatric outcomes and practice changes due to coronavirus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). A structured quality assessment was used to assess those articles reporting quantitative data. RESULTS: Fifty articles were identified for inclusion, but only 12 contained original data. Eleven of those twelve were rated as of weak quality. The literature described psychiatric sequelae of the coronavirus and related public health interventions through cross-sectional surveys among different populations; no studies include diagnostic or functional impairment data. Populations at risk include COVID-19 survivors, health care workers, the elderly, and those with preexisting psychiatric disease. Impacts on psychiatric practice were described, again without data on changes to quality or access of care. CONCLUSIONS: There is a quickly accumulating body of evidence on the psychiatric implications of coronavirus including psychological effects on the general public and at-risk subgroups. Similarly, psychiatric practice has witnessed substantial adaptation to the pandemic. However, there remain significant gaps in scientific knowledge. We suggest opportunities for consultation-liaison psychiatry to improve the understanding of the relationship between coronavirus and psychiatric care.","Cabrera, Maximilliam A; Karamsetty, Lakshmipriya; Simpson, Scott A",Psychosomatics,,27
252790,COVID-19: Could it serve as an opportunity to overcome public health challenges of the 21st century?,2020,"The aim of this paper is the imputation of missing data of COVID-19 hospitalized and intensive care curves in several Spanish regions. Taking into account that the curves of cases, deceases and recovered people are completely observed, a function-on-function regression model is proposed to estimate the missing values of the functional responses associated with hospitalized and intensive care curves. The estimation of the functional coefficient model in terms of principal components’ regression with the completely observed data provides a prediction equation for the imputation of the unobserved data for the response. An application with data from the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain is developed after properly homogenizing, registering and smoothing the data in a common interval so that the observed curves become comparable. Finally, Canonical Correlation Analysis is performed on the functional principal components to interpret the relationship between hospital occupancy rate and illness response variables.","Acal, Christian Escabias Manuel Aguilera Ana M.; Valderrama, Mariano J.",Mathematics,,27

In response, we developed SalivaDirect, which received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Methods: We simplified our saliva-based diagnostic test by (1) not requiring collection tubes with preservatives, (2) replacing nucleic acid extraction with a simple enzymatic and heating step, and (3) testing specimens with a dualplex qRT-PCR assay. Moreover, we validated SalivaDirect with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors to minimize supply chain issues. Findings: From our hospital cohort, we show a high positive agreement (94%) between saliva tested with SalivaDirect and nasopharyngeal swabs tested with a commercial qRT-PCR kit. In partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), we tested 3,779 saliva specimens from healthy individuals and detected low rates of invalid (0.3%) and false-positive (<0.05%) results. Conclusions: We demonstrate that saliva is a valid alternative to swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening and that SalivaDirect can make large-scale testing more accessible and affordable.

262571,Health Information Privacy Laws in the Digital Age: HIPAA Doesn't Apply,2021,"The spread of misinformation can cause social confusion. The authenticity of information on a social networking service (SNS) is unknown, and false information can be easily spread. Consequently, many studies have been conducted on methods to control the spread of misinformation on social networking sites. However, few studies have examined the impact of the spread of misinformation and its corrections on society. This study models the impact of the reduction of misinformation and the diffusion of corrective information on social disruption, and it identifies the features of this impact. In this study, we analyzed misinformation regarding the shortage of toilet paper during the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic, its corrections, and the excessive purchasing caused by this information. First, we analyze the amount of misinformation and corrective information spread on SNS, and we create a regression model to estimate the real-world impact of misinformation and its correction. This model is used to analyze the change in real-world impact corresponding to the change in the diffusion of misinformation and corrective information. Our analysis shows that the corrective information was spread to a much greater extent than the misinformation. In addition, our model reveals that the corrective information was what caused the excessive purchasing behavior. As a result of our further analysis, we found that the amount of diffusion of corrective information required to minimize the impact on the real world depends on the amount of the diffusion of misinformation.","Iizuka, Ryusuke; Toriumi, Fujio; Nishiguchi, Mao; Takano, Masanori; Yoshida, Mitsuo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09665v1.pdf,27

The sensitivity of different experiments depends strongly on the ALP mass and its couplings to leptons and photons. For ALPs that can be resonantly produced, the sensitivity of three-body decays such as µâ3e and &#964;â3µ exceeds by many orders of magnitude that of radiative decays like µâeÎ³ and &#964;âµÎ³. Searches for these two types of processes are therefore highly complementary. We discuss experimental constraints on ALPs with a single dominant lepton-flavor-violating coupling. Allowing for one or more such couplings offers qualitatively new ways to explain the anomalies related to the magnetic moments of the muon or the electron. The explanation of both anomalies requires lepton-flavor-nonuniversal or lepton-flavor-violating ALP couplings.","Bauer, Martin; Neubert, Matthias; Renner, Sophie; Schnubel, Marvin; Thamm, Andrea",Phys Rev Lett,,27

Additional measures to protect patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19 that may be transmitted by the inhalation sedation system are discussed. The authors recommend minimal use of a N2O system during inhalation sedation in dentistry. In case of need, the practitioners should have more than one scavenger kit and nasal masks for each N2O/O2 mixer. Biologic barriers should be mounted between the scavenger's tubing and the central evacuation system. Strict cleansing and sterilization should be performed for all parts of the N2O system.

The fights have thus never stopped to prevent pandemics. Due to its acute outbreak, is generally susceptible to the population regardless of ages, so strict quarantine of the infections becomes the most effective means for the epidemic control, which has been proved in the prevention of other contagious diseases such as SARS and H1N1. The key strategy widely used to find infected and suspected patients is still the epidemiological tracking of confirmed cases. However, this may fail to identify infections especially when patients do not show any symptoms. Therefore, the approach to rapid, effective, and simple infection identification is essential to prevent the spread of a contagious disease. This paper proposes to leverage a social apps and Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) with Blockchain to effectively identify infections with privacy concern. Since people widely use social apps, a large scale of social data with geospatial information could be easily collected and kept on Blockchain with privacy preservation, which thus provides a framework of decentralized, tamper-proof, and privacy-preserved information sharing. With the support of GeoAI, which analyzes the spatial distribution of diseases from the shared data, we could study the influence factors based on spatial propagation of contagious diseases for infection identification.

With the growing numbers of community spread cases worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Like influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to be mainly transmitted by droplets and direct contact, and COVID-19 has a similar disease presentation to influenza. Here we present a case of influenza A and COVID-19 co-infection in a 60-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old man with ESRD on hemodialysis presented for worsening cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. The patient first developed a mild fever (37.8 °C) during hemodialysis 3 days prior to presentation and has been experiencing worsening flu-like symptoms, including fever of up to 38.6 °C, non-productive cough, generalized abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and liquid green diarrhea. He lives alone at home with no known sick contacts and denies any recent travel or visits to healthcare facilities other than the local dialysis center. Rapid flu test was positive for influenza A. Procalcitonin was elevated at 5.21 ng/mL with a normal white blood cell (WBC) count. Computed tomography (CT) chest demonstrated multifocal areas of consolidation and extensive mediastinal and hilar adenopathy concerning for pneumonia. He was admitted to the biocontainment unit of Nebraska Medicine for concerns of possible COVID-19 and was started on oseltamivir for influenza and vancomycin/cefepime for the probable bacterial cause of his pneumonia and diarrhea. Gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen panel and Clostridioides difficile toxin assay were negative. On the second day of admission, initial nasopharyngeal swab came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The patient received supportive care and resumed bedside hemodialysis in strict isolation, and eventually fully recovered from COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We presented a case of co-infection of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis patient. The possibility of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection should not be overlooked even when other viruses including influenza can explain the clinical symptoms, especially in high-risk patients.","Jing, Ran; Vunnam, Rama Rao; Schnaubelt, Elizabeth; Vokoun, Chad; Cushman-Vokoun, Allison; Goldner, David; Vunnam, Srinivas Rao",BMC Infect Dis,,27

His initial evaluation in the resuscitation room and treatments in the intensive care unit was performed under droplet and contact precaution with additional airborne protection using the N95 respirator mask. He was successfully treated in the intensive care unit with mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory support; and antiretroviral treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir. His total intensive care unit stay was 15 days and was discharged on hospital day 24. CONCLUSIONS: Strict infection control precautions are not always an easy task, especially under urgent care in an intensive care unit. However, severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, or another novel infectious disease, could present at any moment and would be a continuing challenge to pursue appropriate measures. We need to be well prepared to secure healthcare workers from exposure to infectious diseases and nosocomial spread, as well as to provide necessary intensive care.","Nakamura, Kazuha; Hikone, Mayu; Shimizu, Hiroshi; Kuwahara, Yusuke; Tanabe, Maki; Kobayashi, Mioko; Ishida, Takuto; Sugiyama, Kazuhiro; Washino, Takuya; Sakamoto, Naoya; Hamabe, Yuichi",J Infect Chemother,,27

295961,E-learning: a panacea during COVID-19 crisis,2021,"COVID-19 has driven several global offline communities to go online. Restrictions to the free movement of people in response to the coronavirus pandemic triggered a profound rethinking of jobs, products and services, and among them, the activities of religious communities, which are well consolidated in the offline sphere. In Spain, since the lockdown established by the government in March 2020, the Catholic Church has reinvented its activity, as all the churches and other places of worship have been closed. This constituted a considerable challenge, considering the history and dynamics of the institution. This paper aims to analyze how Catholicism, as one of the most consolidated offline communities, reworked its communication, going online in a matter of days. With this objective, researchers surveyed each and every one of the 70 Spanish dioceses, taking them as representatives of the global Catholic community in the country. Their responses are complemented with an in-depth interview with the Director of Communications at the Spanish Conference of Bishops. The results highlight the huge and unprecedented step towards the digitalization of the community through consistent, creative and efficient action. New methods, platforms and languages have been implemented, even broadening community membership. Despite an offline essence that is still detected in some decisions, this pandemic has brought a new communicative paradigm to the Spanish Catholic community. Digitalization has been consolidated whilst preserving the best aspects of direct contact and action.","Sabaté Gauxachs, Alba Albalad Aiguabella José María Diez Bosch Miriam",Religions,,27
296378,COVID-19 pandemic: report on the use of auriculotherapy to optimize emergency workers'health,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed social inequities that rival biological inequities in disease exposure and severity. Merely identifying some inequities without understanding all of them can lead to harmful misrepresentations and deepening disparities. Applying an 'equity lens' to bring inequities into focus without a vision to extinguish them is short-sighted. Interventions to address inequities should be as diverse as the pluralistic populations experiencing them. We present the first validated equity framework applied to COVID-19 that sheds light on the full spectrum of health inequities, navigates their sources and intersections, and directs ethically just interventions. The Equity Matrix also provides a comprehensive map to guide surveillance and research in order to unveil epidemiological uncertainties of novel diseases like COVID-19, recognising that inequities may exist where evidence is currently insufficient. Successfully applied to vaccines in recent years, this tool has resulted in the development of clear, timely and transparent guidance with positive stakeholder feedback on its comprehensiveness, relevance and appropriateness. Informed by evidence and experience from other vaccine-preventable diseases, this Equity Matrix could be valuable to countries across the social gradient to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by abating the spread of inequities. In the race to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, this urgently needed roadmap can effectively and efficiently steer global leadership towards equitable allocation with diverse strategies for diverse inequities. Such a roadmap has been absent from discussions on managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and is critical for our passage out of it.","Ismail, Shainoor J; Tunis, Matthew C; Zhao, Linlu; Quach, Caroline",,,27
296379,COVID-19 pandemic: report on the use of auriculotherapy to optimize emergency workers' health,2020,"BACKGROUND: To calculate hospital surge capacity, achieved via hospital provision interventions implemented for the emergency treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other patients through March to May 2020; to evaluate the conditions for admitting patients for elective surgery under varying admission levels of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We analysed National Health Service (NHS) datasets and literature reviews to estimate hospital care capacity before the pandemic (pre-pandemic baseline) and to quantify the impact of interventions (cancellation of elective surgery, field hospitals, use of private hospitals, deployment of former medical staff and deployment of newly qualified medical staff) for treatment of adult COVID-19 patients, focusing on general and acute (G&A) and critical care (CC) beds, staff and ventilators. RESULTS: NHS England would not have had sufficient capacity to treat all COVID-19 and other patients in March and April 2020 without the hospital provision interventions, which alleviated significant shortfalls in CC nurses, CC and G&A beds and CC junior doctors. All elective surgery can be conducted at normal pre-pandemic levels provided the other interventions are sustained, but only if the daily number of COVID-19 patients occupying CC beds is not greater than 1550 in the whole of England. If the other interventions are not maintained, then elective surgery can only be conducted if the number of COVID-19 patients occupying CC beds is not greater than 320. However, there is greater national capacity to treat G&A patients: without interventions, it takes almost 10,000 G&A COVID-19 patients before any G&A elective patients would be unable to be accommodated. CONCLUSIONS: Unless COVID-19 hospitalisations drop to low levels, there is a continued need to enhance critical care capacity in England with field hospitals, use of private hospitals or deployment of former and newly qualified medical staff to allow some or all elective surgery to take place.","McCabe, Ruth; Schmit, Nora; Christen, Paula; D039,; Aeth, Josh C; Løchen, Alessandra; Rizmie, Dheeya; Nayagam, Shevanthi; Miraldo, Marisa; Aylin, Paul; Bottle, Alex; Perez-Guzman, Pablo N; Ghani, Azra C; Ferguson, Neil M; White, Peter J; Hauck, Katharina",BMC Med,,27

300414,The UK's public health response to covid-19,2020,"COVID-19's second wave had a significant impact on India, on May 7, 2021, the largest daily recorded case count was a little more than 4 million, and it has since fallen. Although the number of new cases reported has dropped, during the third week of May 2021, India accounted for about 45% of new cases identified globally and around 34% of deaths. As India maintains its present level of stability, a new urgent threat has emerged in the form of coronavirus-associated mucormycosis. Mucormycosis, an acute and deadly fungal infection caused by Mucorales-related fungal species, is a fungal emergency with a particularly aggressive propensity for contiguous spread, associated with a poor prognosis if not properly and immediately identified, and treated. Mucormycosis, sometimes referred to as the ""black fungus,"" has increased more rapidly in India during the second wave of COVID-19 than during the first wave, with at least 14,872 cases as of May 28, 2021. Uncontrolled diabetic mellitus (DM) and other immunosuppressive diseases such as neutropenia and corticosteroid treatment have traditionally been identified as risk factors for mucormycosis. Therefore, the use of glucocorticoids or high doses of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxemia) should be avoided. In addition, drugs that target the immune pathway, such as tocilizumab, are not recommended without clear benefits.","Gupta, Gaurav; S, Roshan; Singh, Yogendra; Thangavelu, Lakshmi; Singh, Sachin Kumar; Dureja, Harish; Chellappan, Dinesh Kumar; Dua, Kamal",Drug dev. res,,27

In contrast, interferons are a crucial component of host antiviral immunity and can be directly suppressed by glucocorticoids. To investigate whether therapeutic interferons can compensate glucocorticoids-induced loss of antiviral immunity, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 387 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with quasi-random exposure to interferons and conditional exposure to glucocorticoids. Among patients receiving glucocorticoids, early interferon therapy was associated with earlier hospital discharge (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19-2.37) and symptom relief (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06-2.08), while these associations were insignificant among glucocorticoids nonusers. Early interferon therapy was also associated with lower prevalence of prolonged viral shedding (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.57) only among glucocorticoids users. Additionally, these associations were glucocorticoid cumulative dose- and timing-dependent. These findings reveal potential therapeutic synergy between interferons and glucocorticoids in COVID-19 that warrants further investigation.","Lu, Yingying; Liu, Feng; Tong, Gangling; Qiu, Feng; Song, Pinhong; Wang, Xiaolin; Zou, Xiafei; Wan, Deyun; Cui, Miao; Xu, Yunsheng; Zheng, Zhihua; Hong, Peng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,27

The targeting for APOGEE-2 is complex and has evolved with time. In this paper, we present the updates and additions to the initial targeting strategy for APOGEE-2N presented in Zasowski et al. (2017). These modifications come in two implementation modes: (i)""Ancillary Science Programs""competitively awarded to SDSS-IV PIs through proposal calls in 2015 and 2017 for the pursuit of new scientific avenues outside the main survey, and (ii) an effective 1.5-year expansion of the survey, known as the Bright Time Extension, made possible through accrued efficiency gains over the first years of the APOGEE-2N project. For the 23 distinct ancillary programs, we provide descriptions of the scientific aims, target selection, and how to identify these targets within the APOGEE-2 sample. The Bright Time Extension permitted changes to the main survey strategy, the inclusion of new programs in response to scientific discoveries or to exploit major new datasets not available at the outset of the survey design, and expansions of existing programs to enhance their scientific success and reach. After describing the motivations, implementation, and assessment of these programs, we also leave a summary of lessons learned from nearly a decade of APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 survey operations.

Among three potential candidates, originated from different components of $R_{ab}$ along the null vectors for the surface (i.e. $R_{ab}q^a_cl^b$, $R_{ab}l^al^b$ and $R_{ab}l^ak^b$ where $q_{ab}$ is the projector on the null surface and $l^a$, $k^a$ are null normal and corresponding auxiliary vector of it, respectively), the first one leads to Navier-Stokes like equation. Here we devote our investigation on the other two members. We find that $R_{ab}l^al^b$, which yields the evolution equation for expansion parameter corresponding to $l^a$ along itself, can be interpreted as a thermodynamic relation when integrated on the two dimensional transverse subspace of the null hypersurface along with a virtual displacement in the direction of $l^a$. Moreover for a stationary background the integrated version of it yields the general form of Smarr formula. Although this is more or less known in literature, but a similar argument for the evolution equation of the expansion parameter corresponding to $k^a$ along $l^a$, provided by $R_{ab}l^ak^b$, leads to a more convenient form of thermodynamic relation. In this analysis, contrary to earlier approaches, the identified thermodynamic entities come out to be in covariant forms and also are foliation independent. Hence these can be applied to any coordinate system adapted to the null hypersurface. Moreover, these results are not restricted to any specific parametrisation of $k^a$ and also $k^a$ need not be hypersurface orthogonal. In addition, here any particular dynamical equation for metric is not being explicitly used and therefore we feel that our results are solely based on the properties of the null surface.","Dey, Sumit; Majhi, Bibhas Ranjan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08221v1.pdf,27

320564,Health Information Sources and the Influenza Vaccination: The Mediating Roles of Perceived Vaccine Efficacy and Safety,2020,"Purpose: Limited data exist regarding volumetric trends and management of upper-extremity emergencies during periods of social restriction and duress, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We sought to study the effect of shelter-in-place orders on emergent operative upper-extremity surgery. Methods: All patients undergoing emergent and time-sensitive operations to the finger(s), hand, wrist, and forearm were tracked over an equal number of days before and after shelter-in-place orders at 2 geographically distinct Level I trauma centers. Surgical volume and resources, patient demographics, and injury patterns were compared before and after official shelter-in-place orders. Results: A total of 58 patients underwent time-sensitive or emergent operations. Mean patient age was 42 years; mean injury severity score was 9 and median American Society of Anesthesiologist score was 2. There was a 40% increase in volume after shelter-in-place orders, averaging 1.4 cases/d. Indications for surgery included high-energy closed fracture (60%), traumatic nerve injury (19%), severe soft tissue infection (15%), and revascularization of the arm, hand, or digit(s) (15%). High-risk behavior, defined as lawlessness, assault, and high-speed auto accidents, was associated with a significantly greater proportion of operations after shelter-in-place orders (40% vs 12.5%; P &lt; .05). Each institution dedicated an average of 3 inpatient beds and one intensive care unit–capable bed to upper-extremity care daily. Resources used included an average of 115 minutes of daily operating room time and 8 operating room staff or personnel per case. Conclusions: Hand and upper-extremity operative volume increased after shelter-in-place orders at 2 major Level I trauma centers across the country, demanding considerable hospital resources. The rise in volume was associated with an increase in high-risk behavior.

322435,Implications of the coronavirus on sales tax revenue and local government fiscal health,2021,"Testing during the COVID-19 pandemic has been crucial to public health surveillance and clinical care. Supply chain constraints—spanning limitations in testing kits, reagents, pipet tips, and swabs availability—have challenged the ability to scale COVID-19 testing. During the early months, sample collection kits shortages constrained planned testing expansions. In response, the University of Vermont Medical Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Vermont Department of Health Laboratory, Aspenti Health, and providers across Vermont including 16 area hospitals partnered to surmount these barriers. The primary objectives were to increase supply availability and manage utilization. Within the first month of Vermont’s stay-at-home order, the University of Vermont Medical Center laboratory partnered with College of Medicine to create in-house collection kits, producing 5000 per week. University of Vermont Medical Center reassigned 4 phlebotomists, laboratory educators, and other laboratory staff, who had reduced workloads, to participate (requiring a total of 5.3-7.6 full-time equivalent (FTE) during the period of study). By August, automation at a local commercial laboratory produced 22,000 vials of media in one week (reducing the required personnel by 1.2 FTE). A multisite, cross-institutional approach was used to manage specimen collection kit utilization across Vermont. Hospital laboratory directors, managers, and providers agreed to order only as needed to avoid supply stockpiles and supported operational constraints through ongoing validations and kit assembly. Throughout this pandemic, Vermont has ranked highly in number of tests per million people, demonstrating the value of local collaboration to surmount obstacles during disease outbreaks and the importance of creative allocation of resources to address statewide needs. © The Author(s) 2021.","Warrington, J.

322489,Ethical and Legal Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Are We Thinking About Rural Hospitals?,2020,"Human beings are currently experiencing a serious public health event. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), has infected about 3 million people worldwide and killed more than 200,000, most being the elderly or people with potential chronic diseases or in immunosuppressive states. According to big data analysis, there are many proteins homologous to or interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which, therefore, may not be the only receptor for the novel coronavirus; other receptors may also exist in host cells of different species. These potential receptors may also play an important role in the infection process of the novel coronavirus. The current study aimed to discover such key proteins or receptors and analyze the susceptibility of different animals to the novel coronavirus, in order to reveal the transmission process of the virus in cross-species infection. We analyzed the proteins coded by the ACE2 gene in different mammalian species and predicted their correlation and homology with the human ACE2 receptor. The major finding of our predictive analysis suggested ACE2 gene-encoded proteins to be highly homologous across mammals. Based on their high homology, their possibility of binding the spike-protein of SARS-CoV-2 is quite high and species such as Felis catus, Bos taurus, Rattus norvegicus etc. may be potential susceptible hosts; special monitoring is particularly required for livestock that are in close contact with humans. Our results might provide ideas for the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus pneumonia.","Cao, Ying; Sun, Yeping; Tian, Xiaodong; Bai, Zhihua; Gong, Yue; Qi, Jianxun; Liu, Di; Liu, Wenjun; Li, Jing",Front.

322517,"Trust, risk, and the challenge of information sharing during a health emergency",2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 and associated social distancing has presented challenges for individuals engaging in face-to-face mutual help groups (MHGs) such as Alcoholics Anonymous for alcohol use recovery. Online MHGs may be particularly appealing to individuals with limited access or inclination to attend in-person MHGs. We examined engagement within the popular ""StopDrinking"" online MHG, hypothesizing that engagement would increase due to demand for virtual peer support as COVID-19 social distancing progressed. METHODS: We collected publicly available engagement data for StopDrinking from February 19, 2018 through April 30, 2020 while considering March and April of 2020 as months initially impacted by voluntary or mandated COVID-19 social distancing. Using seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models, we predicted daily engagement for this social distancing time period based on all available engagement data collected before April 2020. Kalman filtering with 95% prediction limits was employed to define significant thresholds for observed data to reside within. RESULTS: All days of observed engagement in March and April 2020 were lower than corresponding predicted values. Observed engagement fell below the lower 95% prediction limit for 36% of days, with 15 days in March and 7 days in April having significantly lower than predicted engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively low activity on StopDrinking may signal broader population trends of problematic alcohol use and recovery disengagement during the initial COVID-19 social distancing timeframe. Continued investigation of online MHGs is needed to understand their potential for monitoring population health trends and to understand how such groups might support alcohol use recovery in contexts of crisis and isolation.","Colditz, Jason B; Rothenberger, Scott D; Liebschutz, Jane M; Rollman, Bruce L; Kraemer, Kevin L",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,27
322659,"The Case for a Temporary COVID-19 Income Tax Levy Now, During the Crisis",2020,"The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control (China CDC) has been identified as a novel Betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). A computational approach was adopted to identify multiepitope vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on S, N and M proteins being able to elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses. In this study, the sequence of the virus was obtained from NCBI database and analyzed with in silico tools such as NetMHCpan, IEDB, BepiPred, NetCTL, Tap transport/proteasomal cleavage, Pa3P, GalexyPepDock, I-TASSER, Ellipro and ClusPro. To identify the most immunodominant regions, after analysis of population coverage and epitope conservancy, we proposed three different constructs based on linear B-cell, CTL and HTL epitopes. The 3D structure of constructs was assessed to find discontinuous B-cell epitopes. Among CTL predicted epitopes, S257-265, S603-611 and S360-368, and among HTL predicted epitopes, N167-181, S313-330 and S1110-1126 had better MHC binding rank. We found one putative CTL epitope, S360-368 related to receptor-binding domain (RBD) region for S protein. The predicted epitopes were non-allergen and showed a high quality of proteasomal cleavage and Tap transport efficiency and 100% conservancy within four different clades of SARS-CoV-2. For CTL and HTL epitopes, the highest population coverage of the world's population was calculated for S27-37 with 86.27% and for S196-231, S303-323, S313-330, S1009-1030 and N328-349 with 90.33%, respectively. We identified overall 10 discontinuous B-cell epitopes for three multiepitope constructs. All three constructs showed strong interactions with TLRs 2, 3 and 4 supporting the hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to TLRs 2, 3 and 4 like other Coronaviridae families. These data demonstrated that the novel designed multiepitope constructs can contribute to develop SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine candidates. The in vivo studies are underway using several vaccination strategies.","Khairkhah, Niloofar; Aghasadeghi, Mohammad Reza; Namvar, Ali; Bolhassani, Azam",PLoS One,,27
322827,A Report on Statistics of an Online Self-screening Platform for COVID-19 and Its Effectiveness in Iran,2021,"BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 protein subunit vaccines are being evaluated by multiple manufacturers to fill the need for low-cost, easy to scale, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines for global access. Vaccine candidates relying on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been the focus of our development program. In this paper, we report on the generation of the RBD203-N1 yeast expression construct, which produces a recombinant protein that when formulated with alum and the TLR-9 agonist, CpG1826 elicits a robust immune response and protection in mice. MethodThe RBD203-N1 antigen was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris X33. After fermentation at the 5 L scale, the protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography. The purified protein was characterized biophysically and biochemically, and after its formulation, the immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated in mice. Results, Conclusions, and SignificanceThe RBD203-N1 production process yielded 492.9 {+/-} 3.0 mg/L of protein in the fermentation supernatant. A two-step purification process produced a >96% pure protein with a recovery rate of 55 {+/-} 3% (total yield of purified protein: 270.5 {+/-} 13.2 mg/L fermentation supernatant). The protein was characterized as a homogeneous monomer with well-defined secondary structure, thermally stable, antigenic, and when adjuvanted on alum and CpG, it was immunogenic and induced robust levels of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. These characteristics show that this vaccine candidate is well suited for technology transfer with feasibility of its transition into the clinic to evaluate its immunogenicity and safety in humans.","Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Pollet, Jeroen; Strych, Ulrich; Lee, Jungsoon; Liu, Zhuyun; Kundu, Rakhi Tyagi; Versteeg, Leroy; Villar, Maria Jose; Adhikari, Rakesh; Wei, Junfei; Poveda, Cristina; Keegan, Brian; Bailey, Aaron Oakley; Chen, Yi-Lin; Gillespie, Portia M; Kimata, Jason T; Zhan, Bin; Hotez, Peter J; Bottazzi, Maria Elena",,,27

Screening of potential antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 depend on in vitro experiments, which are based on the quantification of the virus titer. Here, we used virus-induced cytopathic effects (CPE) in brightfield microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected monolayers to quantify the virus titer. Images were classified using deep transfer learning (DTL) that fine-tune the last layers of a pre-trained Resnet18 (ImageNet). To exclude toxic concentrations of potential drugs, the network was expanded to include a toxic score (TOX) that detected cell death (CPETOXnet). With this analytic tool, the inhibitory effects of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and emetine were validated. Taken together we developed a simple method and provided open access implementation to quantify SARS-CoV-2 titers and drug toxicity in experimental settings, which may be adaptable to assays with other viruses. The quantification of virus titers from brightfield images could accelerate the experimental approach for antiviral testing.","Werner, Julia; Kronberg, Raphael M; Stachura, Pawel; Ostermann, Philipp N; Müller, Lisa; Schaal, Heiner; Bhatia, Sanil; Kather, Jakob N; Borkhardt, Arndt; Pandyra, Aleksandra A; Lang, Karl S; Lang, Philipp A",Viruses,,27

325079,Student-Led Initiatives' Potential in the COVID-19 Response in Iran,2020,"BACKGROUND: The elderly are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore need to adopt long-term social distancing measures. The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly. METHODS: An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine. RESULTS: The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1. Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.","Maggi, Gianpaolo; Baldassarre, Ivana; Barbaro, Andrea; Cavallo, Nicola Davide; Cropano, Maria; Nappo, Raffaele; Santangelo, Gabriella",Psychogeriatrics,,27

330336,The Raven,2020,"During the Corona crisis measures were taken to avoid the spread of the virus, and one of the most important was to 'keep sufficient distance'. In this period cyclists were facilitated in distancing by the widening of cycle paths, or the use of car lanes. The Corona measures also affected intersection control, since one of the principles of signalizing is based on clustering of traffic. The settings of the control take into account the way cyclists tend to cluster close together at the stop line, so for optimal control, if the clustering changes, the control should be adapted as well. This paper presents measures for 'Corona-safe' intersection control for cyclists, and discusses the effect of the measures and their (dis)advantages. Further it was investigated how some municipalities used these measures and conveyed about it in the media and how these measures were received by the public. The measures can be divided in two groups: detection and timing. For the municipalities considered, the least popular measures concerned the detection methods, such as adaptations in use, or type, of push button, since the negative aspects can be large (effect on throughput and costs). More popular were changes in the timing of the control, the most conveyed measures being more frequent and longer green for cyclists. The acceptance of the measures by the public (determined via reactions on social media) is mixed, some are positive about the improved control, others negative (effect on car traffic or costs). The most common reactions are general complaints about intersection control, and about cyclists behaviour. For future use the measure 'more frequent green' is most suitable, permitted cyclists are detected to support the acceptance of the control. Also bicycle apps can be applied, since these results in more comfort and have limited negative effects.","Salomons, A. Maria",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01488v1.pdf,27

While struggling with the unknown nature of this novel coronavirus, many researchers and groups attempted to project the progress of the pandemic using empirical or mechanistic models, each one having its drawbacks. The first confirmed cases were announced early in March, and since then, serious containment measures have taken place in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we present a different approach, a Bayesian negative binomial multilevel model with mixed effects, for the projection of the COVID-19 pandemic and apply this model to the Turkish case. The model source code is available at https://github.com/kansil/covid-19. We predicted confirmed daily cases and cumulative numbers for June 6th to June 26th with 80%, 95% and 99% prediction intervals (PI). RESULTS: Our projections showed that if we continued to comply with measures and no drastic changes are seen in diagnosis or management protocols, the epidemic curve would tend to decrease in this time interval. Also, the predictive validity analysis suggests that proposed model projections should be in the 95% PI band for the first 12 days of the projections. CONCLUSION: We expect that drastic changes in the course of the COVID-19 in Turkey will cause the model to suffer in predictive validity, and this can be used to monitor the epidemic. We hope that the discussion on these projections and the limitations of the epidemiological forecasting will be beneficial to the medical community, and policy-makers.","Acar, Aybar Can; Er, Ahmet Görkem; Burduroglu, Hüseyin Cahit; Sülkü, Seher Nur; Aydin Son, Yesim; Akin, Levent; Ünal, Serhat",,,27

Treatment priority is often determined by the symptom severity based on first assessment. However, clinical observation suggests that some patients with mild symptoms may quickly deteriorate. Hence, it is crucial to identify patient early deterioration to optimize treatment strategy. To this end, we develop an early-warning system with deep learning techniques to predict COVID-19 malignant progression. Our method leverages CT scans and the clinical data of outpatients and achieves an AUC of 0.920 in the single-center study. We also propose a domain adaptation approach to improve the generalization of our model and achieve an average AUC of 0.874 in the multicenter study. Moreover, our model automatically identifies crucial indicators that contribute to the malignant progression, including Troponin, Brain natriuretic peptide, White cell count, Aspartate aminotransferase, Creatinine, and Hypersensitive C-reactive protein.","Fang, Cong; Bai, Song; Chen, Qianlan; Zhou, Yu; Xia, Liming; Qin, Lixin; Gong, Shi; Xie, Xudong; Zhou, Chunhua; Tu, Dandan; Zhang, Changzheng; Liu, Xiaowu; Chen, Weiwei; Bai, Xiang; Torr, Philip H S",Med Image Anal,,27

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a pre-trained commercially available NLP engine to automatically categorize 5397 radiological reports of radiographs (hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, knee, pelvis/hip) within a 6-week period from March to April in 2015-2020 into ""fracture affirmed"" or ""fracture not affirmed."" The NLP engine achieved an F1 score of 0.81 compared to human annotators. RESULTS: In 2020, we found a significant decrease of fractures in general (p < 0.001); the average number of fractures in 2015-2019 was 295, whereas it was 233 in 2020. In children and adolescents (p < 0.001), and in adults up to 65 years (p = 0.006), significantly fewer fractures were reported in 2020. The number of fractures in the elderly did not change (p = 0.15). The number of hand/wrist fractures (p < 0.001) and fractures of the elbow (p < 0.001) was significantly lower in 2020 compared with the average in the years 2015-2019. CONCLUSION: NLP can be used to identify relevant changes in the number of pathologies as shown here for the use case fracture detection. This may trigger root cause analysis and enable automated real-time monitoring in radiology.","Jungmann, Florian; Kämpgen, B; Hahn, F; Wagner, D; Mildenberger, P; Düber, C; Kloeckner, R",Skelet. radiol,,27
344606,Evidence informing the UK's COVID-19 public health response must be transparent,2020,"RATIONALE: In spring 2020, many states in the United States enacted stay-at-home orders to limit the spread of COVID-19 and lessen effects on hospitals and health care workers. This required parents to act in new roles without much support. Although studies have asked parents about stress before and during the pandemic, none have examined how stress may have fluctuated throughout the day and the characteristics related to those daily changes. OBJECTIVE: Our study assesses how time-varying (e.g., presence of a focal child) and day-varying (e.g., weekend vs. weekday) factors were related to parents' level of stress. METHODS: We use Ecological Momentary Assessment to examine stress three times a day (10 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m.) for 14 days. We include two different dates hypothesized to be related to parents' stress levels: (1) when Ohio announced schools would go virtual for the rest of the academic year and (2) when most retail businesses were allowed to re-open. Our sample of 332 individuals, recruited via Facebook, Craigslist, and word of mouth, completed 13,360 of these brief surveys during April-May 2020. Data were analyzed using generalized ordered logit models. RESULTS: Parents report lower levels of stress when completing the 9 p.m. survey, but higher levels when they were at work, during weekdays (compared to weekends) or when they were with the focal child. COVID-19 milestone dates were not related to stress levels. CONCLUSIONS: Parents need some form of respite (e.g. child care, child-only activities) to reduce stress, especially during the week when parents are juggling their outside employment and their child(ren)'s schooling. Providing parents with skills and tools to identify and reduce stress, such as apps monitoring heart rate or providing deep breathing techniques, may be one way of helping parents cope with extremely stressful situations.","Freisthler, Bridget; Gruenewald, Paul J; Tebben, Erin; Shockley McCarthy, Karla; Price Wolf, Jennifer",Soc Sci Med,,27

An epidemic has been recorded since February 20 in a middle province in Northern Italy (Lodi province, in the low Po Valley). The first line hospital had to redesign its logistical and departmental structure to respond to the influx of COVID-19-positive patients who needed hospitalization. Logistical and structural strategies were guided by the crisis unit, managing in 8 days from the beginning of the epidemic to prepare the hospital to be ready to welcome more than 200 COVID-19-positive patients with different ventilatory requirements, keeping clean emergency access lines, and restoring surgical interventions and deferred urgent, routine activity.","Gagliano, Annalisa; Villani, Pier Giorgio; Co039,; Francesca, M; Manelli, Anna; Paglia, Stefano; Bisagni, Pietro A G; Perotti, Gabriele M; Storti, Enrico; Lombardo, Massimo",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,27
345861,Adapting to a new reality: COVID-19 coronavirus and online education in the health professions,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between maximal exercise capacity measured before severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hospitalization due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We identified patients (&#8805;18 years) who completed a clinically indicated exercise stress test between January 1, 2016, and February 29, 2020, and had a test for SARS-CoV-2 (ie, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test) between February 29, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Maximal exercise capacity was quantified in metabolic equivalents of task (METs). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the likelihood that hospitalization secondary to COVID-19 is related to peak METs, with adjustment for 13 covariates previously identified as associated with higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients (age, 59±12 years; 42% male; 75% black race) who had an exercise test and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among these, 89 (36%) were hospitalized. Peak METs were significantly lower (P<.001) among patients who were hospitalized (6.7±2.8) compared with those not hospitalized (8.0±2.4). Peak METs were inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization in unadjusted (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74-0.92) and adjusted models (odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99). CONCLUSION: Maximal exercise capacity is independently and inversely associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19. These data further support the important relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness and health outcomes. Future studies are needed to determine whether improving maximal exercise capacity is associated with lower risk of complications due to viral infections, such as COVID-19.","Brawner, Clinton A; Ehrman, Jonathan K; Bole, Shane; Kerrigan, Dennis J; Parikh, Sachin S; Lewis, Barry K; Gindi, Ryan M; Keteyian, Courtland; Abdul-Nour, Khaled; Keteyian, Steven J",Mayo Clin Proc,,27

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: Field area of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation. PARTICIPANTS: More than 30 000 individuals irrespective of their age, sex, acute/past COVID-19 infection participated in the serosurvey which covered all the 75 Urban Primary Health Centres (UPHCs) across 48 wards and 7 zones of the city. Study also involved healthcare workers (HCWs) from COVID-19/non-COVID-19 hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Seropositivity of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was measured as a mark of COVID-19 infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Seropositivity was used to calculate cumulative incidence. Correlation of seropositivity with available demographic detail was used for valid and precise assessment of the pandemic situation. RESULTS: From 30 054 samples, the results were available for 29 891 samples and the crude seropositivity is 17.61%. For all the various age groups, the seropositivity calculated between 15% and 20%. The difference in seropositivity for both the sex group is statistically not significant. The seropositivity is significantly lower (13.64%) for HCWs as compared with non-HCWs (18.71%). Seropositivity shows increasing trend with time. Zone with maximum initial cases has high positivity as compared with other zones. UPHCs with recent rise in cases are leading in seropositivity as compared with earlier and widely affected UPHCs. CONCLUSIONS: The results of serosurveillance suggest that the population of Ahmedabad is still largely susceptible. People still need to follow preventive measures to protect themselves till an effective vaccine is available to the people at large. The data indicate the possibility of vanishing immunity over time and need further research to cross verify with scientific evidences.","Prakash, Om; Solanki, Bhavin; Sheth, Jay K; Joshi, Bhavin; Kadam, Mina; Vyas, Sheetal; Shukla, Aparajita; Tiwari, Hemant; Rathod, Sanjay; Rajput, Anil; Trivedi, Toral; Ramanuj, Vaibhav; Solanki, Anand",BMJ Open,,27

We exploit their unique feature - stopovers: short, non traffic-related stops made by cyclists during their trips. As we demonstrate on the case-study of Krakow (Poland), when applied to a big dataset, meaningful patterns appear, with hotspots (places with long and frequent stopovers) identified at both the top tourist and leisure attractions as well as emerging new places. We propose a generic method, applicable to any spatiotemporal city-bike traces, providing results meaningful to understand both the general urban space attractiveness and its dynamics. With the proposed filtering (to mitigate a selection bias) and empirical cross-validation (to rule-out false-positive classifications) results effectively reveal spatial patterns of urban attractiveness. Valuable for decision-makers and analysts to enhance understanding of urban space consumption patterns by tourists and residents.","Banet, Krystian; Kucharski, Rafal; Naumov, Vitalii",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04493v1.pdf,27

No asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, whereas common cold symptoms were common (51.2%). Our study shows that in Belgium, there is no sign of early introduction into daycare centers at a moment children were not yet isolated at home although the virus was clearly circulating. It is clear that more evidence is needed to understand the actual role of young children in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and their infection risk when attending daycare.

The experience has been incredibly humbling given that no country or section of society, regardless of its wealth or status, has been spared. The pandemic is not only a health crisis, but is also having serious damaging effects on societies, economies and vulnerable groups. Timely response is necessary in order to alleviate human suffering and to prevent irreversible destruction of livelihoods. This paper provides preliminary data on the socio-economic impacts of Covid-19 in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya, at the time of government-imposed curfews and cessation of movement. We conducted online surveys for two weeks during the restrictions period. The data was collected using online questionnaires directed at the city residents. The data highlights the mobile gender gap resulting from gender inequalities, residents' reliance on the government for Covid-19 information but lack of trust for government interventions, inadequate provisions of essential services, and the residents' lack of preparedness to tackle similar challenges in the future.","Kithiia, Justus; Wanyonyi, Innocent; Maina, Joseph; Jefwa, Titus; Gamoyo, Majambo",Data Brief,,27

Several antiviral drugs for FIP have been identified, but many of these are expensive and not available in veterinary medicine. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a drug approved by several countries to treat malaria and immune-mediated diseases in humans, and its antiviral effects on other viral infections (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, dengue virus) have been confirmed. We investigated whether HCQ in association with interferon-&#969; (IFN-&#969;) is effective for FIPV in vitro. A total of 100 µM of HCQ significantly inhibited the replication of types I and II FIPV. Interestingly, the combination of 100 µM of HCQ and 104 U/mL of recombinant feline IFN-&#969; (rfIFN-&#969;, veterinary registered drug) increased its antiviral activity against type I FIPV infection. Our study suggested that HCQ and rfIFN-&#969; are applicable for treatment of FIP. Further clinical studies are needed to verify the combination of HCQ and rIFN-&#969; will be effective and safe treatment for cats with FIP.","Takano, Tomomi; Satoh, Kumi; Doki, Tomoyoshi; Tanabe, Taishi; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Viruses,,27

352656,Racism is a public health crisis! Black Power in the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Studies have shown individuals with chronic illnesses tend to experience poorer mental health compared to their counterparts without a chronic illness under the COVID-19 pandemic. The pervasive disruption on daily lifestyles due to social distancing could be a contributing factor. In this study, we collaborated with local patient support groups to explore the psychological adjustment among a group of community-dwelling individuals with chronic illnesses under the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We collected responses from 408 adults with one or more chronic illnesses using an online survey. Results show that about one in four participants experienced moderate to high levels of depression (26.0%), anxiety (26.2%) and stress (20.1%) symptoms measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index. While 62.3% (gatherings) to 91.9% (contact with others) of participants reported changes in their daily lifestyles, these changes-both an increase and a decrease-were related to poorer mental health. The relationship was mediated by psychological resilience, measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, with an estimate of indirect effect of -0.28 (95% confidence interval -0.44 to -0.10). In light of our findings, we urge social and healthcare professionals to support chronic illness patients to continue their daily lifestyles such as exercises and social contacts as much as possible by educating the public on feasible and practical preventive measures and enhance the psychological resilience of community-dwelling patients with scalable and efficacious psychological interventions.","Lau, Bobo Hi Po; Cheung, Mike Kwun Ting; Chan, Lucian Tsz Hei; Chan, Cecilia Lai Wan; Leung, Pamela Pui Yu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,27
353518,Mental health of healthcare professionals in China during the new coronavirus pandemic: an integrative review,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women affected by SARS-COV-2. METHODS: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study including women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 from 73 centers from 22 different countries in Europe, United States, South America, Asia and Australia from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. Confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: 388 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The primary outcome was observed in 47/388 women (12.1%). 43/388 women (11.1%) were admitted to ICU, 36/388 (9.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 3/388 women deceased (0.8%). Of the 388 women included in the study, 122 (31.4%) were still pregnant at the time of the study. Among the other 266 women, 6 had spontaneous first-trimester abortion, 3 had elective termination of pregnancy, 6 had stillbirth, and 251 delivered a live-born infant. The rate of preterm birth less than 37 weeks of gestation was 26.3% (70/266). Of the 251 live-born infants, 69/251 (27.5%) were admitted to NICU, with 5 neonatal deaths (2.0%). The overall rate of perinatal death was 4.1% (11/266). Only one infant (1/251, 0.4%) born from a mother tested positive during the third trimester, was found positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV-2 in pregnant women is associated with 0.8% rate of maternal mortality, but 11.1% rate of admission to ICU. The risk of vertical transmission seems to be negligible.

356116,Population Health: Identifying Skill Sets and Education Alignment for Him Professionals,2021,"IntroductionSince March of 2020, over 210 million SARS-CoV-2 cases have been reported and roughly five billion doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been delivered. The rise of the more infectious delta variant has recently indicated the value of reinstating previously relaxed non-pharmacological and test-driven preventative measures. These efforts have been met with resistance, due, in part, to a lack of site-specific quantitative evidence which can justify their value. As vaccination rates continue to increase, a gap in knowledge exists regarding appropriate thresholds for escalation and de-escalation of COVID-19 preventative measures. MethodsWe conducted a series of simulation experiments, trialing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a hypothesized working environment that is subject to COVID-19 infections from the surrounding community. We established cohorts of individuals who would, in simulation, work together for a set period of time. With these cohorts, we tested the rates of workplace and community acquired infections based on applied isolation strategies, community infection rates (CIR), scales of testing, non-pharmaceutical interventions, variant predominances and testing strategies, vaccination coverages, and vaccination efficacies of the members included. Permuting through each combination of these variables, we estimated expected case counts for 33,462 unique workplace scenarios. ResultsWhen the CIR is 5 new confirmed cases per 100,000 or fewer, and at 50% of the workforce is vaccinated with a 95% efficacious vaccine, then testing daily with an antigen-based or PCR based test in only unvaccinated workers will result in less than one infection through 4,800 person weeks. When the community infection rate per 100,000 persons is less than or equal to 60, and the vaccination coverage of the workforce is 100% with 95% vaccine efficacy then no masking or routine testing + isolation strategies are needed to prevent workplace acquired infections regardless of variant predominance. Identifying and isolating workers with antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing methods results in the same or fewer workplace acquired infections than testing with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. ConclusionsSpecific scenarios exist in which preventative measures taken to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, including masking, and testing plus isolation strategies can safely be relaxed. Further, efficacious testing with quarantine strategies exist for implementation in only unvaccinated cohorts in a workplace. Due to shorter turnaround time, antigen-based testing with lower sensitivity is more effective than PCR testing with higher sensitivities in comparable testing strategies. The general reference interactive heatmap we provide can be used for site specific, immediate, parameter-based case count predictions to inform appropriate institutional policy making.","Pettit, Rowland W; Peng, Bo; Yu, Patrick; Matos, Peter; Greninger, Alexander L.; McCashin, Julie; Amos, Christopher Ian",,,27

Personal protective equipment was essential to prevent transmission. Owing to shortage of face masks, Taiwan government began to implement quasi rationing on February 6, 2020, by allowing each resident to purchase two masks in seven days. Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration offered online data with real-time updates on face mask availability in all contracted pharmacies and selected local health centers. Based on the open data, numerous software applications quickly emerged to assist the public in finding sales locations efficiently. METHODS: Up until March 15, 2020, the Public Digital Innovation Space of Taiwan government had recorded 134 software applications of face mask availability, and 24 software applications were excluded due to defect, duplicate, and unavailability. These applications were analyzed according to platform, developer type, and display mode. RESULTS: Of the 110 valid software applications, 67 (60.9%) applications were deployed on websites, followed by 21 (19.1%) on social networking sites, 19 (17.3%) as mobile applications, and 3 (2.7%) in other modes. Nearly two thirds (n = 70) of applications were developed by individuals, one third (n = 37) by commercial companies, only two applications by central and local governments, and one by a nongovernmental organization. With respect to the display mode, 47 (42.7%) applications adopted map-view only, 41 (37.3%) adopted table-view only, and 19 (17.3%) adopted both modes. Of the remaining three applications, two offered voice user interfaces and one used augmented reality. CONCLUSION: Taiwan's open data strategy facilitated rapid development of software applications for information dissemination to the public during the COVID-19 crisis. The transparency of real-time data could help alleviate the panic of the public. The collaborative contributions from the grassroots in disasters were priceless treasures.","Yuan, Eunice J; Hsu, Chia-An; Lee, Wui-Chiang; Chen, Tzeng-Ji; Chou, Li-Fang; Hwang, Shinn-Jang",J Chin Med Assoc,,27

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 34 patients with acute abdomen who underwent emergency surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the 34 patients with acute abdomen, a total of six cases were found with COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical classification for COVID-19 pneumonia: all were the common type). On the premise of similar demographics between both groups, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had worse indicators of liver and coagulation function. Compared with acute abdomen patients without COVID-19, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had a longer hospital stay, but there were no significant differences in postsurgical complications (P = 0.58) or clinical outcomes (P = 0.56). In addition, an obvious resolution of lung inflammation after surgery was observed in five COVID-19 patients (83.3%). No new COVID-19 cases occurred during the patients' hospital stays. Therefore, for the common type of COVID-19 pneumonia, emergency surgery could not only improve the outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia patients with acute abdomen, but also benefit the resolution of pulmonary inflammation.","Zhao, Ning; Wu, Liang; Cheng, Yifeng; Zheng, Hai; Hu, Ping; Hu, Chaojie; Chen, Ding; Xu, Peng; Chen, Qingyong; Cheng, Ping; Chen, Jinhuang; Zhao, Gang",Aging (Albany NY),,27

(Special issue: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and responses.),2020,"Importance: Resource limitations because of pandemic or other stresses on infrastructure necessitate the triage of time-sensitive care, including cancer treatments. Optimal time to treatment is underexplored, so recommendations for which cancer treatments can be deferred are often based on expert opinion. Objective: To evaluate the association between increased time to definitive therapy and mortality as a function of cancer type and stage for the 4 most prevalent cancers in the US. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assessed treatment and outcome information from patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, non-small cell lung (NSCLC), and colon cancers from 2004 to 2015, with data analyzed January to March 2020. Data on outcomes associated with appropriate curative-intent surgical, radiation, or medical therapy were gathered from the National Cancer Database. Exposures: Time-to-treatment initiation (TTI), the interval between diagnosis and therapy, using intervals of 8 to 60, 61 to 120, 121 to 180, and greater than 180 days. Main Outcomes and Measures: 5-year and 10-year predicted all-cause mortality. Results: This study included 2â¯241â¯706 patients (mean [SD] age 63 [11.9] years, 1â¯268â¯794 [56.6%] women, 1â¯880â¯317 [83.9%] White): 1â¯165â¯585 (52.0%) with breast cancer, 853â¯030 (38.1%) with prostate cancer, 130â¯597 (5.8%) with NSCLC, and 92â¯494 (4.1%) with colon cancer. Median (interquartile range) TTI by cancer was 32 (21-48) days for breast, 79 (55-117) days for prostate, 41 (27-62) days for NSCLC, and 26 (16-40) days for colon. Across all cancers, a general increase in the 5-year and 10-year predicted mortality was associated with increasing TTI. The most pronounced mortality association was for colon cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage III: TTI 61-120 d, 38.9% vs. 181-365 d, 47.8%), followed by stage I NSCLC (5 y predicted mortality: TTI 61-120 d, 47.4% vs 181-365 d, 47.6%), while survival for prostate cancer was least associated (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, high risk: TTI 61-120 d, 12.8% vs 181-365 d, 14.1%), followed by breast cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage I: TTI 61-120 d, 11.0% vs. 181-365 d, 15.2%). A nonsignificant difference in treatment delays and worsened survival was observed for stage II lung cancer patients-who had the highest all-cause mortality for any TTI regardless of treatment timing. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, for all studied cancers there was evidence that shorter TTI was associated with lower mortality, suggesting an indirect association between treatment deferral and mortality that may not become evident for years. In contrast to current pandemic-related guidelines, these findings support more timely definitive treatment for intermediate-risk and high-risk prostate cancer.","Cone, Eugene B; Marchese, Maya; Paciotti, Marco; Nguyen, David-Dan; Nabi, Junaid; Cole, Alexander P; Molina, George; Molina, Rose L; Minami, Christina A; Mucci, Lorelei A; Kibel, Adam S; Trinh, Quoc-Dien",JAMA Netw Open,,27

Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offers the ability to generate long-read sequencing data in real time via portable protein nanopore USB devices. This work aimed to provide the user with the number of reads that should be sequenced, through the ONT MinION platform, to reach the desired accuracy level for a human cell RNA study. We sequenced three cDNA libraries prepared from poly-adenosine RNA of human primary cardiac fibroblasts. Since the runs were comparable, they were combined in a total dataset of 48 million reads. Synthetic datasets with different sizes were generated starting from the total and analyzed in terms of the number of identified genes and their expression levels. As expected, an improved sensitivity was obtained, increasing the sequencing depth, particularly for the non-coding genes. The reliability of expression levels was assayed by (i) comparison with PCR quantifications of selected genes and (ii) by the implementation of a user-friendly multiplexing method in a single run.","Massaiu, Ilaria; Songia, Paola; Chiesa, Mattia; Valerio, Vincenza; Moschetta, Donato; Alfieri, Valentina; Myasoedova, Veronika A; Schmid, Michael; Cassetta, Luca; Colombo, Gualtiero I; D039,; Alessandra, Yuri; Poggio, Paolo",Int. j. mol. sci.

Therefore, specific preventative measures including COVID-19 vaccines are especially important. Both anticancer therapies and the underlying malignancy itself can lead to significant immunosuppression posing a particular challenge for vaccination strategies in these patients. At the moment, four COVID-19 vaccines are European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved in Germany: two mRNA and two viral vector-based vaccines. All four vaccines show excellent protection against severe COVID-19. Their mechanism of action relies on the induction of the production of virus-specific proteins by human cells and the following activation of a specific adaptive immune response. Vaccination against COVID-19 has been prioritized for cancer patients and medical personnel in Germany. Regarding timing of vaccination, vaccination prior to initiation of anticancer therapy seems ideal in newly diagnosed disease. However, due to the significant risk of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients, vaccination is also strongly recommended for patients already undergoing anticancer therapy. In these patients, immune response might be reduced. In two particular patient cohorts, namely stem cell transplant recipients and patients treated with B­cell depleting agents, an interval of several months following therapy is recommended because otherwise the response to vaccination will most likely be severely reduced. Preliminary data suggest only low rates of seroconversion following a single shot of vaccine in cancer patients. Therefore, on the long run, repeat vaccination regimens might be preferable in cancer patients.","von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie; Rieger, Christina; Giesen, Nicola; Wörmann, Bernhard",Onkologe (Berl),,27

373652,Beyond the COVID-19 crisis: building on lost opportunities in the history of public health,2021,"Overall mental health depends in part on the blood-brain barrier, which regulates nutrient transfer in-and-out of the brain and its central nervous system. Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier via receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce Aß deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain - the Neuro-COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are widely reported in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis patients with aggravated clinical outcomes. Lactoferrin, credited with several neuroprotective benefits in the brain could serve as a potential adjuvant in the clinical management of Neuro-COVID-19.","Naidu, Sreus A G; Wallace, Taylor C; Davies, Kelvin J A; Naidu, A Satyanarayan",J Diet Suppl,,27

Rat models showed that Azithromycin produces oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis of myocardial tissue. Rosuvastatin, a synthetic statin, can attenuate myocardial ischemia with antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects. This study aims to evaluate the probable protective effect of Rosuvastatin against Azithromycin induced cardiotoxicity. MAIN METHOD: Twenty adult male albino rats were divided randomly into four groups, five rats each control, Azithromycin, Rosuvastatin, and Azithromycin +Rosuvastatin groups. Azithromycin 30 mg/kg/day and Rosuvastatin 2 mg/kg/day were administrated for two weeks by an intragastric tube. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, rats were anesthetized and the following measures were carried out; Electrocardiogram, Blood samples for Biochemical analysis of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The animals sacrificed, hearts excised, apical part processed for H&E, immunohistochemical staining, and examined by light microscope. The remaining parts of the heart were collected for assessment of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and Reduced Glutathione (GSH). KEY FINDINGS: The results revealed that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates ECG changes, biochemical, and Oxidative stress markers alterations of Azithromycin. Histological evaluation from Azithromycin group showed marked areas of degeneration, myofibers disorganization, inflammatory infiltrate, and hemorrhage. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed significant increase in both Caspase 3 and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) immune stain. Rosuvastatin treated group showed restoration of the cardiac muscle fibers in H&E and Immunohistochemical results. SIGNIFICANCE: We concluded that Rosuvastatin significantly ameliorates the toxic changes of Azithromycin on the heart.","Mansour, Basma S; Salem, Noha A; Kader, Ghada Abdel; Abdel-Alrahman, Gamal; Mahmoud, Omayma M",Life Sci,,27

The rapid emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has challenged health services in an unprecedented manner. Mobilization of the dermatology community in response has included rapid development and deployment of multiple, partially harmonized, international patient registries, reinventing established patient registry timelines. Partnership with patient organizations has demonstrated the critical nature of inclusive patient involvement. This global effort has demonstrated the value, capacity, and necessity for the dermatology community to adopt a more cohesive approach to patient registry development and data sharing that can lead to myriad benefits. These include improved utilization of limited resources, increased data interoperability, improved ability to rapidly collect meaningful data, and shortened response times to generate real-world evidence. We call on the global dermatology community to support the development of an international federation of patient registries to consolidate and operationalize the lessons learned during this pandemic.

Thus, concerns about the reducing and management of COVID-19 are on the rise, as there is need to provide diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and follow-ups during the pandemic. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic has radically and quickly altered how medical practitioners provide care to patients. Medical centers are now responding to COVID-19 through rapid adoption of digital tools and technologies such as telemedicine and virtual care which refer to the delivery of healthcare services digital or at a distance using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) for treatment of patients. Telemedicine is expected to deliver timely care while minimizing exposure to protect medical practitioners and patients. Accordingly, a rapid literature review was conducted, and 35 research studies published from 2019 to May 2020 were employed to provide theoretical and practical evidence on the significance of using telemedicine and virtual care for remote treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides practical guide based on how to use telemedicine and virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early studies indicated that monoclonal antibody treatment in immunocompromised individuals could result in within-host viral evolution preferentially affecting epitopes recognized by these antibodies, although whether this signifies a real risk of transmissible antibody resistant virus is unclear. In this study we have taken advantage of a regional SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance program encompassing regions in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa to monitor the introduction or de novo emergence of SARS-Cov-2 lineages with clinically relevant variants. Here we describe a newly acquired E484K mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detected within the B.1.311 lineage. Multiple individuals in two related households were infected. The timing and patterns of subsequent spread were consistent with de novo emergence of this E484K variant in the initially affected individual who had been treated with bamlanivimab monotherapy. The subsequent transmission to close contacts occurred several days after the resolution of symptoms and the end of this patients quarantine period. Our study suggests that the selective pressures introduced by the now widespread administration of these antibodies may warrant increased genomic surveillance to identify and mitigate spread of therapy-induced variants.","Sabin, Arick P; Richmond, Craig S; Kenny, Paraic A",,,27

(Special Section: COVID-19.),2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, has recently been associated with a myriad of hematologic derangements; in particular, an unusually high incidence of venous thromboembolism has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. It is postulated that either the cytokine storm induced by the viral infection or endothelial damage caused by viral binding to the ACE-2 receptor may activate a cascade leading to a hypercoaguable state. Although pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis have been well described in patients with COVID-19 infection, there is a paucity of literature on cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (cVST) associated with COVID-19 infection. cVST is an uncommon etiology of stroke and has a higher occurrence in women and young people. We report a series of three patients at our institution with confirmed COVID-19 infection and venous sinus thrombosis, two of whom were male and one female. These cases fall outside the typical demographic of patients with cVST, potentially attributable to COVID-19 induced hypercoaguability. This illustrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for cVST in patients with COVID-19 infection, particularly those with unexplained cerebral hemorrhage, or infarcts with an atypical pattern for arterial occlusive disease.","Dakay, Katarina; Cooper, Jared; Bloomfield, Jessica; Overby, Philip; Mayer, Stephan A; Nuoman, Rolla; Sahni, Ramandeep; Gulko, Edwin; Kaur, Gurmeen; Santarelli, Justin; Gandhi, Chirag D; Al-Mufti, Fawaz",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,27

388937,[Mental health in the perinatal period and maternal stress during the Covid-19 pandemic: influence on fetal development.],2020,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced emergency services to implement new standards of practice around the world. The dynamic and unpredictable nature of many clinical situations has placed emergency service personnel in direct danger of contracting the disease. This work uses a validated survey developed for the study to assess the predictors of stress that paramedics, nurses and doctors experience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group included 955 medical staff, and the level of significance adopted for statistical analysis was p = 0.05. Non-parametric Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the qualitative variables divided into groups. The selection of tests was carried out based on the distribution of variables, verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. In order to determine the predictors that caused the feelings of stress, it was necessary to use the linear regression model. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress among emergency medical personnel has increased considerably due to new factors that did not previously exist. The predictors of stress in the professional environment include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of treatment for patients not suffering from COVID-19. Additional socio-demographic factors that increase stress among emergency medical personnel are being female and working in the nursing profession. Appropriate training, the supply of personal protective equipment and opinions on the preparedness of the system to deal with the outbreak of the pandemic did not affect the level of stress among health service personnel. CONCLUSIONS: The factors that can be considered to act as predictors of occupational stress include the fear of contracting COVID-19, a decrease in the level of safety and security while conducting emergency medical procedures, and the marginalization of patients not suffering from COVID-19.","Ilczak, Tomasz; Rak, Malgorzata; Cwiertnia, Michal; Mikulska, Monika; Waksmanska, Wioletta; Krakowiak, Anna; Bobinski, Rafal; Kawecki, Marek",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,27
389443,Coping With Health Threats: The Costs and Benefits of Managing Emotions,2021,"Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) is a critical indicator in economic studies, while it can be used to forecast a recession. Under higher levels of uncertainty, firms' owners cut their investment, which leads to a longer post-recession recovery. EPU index is computed by counting news articles containing pre-defined keywords related to policy-making and economy and convey uncertainty. Unfortunately, this method is sensitive to the original keyword set, its richness, and the news coverage. Thus, reproducing its results for different countries is challenging. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised text mining method that uses word-embedding representation space to select relevant keywords. This method is not strictly sensitive to the semantic similarity threshold applied to the word embedding vectors and does not require a pre-defined dictionary. Our experiments using a massive repository of Persian news show that the EPU series computed by the proposed method precisely follows major events affecting Iran's economy and is compatible with the World Uncertainty Index (WUI) of Iran.","Kaveh-Yazdy, Fatemeh; Zarifzadeh, Sajjad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04631v1.pdf,27

Health-care personnel is highly susceptible to becoming infected. This study aimed to determine the characteristics and known risk factors for contagion and severe outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 disease in health-care personnel of a pediatric coronavirus disease (COVID) center in Mexico City. METHODS: In the last week of March 2020 (at the beginning of phase 2 of the Ministry of Health's national campaign in Mexico), a study was conducted on healthcare workers of a pediatric COVID hospital in Mexico City. Using a virtual interview, we evaluated comorbidities, mobility, areas and functions where they carry out the activities, protection measures, contact history, and vaccination. According to their activities, healthcare workers were classified into the following areas: medical, nursing, other health-care personnel (researchers, nutritionists, rehabilitation, imaging, and laboratory), administrative, and other services. We compared the variables between the groups of healthcare workers with the X2 test. RESULTS: We included 812 participants. The mean age was 41 ± 11 years, and 33% were overweight or obese, 18% were over 60 years old, and 19% had high blood pressure. Medical and nursing personnel presented a higher proportion in the use of standard protection measures. CONCLUSIONS: Among healthcare workers, there are risk conditions for the development of complications in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most medical and nursing personnel use standard protective measures.","Márquez-González, Horacio; Klünder-Klünder, Miguel; de la Rosa-Zamboni, Daniela; Ortega-Riosvelasco, Fernando; López-Martínez, Briceida; Jean-Tron, Guadalupe; Chapa-Koloffon, Gina; Ávila-Hernández, A Viridiana; Garduño-Espinosa, Juan; Villa-Guillén, Mónica; Nieto-Zermeño, Jaime",Bol. med.

390347,Frugal innovations that helped mission hospitals manage during the pandemic and further suggestions,2020,"BACKGROUND: Developing a safe and effective vaccine will be the principal way of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. However, current COVID-19 vaccination trials are not adequately representing a diverse participant population in terms of age, ethnicity and comorbidities. Achieving the representative recruitment targets that are adequately powered to the study remains one of the greatest challenges in clinical trial management. To ensure accuracy and generalisability of the safety and efficacy conclusions generated by clinical trials, it is crucial to recruit patient cohorts as representative as possible of the future target population. Missing these targets can lead to reduced validity of the study results and can often slow down drug development leading to costly delays. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the key factors related to perceptions and participation in vaccination trials. METHODS: This study involved an anonymous cross-sectional online survey circulated across the UK. Statistical analysis was done in six phases. Multi-nominal logistic models examined demographic and geographic factors that may impact vaccine uptake. RESULTS: The survey had 4884 participants of which 9.44% were Black Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME). Overall, 2020 (41.4%) respondents were interested in participating in vaccine trials; 27.6% of the respondents were not interested and 31.1% were unsure. The most interested groups were male (OR = 1.29), graduates (OR = 1.28), the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups (OR = 1.88 and OR = 1.46 respectively) and those with no health issues (OR = 1.06). The least interested groups were BAME (OR = 0.43), those from villages and small towns (OR = 0.66 and 0.54 respectively) and those aged 70 and above (OR = 1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In order to have a vaccination that is generalisable to the entire population, greater work needs to be done in engaging a diverse cohort of participants. Public health campaigns need to be targeted in improving trial recruitment rates for the elderly, BAME community and the less educated rural population.","Sethi, Sonika; Kumar, Aditi; Mandal, Anandadeep; Shaikh, Mohammed; Hall, Claire A; Kirk, Jeremy M W; Moss, Paul; Brookes, Matthew J; Basu, Supratik",Trials,,27

Candidates for repurposing include drugs that target COVID-19 pathobiology, including agents that alter angiotensin signalling. Recent data indicate that key findings in COVID-19 patients include thrombosis and endotheliitis. Activation of proteinase-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), in particular by the serine protease thrombin, is a critical element in platelet aggregation and coagulation. PAR1 activation also impacts on the actions of other cell types involved in COVID-19 pathobiology, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. Vorapaxar is an approved inhibitor of PAR1, used for treatment of patients with myocardial infarction or peripheral arterial disease. We discuss evidence for a possible beneficial role for vorapaxar in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and other as-yet non-approved antagonists of PAR1 and proteinase-activated receptor 4 (PAR4).

Such estimates are challenging due to small population sizes in these facilities and inconsistent testing practices. We estimate the patient-to-patient R0 and daily transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 using data from a closely monitored hospital outbreak in Paris 2020 during the first wave. We use a realistic epidemic model which accounts for progressive stages of infection, stochastic effects and a large proportion of asymptomatic infections. Innovatively, we explicitly include changes in testing capacity over time, as well as the evolving sensitivity of PCR testing at different stages of infection. We conduct rigorous statistical inference using iterative particle filtering to fit the model to the observed patient data and validate this methodology using simulation. We provide estimates for R0 across the entire hospital (2.6) and in individual wards (from 3 to 15), possibly reflecting heterogeneity in contact patterns or control measures. An obligatory mask-wearing policy introduced during the outbreak is likely to have changed the R0, and we estimate values before (8.7) and after (1.3) its introduction, corresponding to a policy efficacy of 85%.","Shirreff, George; Zahar, Jean-Ralph; Cauchemez, Simon; Temime, Laura; Opatowski, Lulla",,,27

Studies on COVID-19 have shown that older adults and people with a history of various medical issues, specifically prior cases of pneumonia, are at a higher risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. As pneumonia is a common type of infection that spreads in the lungs, doctors usually perform chest X-ray to identify the infected regions of the lungs. In this study, machine learning tools such as LabelBinarizer are used to perform one-hot encoding on the labeled chest X-ray images and transform them into categorical form using Python's to_categorical tool. Subsequently, various deep learning features such as convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, AveragePooling2D, dropout, flatten, dense, and input are used to build a detection model. Adam is used as an optimizer, which can be further applied to predict pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The model predicted pneumonia with an average accuracy of 91.69%, sensitivity of 95.92%, and specificity of 100%. The model also efficiently reduces training loss and increases accuracy.

396602,COVID-19: A Window of Opportunity for Positive Healthcare Reforms,2020,"BACKGROUND: The Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) can indicate the presence of novel, widespread community pathogens. Comparing week-to-week reported influenza-like illness percentages may identify the time of year a novel pathogen is introduced. However, changes in health-seeking behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic call in to question the reliability of 2019-2020 ILINet data as a comparison to prior years, potentially rendering this system less reliable as a novel pathogen surveillance tool. Corroboration of trends seen in the 2019-2020 ILINet data lends confidence to the validity of those trends. This study compares predicted versus reported influenza and influenza-like illnesses in vaccinated adults as a surrogate measure of novel pathogen surveillance. METHODS: An online survey was used to ask US adults their influenza vaccination status, whether they were diagnosed with influenza after vaccination, and whether they experienced an influenza-like illness other than flu. RESULTS: Prevalence of self-reported flu diagnosis in adults age 18-64 who received the flu vaccine between September 1, 2019 and April 15, 2020 (n = 3,225) was 5.8 %, while self-reported flu or flu-like illness (without a flu diagnosis) was 17.9 %. CONCLUSION: Flu and flu-like illness in this sample of flu-vaccinated U.S. adults is significantly higher than predicted, consistent with substantially higher ILI's in 2019-20 compared to ILI's from 2018-19, suggesting that the ILI values reported during the COVID-19 pandemic may be appropriate for comparison to prior years.","Lennon, Robert P; Miller, Erin L; Snyder, Bethany; Van Scoy, Lauren Jodi",J Clin Virol,,27

398265,Five principles for pandemic preparedness: lessons from the Australian COVID-19 primary care response,2020,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: An immobile vocal fold due to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury usually shows no gross signs of atrophy and lies near the midline. In 1881, Felix Semon proposed that this phenomenon was due to a selective injury of nerve fibers supplying the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA) and supported this with postmortem proof of selective PCA atrophy. In recent decades, evidence has emerged that the RLN regenerates after injury but does not always result in useful motion of the vocal folds. It has been proposed that this is caused by laryngeal synkinesis. Laryngeal synkinesis describes a random distribution of regenerated nerve fibers to opposing vocal fold muscles. This study was conducted to clarify the relative contribution of these two potential pathomechanisms in our patient population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case analysis. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of laryngeal EMG results from cases with RLN paralysis of at least 6 months duration seen at our neurolaryngology clinic. RESULTS: Out of 118 PCA EMGs, there was not a single normal or near-normal tracing, whilst 33.3% of TA EMGs indicated normal or near normal innervation. PCA EMGs showed signs of persistent high-grade partial denervation (41.5%) as a sign of atrophy, moderate or strong synkinesis (21.2%), or a combination of both (37.3%). CONCLUSIONS: In chronic RLN paralysis the intrinsic laryngeal muscles are affected to different extents either by atrophy or synkinesis or a combination of both. The PCA is always affected. The lesser damage to TA innervation explains the commonly seen maintenance of vocal fold muscle bulk.

402470,Policy responses to COVID-19 present a window of opportunity for a paradigm shift in global health policy: An application of the Multiple Streams Framework as a heuristic,2021,"BackgroundCD20 depletion is a highly-effective treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis that maintains B cells at low levels through six monthly dosing of 600mg ocrelizumab. This dosing schedule is associated with inhibition of seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in contrast to the high levels of seroconversion following treatment with alemtuzumab and cladribine tablets. A number of emerging reports suggest that repopulation of 1-3% B cells facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. The frequency of this occurring following repeated ocrelizumab treatment, after other DMT, and after treatment cessation is largely unknown.

ResultsOnly 3-5% of people with MS exhibit 1% B cells at 6 months after the last infusion following 3-4 cycles of ocrelizumab, compared to 50-55% at 9 months, and 85-90% at 12 months. During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab. ConclusionsFew people repopulate peripheral B cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing, however an extending the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow many more people to potentially seroconvert in the relative absence of excess relapse-activity. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine. This may help protect against severe COVID-19.","Baker, David; MacDougall, Amy; Kang, Angray S; Schmierer, Klaus; Giovannoni, Gavin; Dobson, Ruth",,,27

403920,The urgency of Public Health in Physical Education training: lessons from COVID-19,2020,"IMPORTANCE: During pandemics Agent Based Models (ABMs) can model complex, fine-grained behavioural interactions occurring in social networks, that contribute to disease transmission by novel viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: We present a new agent-based model (ABM) called the Discrete-Event, Simulated Social Agent based Network Transmission model (DESSABNeT) and demonstrate its ability to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Gold Coast. Our aim was to validate the model with its disease dynamics and underlying social network. DESIGN: DESSABNeT relies on disease transmission within simulated social networks. It employs an epidemiological SEIRD+M (Susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, died and managed) structure. One hundred simulations were run for each city, with simulated social restrictions closely modelling real restrictions imposed in each location. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The mean predicted daily incidence of COVID-19 cases were compared to real case incidence data for each city. Reff and health service utilisation outputs were compared to the literature, or for the Gold Coast with daily incidence of hospitalisation. RESULTS: DESSABNeT modelled multiple physical distancing restrictions and predicted epidemiological outcomes of Sydney, Melbourne and the Gold Coast, validating this model for future simulation work. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: DESSABNeT is a valid platform to model the spread of COVID-19 in large cities in Australia and potentially internationally. The platform is suitable to model different combinations of social restrictions, or to model contact tracing, predict, and plan for, the impact on hospital and ICU admissions, and deaths; and also the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and optimal social restrictions during vaccination.","Stapelberg, Nicolas J C; Smoll, Nicolas R; Randall, Marcus; Palipana, Dinesh; Bui, Bryan; Macartney, Kristine; Khandaker, Gulam; Wattiaux, Andre",PLoS One,,27
403994,Mobile phone data for informing public health actions across the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle,2020,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with cancer have a high fatality rate. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies that reported fatalities in COVID-19 patients with cancer. A comprehensive meta-analysis that assessed the overall case fatality rate and associated risk factors was performed. Using individual patient data, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for each variable with outcomes. RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 3019 patients, of which 1628 were men; 41.0% were from the UK and Europe, followed by the USA and Canada (35.7%) and Asia (China, 23.3%). The overall case fatality rate of COVID-19 patients with cancer measured 22.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.3% to 28.0%). Univariate analysis revealed age (odds ratio [OR] = 3.57; 95% CI = 1.80 to 7.06), male (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.13), and comorbidity (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.04 to 3.85) were associated with increased risk of severe events (defined as the individuals being admitted to the intensive care unit, or requiring invasive ventilation, or death). In multivariate analysis, only age greater than 65 years (OR = 3.16; 95% CI = 1.45 to 6.88) and being male (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.07 to 4.87) were associated with increased risk of severe events. CONCLUSION: Our analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with cancer have a higher fatality rate when compared with that of COVID-19 patients without cancer. Age and gender appear to be risk factors associated with a poorer prognosis.","Zhang, Hua; Han, Han; He, Tianhui; Labbe, Kristen E; Hernandez, Adrian V; Chen, Haiquan; Velcheti, Vamsidhar; Stebbing, Justin; Wong, Kwok-Kin",J. natl. cancer inst,,27
405127,Too Big to Heal? Macroprudential Policies in Health Governance,2020,"Health behaviour of the people is said to be shaped by market forces, scientific or religious institutions or the state. It is pertinent to examine the dominant institutions that shape health cultures in any society, at any given point in time. While public health has not been a priority for the Indian state, the COVID-19 pandemic created an unmistakable opportunity for state regulation. It is the argument of this article that the state has been central to the framing of the COVID-19 pandemic and the identification of relevant interventions, such that the borderline between the political and medical is blurred. The influence of these institutional decisions on the health behaviour of the people indicates that compliant health behaviour is a symbolic resource for the state in societies like India, irrespective of whether the government actually delivers on its health care delivery.","Sujatha, V.",Contributions to Indian Sociology,,27

The turnstile usage data not only indicate the usage of the city's subway but also people's activity that promoted the large prevalence of COVID-19 city dwellers experienced from March to May of 2020. While this correlation is apparent, no proof has been provided before. Here we demonstrate this correlation through the application of a long short-term memory neural network. We show that the correlation of COVID-19 prevalence and deaths considers the incubation and symptomatic phases on reported deaths. Having established this correlation, we estimate the dates when the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases would approach zero after the reported number of deaths were decreasing by using the Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model. We also estimate the dates when the first cases and deaths occurred by back-tracing the data sets and compare them to the reported dates.","Fathi-Kazerooni, Sina; Rojas-Cessa, Roberto; Dong, Ziqian; Umpaichitra, Vatcharapan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08156v2.pdf,27

410194,Notes from the Field: Concerns of Health-Related Higher Education Students in Brazil Pertaining to Distance Learning During the Coronavirus Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Low free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels are related to a poor prognosis deterioration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTI). This study was designed to explore whether free thyroxin (FT4) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels affected the mortality of patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels. The 90-day mortality and critical illness rates were compared among patients with low and normal TSH levels, as well as among patients with low FT4 levels and normal-high FT4 levels; in addition, differences in demographic and laboratory data were compared. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of TSH and FT4 levels with mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with low FT3 levels and without a history of thyroid disease were included, 68% of whom had normal FT4 and TSH levels. Critical illness rates (74.07% VS 37.40%, P = 0.001) and mortality rates (51.85% VS 22.76%, P = 0.002) were significantly higher in the low TSH group than in the normal TSH group. Although no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found (P = 0.296), the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group (P = 0.038). Low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, 95% CI:1.42-5.552, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Low FT4 and TSH concentrations were associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI; moreover, low TSH levels were an independent risk factor for mortality in these patients.","Gong, Jing; Wang, Ding-Kun; Dong, Hui; Xia, Qing-Song; Huang, Zhao-Yi; Zhao, Yan; Chen, Xing; Yuan, Fen; Li, Jing-Bin; Lu, Fu-Er",BMC Endocr Disord,,27
411697,Ethical challenges of nurses related covid-19 pandemic in inpatient wards: an integrative review,2021,"COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2, has created a global health, social, and economic crisis. As of mid-January 2021, there are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. The main protease (Mpro) of the virus is an attractive target for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the Mpro has no human homologues, so drugs designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the Mpro in complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, namely, N3 and &#945;-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are covalent inhibitors of the Mpro. Our results indicate that the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the Mpro target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the Mpro than the &#945;-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the Mpro-N3 covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the Mpro-&#945;-ketoamide covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.","Awoonor-Williams, Ernest; Abu-Saleh, Abd Al-Aziz A",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,27

412076,Construction of Meaning during a Pandemic: The Forgotten Role of Social Norms,2020,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed how outpatient care is delivered in ophthalmology clinics, particularly with glaucoma care. This case series highlights the need for awareness of fogging and improper face mask fit as causes of standard automated perimetry artifacts in patients with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS: Six patients with the diagnosis of ocular hypertension, glaucoma suspect, or glaucoma underwent standard automated perimetry (24-2 or 10-2 SITA, Humphrey Field Analyzer) while wearing ear-loop surgical face masks. Due to patient complaints of fogging during the testing, low test reliability, and unexpected results, the tests were repeated after taping securely the mask to the bridge of the nose. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Fogging may reduce visual field (VF) test reliability and induce artifacts that mimic glaucomatous defects. VF test reliability can be improved and artifacts minimized following mask taping. In 1 case there was worsening of VF defects after mask taping. This suggests that fogging may also disguise true VF defects. CONCLUSIONS: Fogging can result in unreliable VF testing with glaucoma-like artifacts. Secure taping of the face mask to the nose bridge may minimize this problem and reduce unnecessary additional testing and follow-up visits.","El-Nimri, Nevin W; Moghimi, Sasan; Fingeret, Murray; Weinreb, Robert N",J Glaucoma,,27

The paper also describes a premature baby with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-positive COVID-19 seen at the Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK. Design We conducted a multifaceted search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase, Medline and PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 12 May 2020 to harvest articles from medical journals and publications reporting cases of COVID-19 in neonates from anywhere in the world. Additional searches were also done so as not to miss any important publications. Write-up was in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, the protocol for the review was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), and risk of bias was analysed with the Newcastle-Ottawa tool. Additionally, the preterm neonate with COVID-19 from our hospital is also reported. Results The systematic review has revealed eight studies where neonates have been described to have confirmed COVID-19, with low risk of bias. Of the 10 reported cases elsewhere, only three are likely to be vertically transmitted, while seven occurred in the postperinatal period and are likely to have been postnatally acquired. All neonates had a mild course, recovered fully and were negative on retesting. Our case of COVID-19 in a 32-week premature baby from the UK was delivered by emergency caesarean section, with the mother wearing a face mask and the family having no contact with the neonate, suggesting vertical transmission. On day 33, the neonate was asymptomatic but was still RT-PCR-positive on nasopharyngeal airway swab. Conclusions Neonatal infection is uncommon, with only two previously reported cases likely to be of vertical transmission. The case we report is still RT-PCR-positive on day 28 and is asymptomatic. Ongoing research is needed to ascertain the epidemiology of COVID-19 in neonates.","Gordon, Morris; Kagalwala, Taher; Rezk, Karim; Rawlingson, Chris; Ahmed, M Idris; Guleri, Achyut",BMJ Paediatr.

416953,Considerations for Public Beaches,2021,"As the world is struggling against COVID-19 pandemic, and unfortunately no certain treatments are discovered yet, prevention of further transmission by isolating infected people has become an effective strategy to overcome this outbreak. That is why scaling up COVID-19 testing is strongly recommended. However, depending on the time tests are performed, they may have a high rate of false-negative results. This inaccuracy of COVID-19 testing is a challenge against controlling the pandemic. Therefore, in this paper we propose a geometric classification algorithm that is fault-tolerant to handle the inaccuracy of tests. So, in a metropolis of n people, let w + r be the number of cases that are tested, where r is the number of positive, while w is the number of negative COVID-19 cases, and k is an upper bound on the number of false-negative COVID-19 cases. The proposed algorithm takes O(r • (log r + log w) + w3 + w log(hR)) time for isolating all positive cases together with at most k (according to the rate of error of testing) possibly positive (false-negative) cases from the rest of the people. The term hR in the time complexity is the size of convex hull of the set of positive cases, and obviously k ∈ O(w). For simplicity of this isolation, we consider a simple convex shape (a triangle) for this classification algorithm. © 2021 IEEE.","Sheikhi, F.; Alipour, S.","26th International Computer Conference, Computer Society of Iran, CSICC 2021",,27
417134,Absolute targets for HCV elimination and national health policy paradigms: Foreseeing future requirements,2021,"Shortly after the outbreak of the novel infectious disease (COVID-19) started at the end of 2019, it turned into a global pandemic, which caused the lockdown of many countries across the world. Various strict measures were adopted to reduce anthropogenic activities in order to prevent further spread and infection of the disease. In this study, we utilized continental scale remotely sensed data along with city scale in situ air quality observations for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2015-2019) to provide an early insight on air pollution changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, by combining both continental and city scales. For the continental scale analysis, data of NO 2, SO 2, and O 3were acquired from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). For city scale analysis, data ofNO 2, CO, PM2.5, O 3, and SO 2were derived from ground-based air quality observations. Results from satellite observations at the continental scale showed that concentrations of NO 2, SO 2, and AOD substantially dropped in 2020 during the lockdown period compared to their averages for the baseline period over all continents, with a maximum reduction of ~33% for NO 2in East Asia, ~41% for SO 2in East Asia, and ~37% for AOD in South Asia. In the case of O 3, the maximum overall reduction was observed as ~11% in Europe, followed by ~10% in North America, while a slight increase was found in other study regions. These findings align with ground-based air quality observations, which showed that pollutants such as NO 2, CO, PM2.5, and SO 2during the 2020 lockdown period decreased significantly except that O 3had varying patterns in different cities. Specifically, a maximum reduction of ~49% in NO 2was found in London, ~43% in CO in Wuhan, ~38% in PM2.5 in Chennai, and ~48% in SO 2in Beijing. In the case of urban O 3, a maximum reduction of ~43% was found inWuhan, but a significant increase of ~47% was observed in Chennai. It is obvious that restricted human activities during the lockdown have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality, especially across the metropolitan cities.","Zhang, Zhijie; Arshad, Arfan; Zhang, Chuanrong; Hussain, Saddam; Li, Weidong",Remote Sens.,,27

We aimed to analyse characteristics of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 in Brazil, and to examine the impact of COVID-19 on health-care resources and in-hospital mortality. METHODS: We did a retrospective analysis of all patients aged 20 years or older with quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe, a nationwide surveillance database in Brazil, between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 8-33). We also examined the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across three 4-week periods within this timeframe (epidemiological weeks 8-12, 19-22, and 27-30). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We compared the regional burden of hospital admissions stratified by age, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and respiratory support. We analysed data from the whole country and its five regions: North, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast, and South. FINDINGS: Between Feb 16 and Aug 15, 2020, 254â288 patients with RT-qPCR-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to hospital and registered in SIVEP-Gripe. The mean age of patients was 60 (SD 17) years, 119â657 (47%) of 254â288 were aged younger than 60 years, 143â521 (56%) of 254â243 were male, and 14â979 (16%) of 90â829 had no comorbidities. Case numbers increased across the three 4-week periods studied: by epidemiological weeks 19-22, cases were concentrated in the North, Northeast, and Southeast; by weeks 27-30, cases had spread to the Central-West and South regions. 232â036 (91%) of 254â288 patients had a defined hospital outcome when the data were exported; in-hospital mortality was 38% (87â515 of 232â036 patients) overall, 59% (47â002 of 79â687) among patients admitted to the ICU, and 80% (36â046 of 45â205) among those who were mechanically ventilated. The overall burden of ICU admissions per ICU beds was more pronounced in the North, Southeast, and Northeast, than in the Central-West and South. In the Northeast, 1545 (16%) of 9960 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation outside the ICU compared with 431 (8%) of 5388 in the South. In-hospital mortality among patients younger than 60 years was 31% (4204 of 13â468) in the Northeast versus 15% (1694 of 11â196) in the South. INTERPRETATION: We observed a widespread distribution of COVID-19 across all regions in Brazil, resulting in a high overall disease burden. In-hospital mortality was high, even in patients younger than 60 years, and worsened by existing regional disparities within the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need to improve access to high-quality care for critically ill patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, particularly in LMICs.

Most of the deaths have occurred in severe and critical cases, but information on prognostic risk factors for severely ill patients is incomplete. Further research is urgently needed to guide clinicians, and we therefore prospectively evaluate the clinical outcomes of 114 severely ill patients with COVID-19 for short-term at the Union Hospital in Wuhan, China. Methods: In this single-centered, prospective, and observational study, we enrolled 114 severely ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Jan 23, 2020, to February 22, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were recorded, and the risk factors for poor outcome were analyzed. Results: Among the 114 enrolled patients with a mean age of 63.96 ± 13.41 years, 94 (82.5%) patients were classified as a good outcome group. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with the good outcome group, 20 (17.5%) patients in the poor outcome group more frequently exhibited lymphopenia, and lower levels of albumin, partial arterial oxygen pressure, higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, hypersensitive troponin I, C-reactive protein, ferritin, blood urea nitrogen, and D-dimer, as well as markedly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-10. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD8 + T cells, decreased in almost all the patients and were markedly lower in the poor outcome group than the good outcome group. We also found that traditional Chinese medicine can significantly improve the patient's condition, which is conducive to the transformation from a severe to mild condition. In addition, univariate and multivariate Cox analyses of potential factors for poor outcome patients indicated that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction are related to the development of a poor outcome. Conclusion: In summary, we reported this single-centered, prospective, and observational study for short-term outcome in severe patients with COVID-19. We found that cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation responses as well as liver, kidney, and cardiac dysfunction may play important roles in the final outcome of severely ill patients with COVID-19. Our study will allow clinicians to benefit and rapidly estimate the likelihood of a short-term poor outcome for severely ill patients.","Feng, Xiaobo; Li, Peiyun; Ma, Liang; Liang, Hang; Lei, Jie; Li, Wenqiang; Wang, Kun; Song, Yu; Li, Shuai; Yang, Wei; Yang, Cao",Front.

Elevated levels of blood neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been described in patients with COVID-19. However, their potential role in COVID-19-associated thrombosis remains incompletely understood. In order to elucidate the potential role of hyperactive neutrophils and NET release in COVID-19-associated thrombosis, we conducted a case-control study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who developed thrombosis, as compared with gender- and age-matched COVID-19 patients without clinical thrombosis. We found that remnants of NETs (cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3) and neutrophil-derived S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in patient sera were associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic events in spite of prophylactic anticoagulation. These observations underscore the need for urgent investigation into the potential relationship between NETs and unrelenting thrombosis in COVID-19, as well as novel approaches for thrombosis prevention.","Zuo, Yu; Zuo, Melanie; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A; Shi, Hui; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P; Lugogo, Njira L; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,27

A reflection on fieldwork under quarantine",2020,"COVID-19 is spreading and ravaging all over the world, and the number of deaths is increasing day by day without downward trend. However, there is limited knowledge of pathogenesis on the deterioration of COVID-19 at present. In this study we aim to determine whether cytokine storm is really the chief culprit for the deterioration of COVID-19. The confirmed COVID-19 patients were divided into moderate group (n = 89), severe group (n = 37), and critical group (n = 41). Demographic data were collected and recorded on admission to ICU. Clinical data were obtained when moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 was diagnosed, and then compared between groups. The proportion of enrolled COVID-19 patients was slightly higher among males (52.5%) than females (47.5%), with an average age of 64.87 years. The number of patients without comorbidities exceed one third (36.1%), and patients with 1, 2, 3, 4 kinds of comorbidities accounted for 23.0%, 23.0%, 13.1%, and 4.9%, respectively. IL-6, IL-10, TNF, and IFN-Î³, including oxygenation index, sequential organ failure assessment score, white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, platelet, C-reaction protein, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase isoenzyme, albumin, D-Dimer, and fibrinogen showed significant difference between groups. Some, but not all, cytokines and chemokines were involved in the deterioration of COVID-19, and thus cytokine storm maybe just the tip of the iceberg and should be used with caution to explain pathogenesis on the deterioration of COVID-19, which might be complex and related to inflammation, immunity, blood coagulation, and multiple organ functions. Future studies should focus on identification of specific signaling pathways and mechanisms after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections (IRB number: IRB-AF/SC-04/01.0).","Gao, Yang; Wang, Changsong; Kang, Kai; Peng, Yahui; Luo, Yunpeng; Liu, Haitao; Yang, Wei; Zhao, Mingyan; Yu, Kaijiang",Viral immunol,,27

426674,Countering COVID-19: A European survey on acceptability of and commitment to preventive measures,2020,"In the wake of the pandemic, the inadequacy of urban sidewalks to comply with social distancing remains untackled in academy. Beyond isolated efforts (from sidewalk widenings to car-free Open Streets), there is a need for a large-scale and quantitative strategy for cities to handle the challenges that COVID-19 poses in the use of public space. The main obstacle is a generalized lack of publicly available data on sidewalk infrastructure worldwide, and thus city governments have not yet benefited from a complex systems approach of treating urban sidewalks as networks. Here, we leverage sidewalk geometries from ten cities in three continents, to first analyze sidewalk and roadbed geometries, and find that cities most often present an arrogant distribution of public space: imbalanced and unfair with respect to pedestrians. Then, we connect these geometries to build a sidewalk network --adjacent, but not assimilable to road networks, so fertile in urban science. In a no-intervention scenario, we apply percolation theory to examine whether the sidewalk infrastructure in cities can withstand the tight pandemic social distancing imposed on our streets. The resulting collapse of sidewalk networks, often at widths below three meters, calls for a cautious strategy, taking into account the interdependencies between a city's sidewalk and road networks, as any improvement for pedestrians comes at a cost for motor transport. With notable success, we propose a shared-effort heuristic that delays the sidewalk connectivity breakdown, while preserving the road network's functionality.","Rhoads, Daniel; Sol'e-Ribalta, Albert; Gonz'alez, Marta C.; Borge-Holthoefer, Javier",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12548v1.pdf,27

Unfortunately, many of these are not properly tested for efficacy. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of the novel COVID-19 Airway Management Isolation Chamber (CAMIC) to contain and evacuate particulate. STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional proof-of-concept study. SETTING: Two academic institutions: Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) and Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Smoke, saline nebulizer, and simulated working port models were developed to assess the efficacy of the CAMIC to contain and remove ultrafine particles. Particulate counts were collected at set time intervals inside and outside the system. RESULTS: With the CAMIC on, smoke particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(18) = -0.88, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(18) = -0.91, P < .001, MAMC. Similarly, saline nebulizer particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = -0.82, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(23) = -0.70, P < .001, MAMC. In the working port model, particulate counts inside the chamber significantly decreased over time: r(23) = -0.95, P < .001, WRNMMC; r(23) = -0.85, P < .001, MAMC. No significant leak was detected in the smoke, saline nebulizer, or working port model when the CAMIC was turned on. CONCLUSIONS: The CAMIC system appears to provide a barrier that actively removes particles from within the chamber and limits egress. Further studies are necessary to determine clinical applicability. The CAMIC may serve as an adjunct to improve health care worker safety and patient outcomes.","Blood, Timothy C; Perkins, Jonathan N; Wistermayer, Paul R; Krivda, Joseph S; Fisher, Nathan T; Riley, Charles A; Ruhl, Douglas S; Hong, Steven S",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,27

However, there is currently no data regarding the safety of this drug in patients with kidney impairment. The aim of this paper, therefore, is to share our experience of the use of favipiravir in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 with any degree of kidney impairment. METHODS: The study enrolled pediatric patients aged under 18 years and confirmed as suffering from COVID-19 and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with any degree of kidney injury, who were treated with favipiravir at the time of admission. RESULTS: Out of a total of 11 patients, 7 were diagnosed with MIS-C and 4 with severe COVID-19. The median age of the cases was 15.45 (9-17.8) years and the male/female ratio was 7/4. At the time of admission, the median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl. Nine patients were treated with favipiravir for 5 days, and 2 patients for 5 days followed by remdesivir for 5-10 days despite kidney injury at the time of admission. Seven patients underwent plasma exchange for MIS-C while 2 severely affected cases underwent continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) as well. One severe COVID-19 patient received plasma exchange as well as CKRT. Serum creatinine values returned to normal in mean 3.07 days. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir seems a suitable therapeutic option in patients affected by COVID-19 with kidney injury without a need for dose adjustment.","Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Oygar, Pembe Derin; Gürlevik, Sibel Laçinel; Kesici, Selman; Ozen, Seza; Kurt Sukur, Eda Didem; Gülhan, Bora; Topaloglu, Rezan; Bayrakci, Benan; Cengiz, Ali Bülent",Pediatr. nephrol,,27

The use of remote cardiac telemetry as an alternative to 12­lead electrocardiography (ECG) for continuous QTc monitoring may facilitate this strategy, but its application has not yet been validated or implemented. METHODS: In the validation component of this two-part prospective cohort study, a total of 65 hospitalized patients with simultaneous ECG and telemetry were identified. QTc obtained via remote telemetry as measured by 3 independent, blinded operators were compared with ECG as assessed by 2 board-certified electrophysiologists as the gold-standard. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of linear correlation between the two methods. In a separate cohort comprised of 68 COVID-19 patients treated with combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, telemetry-based QTc values were compared at serial time points after medication administration using Friedman rank-sum test of repeated measures. RESULTS: Telemetry-based QTc measurements highly correlated with QTc values derived from ECG, with correlation coefficients of 0.74, 0.79, 0.85 (individual operators), and 0.84 (mean of all operators). Among the COVID-19 cohort, treatment led to a median QTc increase of 15 milliseconds between baseline and following the 9th dose (p = 0.002), with 8 (12%) patients exhibiting an increase in QTc &#8805; 60 milliseconds and 4 (6%) developing QTc &#8805; 500 milliseconds.

431812,Parent Perceptions of Changes in Child Physical Activity During COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Orders,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Risk prediction models are widely used to inform evidence-based clinical decision making. However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV2 pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergising prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study we selected and reimplemented seven prediction models for COVID-19, which were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergise them for realising personalised predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the UK and 2 from China; total N=5,394) were used to validate all eight models on discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the two countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergised model will have the potential to achieve synergised performances. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combining a diverse set of individual prediction models, ensemble method can synergise a robust and well-performing model by choosing the most competent ones for individual patients.","Wu, Honghan; Zhang, Huayu; Karwath, Andreas; Ibrahim, Zina; Shi, Ting; Zhang, Xin; Wang, Kun; Sun, Jiaxing; Dhaliwal, Kevin; Bean, Daniel; Cardoso, Victor Roth; Li, Kezhi; Teo, James T; Banerjee, Amitava; Gao-Smith, Fang; Whitehouse, Tony; Veenith, Tonny; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Wu, Xiaodong; Dobson, Richard; Guthrie, Bruce",J. am. med. inform. assoc,,27

434182,Public health policy of India and COVID-19: Diagnosis and prognosis of the combating response,2021,"Prior evaluations of the relationship between COVID-19 and weather indicate an inconsistent role of meteorology (weather) in the transmission rate. While some effects due to weather may exist, we found possible misconceptions and biases in the analysis that only consider the impact of meteorological variables alone without considering the urban metabolism and environment. This study highlights that COVID-19 assessments can notably benefit by incorporating factors that account for urban dynamics and environmental exposure. We evaluated the role of weather (considering equivalent temperature that combines the effect of humidity and air temperature) with particular consideration of urban density, mobility, homestay, demographic information, and mask use within communities. Our findings highlighted the importance of considering spatial and temporal scales for interpreting the weather/climate impact on the COVID-19 spread and spatiotemporal lags between the causal processes and effects. On global to regional scales, we found contradictory relationships between weather and the transmission rate, confounded by decentralized policies, weather variability, and the onset of screening for COVID-19, highlighting an unlikely impact of weather alone. At a finer spatial scale, the mobility index (with the relative importance of 34.32%) was found to be the highest contributing factor to the COVID-19 pandemic growth, followed by homestay (26.14%), population (23.86%), and urban density (13.03%). The weather by itself was identified as a noninfluential factor (relative importance < 3%). The findings highlight that the relation between COVID-19 and meteorology needs to consider scale, urban density and mobility areas to improve predictions.","Jamshidi, Sajad; Baniasad, Maryam; Niyogi, Dev",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,27

We investigated the potential mental health risk faced by healthcare professionals working in neonatal units in a multicentre cross-sectional observational study. MethodsWe included all healthcare personnel of 7 level-3 and 6 level-2 neonatal units in Tuscany, Italy. We measured the level of physical exposure to COVID-19 risk, self-reported COVID-related stress, and mental health load outcomes (anxiety, depression, burnout, psychosomatic, and post-traumatic symptoms) via validated, self-administered, on-line questionnaires. ResultsWe analysed 314 complete answers. Scores above the clinical cutoff were reported by 91% of participants for anxious symptoms, 29% for post-traumatic symptoms, 13% for burnout, and 3% for depressive symptoms. Moreover, 50% of the participants reported at least one psychosomatic symptom. COVID-related stress (but not actual physical exposure) was significantly associated with all the measured mental health load outcomes, with a Risk Ratio of 3.33 (95% Confidence interval: 1.89, 5.85) for clinically relevant anxiety, 2.39 (1.69, 3.38) for post-traumatic symptoms, 1.79 (1.16, 2.75) for emotional exhaustion, and 2.51 (0.98, 6.44) for depression.

440712,Myanmar's democracy and health on life support,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Collateral blood supply is a key determinant of outcome in large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. Single- and multiphase CTA collateral scoring systems have been described but are subjective and require training. We aimed to test whether the CTP-derived hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status and whether a threshold hypoperfusion intensity ratio exists that predicts poor CTA collaterals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging and clinical data of consecutive patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were retrospectively reviewed. Single-phase CTA and multiphase CTA scoring were performed by 2 blinded neuroradiologists using the Tan, Maas, and Calgary/Menon methods. CTP was processed using RApid processing of PerfusIon and Diffusion software (RAPID). Hypoperfusion intensity ratio = ratio of brain volume with time-to-maximum >10 seconds over time-to-maximum >6-second volume. Correlation between the hypoperfusion intensity ratio and CTA collateral scores was calculated using the Pearson correlation. The optimal threshold of the hypoperfusion intensity ratio for predicting poor collaterals was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke were included. Multiphase CTA collateral scoring showed better interrater agreement (&#954; = 0.813) than single-phase CTA (Tan, &#954; = 0.587; Maas, &#954; = 0.273). The hypoperfusion intensity ratio correlated with CTA collateral scores (multiphase CTA: r = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.40; P &#8804; .001). The optimal threshold for predicting poor multiphase CTA collateral status was a hypoperfusion intensity ratio of >0.45 (sensitivity = 78%; specificity = 76%; area under the curve = 0.86). Patients with high hypoperfusion intensity ratio/poor collateral status had lower ASPECTS/larger infarcts, higher NIHSS scores, and larger hypoperfused volumes. CONCLUSIONS: The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is associated with CTA collateral status in patients with large-vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke. The hypoperfusion intensity ratio is an automated and quantitative alternative to CTA collateral scoring methods for both clinical and future stroke trial settings.","Lyndon, D; van den Broek, M; Niu, B; Yip, S; Rohr, A; Settecase, F",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,27

440829,Beyond the anti-racist reason: a postcolonial perspective on pandemic politics,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterised by hyperinflammatory state, systemic coagulopathies, and multiorgan involvement, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We here describe our preliminary clinical experience with COVID-19 patients treated via an early initiation of extracorporeal blood purification combined with systemic heparinisation and respiratory support. METHODS: Fifteen patients were included; several biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity were monitored. Personalised treatment was tailored according to the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL- 8, tumour necrosis factor alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophilto- lymphocyte ratio, thrombocyte counts, D-dimers, and fibrinogen. Treatment consisted of respiratory support, extracorporeal blood purification using the AN69ST (oXiris®) hemofilter, and 300 U/kg heparin to maintain activation clotting time &#8805; 180 seconds. RESULTS: Ten patients presented with severe to critical disease (dyspnoea, hypoxia, respiratory rate > 30/min, peripheral oxygen saturation < 90%, or > 50% lung involvement on X-ray imaging). The median intensive care unit length of stay was 9.3 days (interquartile range 5.3-10.1); two patients developed ARDS and died after 5 and 26 days. Clinical improvement was associated with normalisation (increase) of thrombocytes and white blood cells, stable levels of IL-6 (< 50 ng/mL), and a decrease of CRP and fibrinogen. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of COVID-19 severity biomarkers and radiological imaging is crucial to assess disease progression, uncontrolled inflammation, and to avert irreversible multiorgan failure. The combination of systemic heparin anticoagulation regimens and extracorporeal blood purification using cytokine-adsorbing hemofilters may reduce hyperinflammation, prevent coagulopathy, and support clinical recovery.","Ugurov, Petar; Popevski, Dijana; Gramosli, Tanja; Neziri, Dashurie; Vuckova, Dragica; Gjorgon, Marko; Stoicovski, Emil; Marinkovic, Sanja; Veljanovska-Kiridjievska, Lidija; Ignevska, Katerina; Mehandziska, Sanja; Ambarkova, Elena; Mitrev, Zan; Rosalia, Rodney Alexander",,,27

442656,COVID-SCORE Spain: Public perceptions of key government COVID-19 control measures,2021,"Why do some organizations bounce-back from traumatic events more quickly than others? While the research on organizations offers extensive insights on recovery from economic or technological shocks, there is limited understanding of how organizations recover from life-threatening events such as terrorist attacks. In this study, we build on the research on resilience and argue that organizational recovery from a traumatic event is informed by the perception of threat. Higher perception of threat increases inter-organizational collaboration and the care associated with the deployment of slack as well as to learning. We tested our arguments with a sample of US and non-US firms before and after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and found that, due to spatial proximity, US firms' higher perception of threat led to a larger increase in the frequency of inter-organizational alliances than that of non-US firms. This preference was more frequently directed towards local partners and demonstrated a distinct emphasis on slack and learning. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our findings suggest that organizational resilience in the face of a traumatic event benefits not from immunity but from spatial proximity to the threat. Proximity increases the perception of threat, and with it, the impetus for adaptation.","Mithani, Murad A; Gopalakrishnan, Shanthi; Santoro, Michael D",Long Range Plann,,27

While the correct use of terminology for some languages and domains can be achieved by adapting general-purpose MT systems on large volumes of in-domain parallel data, such quantities of domain-specific data are seldom available for less-resourced languages and niche domains. Furthermore, as exemplified by COVID-19 recently, no domain-specific parallel data is readily available for emerging domains. However, the gravity of this recent calamity created a high demand for reliable translation of critical information regarding pandemic and infection prevention.

This study aims to investigate the daily TC and the percentage of positive cases over the tested population (PPCTP) to evaluate the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) trajectory phase and generate benchmarks on desirable TC. Data were retrieved from government facilities, including 101 countries and 55 areas in the USA. We have divided the pandemic situations of investigated areas into four phases, i.e., low-level, suppressing, widespread, or uncertain transmission phase. Findings indicate each country should increase TC to roughly two tests per thousand people each day. Additionally, based on TC, a susceptible-unconfirmed-confirmed-recovered (SUCR) model, which can capture the dynamic growth of confirmed cases and estimate the group size of unconfirmed cases in a country or area, is proposed. We examined our proposed SUCR model for 55 areas in the USA. Results show that the SUCR model can accurately capture the dynamic growth of confirmed cases in each area. By increasing TC by five times and applying strict control measures, the total number of COVID-19 patients would reduce to 33%.","Zhan, Choujun; Chen, Jiaqi; Zhang, Haijun",Information sciences,,27

445253,Estimating the Instantaneous Asymptomatic Proportion With a Simple Approach: Exemplified With the Publicly Available COVID-19 Surveillance Data in Hong Kong,2021,"Background: Whereas accumulating studies on COVID-19 patients report high incidences of thrombotic complications, large studies on clinically relevant thrombosis in patients with other respiratory tract infections are lacking. How this high risk in COVID-19 patients compares to those observed in hospitalized patients with other viral pneumonias such as influenza is unknown. Objectives: To assess the incidence of venous and arterial thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients as opposed to that observed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study; we used data from Statistics Netherlands (study period: 2018) on thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients. In parallel, we assessed the cumulative incidence of thrombotic complications - adjusted for competing risk of death - in patients with COVID-19 in three Dutch hospitals (February 24th - April 26th 2020). Results: Of the 13.217 hospitalized influenza patients, 437 (3.3%) were diagnosed with thrombotic complications, versus 66 (11%) of the 579 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The 30-day cumulative incidence of any thrombotic complication in influenza was 11% (95%CI 9.4-12) versus 25% (95%CI 18-32) in COVID-19. For venous thrombotic complications (VTE) and arterial thrombotic complications alone, these numbers were respectively 3.6% (95%CI 2.7-4.6) and 7.5% (95%CI 6.3-8.8) in influenza versus 23% (95%CI 16-29) and 4.4% (95%CI 1.9-8.8) in COVID-19. Conclusions: The incidence of thrombotic complications in hospitalized influenza patients was lower than in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This difference was mainly driven by a high risk of VTE complications in the COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU. Remarkably, influenza patients were more often diagnosed with arterial thrombotic complications.","Stals, Mam; Grootenboers, Mjjh; van Guldener, C; Kaptein, Fhj; Braken, Sje; Chen, Q; Chu, G; van Driel, E M; Iglesias Del Sol, A; de Jonge, E; Kant, K M; Pals, F; Toorop, Mma; Cannegieter, S C; Klok, F A; Huisman, M V",,,27
446383,"Masks Are the New Condoms: Health Communication, Intersectionality and Racial Equity in COVID-Times",2020,"Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD) is a Chinese herbal medicine newly formulated for the treatment of COVID-19. QFPD significantly enhances the therapeutic effects of stan- dard pharmacotherapy in mild to critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, limited information is available on the immunological mechanisms underlying the efficacy of QFPD. In addition, the feasibility of the prophylactic administration of QFPD to uninfected individuals remains unconfirmed. To obtain insight into these issues, an open-label, single-arm pilot study was conducted using 19 healthy uninfected individuals as subjects, and the effects of QFPD ingestion at a dose lower than that recommended for therapeutic use on hematological and immunological parameters were examined. QFPD was prepared according to the Chinese official clinical guideline, except that the dose of each herb was reduced to 1/30 and administered orally to the participants twice daily for 3 days. Low-dose QFPD ingestion significantly increased the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (P=0.000107), interleukin (IL)-1β (P=0.000982), IL-18 (P=0.00105), IL-2 (P=0.0483) and IL-8 (P=0.000191), key mediators of a broad spectrum of antiviral immunity. No apparent adverse effects were observed during the trial. These findings suggest that the clinical efficacy of QFPD against COVID-19 is, at least in part, associated with its immunological activity to mimic the blood cytokine environ- ment produced by early antiviral immune responses, which are shown to be profoundly suppressed during the early stages of COVID-19. The daily ingestion of low-dose QFPD may thus be a possible option for the prevention of COVID-19 during the epidemic.

446607,"Rethinking pandemic preparation: Global Health Security Index (GHSI) is predictive of COVID-19 burden, but in the opposite direction",2020,"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can have symptoms that rapidly evolve to profound hypoxaemia and death. The efficacy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe ARDS in the context of COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with respiratory failure and COVID-19 treated with ECMO. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was done in the Paris-Sorbonne University Hospital Network, comprising five intensive care units (ICUs) and included patients who received ECMO for COVID-19 associated ARDS. Patient demographics and daily pre-ECMO and on-ECMO data and outcomes were collected. Possible outcomes over time were categorised into four different states (states 1-4): on ECMO, in the ICU and weaned off ECMO, alive and out of ICU, or death. Daily probabilities of occupation in each state and of transitions between these states until day 90 post-ECMO onset were estimated with use of a multi-state Cox model stratified for each possible transition. Follow-up was right-censored on July 10, 2020. FINDINGS: From March 8 to May 2, 2020, 492 patients with COVID-19 were treated in our ICUs. Complete day-60 follow-up was available for 83 patients (median age 49 [IQR 41-56] years and 61 [73%] men) who received ECMO. Pre-ECMO, 78 (94%) patients had been prone-positioned; their median driving pressure was 18 (IQR 16-21) cm H2O and PaO2/FiO2 was 60 (54-68) mm Hg. At 60 days post-ECMO initiation, the estimated probabilities of occupation in each state were 6% (95% CI 3-14) for state 1, 18% (11-28) for state 2, 45% (35-56) for state 3, and 31% (22-42) for state 4. 35 (42%) patients had major bleeding and four (5%) had a haemorrhagic stroke. 30 patients died. INTERPRETATION: The estimated 60-day survival of ECMO-rescued patients with COVID-19 was similar to that of studies published in the past 2 years on ECMO for severe ARDS. If another COVID-19 outbreak occurs, ECMO should be considered for patients developing refractory respiratory failure despite optimised care.

In this study, the predictors of ARDS were investigated and a score that can predict progression to ARDS in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was developed. All patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020, at five university hospitals in Korea were enrolled. Their demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics and the outcomes were collected using the World Health Organization COVID-19 Case Report Form. A logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors for ARDS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for the scoring model. Of the 166 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 37 (22.3%) patients developed ARDS. The areas under the curves for the infiltration on a chest X-ray, C-reactive protein, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and age, for prediction of ARDS were 0.91, 0.90, 0.87, and 0.80, respectively (all P < 0.001).

457664,Public Sphere in Crisis Mode: How the Covid-19 Pandemic Influenced Public Discourse and User Behaviour in the Swiss Twitter-Sphere,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory illnesses from COVID19 infection are increasing globally. Reports from earlier in the pandemic suggested that patients hospitalized for COVID19 are at particularly high risk for pulmonary embolism (PE). To estimate the incidences of PE during hospitalization for COVID19, we performed a rigorous systematic review of published literature. METHODS: We searched for case series, cohort studies and clinical trials from December 1, 2019 to July 13, 2020 that reported the incidence of PE among consecutive patients who were hospitalized for COVID19 in ICUs and in non-ICU hospital wards. To reflect the general population of hospitalized COVID19 patients, we excluded studies in which subject enrollment was linked to the clinical suspicion for venous thromboembolism (VTE). RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included in the analysis. The combined random effects estimate of PE incidence among all hospitalized COVID19 patients was 7.1% (95% CI: 5.2%, 9.1%). Studies with larger sample sizes reported significantly lower PE incidences than smaller studies (r2 = 0.161, p = 0.036). The PE incidence among studies that included 400 or more patients was 3.0% (95% CI: 1.7%, 4.6%). Among COVID19 patients admitted to ICUs, the combined estimated PE incidence was 13.7% (95% CI: 8.0%, 20.6%). The incidence of ICU-related PE also decreased as the study sample sizes increased. The single largest COVID19 ICU study (n = 2215) disclosed a PE incidence of 2.3% (95% CI: 1.7%, 3.0%). CONCLUSION: PE incidences among hospitalized COVID19 patients are much lower than has been previously postulated based on smaller, often biased study reports. The incidence of ""microthrombosis,"" leading to occlusion of microscopic blood vessels, remains unknown.","Gallastegui, Nicolas; Zhou, Jenny Y; Drygalski, Annette von; Barnes, Richard F W; Fernandes, Timothy M; Morris, Timothy A",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,,27

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A key informant survey was used to enquire about the changes expected in the specialty over the next 5 years. The survey was completed by heads of neurology departments with broad knowledge of the situation, having been active during the pandemic. RESULTS: Despite a low level of consensus between participants, there was strong (85%) and moderate consensus (70%) about certain subjects, mainly the increase in precautions to be taken, the use of telemedicine and teleconsultations, the reduction of care provided in in-person consultations to avoid the presence of large numbers of people in waiting rooms, the development of remote training solutions, and the changes in monitoring visits during clinical trials. There was consensus that there would be no changes to the indication of complementary testing or neurological examination. CONCLUSION: The key informant survey identified the foreseeable changes in neurological care after the pandemic.","Matías-Guiu, J; Matias-Guiu, J A; Alvarez-Sabin, J; Ramon Ara, J; Arenillas, J; Casado-Naranjo, I; Castellanos, M; Jimenez-Hernandez, M D; Lainez-Andres, J M; Moral, E; Morales, A; Rodriguez-Antigüedad, A; Segura, T; Serrano-Castro, P; Diez-Tejedor, E",Neurologia,,27

This purportedly proactive policy aimed to advance digital and green industries to lay the groundwork for the post-pandemic era. This article examines the South Korean government's early proposal of a post-pandemic policy, titled the Korean New Deal, in order to explore how the pandemic crisis may affect the policymakers' envisioning of the post-crisis society. Moreover, the study examines how this early predictive plan may reveal the ways in which the pandemic is utilized for discursive politics. Drawing on the critical discourse analysis of policy documents and news coverage, this article questions how the ""old"" language of the developmental state is incorporated into the ""new"" policy. The study also shows how COVID-19's impacts and uncertainties are translated into political discourses.","Yoon, Kyong",East Asia (Piscataway),,27

464752,Reactive nitrogen compounds and their influence on human health: an overview,2021,"OBJECTIVES: to provide a description of inequalities in overall and COVID-19 mortality by ecological socioeconomic measures (ESEMs) during the first outbreak peak (March and April 2020) in Emilia-Romagna Region. DESIGN: cross-sectional study based on the record linkage of the COVID-19 notification system, the regional population health register and the 2011 census data. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: residents in Emilia-Romagna who were grouped according to three ESEMs calculated at census block level: the index of deprivation, the household crowding, and the percentage of the foreign resident population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: counts of all deaths and those directly attributable to COVID-19. The association between mortality and ESEMs was assessed through rate differences and mortality rate ratios, estimated through Poisson models. RESULTS: during the outbreak peak, the nine provinces of the Emilia-Romagna Region were unequally hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, with Piacenza recording the highest COVID-19 absolute death toll and Ferrara the lowest. The overall and COVID-19 mortality burden was unequal also in terms of ecological socioeconomic measures. Percentage differences in the age-standardised mortality rates between the least and the most disadvantaged census blocks were greater for COVID-19 mortality than for overall mortality, suggesting that the Coronavirus outbreak has had a stronger impact on the most socioeconomically deprived areas. Although clear gradients were not always present, people living in the most disadvantaged census blocks experienced the highest absolute and relative risk of dying. Rate differences were larger among men, but mortality rate ratios were not always greater among men than women, especially for the COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: these descriptive yet informative results are relevant to document inequalities and inform regional public health policies and interventions in case of new COVID-19 surges.","Di Girolamo, Chiara; Bartolini, Letizia; Caranci, Nicola; Moro, Maria Luisa",Epidemiol Prev,,27

METHODS: Online survey among members of the Association of Chief Physicians for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in North Rhine-Westphalia (LLPP) and analysis of protocols of LLPP board meetings. RESULTS: Changes in the practice of involuntary hospitalization have been perceived in contexts with and without direct reference to COVID-19. These changes have affected, among other things, judicial hearings as well as decisions about the use of coercive measures. CONCLUSION: Procedural standards for involuntary hospitalization must be maintained and coercive measures may only be used if they meet the applicable ethical and legal requirements. It must be ensured that people with mental disorders are not treated unequally both when taking and withdrawing restrictive measures to contain the pandemic.","Gather, Jakov; Efkemann, Simone Agnes; Henking, Tanja; Scholten, Matthé; Köhne, Martin; Chrysanthou, Christos; Hoffmann, Knut; Juckel, Georg",Psychiatr. prax,,27

The objective of this study was to assess the impact of this change in informing the potential viability of a longer-term shift to telehealth in the outpatient setting. A retrospective analysis was performed using data from the first COVID-19 wave, comprising 2998 telehealth patient surveys and 143,321 distinct outpatient contacts through both the physical and virtual medium. Four in five specialities showed no significant change in the overall number of consultations per patient during the first wave of the pandemic when telehealth services were widely implemented. Of those surveyed following virtual consultation, more respondents 'preferred' virtual (36.4%) than physical appointments (26.9%) with seven times as many finding them 'less stressful' than 'more stressful'. In combining both patient survey and routine activity data, this study demonstrates the importance of using data from multiple sources to derive useful insight. The results support the potential for telehealth to be rapidly employed across a range of outpatient specialities without negatively affecting patient experience.","Tyler, Joshua M B; Pratt, Adrian C; Wooster, Job; Vasilakis, Christos; Wood, Richard M",Int. j. health plann. manage,,27

Furthermore, all deceased patients were severe/critical cases. The main reasons for the high mortality of severe/critical patients are advanced age (>60 years old) and combined underlying diseases. Elderly patients with comorbidities show decreased organ function and low compensation for damage such as hypoxia and inflammation, which accelerates disease progression. The lung is the main target organ attacked by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) while immune organs, liver, blood vessels and other organs are damaged to varying degrees. Liver volume is increased, and mild active inflammation and focal necrosis are observed in the portal area. Virus particles have also been detected in liver cells. Therefore, multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and individualized treatment plans, accurate prediction of disease progression and timely interventions are vital to effectively reduce mortality. Specifically, a ""multidisciplinary three-dimensional management, individualized comprehensive plan"" should be implemented. The treatment plan complies with three principles, namely, multidisciplinary management of patients, individualized diagnosis and treatment plans, and timely monitoring and intervention of disease. MDT members are mainly physicians from critical medicine, infection and respiratory disciplines, but also include cardiovascular, kidney, endocrine, digestion, nerve, nutrition, rehabilitation, psychology and specialty care. According to a patient's specific disease condition, an individualized diagnosis and treatment plan is formulated (one plan for one patient). While selecting individualized antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment, we also strengthen nutritional support, psychological intervention, comprehensive rehabilitation and timely and full-course intervention to develop overall and special nursing plans. In response to the rapid progression of severe/critical patients, MDT members need to establish a three-dimensional management model with close observation and timely evaluation. The MDT should make rounds of the quarantine wards both morning and night, and of critical patient wards nightly, to implement ""round-the-clock rounds management"", to accurately predict disease progression, perform the quick intervention and prevent rapid deterioration of the patient. Our MDT has cumulatively treated 77 severe/critical COVID-19 cases, including 62 (80.5%) severe cases and 15 (19.5%) critical cases, with an average age of 63.8 years. Fifty-three (68.8%) cases presented with more than one underlying disease and 65 (84.4%) severe cases recovered from COVID-19. The average hospital stay of severe/critical cases was 22 days, and the mortality rate was 2.6%, both of which were significantly lower than the 30-40 days and 49.0-61.5%, respectively, reported in the literature. Therefore, a multidisciplinary, three-dimensional and individualized comprehensive treatment plan can effectively reduce the mortality rate of severe/critical COVID-19 and improve the cure rate.","Yang, Qing",,,27

However, data are limited on how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters and spreads in a population. METHODS: We targeted testing to persons living in Iceland who were at high risk for infection (mainly those who were symptomatic, had recently traveled to high-risk countries, or had contact with infected persons). We also carried out population screening using two strategies: issuing an open invitation to 10,797 persons and sending random invitations to 2283 persons. We sequenced SARS-CoV-2 from 643 samples. RESULTS: As of April 4, a total of 1221 of 9199 persons (13.3%) who were recruited for targeted testing had positive results for infection with SARS-CoV-2. Of those tested in the general population, 87 (0.8%) in the open-invitation screening and 13 (0.6%) in the random-population screening tested positive for the virus. In total, 6% of the population was screened. Most persons in the targeted-testing group who received positive tests early in the study had recently traveled internationally, in contrast to those who tested positive later in the study.

480923,Digital Health during COVID-19: Informatics Dialogue with the World Health Organization,2021,"An outbreak of novel coronavirus-related pneumonia COVID-19, that was identified in December 2019, has expanded rapidly, with cases now confirmed in more than 211 countries or areas. This constant transmission of a novel coronavirus and its ability to spread from human to human have prompted scientists to develop new approaches for treatment of COVID-19. A recent study has shown that remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the replication and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCov) in vitro. In the United States, one case of COVID-19 was successfully treated with compassionate use of remdesivir in January of 2020. In addition, a clinically proven protease inhibitor, camostat mesylate, has been demonstrated to inhibit Calu-3 infection with SARS-CoV-2 and prevent SARS-2-spike protein (S protein)-mediated entry into primary human lung cells. Here, we systemically discuss the pharmacological therapeutics targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), proteinase and S protein for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review should shed light on the fundamental rationale behind inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes RdRp as new therapeutic approaches for management of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we will discuss the viability and challenges in targeting RdRp and proteinase, and application of natural product quinoline and its analog chloroquine for treatment of coronavirus infection. Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Huang, Jiansheng; Song, Wenliang; Huang, Hui; Sun, Quancai",J.

487066,Does the rise of robotic technology make people healthier?,2021,"Canada has been home to a longstanding public health crisis related to opioids, including an extensive mortality and morbidity toll in the face of substantive intervention gaps. Recently (2019), two extensive reports from preeminent federal authorities - the Chief Public Health Officer and the Mental Health Commission of Canada - have been tabled with detailed, core focus on the phenomenon of 'stigma' and its impacts on substance/opioid use and harms. The reports present extensive descriptions of the nature and effects, as well as a multitude of prescriptions for remedial measures and actions to ""stop the cycle of stigma"". Closer reading of the documents, however, suggests substantial conceptual and empirical limitations in the characterization of the - multi-faceted and challenging - nature and workings of 'stigma' as a socio-political, structural or individual process or force, specifically as it applies to and negatively affects substance use and related outcomes, primarily the wellbeing of substance users. Concretely, it is unclear how the remedial actions proposed will materially alleviate stigma process and impacts, especially given apparent gaps in the issues examined, including essential strategies - for example, reform of drug user criminalization as a fundamental element and driver of structural stigma - for action that directly relate to the jurisdictions and privileged mandates of the report sources themselves as health and policy leaders. The commentary provides some concrete while subjective notes and observations on the dynamics of stigma as applies to and framed for substance/opioid use, as well as strategies and measures necessary to both tangibly address the material health and wellbeing of substance users, and related forces of stigma, in the distinct context of the opioid crisis in Canada.","Fischer, Benedikt",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,,27

A key challenge of controlling COVID-19 is the large proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (ACCs) that makes breaking the transmission chains even harder. Unfortunately, till now there is still a lack of cost-effective approaches to detect ACCs except doing a medical screening of the entire population. This paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory for COVID-19 tracing (STEM-COVID) for identifying ACCs from contact tracing data. Based on fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (fusion ART), STEM-COVID provides a mechanism to encode the collective spatio-temporal episodic memory traces of individuals, based on which parallel searches of ACCs can be performed in a computationally efficient manner by pooling together the episodic traces of the identified positive cases. To illustrate the effectiveness of STEM-COVID, a simulation model of the COVID-19 spreading is implemented based on recent epidemiological findings on ACCs. The experimental results based on multiple simulation scenarios show that the STEM-COVID model is able to identify ACCs with a reasonably high level of accuracy and efficiency.","Hu, Yue; Subagdja, Budhitama; Tan, Ah-Hwee; Yin, Quanjun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.00187v2.pdf,27
488951,Correction to: Amid COVID-19: the importance of developing an positive adverse drug reaction (ADR) and medical device incident (MDI) reporting culture for Global Health and public safety,2020,"BACKGROUND: Dysfunction in the late Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) is responsible for endothelial repair in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), and the shear stress is beneficial for EPCs function. However, the impact of shear stress on the capacity of EPCs in CAD patients has not been elucidated yet. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 7/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (CXCR7)/(ERK) pathways are identified to regulate EPCs function in CAD patients. Here, we hypothesize that shear stress upregulates the CXCR7/ERK pathways, which restore the EPCs function in CAD patients. METHODS: The human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy adults and CAD patients and then used for EPCs cultivation. The Lv-siRNA for human CXCR7 was transfected into induced EPCs isolated from the CAD patients. Meanwhile, the EPCs from CAD patients were subjected to shear stress generated by a biomimetic device. Next, the cell viability, migration, tube formation, and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, Transwell assay, Matrigel, and flow cytometry, respectively. Also, the CXCR7/ERK pathways in human EPCs were analyzed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULT: Compared to the EPCs collected from normal adults, the CAD patient-derived EPCs showed reduced in vitro vasculogenic capacity. Also, the level of CXCR7 in CAD patient-derived EPCs was significantly reduced compared to the EPCs of healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which represents a CXCR7 downstream signaling pathway, had decreased phosphorylation level. The shear stress treatment augmented the CXCR7 expression and also elevated ERK phosphorylation, which is comparable to the up-regulation of CAD patient-derived EPCs function. Further, the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated CXCR7 knockdown diminished the enhanced migration, adhesion, and tube formation capacity of shear stress treated CAD patient-derived EPCs. CONCLUSION: Up-regulation of the CXCR7/ERK pathways by shear stress can be a promising new target in enhancing the vasculogenic ability of CAD patient-derived EPCs.","Zhou, Hua; Tu, Qiang; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Hua Qiang; Shuai, Qing Yun; Huang, Xiao Chuan; Fu, Jie; Cao, Zheng",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,,27
489897,Community Susceptibility and Resiliency to COVID-19 Across the Rural-Urban Continuum in the United States,2020,"Le syndrome d'inflammation périvasculaire transitoire de l'artère carotide (TIPIC) est une entité de description récente caractérisée par une douleur cervicale aiguë sur le trajet de l'artère carotide cédant spontanément ou sous anti-inflammatoires en quelques jours. Cette pathologie était qualifiée jusqu'à présent de rare : la plus grande série publiée fait état de 47 patients diagnostiqués en sept ans au sein de dix centres spécialisés en neurologie [1]. Nous rapportons ici trois nouveaux cas de TIPIC syndrome diagnostiqués en l'espace de 12 mois dans un service de médecine interne. Cas n°1 : Un homme de 79 ans sujet aux migraines ophtalmiques présente fin novembre un tableau neurologique aigu à type de paresthésies du membre inférieur droit, suivies de scintillements visuels. L'IRM cérébrale ne trouve pas de lésion ischémique constituée, et un traitement par aspirine est débuté dans l'hypothèse d'un accident ischémique transitoire. L'électromyogramme, réalisé devant la persistance de paresthésies des deux pieds, est normal. Une semaine plus tard, il se plaint d'une douleur cervicale gauche. La CRP est normale mais la VS élevée à 92 mm/h. L'angio-IRM montre un infiltrat péri-carotidien gauche. Les douleurs cèdent spontanément en quelques jours et le doppler artériel de contrôle à une semaine est sans anomalie. Cas n°2 : Un homme de 42 ans, sans antécédent, présente mi-août une douleur latéro-cervicale droite. L'échographie doppler identifie un épaississement excentrique de la paroi du bulbe carotidien droit;l'angioscanner montre un épaississement pariétal carotidien primitif droit évalué à 3,2 mm ;le PET scanner, réalisé après résolution des symptômes, met en évidence quelques fixations ganglionnaires cervicales gauches, sans hyperfixation de la carotide. Les douleurs cèdent spontanément en deux semaines. L'angioscanner de contrôle retrouve toujours un épaississement circonférentiel de 3 mm de la carotide pré-bulbaire droite un mois après la résolution des symptômes. Le patient présente une rechute 4 mois après les premières manifestations. Cas n°3 : Un homme de 50 ans aux antécédents de céphalées de tension se plaint début novembre de cervicalgies gauches. Il décrit une agueusie et une anosmie brutales en octobre, évoquant une infection récente à la Covid-19. L'échographie cervicale et l'angio-IRM identifient un épaississement inflammatoire quasi circonférentiel du bulbe carotidien gauche ;l'angioscanner–réalisé tardivement - uniquement une plaque d'athérome non calcifiée responsable d'une sténose à 50 % de l'origine du bulbe carotidien gauche. Un traitement par aspirine est débuté et les douleurs évoluent favorablement. Le PET scanner à un mois de la résolution des symptômes ne trouve pas d'hyperfixation artérielle, y compris carotidienne gauche. Notre premier patient présente une symptomatologie neurologique. Ces symptômes neurologiques sont variés et présents dans 17 % des cas : vertiges, paralysie faciale périphérique, dysesthésie et déficit moteur ont été décrits. Ils doivent faire éliminer un accident vasculaire cérébral. L'élévation des marqueurs de l'inflammation (CRP ou VS) n'est pas habituelle, présente chez 6 % des patients seulement [1]. Le second cas chez un patient jeune sans antécédent est tout à fait typique, avec une rechute à 4 mois du diagnostic. Les rechutes sont observées chez 20 % des patients, dans un délai de 1 à 6 mois. Le principal facteur de risque identifié est une maladie auto-immune associée ;la rechute survient alors à la faveur d'une poussée de la maladie. Des anomalies persistantes à l'imagerie sont possibles, comme chez ce patient, et doivent faire éliminer une maladie de Takayasu. Elles laissent craindre le développement secondaire d'une athérosclérose, justifiant un suivi prolongé [1,2]. Un antécédent d'infection virale a été identifié chez 4 % des patients seulement, mais la question de l'imputabilité de l'infection à coronav rus dans la physiopathologie de la maladie se pose dans notre troisième cas. Comme chez ce patient, une sténose modérée associée ou non à une plaque d'athérome non calcifiée est retrouvée dans 38 % des cas, sans modification hémodynamique [1]. Ces trois cas diagnostiqués en l'espace de douze mois à la consultation d'un service de médecine interne sont en faveur d'une fréquence relativement élevée du TIPIC syndrome, probablement sous-estimée du fait de symptômes cliniques modérés et transitoires et d'une méconnaissance des cliniciens. Le TIPIC syndrome n'est sans doute pas aussi rare que ce que des études limitées ont laissé penser. L'interniste peut dont être amené à prendre en charge cette pathologie. Il doit connaître le TIPIC syndrome, savoir le distinguer d'une vascularite, et ainsi limiter les explorations complémentaires dans cette pathologie bénigne.

The aim of the present study was to examine associations between the perceptions of information overload and wellbeing in China during the initial phase of COVID-19. (2) Methods: The present research involved a cross-sectional online survey, which controlled for established predictors of wellbeing and the perception of general (not COVID-19-specific) information overload. The setting of the research was China, February 2020. A total of 1349 participants completed an online survey, and the results from 1240 members of the general public who stated that they were uninfected are reported here (55.6% female;49.4% single;age distribution: 17-25 years: 26%;26-30 years: 24.3%;31-40 years: 23.9%;41-50 years: 16.2%;51 years+: 9.6%;the most frequent occupations were: 21.5% students;19.5% teachers;25.9% office workers;10.8% managers, plus a few in a wide range of jobs). The outcomes were positive wellbeing (positive affect and life satisfaction) and negative wellbeing (stress, negative affect, anxiety and depression). (3) Results: Regressions were carried out, controlling for established predictors of wellbeing (psychological capital, general information overload, positive and negative coping). Spending time getting information about COVID-19 was associated with more positive wellbeing. In contrast, perceptions of COVID-19 information overload and feeling panic due to COVID-19 were associated with more negative wellbeing. (4) Conclusions: These results have implications for the communication of information about COVID-19 to the general public and form the basis for further research on the topic.","Fan, J.; Smith, A.

491963,Neha News,2021,"BACKGROUND: Maintaining balance in response to perturbations during walking often requires the use of corrective responses to keep the center of mass within the base of support. The relationship between the center of mass and base of support is often quantified using the margin of stability. Although people post-stroke increase the margin of stability following perturbations, control deficits may lead to asymmetries in regulation of margins of stability, which may also cause maladaptive coupling between the sagittal and frontal planes during balance-correcting responses. METHODS: We assessed how paretic and non-paretic margins of stability are controlled during recovery from forward perturbations and determined how stroke-related impairments influence the coupling between the anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability. Twenty-one participants with post-stroke hemiparesis walked on a treadmill while receiving slip-like perturbations on both limbs at foot-strike. We assessed anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability before perturbations and during perturbation recovery. FINDINGS: Participants walked with smaller anteroposterior and larger mediolateral margins of stability on the paretic versus non-paretic sides. When responding to perturbations, participants increased the anteroposterior margin of stability bilaterally by extending the base of support and reducing the excursion of the extrapolated center of mass. The anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability in the paretic limb negatively covaried during reactive steps such that increases in anteroposterior were associated with reductions in mediolateral margins of stability. INTERPRETATION: Balance training interventions to reduce fall risk post-stroke may benefit from incorporating strategies to reduce maladaptive coupling of frontal and sagittal plane stability.","Buurke, Tom J W; Liu, Chang; Park, Sungwoo; den Otter, Rob; Finley, James M","Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)",,27
491964,Neha News,2020,"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.","Moore, Colman; Borum, Raina M; Mantri, Yash; Xu, Ming; Fajtová, Pavla; O039,; Donoghue, Anthony J; Jokerst, Jesse V",ACS Sens,,27

493189,$6·5 billion proposed for new US health research agency,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The effect of anti-infective agents in COVID-19 is unclear. The impact of changes in practice on prognosis over time has not been evaluated. METHODS: Single center, retrospective study in adults hospitalized in a medicine ward for COVID-19 from March 5th to April 25th 2020. Patient characteristics were compared between two periods (before/after March 19th) considering French guidelines. The aim of the study was to evaluate how medical care impacted unfavorable outcome, namely admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and/or death. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were admitted: mean age 59.0±16.3 years; mean C-reactive protein (CRP) level 84.0±71.1 mg/L; 46% had a lymphocyte count <1000/mm3. Prescribed anti-infective agents were lopinavir-ritonavir (n=12), azithromycin (AZI) (n=28) and AZI combined with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (n=52). There was a significant decrease in ICU admission, from 43% to 12%, between the two periods (P<0.0001). Delays until transfer to ICU were similar between periods (P=0.86). Pulmonary computerized tomography (CT)-scans were performed significantly more often with time (from 50% to 90%, P<0.0001), and oxygen-dependency (53% vs 80%, P=0.001) and prescription of AZI±HCQ (from 25% to 76%, P<0.0001) were also greater over time. Multivariate analyses showed a reduction of unfavorable outcome in patients receiving AZI±HCQ (hazard ratio [HR]=0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.21-0.97], P=0.04), particularly among an identified category of individuals (lymphocyte &#8805;1000/mm3 or CRP &#8805;100 mg/L). CONCLUSION: The present study showed a significant decrease in admission to ICU over time, which was probably related to multiple factors, including a better indication of pulmonary CT-scan, oxygen therapy, and a suitable prescription of anti-infective agents.","Davido, Benjamin; Boussaid, Ghilas; Vaugier, Isabelle; Lansaman, Thibaud; Bouchand, Frédérique; Lawrence, Christine; Alvarez, Jean-Claude; Moine, Pierre; Perronne, Véronique; Barbot, Frédéric; Saleh-Mghir, Azzam; Perronne, Christian; Annane, Djillali; De Truchis, Pierre",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,27

Here, we examined the impact of lockdown on the air quality index (AQI) [including ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and ammonia (NH3)] and tropospheric NO2 and O3 densities through Sentinel-5 satellite data approximately 1 d post-lockdown and one month pre-lockdown and post-lockdown. Our findings revealed a marked reduction in the ambient AQI (estimated mean reduction of 17.75% and 20.70%, respectively), tropospheric NO2 density, and land surface temperature (LST) during post-lockdown compared with the pre-lockdown period or corresponding months in 2019, except for a few sites with substantial coal mining and active power plants. We observed a modest increase in the O3 density post-lockdown, thereby indicating improved tropospheric air quality. As a favorable outcome of the COVID-19 lockdown, road accident-related mortalities declined by 72-folds. Cities with poor air quality correlate with higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (r = 0.504 and r = 0.590 for NO2; r = 0.744 and r = 0.435 for AQI). Conversely, low mortality was reported in cities with better air quality. These results show a correlation between the COVID-19 vulnerable regions and AQI hotspots, thereby suggesting that air pollution may exacerbate clinical manifestations of the disease. However, a prolonged lockdown may nullify the beneficial environmental outcomes by adversely affecting socioeconomic and health aspects.","Naqvi, Hasan Raja; Datta, Manali; Mutreja, Guneet; Siddiqui, Masood Ahsan; Naqvi, Daraksha Fatima; Naqvi, Afsar Raza",Environ Pollut,,27

Risk and protective factors for depression and generalized anxiety in healthcare workers need to be identified to protect their health and ability to work. Social support and optimism are known protective psychosocial resources, but have not been adequately studied in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers in Germany. METHODS: Within the first wave of the VOICE study (n = 7765), a longitudinal web-based survey study among healthcare workers in Germany, we assessed symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and generalized anxiety (GAD-2), social support (ENRICHD Social Support Inventory;ESSI), and generalized optimism as well as sociodemographic, occupational, and COVID-19 related variables. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between the constructs. RESULTS: The analyses revealed that higher levels of social support and optimism were associated with lower levels of depression and generalized anxiety. They showed a higher association with depression and generalized anxiety than demographic or occupational risk factors such as female gender and direct contact with infected individuals. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial resources such as social support and optimism appear to contribute to successful coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and should be considered in future studies.","Schug, C.; Morawa, E.; Geiser, F.; Hiebel, N.; Beschoner, P.; Jerg-Bretzke, L.; Albus, C.; Weidner, K.; Steudte-Schmiedgen, S.; Borho, A.; Lieb, M.; Erim, Y.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,27

500678,When time falls apart: The public health implications of distorted time perception in the age of COVID-19,2020,"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has forced important changes in health care worldwide. Stroke care networks have been affected, especially acute admissions and ancillary tests availability. We assessed the impact of the pandemic and the lockdowns imposed in stroke admissions in Latin America. Methods: A multinational study (7 countries, 18 centers) of patients admitted since the pandemic outbreak (January - June 2020). These cases were compared with the same period in 2019. We also assessed patterns during the strictest lockdown period (March-June 2020). Number of cases, stroke etiology and severity, acute care and functional outcomes were compared per periods, months, centers and countries. Results: There were 1863 stroke cases in 2019 and 1781 cases in 2020 (p=0.02). We found a significant increase in strokes of undetermined etiology due to incomplete studies in 2020 [16.8% vs 27.6%, p&lt;0.001]). Most countries reported decreases in all-type stroke admissions, except México and Brasil (16% and 36% increases in admissions, respectively). There were no significant differences among months. All-type mortality increased (6.2% vs. 12.6%, p&lt;0.001), and poor functional outcome (mRs 3-6) increased from 32.2% to 38.8% (p=0.007) in 2020. During the period of strict lockdown (March-June 2020), ischemic stroke admissions during the first 24 hours of onset (68.3% vs. 64.4%, p=0.1) and in-hospital stroke code activation (35.1% vs. 27.6%, p=0.005) diminished compared to 2019 period. No differences in total reperfusion treatment rates were observed, with similar door-to-needle and door-to-groin times in both periods. Conclusions: All-type stroke admissions diminished only slightly during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in this region, we found substantial deficiencies in stroke work-up, poor short-term outcome and increased mortality.","Pujol-Lereis, V.; Flores, A.; Arauz, A.; Abanto-Argomedo, C.; Amaya, P.; Bayona, H.; Bonardo, P.; Diaz-Escobar, L.; Gomez-Schneider, M.; Góngora-Rivera, F.; Lavados, P.

Since this disease is highly contagious and 33% of cases are asymptomatic, it is crucial to develop methods to predict its course. We developed a predictive model for Covid-19 infection in Spanish provinces. METHODS: We applied main components analysis to epidemiological data for Spanish provinces obtained from the National Centre of Epidemiology, based on the epidemiological curve between 24 February and 8 June 2020. Using this method, we classified provinces according to their epidemiological progress (worst, intermediate, and good). RESULTS: We identified 2 components that explained 99% of variability in the 52 epidemiological curves. The first component can be interpreted as the crude incidence rate trend and the second component as the speed of increase or decrease in the incidence rate during the period analysed. We identified 10 provinces in the group with the worst progress and 17 in the intermediate group. The threshold values for the 7-day incidence rate for an alert 1 (intermediate) were 134 cases/100,000 inhabitants, and 167 for alert 2 (high), respectively, showing a high discriminative power between provinces. CONCLUSIONS: These alert levels might be useful for deciding which measures may affect population mobility and other public health decisions when considering community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a given geographical area. This information would also facilitate intercomparison between healthcare areas and Autonomous Communities.","Santiago Pérez, María Isolina; López-Vizcaíno, Esther; Ruano-Ravina, Alberto; Pérez-Ríos, Mónica",Arch Bronconeumol,,27

The mechanism of COVID-19-associated thrombophilia is unknown; increasing global reports of antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positivity in COVID-19 suggest that the virus may induce antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a separate autoimmune thrombotic illness1. Because laboratory criteria used to diagnose APS are neither strongly specific nor sensitive, and because clinical circumstances including anticoagulation alter the laboratory results, international committees have published strict guidelines for aPL testing2,3. The hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 induces APS requires demonstration that COVID-19 patients fulfill both the clinical and the laboratory criteria for APS4. We reviewed recent publications (Supplementary Material for Methods) in order to assess the likelihood that aPL contribute to thromboses in COVID-19 patients.","Gkrouzman, Elena; Barbhaiya, Medha; Erkan, Doruk; Lockshin, Michael D",Arthritis rheumatol.

502988,Attitudes and opinions on quarantine and support for a contact-tracing application in France during the COVID-19 outbreak,2020,"Abstract What is the effect of social distancing policies on the spread of the new coronavirus? Social distancing policies rose to prominence as most capable of containing contagion and saving lives. Our purpose in this paper is to identify the causal effect of social distancing policies on the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and on contagion velocity. We align our main argument with the existing scientific consensus: social distancing policies negatively affect the number of cases. To test this hypothesis, we construct a dataset with daily information on 78 affected countries in the world. We compute several relevant measures from publicly available information on the number of cases and deaths to estimate causal effects for short-term and cumulative effects of social distancing policies. We use a time-series cross-sectional matching approach to match countries' observable histories. Causal effects (ATTs and ATEs) can be extracted via a dif-in-dif estimator. Results show that social distancing policies reduce the aggregated number of cases by 4,832 on average (or 17.5/100 thousand), but only when strict measures are adopted. This effect seems to manifest from the third week onwards.","Cunha, Matheus; Domingos, Amanda; Rocha, Virginia; Torres, Marcus",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,27

503497,Sars,2020,"In public health, social distancing is a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions or measures intended to prevent the spread of a contagious disease, by maintaining a physical distance between people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization suggested the term, ‘physical distancing,’ as opposed to ‘social distancing’, arguing that it is a physical distance which prevents transmission;people can remain socially connected via technology. This paper discusses the concepts of social distance, social distancing, physical distancing, self-quarantine, self-isolation, symptomatic, asymptomatic and parasymptomatic cases as they relate to COVID-19 and African perception of pandemic diseases. Although the idea of social distancing is not novel to the Africans, but a challenge in its implementation is that historically, social distancing is rather applied to non-infectious cases like mental illness, epilepsy, infertility, aging, victims of sexual violence and the like. The paper utilizes health-related theories and pertinent empirical findings to explain African perspective of social distancing and the challenges of adoption in pandemic situations. The theories on health risk perception reviewed include the protection motivation theory, the health belief model, the extended parallel process model and the precaution adoption process model. From consumer psychology background on product adoption, a conceptual model for ‘social distancing’ adoption in pandemics was advanced. These ancient and novel health-related theories and models were applied to explain the erroneous understanding, perception and adoption challenges of social distancing in Africa, leading to possible increase in the spread of the coronavirus.","Ehigie, Benjamin Osayawe Ehigie Rebecca Ibhaguelo Sholarin Adeniyi Muyiwa Elizabeth Olowookere Agoha Benedict",Psychological studies,,27

Many of the discussions are new twists on an old theme: how to fairly allocate scarce medical resources, such as ventilators and intensive care unit beds. In this essay, we do not add another allocation scheme to the growing pile, partly out of appreciation that such schemes should be products of inclusive and transparent community engagement and partly out of recognition of their limited utility for physicians working in the field. Instead, we make the more modest claim that context matters when making such decisions and, more specifically, that recommendations from high-income countries about fair allocation during Covid-19 should not be cut and pasted into low-income settings. We offer a few examples of why seemingly universal, well-intentioned ethical recommendations could have adverse consequences if unreflectively applied in sub-Saharan Africa.","Moodley, Keymanthri; Ravez, Laurent; Obasa, Adetayo Emmanuel; Mwinga, Alwyn; Jaoko, Walter; Makindu, Darius; Behets, Frieda; Rennie, Stuart",Hastings Cent Rep,,27

Durant le premier confinement pour COVID-19 les dispositifs de signalement des VPI/VIF préexistants ont été renforcés, de nouveaux ont été créés et ont enregistré une augmentation des signalements de 32 % dès le début du confinement avec des disparités régionales. Aucune étude, à notre connaissance, n’a mesuré l’accessibilité de ces dispositifs en population générale, et ce qu’elle en connaît, que ce soit pendant le confinement ou en dehors. L’objectif est de déterminer la proportion de la population française féminine qui a connaissance de ces dispositifs et qui a pu en avoir recours durant le premier confinement. Méthodes Analyse secondaire d’une étude observationnelle par questionnaire anonyme (diffusé via réseaux sociaux, Ordres professionnels, associations d’aide aux victimes, réseaux de périnatalité, Protection maternelle et infantile) conduite du 19/05/20 au 10/07/20 auprès des femmes de plus de 15 ans résidentes en France. Etaient recueillis, les caractéristiques sociodémographiques, l’existence des types de VPI selon l’OMS (psychologiques, physiques/sexuelles, cyberviolence, coercition sexuelle) et VIF, leur fréquence avant confinement, leurs évolutions pendant, la connaissance des principaux dispositifs de signalement pour violences et leurs recours (numéro 3919, Alerte pharmacie, SMS 114). Les analyses bivariées des variables qualitatives ont été réalisées à l’aide du logiciel R.3.5.1. L’analyse multivariée est en cours. L’étude a été déclarée à la CNIL. Résultats Au total, 722/1211 femmes incluses (59,6 %) déclaraient subir au moins un type de VPI/VIF avant confinement qui a perduré pendant pour 89,8 % (648/722). L’âge moyen était de 34,1 ans (±10,4). Durant le confinement les VPI psychologiques, cyberviolence et VIF avaient diminué (respectivement 92 % versus 85,3 %, p&lt;0,001 ;13,6 % versus 8,2 %, p&lt;0,01 ;13,7 % versus 4,4 %, p&lt;0,001) alors que les VPI physiques/sexuelles et la coercition sexuelle étaient stables (respectivement 12,5 % versus 11,6 %, p=0,58 ;11,3 % versus 8,6 %, p=0,10). 10/722 (1,4 %) avaient déclaré des coupures/hématomes, 2/722 (0,3 %) des entorses/brûlures/luxations, 2/722 (0,3 %) une hospitalisation. 16/489 (3,3 %) non-victimes avant confinement avaient subi des violences de tous types pendant. Les trois dispositifs étaient aussi méconnus des victimes avant confinement que des non-victimes : plateforme 3919 (34,3 % versus 31,9 %, p=0,38), Alerte pharmacie (44,5 % versus 41,3 %, p=0,28), SMS 114 (55,1 % versus 54 %, p=0,54) ;0,6 % versus 0,4 % (p&gt;0,99), 1,9 % versus 2,5 % (p=0,54) et 2,4 % versus 1,6 % (p=0,39) avaient découvert le 3919, l’Alerte pharmacie et le SMS 114 après le déconfinement. Une femme sur 722 avait appelé elle-même le 3919., 15/722 (2,1 %), 6/722 (0,8 %) et 7/722 (1 %) n’avaient pas pu signaler les violences au 3919, dans une pharmacie ou par SMS ;19/722 (2,6 %) par peur des représailles, 4/722 (0,6 %) empêchées par leur conjoint/entourage. Six sur 722 (0,8 %) avaient déposé plainte, 6/722 (0,8 %) contacté d’autres plateformes de signalement, 5/722 (0,7 %) les services sociaux, et 9/722 (1,2 %) consulté un professionnel de santé. Conclusion Très peu d’actes de VPI/VIF ont été déclarés via les dispositifs de signalement. Les VPI/VIF ici n’entraient pas dans les statistiques officielles. Sans minimiser leur nécessité, ces dispositifs semblent mal connus de la population, même chez les victimes de VPI/VIF. Une meilleure visibilité/accessibilité et un dépistage systématique des violences sont nécessaires.","Mussa, A.; Pradier, C.; Maccagnan, S.; Delotte, J.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,27

508887,How to Minimize the Impact of Pandemic Events: Lessons From the COVID-19 Crisis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To compare National Health Service (NHS) organisations' testing pathways for patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community versus standard hospital testing practices. PERSPECTIVE: NHS commissioners and services. METHODS: During the containment phase of the COVID-19 pandemic we developed a community model pathway for COVID-19 testing in Wales with testing teams undertaking swabbing for COVID-19 in individuals' usual place of residence. We undertook a cost-minimisation analysis comparing the costs to the NHS in Wales of community testing for COVID-19 versus standard hospital testing practices and ambulance conveyancing. We analysed data from patients with suspected COVID-19 between January and February 2020 and applied assumptions of costs from national contractual and reference costs for ambulances, staffing and transportation with market costs at the time of publication. RESULTS: 177 patients with suspected COVID-19 underwent community testing via local NHS organisations between January and February 2020 with a mean age of 46.1 (IQR 27.5-56.3). This was 92% of total patients who were tested for COVID-19 during this period. We estimate, compared with standard hospital testing practices, cash savings in improved productivity for the NHS of £24,539 during this time period, in addition to further non-monetised benefits for hospital and ambulance flow. CONCLUSIONS: Community testing for COVID-19 in Wales is now an established pathway and continues to bring benefits for patients, local healthcare organisations and the NHS. Further application of this model in other settings and to other infectious diseases may herald promising returns.","Currie, Jonny; Adamson, James; Bowden, Bethan; Woolls, Julie; Jones, Rachel; Healy, Brendan; Heyburn, David; Shankar, Ananda Giri; Howe, Robin",BMJ Open,,27

510616,"HIT-COVID, a global database tracking public health interventions to COVID-19",2020,"BACKGROUND: Mortality from COVID-19 is high among hospitalized patients and effective therapeutics are lacking. Hypercoagulability, thrombosis and hyperinflammation occur in COVID-19 and may contribute to severe complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation may improve clinical outcomes through anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral mechanisms. Our primary objective is to evaluate whether therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin prevents mechanical ventilation and/or death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 compared to usual care. METHODS: An international, open-label, adaptive randomized controlled trial. Using a Bayesian framework, the trial will declare results as soon as pre-specified posterior probabilities for superiority, futility, or harm are reached. The trial uses response-adaptive randomization to maximize the probability that patients will receive the more beneficial treatment approach, as treatment effect information accumulates within the trial. By leveraging a common data safety monitoring board and pooling data with a second similar international Bayesian adaptive trial (REMAP-COVID anticoagulation domain), treatment efficacy and safety will be evaluated as efficiently as possible. The primary outcome is an ordinal endpoint with three possible outcomes based on the worst status of each patient through day 30: no requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation or death. CONCLUSION: Using an adaptive trial design, the Anti-Thrombotic Therapy To Ameliorate Complications of COVID-19 trial will establish whether therapeutic anticoagulation can reduce mortality and/or avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Leveraging existing networks to recruit sites will increase enrollment and mitigate enrollment risk in sites with declining COVID-19 cases.","Houston, Brett L; Lawler, Patrick R; Goligher, Ewan C; Farkouh, Michael E; Bradbury, Charlotte; Carrier, Marc; Dzavik, Vlad; Fergusson, Dean A; Fowler, Robert A; Galanaud, Jean-Phillippe; Gross, Peter L; McDonald, Emily G; Husain, Mansoor; Kahn, Susan R; Kumar, Anand; Marshall, John; Murthy, Srinivas; Slutsky, Arthur S; Turgeon, Alexis F; Berry, Scott M; Rosenson, Robert S; Escobedo, Jorge; Nicolau, Jose C; Bond, Lindsay; Kirwan, Bridget-Anne; de Brouwer, Sophie; Zarychanski, Ryan",Clin Trials,,27

PURPOSE: Patients with a reported ß-lactam allergy (BLA) are often given alternative perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis, increasing risk of surgical site infections (SSIs), acute kidney injury (AKI), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a pharmacist-led BLA clarification interview service in the preoperative setting. METHODS: A pharmacist performed BLA clarification telephone interviews before elective procedures from November 2018 to March 2019. On the basis of allergy history and a decision algorithm, first-line preoperative antibiotics, alternative antibiotics, or allergy testing referral was recommended. The pharmacist intervention (PI) group was compared to a standard of care (SOC) group who underwent surgery from November 2017 to March 2018. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were included, with 50 (57%) and 37 (43%) in the SOC and PI groups, respectively. The most common surgeries included orthopedic surgery in 41 patients (47%) and neurosurgery in 17 patients (20%). In the PI group, all BLA labels were updated after interview. Twenty-three patients were referred for allergy testing, 12 of the 23 (52%) completed BLA testing, and penicillin allergies were removed for 9 of the 12 patients. Overall, 28 of the 37 (76%) pharmacy antibiotic recommendations were accepted. Cefazolin use significantly increased from 28% to 65% after the intervention (P = 0.001). SSI occurred in 5 (10%) patients in the SOC group and no patients in the PI group (P = 0.051). All of these SSIs were associated with alternative antibiotics. Incidence of AKI and CDI was similar between the groups. No allergic reactions occurred in either group. CONCLUSION: Implementation of a pharmacy-driven BLA reconciliation significantly increased ß-lactam preoperative use without negative safety outcomes.","Kwiatkowski, Shaina; Mulugeta, Surafel; Davis, Susan; Kenney, Rachel; Kalus, James; Walton, Leslie; Patel, Nisha",Am. j. health system pharm,,27

514652,Willingness to Pay for a COVID-19 Vaccine,2021,"A review of risk factors affecting airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was synthesised into an 'easy-to-apply' visual framework. Using this framework, video footage from two cricket matches were visually analysed, one pre-COVID-19 pandemic and one 'COVID-19 aware' game in early 2020. The number of opportunities for one participant to be exposed to biological secretions belonging to another participant was recorded as an exposure, as was the estimated severity of exposure as defined from literature. Events were rated based upon distance between subjects, relative orientation of the subjects, droplet generating activity performed (e. g., talking) and event duration. In analysis we reviewed each risk category independently and the compound effect of an exposure i. e., the product of the scores across all categories. With the application of generic, non-cricket specific, social distancing recommendations and general COVID-19 awareness, the number of exposures per 100 balls was reduced by 70%.

590270,Re-imagining world: From human health in the world to 'all-world health',2021,"Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 regularly infect host tissues that express antiviral proteins (AVPs) in abundance. Understanding how they evolve to adapt or evade host immune responses is important in the effort to control the spread of infection. Two AVPs that may shape viral genomes are the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme-catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3). The former binds to CpG dinucleotides to facilitate the degradation of viral transcripts while the latter frequently deaminates C into U residues which could generate notable viral sequence variations. We tested the hypothesis that both APOBEC3 and ZAP impose selective pressures that shape the genome of an infecting coronavirus. Our investigation considered a comprehensive number of publicly available genomes for seven coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS infecting Homo sapiens, Bovine CoV infecting Bos taurus, MHV infecting Mus musculus, HEV infecting Sus scrofa, and CRCoV infecting Canis lupus familiaris). We show that coronaviruses that regularly infect tissues with abundant AVPs have CpG-deficient and U-rich genomes; whereas those that do not infect tissues with abundant AVPs do not share these sequence hallmarks. Among the coronaviruses surveyed herein, CpG is most deficient in SARS-CoV-2 and a temporal analysis showed a marked increase in C to U mutations over four months of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution. Furthermore, the preferred motifs in which these C to U mutations occur are the same as those subjected to APOBEC3 editing in HIV-1. These results suggest that both ZAP and APOBEC3 shape the SARS-CoV-2 genome: ZAP imposes a strong CpG avoidance, and APOBEC3 constantly edits C to U. Evolutionary pressures exerted by host immune systems onto viral genomes may motivate novel strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.","Wei, Yulong; Silke, Jordan R.; Aris, Parisa; Xia, Xuhua",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351847/,27

While SARS-CoV-2, the causal pathogen of COVID-19, has been detected in some patient brains, its ability to infect brain cells and impact their function are not well understood. Here we investigated the susceptibility of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived monolayer brain cells and region-specific brain organoids to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that neurons and astrocytes were sparsely infected, but choroid plexus epithelial cells underwent robust infection. We optimized a protocol to generate choroid plexus organoids from hiPSCs and showed that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of these organoids is associated with increased cell death and transcriptional dysregulation indicative of an inflammatory response and cellular function deficits. Together, our findings provide evidence for selective SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and support the use of hiPSC-derived brain organoids as a platform to investigate SARS-CoV-2 infection susceptibility of brain cells, mechanisms of virus-induced brain dysfunction, and treatment strategies.","Jacob, Fadi; Pather, Sarshan R.; Huang, Wei-Kai; Zhang, Feng; Hao Wong, Samuel Zheng; Zhou, Haowen; Cubitt, Beatrice; Fan, Wenqiang; Chen, Catherine Z.; Xu, Miao; Pradhan, Manisha; Zhang, Daniel Y.; Zheng, Wei; Bang, Anne G.; Song, Hongjun; Carlos de la Torre, Juan; Ming, Guo-li",Cell Stem Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2020.09.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193459092030463X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33010822/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193459092030463X,27

591200,The economic impact of SARS: How does the reality match the predictions?,2008-04-23,"The role of animal feed as a vehicle for the transport and transmission of viral diseases was first identified during the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) epidemic in North America. Since that time, various feed additives have been evaluated at the laboratory level to measure their effect on viral viability and infectivity in contaminated feed using bioassay piglet models. While a valid first step, the conditions of these studies were not representative of commercial swine production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of feed additives to mitigate the risk of virus‐contaminated feed using a model based on real‐world conditions. This new model used an ‘ice‐block’ challenge, containing equal concentrations of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Senecavirus A (SVA) and PEDV, larger populations of pigs, representative commercial facilities and environments, along with realistic volumes of complete feed supplemented with selected additives. Following supplementation, the ice block was manually dropped into designated feed bins and pigs consumed feed by natural feeding behaviour. After challenge, samples were collected at the pen level (feed troughs, oral fluids) and at the animal level (clinical signs, viral infection, growth rate, and mortality) across five independent experiments involving 15 additives. In 14 of the additives tested, pigs on supplemented diets had significantly greater average daily gain (ADG), significantly lower clinical signs and infection levels, and numerically lower mortality rates compared to non‐supplemented controls. In conclusion, the majority of the additives evaluated mitigated the effects of PRRSV 174, PEDV and SVA in contaminated feed, resulting in improved health and performance.","Dee, Scott A.; Niederwerder, Megan C.; Edler, Roy; Hanson, Dan; Singrey, Aaron; Cochrane, Roger; Spronk, Gordon; Nelson, Eric",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32706431/,27

Objective To describe our experience and patient outcomes of almost 3,000 patients who received MAB infusion therapy at Northwell Health, a large integrated health care system in New York. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a descriptive study of adult patients, who received MAB therapy between November 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021, and a retrospective cohort survival analysis comparing patients who received MAB therapy prior to admission versus those who did not. Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality; additional evaluations included ED utilization and hospitalization within 28 days of a positive COVID-19 test for patients who received MAB therapy. Results During the study period, 2818 (1412 [50.1%]) male, (1406 [49.9%] female) adult patients median age 67 years (IQR 58-74) with symptomatic COVID-19 received MAB infusion. Following therapy and within 28 days of COVID-19 test, 145 patients (5.1%) were hospitalized and compared with 200 controls who were eligible for but did not receive MAB therapy, and were hospitalized. In the MAB group, 16 (11%) patients met the primary outcome, versus 21 (10.5%) in the control group (not significant, log rank p-value = 0.41). In an unadjusted proportional hazards model, no significant association was found between pre-hospitalization MAB use and time to the primary end point (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.696-2.719) as well as in models adjusting for demographics (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.53-2.23), demographics and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.573-2.59), and with inverse probability weighting according to propensity scores (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.619-2.29). Reduced hospitalization rate was related to the time between symptom onset and MAB therapy (4.4% within 0-4 days, 5% within 5-7 days, and 6.1% within [≥]8 days) however, this finding did not reach statistical significance (p-value = 0.15). Conclusions and relevance Establishing the capability to provide MAB infusion therapy requires significant planning and coordination. While this therapy may be an important treatment option for early mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients, further investigations are needed to define the optimal timing of MAB treatment.","Jarrett, M.

METHODS: A mathematical model was utilized to fit the monthly case data, in order to estimate the turning points (peak incidence) and the reproduction number R of the outbreak. Furthermore, correlation analysis was carried out to assess the correlation between infections among the male and female IDUs. RESULTS: Model fit revealed a two-wave epidemic during April 2004–March 2007. The larger second wave started shortly after May 2005 and peaked in October 2005 before gradually subsiding. R was estimated to be 3.15 (3.14–3.16) and 27.21 (26.73–28.05) for the two respective waves. The time series of monthly differences in male and female case data were found to be most significantly correlated at lag 0 (i.e., r > 0.7) with r = 0.906 and 0.804, respectively in each direction. The Granger causality test indicated that the male time series caused the corresponding female time series with a lag of 2 months or less. CONCLUSIONS: The modeling results revealed the presence of a small first wave in 2004, before an explosion of cases after May 2005. Furthermore, a harm reduction program implemented in August 2005 contributed to the downturn in the epidemic after October. Correlation results also suggest that the upsurge in male HIV cases led to the subsequent drastic surge in female cases.","Hsieh, Ying-Hen",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971213000386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23414736/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2013.01.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971213000386,27

Regarding the relation between coping strategies and stress no difference was identified between the two groups. In both of them, emotionally focused coping was negatively related with perceived stress, whereas dysfunctional coping was positively related with stress. These results could be useful in planning actions aiming to reduce stress and improve the effectiveness of HCWs’ interventions.

We aimed to evaluate the performance and degree of correlation of three fully automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with neutralization activity using a surrogate virus-neutralizing test (sVNT) from GenScript, targeting the receptor-binding domain. Methods: 110 sera collected from PCR-confirmed asymptomatic COVID-19 individuals were tested for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) using the sVNT. Positive samples were tested on three automated immunoassays targeting different viral antigens: Mindray CL-900i®, Abbott Architect, and Ortho VITROS®. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, agreement, and correlation with the sVNT were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal thresholds for predicting the presence of neutralizing activity by each assay. Results: All three assays showed 100% specificities. The highest sensitivity was 99.0%, demonstrated by VITROS®, followed by 94.3%, for CL-900i®, and 81.0%, for Architect. Both VITROS® and CL-900i® had the strongest correlation with the sVNT (ρ = 0.718 and ρ = 0.712, respectively), while Architect showed a moderate correlation (ρ = 0.618). ROC curve analysis indicated that the manufacturer's recommended cutoff values are adequate for predicting the presence of nAbs and providing a strong correlation with the sVNT.

601161,The Need for All-Cause Mortality Data to Aid Our Understanding of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin America.,2021-09-23,"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections commonly lead to respiratory failure and potentially fatal systemic inflammation and organ failure. Nebulized DAS181, a host-directed biologics with sialidase activity, is an investigational drug with antiviral activities on parainfluenza and influenza under phase 3 and phase 2 development. The objective of this study (NCT04324489) is to investigate the safety and effects of nebulized DAS181 on hypoxic coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, open-label, compassionate use. SETTING: Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and Department of Infectious Diseases. SUBJECTS: Patients 18 to 70 years old who met Chinese criteria for severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia and required supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilator at screening. INTERVENTIONS: Nebulized DAS181 (4.5 mg) twice a day for 10 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three male coronavirus disease 2019 hypoxic patients with bilateral lung involvement completed DAS181 treatment for 10 days. By day 14, all achieved return to room air (primary endpoint) and their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Clinical severity improved from severe coronavirus disease 2019 at baseline to moderate or mild disease by day 5, consistent with rapid reduction of inflammatory cytokines by days 2–3 and radiologic improvement by days 5–10. No DAS181-related adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of DAS181 was well tolerated and potential clinical benefit of DAS181 on hypoxic coronavirus disease 2019 is the reduction of supplemental oxygen need. Efficacy and safety, including pharmacokinetics and viral studies of DAS181 in severe, hypoxic coronavirus disease 2019, should be examined by a double-blind, randomized controlled study.","Ho, Jennifer Hui-Chun; Zhao, Yang; Liu, Zhenlian; Zhou, Xiaoyang; Chen, Xiaobei; Xianyu, Yunyan; Lewis, Stanley; Fan, Liya; Tian, Yuan; Chang, Nancy; Gong, Zuojiong; Hu, Ke",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134951/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000263,27

604084,Designing Futuristic Telemedicine Using Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in the COVID-19 Era,2020-11-02,"Abstract JHM virus, when inoculated into neonatal rats, can cause either a rapidly fatal acute encephalomyelitis or, after longer incubation periods, a paralytic disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum anti-JHM virus IgG concentrations present in rats prior to onset of clinical symptoms or during the acute and paralytic phases of disease were compared. High CSF/serum ratios, indicative of local antibody production in the CNS, were noted only where disease was demonstrable suggesting that local antibody production accompanied the infection but did not prevent the neurological disease. Among animals in which neurologic symptoms had not become manifest, only those with elevated CSF/serum ratios were found to have histological CNS lesions. Immunofluorescent microscopy indicated that viral antigens were present in both glia and neurons. Antigen-positive cells were frequently present in histologically normal CNS tissue, while regions of necrosis were antigen negative. Testing for the presence of viral RNA with JHM cDNA probes revealed that the virus was rapidly disseminated throughout the CNS, presumably establishing centers of infection prior to the development of recognizable tissue damage. Viral RNA was also detected in the CNS following recovery from paralysis and as late as 5 months postinfection, where no disease occurred. These findings indicate that, although infection by JHM virus can spread rapidly throughout the CNS, formation of lesions during chronic disease is a slower process. The current data and previous observations suggest that JHM virus can remain in a latent state for periods of at least several months in rats without apparent neurologic disease despite the absence of any known provirus phase in the replicative strategy of coronaviruses.","Sorensen, O.; Coulter-Mackie, M.

Methods We surveyed 2,328 Taiwanese from July 29 to August 6, 2020, assessing demographics, information sources, and practice of preventive behaviors from the 2003 SARS or 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (2009pdmH1N1) era to the current pdmCOVID-19 as well as post-survey intention to continue preventive practices. Logistic regression was employed to identify characteristics associated with close adherence to preventive behavior practices in 2020. Results About 70.2% of participants adhered closely to recommended preventive behavior practices. Compared with 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1, there was a significant increase in the use of facemasks during pdmCOVID-19 (66.6% vs. 99.2% [indoors], p < 0.001) and the use of on-person alcohol-based hand sanitizer (AHS) (44.2% vs. 65.4%, p < 0.001) or 98.4% (hand sanitation at entry of buildings, p < 0.001) during the pdmCOVID-19. Multivariable logistic regression revealed four characteristics significantly associated with continuance of close adherence to recommend preventive behavior practices in 2020: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.72), receipt of government COVID-19-prevention information (aOR, 1.52), recruitment of the study subjects from primary care clinics (aOR, 1.43), and previous use of AHS during the 2003SARS/2009pdmH1N1 (AOR, 1.37). Conclusions With Taiwan’s concerted efforts of government leadership, healthcare providers’ risk communication, and public cooperation, we rapidly brought the COVID-19 pandemic under control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The seroprevalence study was done from the random sampling (n=1000) of blood collected from 29 dual-purpose herds, located in three municipalities (Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria) of Cesar department. The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd. RESULTS: The overall highest seroprevalence was observed for BHV-1 (94.7%), followed by BRSV (98.6%), BVDV (35.2%), and BPI-3V (47.1%). Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities. Female sex and older animals (>24 months) were a significant risk factor for BHV-1 and BPI-3V infection. Regarding the clinical signs, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion. CONCLUSION: This research confirms the high seroprevalence of the respiratory viral pathogens in nonvaccinated cattle within the study areas. Therefore, appropriate sanitary management practices and routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the seroprevalence of these infectious agents.","León, Juan Carlos Pinilla; Diaz, Wilson; Vasquez, María Cristina; Tobón, Julio Cesar; Sánchez, Alfredo; Ortiz, Diego",Vet World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528017/; https://doi.org/10.14202/vetworld.2019.951-958,27

Despite the need for seeking urgent care for conditions such as myocardial infarction, many people may not seek treatment. This study seeks to measure associations between the COVID-19 pandemic and location of death among individuals who died from ischemic heart disease (IHD). Data obtained from death certificates from the Arkansas Department of Health was used to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis to assess whether decedents of IHD were more likely to die at home during the pandemic (March 2020 through September 2020). The analysis compared location of death for decedents of IHD pre and during the pandemic to location of death for decedents from non-natural causes. Before the pandemic, 50.0% of decedents of IHD died at home compared to 57.9% dying at home during (through September 2020) the pandemic study period (p < .001). There was no difference in the proportion of decedents who died at home from non-natural causes before and during the pandemic study period (55.8% vs. 53.5%; p = .21). After controlling for confounders, there was a 48% increase in the odds of dying at home from IHD during the pandemic study period (p < .001) relative to the change in dying at home due to non-natural causes. During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of decedents who died at home due to IHD. Despite the ongoing pandemic, practitioners should emphasize the need to seek urgent care during an emergency.","Porter, Austin; Brown, Clare C.; Tilford, J.

However, their relations and effects for a better sustainable energy transmission would need further research works in an international context. Motivated by that reason, this study contributes to the ongoing literature by revisiting the effects of renewable energy consumption, electricity output, and economic activities on carbon risk using a global sample of 219 countries over the period of 1990–2020. Using GMM estimation, simultaneous quantile, and panel quantile estimations; the study finds supportive findings showing that the higher the countries with renewable energy consumption and electricity output the better the capacity those countries can mitigate the environmental degradation by reducing the amount of total carbon emission over time. However, those relations are changed when using system GMM approaches, implying the role of FDI inflows and the difference in income groups in the selected sample countries. This can be intuitively explained that emerging countries might give more priority to the economic growth receiving FDI inflows from more advanced economies and balancing the trade-off between economic growth and environmental protection, while the developed economies with their advantages in green technologies and financial flexibility might have higher advantages in acquiring a sustainable transition and maintaining the real economy’s growth without significant trade-off concerns.

Synthetic viruses and genetic engineering of pathogens are a reality, with a rapid acceleration of dual-use science. The public availability of methods for dual-use genetic engineering, coupled with the insider threat, poses an unprecedented risk for biosecurity. Case studies including the 1984 Rajneesh salmonella bioterrorism attack and the controversy over engineered transmissible H5N1 influenza are analyzed. Simple probability analysis shows that the risks of dual-use research are likely to outweigh potential benefits, yet this type of analysis has not been done to date. Many bioterrorism agents may also occur naturally. Distinguishing natural from unnatural epidemics is far more difficult than other types of terrorism. Public health systems do not have mechanisms for routinely considering bioterrorism, and an organizational culture that is reluctant to consider it. A collaborative model for flagging aberrant outbreak patterns and referral from the health to security sectors is proposed.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using publicly available information from the critical care database Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III. Adults (≥18 years of age) who attended the ICU for the first time were enrolled. Demographic information and clinical data were obtained from each patient. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after ICU admission, and the secondary outcomes were in-hospital and ICU mortality. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to examine the associations between SAHS comorbidities and the research outcomes. Propensity score matching was used to adjust for potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Of the 32 989 patients enrolled, 1918 (5.81%) were diagnosed with SAHS as a comorbid condition. Patients with SAHS had a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate compared with those without SAHS (5.27% vs 13.65%, respectively; p<0.001). The frequency of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral disease, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and renal failure was significantly different between the two groups. Patients with SAHS demonstrated significantly longer survival compared with patients without SAHS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression identified a significant relationship between SAHS and mortality within 30 days (adjusted HR=0.610, 95% CI 0.499 to 0.747, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: SAHS as a comorbid condition decreases the risk of 30-day mortality, in-hospital mortality and ICU mortality among ICU patients.","Wang, Hongxia; Shao, Guangqiang; Rong, Lei; Ji, Yang; Zhang, Keke; Liu, Min; Ma, Ling",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048886; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162653/,27

We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models’ transition from research to clinical practice. Methods In this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles. Results The open source website https://covid19risk.ai/ currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work. Conclusion We have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models in a user-friendly format. Additionally, this platform supports researchers in showcasing their work, which will increase the visibility and use of their models.","Halilaj, Iva; Chatterjee, Avishek; van Wijk, Yvonka; Wu, Guangyao; van Eeckhout, Brice; Oberije, Cary; Lambin, Philippe",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.05.425384,27

There is a paucity of research investigating the experiences of returning cataract surgeons and how different individual circumstances impact on their return. Our aim was to investigate the subjective experiences of UK ophthalmologists simultaneously returning to surgery following the nationwide elective surgical hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was nationally distributed between 01/09/2020 and 29/10/2020 to registered UK ophthalmologists. Participants indicating a surgical hiatus of 8 weeks or more were included. RESULTS: 232 of 264 responses were analysed. Covid-19 was the most frequent reason for a surgical hiatus (median 15 weeks). Perceived operating difficulties were found in 29.1%. Transient anxiety (51.7%), reduced confidence, and perceived increased surgical time were commonplace. Trainees and females were more likely to encounter negative experiences (p < 0.001) and barriers to resource accessibility. Eyesi(®) and online videos were the most available and accessed pre-return resources. Childcare was five times more likely to present as a barrier to resource access for females than males. CONCLUSIONS: Technical skills fade such as capsulorhexis difficulties were commonly perceived by trainee surgeons in addition to transient anxiety, reported in more than half of all surgeons following a hiatus as short as 8 weeks. Eyesi(®) simulation offers the potential to negate technical de-skilling. Few had formal return plans or awareness of RCOphth guidance. We believe there is scope for more specialised and targeted support for future returning cataract surgeons thereby optimising patient care.","Maubon, Laura; Nderitu, Paul; O’Brart, David P.

Of the inpatient facilities 81% reported an average decrease of hospitalized patients of −54.9% and 52% of the participants complained of a lack of PPE. Organizational adjustments are reported. CONCLUSION: The rheumatological services were significantly reduced 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic had reached Germany on a large scale. The study showed that in this phase there were decisive turning points in patient care and implicated substantial organizational and ultimately also economic effects on the healthcare system, both in hospitals and private practices. As the survey cannot adapt to the daily dynamic changes in priorities it serves as a first snapshot, which requires follow-up studies.","Freudenberg, S.; Vossen, D.",Z Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-020-00833-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661916/,27

Despite this, a safe and effective PEDV vaccine against highly virulent strains is unavailable, making PEDV prevention and control challenging. Lactogenic immunity induced via the gut-mammary gland-secretory IgA (sIgA) axis, remains the most promising and effective way to protect suckling piglets from PEDV. Therefore, a successful PEDV vaccine must induce protective maternal IgA antibodies that passively transfer into colostrum and milk. Identifying variables that influence lymphocyte migration and IgA secretion during gestation and lactation is imperative for designing maternal immunization strategies that generate the highest amount of lactogenic immune protection against PEDV in suckling piglets. Because pregnancy-associated immune alterations influence viral pathogenesis and adaptive immune responses in many different species, a better understanding of host immune responses to PEDV in pregnant swine may translate into improved maternal immunization strategies against enteric pathogens for multiple species. In this review, we discuss the role of host factors during pregnancy on antiviral immunity and their implications for generating protective lactogenic immunity in suckling neonates.","Langel, Stephanie N.; Wang, Qiuhong; Vlasova, Anastasia N.; Saif, Linda J.",Pathogens,https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9020130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32085410/,27

Without available safe and effective vaccines and cures, an unscrupulous marketplace has emerged selling COVID-19 quackery (fraudulent misrepresentation of preventions and treatments). METHODS: US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Warning Letters issued from March 2020 to July 2020 were analyzed for themes pertaining to unapproved, adulterated, and misbranded COVID-19 products. RESULTS: During this period, the FDA issued 3,139 Warning Letters of which 98 (3.14%) of these were focused on COVID-19-related drugs, devices, biologics, and dietary supplements (products and ingredients). Specifically, these Warning Letters revealed regulatory nonconformities involving 40 identified herbs, 22 minerals/compounds, 6 devices and biologicals, and 3 vitamins. Products included hand sanitizers; COVID-19 antibody test kits; herbal teas and tinctures; nasal gel; toothpaste; and 1 vaccine. Nine Warning Letters were issued for products being sold via the Amazon online shopping platform. CONCLUSION: A small percentage of FDA Warning Letters recently have been focused on COVID-19. These Letters expose the blatant and potentially harmful quackery of vendors across the world who prioritize financial gain over clinical beneficence. Patient history-taking should include queries about non-traditional and unapproved products to identify, document, and report potentially harmful quackery. FDA Warning Letters are a component of meaningful corrective action; however, greater effort in spreading awareness of such misrepresented, unapproved, and adulterated products is needed to deter purchases of such products.","Bramstedt, Katrina A.",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33001378/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s43441-020-00224-1,27

630592,Comment on: “Willingness to Pay for a COVID-19 Vaccine”,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Pandemics greatly interfere with overall health care delivery as resources are diverted to combat the crisis. Kidney transplantation programs were closed temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the critical shortage of organs, their short shelf life, and their overall importance to improving length and quality of life for those with kidney disease, this analysis examines the impact of discarding deceased donor organs. METHODS: The net benefit (or harm) of discarding deceased donor organs was measured in projected life years from a societal and individual perspective using a Markov model. A wide range of infection rates, pandemic durations, and case fatality rates associated with infection in wait listed and transplant recipients were examined. RESULTS: Overall, patient life expectancy fell for both wait listed and transplant recipients as the pandemic conditions became more unfavorable. However, the overall net benefit of a transplant during the pandemic was preserved. For example, prior to the pandemic, the net benefit of a kidney transplant over dialysis was calculated to be 6.25 life years (LYs) or 8.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in a 40-year old recipient. This fell to 5.86 LYs (7.78 QALYs) during the pandemic. Even assuming plausible but higher relative case fatality rates and risks of nosocomial and donor transmission in transplant recipients compared to wait listed patients, the net benefit remained >4 years for most deceased donor organs. CONCLUSION: As long as hospitals have adequate resources to deal with the pandemic and can limit nosocomial infection, kidney transplantation should not be curtailed.","Vinson, Amanda J.; Kiberd, Bryce A.; Tennankore, Karthik K.",Kidney Int Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34013101/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ekir.2021.02.017,27

631501,Beyond pilotitis: taking digital health interventions to the national level in China and Uganda,2017-07-31,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant reductions in the administration of routinely recommended vaccines among adolescents in the US including tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap); meningococcal (ACWY); and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. The extent to which these deficits could persist in 2021 and beyond is unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this study estimated the cumulative deficits of routine vaccine doses among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated the time and effort needed to recover from those deficits. METHODS: Monthly reductions in Tdap, meningococcal, and HPV doses administered to US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic were quantified using MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data. The time and effort required to reverse the vaccination deficit under various catch-up scenarios were estimated. RESULTS: Annual doses administered of Tdap, meningococcus, and HPV vaccines decreased by 21.2%, 20.8%, and 24.0%, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. For 2021, the reduction in doses administered is projected to be 6%-21% compared to 2019 under different scenarios. The projected deficit of missed doses is expected to be cleared between winter 2023 and fall 2031. CONCLUSIONS: Administration rates of routine vaccines decreased significantly among US adolescents during COVID-19. Reversing these deficits to mitigate long-term health and economic consequences will require a sustained increase in vaccination rates over multiple years.","Saxena, Kunal; Marden, Jessica R; Carias, Cristina; Bhatti, Alexandra; Patterson-Lomba, Oscar; Gomez-Lievano, Andres; Yao, Lixia; Chen, Ya-Ting",Curr Med Res Opin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538163/; https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1981842,27

Considered essential workers, ABA providers are exempt from government directives to close, so they have both the freedom and the great responsibility to make their own decisions about how best to keep their clients safe while continuing to provide medically necessary services. In the coming weeks and months, ABA providers will be faced with the decision about whether to reopen centers. This article does not address that decision, except to acknowledge the urgency to reopen, both to help clients and to remain solvent. Political rhetoric and contradictory public information further complicate this daunting decision. Because ABA providers do not have legal guidance to shift the burden of such decisions to local and state regulators, the burden is theirs alone. The unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic means that no decision is clearly wrong or right, and every decision has consequences. Although ABA providers do not have their own state guidance, many states have issued guidelines for childcare providers whose operations have continued throughout the pandemic. This article analyzes that guidance, identifies common variables potentially relevant to ABA organizations, highlights clinical considerations and procedural compliance, and provides ABA organizations with the tools to make the best decision for their clients, in their community, and on their timeline.

632374,Reflections on the 7th international Jerusalem conference on health policy in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak,2020-12-28,"The ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has prompted worldwide vaccine development. Several vaccines have been authorized by WHO, FDA, or MOH of different countries. However, issues such as need for cold chain, price, and most importantly access problems have limited vaccine usage in some nations especially developing countries. Moreover, the vast global demand justifies further attempts for vaccine development. Multi-epitope polypeptide vaccines enjoy several key features including safety and lower production and transfer costs and could be designed by in silico tools. Spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), the three major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, are ideal candidates for epitope selection. ORF3a (open reading frame3a), a transmembrane protein with pro-apoptotic functions, could be another proper target. Thus, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed using these four proteins and LL37, a TLR3 agonist adjuvant, through different immunoinformatics and bioinformatics tools. The proposed multi-epitope vaccine is expected to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with a population coverage of 76.92 % due to containing different immunodominant epitopes and LL37 adjuvant. Selecting epitopes derived from one functional and three structural proteins suggests the protective ability of the vaccine irrespective of probable virus mutations. The computationally observed proper interaction of LL37 with TLR3 implies its ability to induce immune responses effectively. Besides, it showed acceptable structural and physicochemical properties. The in-silico cloning results predicted its high efficiency production in Escherichia coli. Future experimental studies could further confirm its immunological efficacy.

This disruption of health services has necessitated new approaches to providing care to ensure continuity. OBJECTIVES: To summarize changes to the provision of routine primary care services during the pandemic. METHODS: Rapid literature review using PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane. Eligible studies were based in primary care and described practice-level changes in the provision of routine care in response to COVID-19. Relevant data addressing changes to routine primary care delivery, impact on primary care functions and challenges experienced in adjusting to new approaches to providing care, were obtained from included studies. A narrative summary was guided by Burns et al.’s framework for primary care provision in disasters. RESULTS: Seventeen of 1,699 identified papers were included. Studies reported on telehealth use and public health measures to maintain safe access to routine primary care, including providing COVID-19 screening, and establishing dedicated care pathways for non-COVID and COVID-related issues. Acute and urgent care were prioritized, causing disruptions to chronic disease management and preventive care. Challenges included telehealth use including disparities in access and practical difficulties in assessing patients, personal protective equipment shortages, and financial solvency of medical practices. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial disruptions to routine primary care occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary care practices’ rapid adaptation, often with limited resources and support, demonstrates agility and innovative capacity.

Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-4. PTSD symptoms were measured by six items from the Impact of Events Scale-revised. Relationships among Ebola experience, perceived Ebola threat and mental health symptoms were examined through binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of any anxiety-depression symptom was 48% (95% CI 46.8% to 50.0%), and of any PTSD symptom 76% (95% CI 75.0% to 77.8%). In addition, 6% (95% CI 5.4% to 7.0%) met the clinical cut-off for anxiety-depression, 27% (95% CI 25.8% to 28.8%) met levels of clinical concern for PTSD and 16% (95% CI 14.7% to 17.1%) met levels of probable PTSD diagnosis. Factors associated with higher reporting of any symptoms in bivariate analysis included region of residence, experiences with Ebola and perceived Ebola threat. Knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression (adjusted OR (AOR) 2.3, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9) and PTSD (AOR 2.095% CI 1.5 to 2.8) symptoms. Perceiving Ebola as a threat was independently associated with anxiety-depression (AOR 1.69 95% CI 1.44 to 1.98) and PTSD (AOR 1.86 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21) symptoms. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of PTSD and anxiety-depression were common after one year of Ebola response; psychosocial support may be needed for people with Ebola-related experiences. Preventing, detecting, and responding to mental health conditions should be an important component of global health security efforts.","Jalloh, Mohamed F; Li, Wenshu; Bunnell, Rebecca E; Ethier, Kathleen A; O’Leary, Ann; Hageman, Kathy M; Sengeh, Paul; Jalloh, Mohammad B; Morgan, Oliver; Hersey, Sara; Marston, Barbara J; Dafae, Foday; Redd, John T",BMJ Glob Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29607096/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000471,27

Transmission and prognosis, once infected, are potentially influenced by many factors, including indoor air pollution. Particulate Matter (PM) is a complex mixture of solid and/or liquid particles suspended in the air that can vary in size, shape, and composition and recent scientific work correlate this index with a considerable risk of COVID-19 infections. Early Warning Systems (EWS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have given rise to the development of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) based on sensors, which measure PM levels and monitor In-door Air pollution Quality (IAQ) in real-time. This article proposes an open-source platform architecture and presents the development of a Long Range (LoRa) based sensor network for IAQ and PM measurement. A few air quality sensors were tested, a network platform was implemented after simulating setup topologies, emphasizing feasible low-cost open platform architecture.","Peladarinos, Nikolaos; Cheimaras, Vasileios; Piromalis, Dimitrios; Arvanitis, Konstantinos G.; Papageorgas, Panagiotis; Monios, Nikolaos; Dogas, Ioannis; Stojmenovic, Milos; Tsaramirsis, Georgios",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577400/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186183,27

640557,COVID-19: protocol for observational studies utilizing near real-time electronic Australian general practice data to promote effective care and best-practice policy—a design thinking approach,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 and broke out as a global pandemic in late 2019. The acidic pH environment of endosomes is believed to be essential for SARS-CoV-2 to be able to enter cells and begin replication. However, the clinical use of endosomal acidification inhibitors, typically chloroquine, has been controversial with this respect. METHODS: In this study, RT-qPCR method was used to detect the SARS-CoV-2N gene to evaluate viral replication. The CCK-8 assay was also used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of SARS-CoV-2. In situ hybridization was used to examine the distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 gene in lung tissues. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was also used to evaluate virus-associated pathological changes in lung tissues. RESULTS: In this study, analysis showed that endosomal acidification inhibitors, including chloroquine, bafilomycin A1 and NH(4)CL, significantly reduced the viral yields of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6, Huh-7 and 293T-ACE2 cells. Chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 also improved the viability and proliferation of Vero E6 cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, in the hACE2 transgenic mice model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 reduced viral replication in lung tissues and alleviated viral pneumonia with reduced inflammatory exudation and infiltration in peribronchiolar and perivascular tissues, as well as improved structures of alveolar septum and pulmonary alveoli. CONCLUSIONS: Our research investigated the antiviral effects of endosomal acidification inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 in several infection models and provides an experimental basis for further mechanistic studies and drug development.","Shang, Chao; Zhuang, Xinyu; Zhang, He; Li, Yiquan; Zhu, Yilong; Lu, Jing; Ge, Chenchen; Cong, Jianan; Li, Tingyu; Tian, Mingyao; Jin, Ningyi; Li, Xiao",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33639976/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01515-1,27

As previous studies mostly included younger individuals, one advantage of our study is the comparatively high mean age of the convalescents included in the cohort considered (54 ± 8.4 years). While anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still detectable in 95% of convalescents up to 8 months post infection, an antibody-decay over time was generally observed in most donors. Using a multiplex assay, our data additionally reveal that most convalescents exhibit a broad humoral immunity against different viral epitopes. We demonstrate by flow cytometry that convalescent donors show a significantly elevated number of natural killer cells when compared to healthy controls, while no differences were found concerning other leucocyte subpopulations. We detected a specific long-lasting cellular immune response in convalescents by stimulating immune cells with SARS-CoV-2-specific peptides, covering domains of the viral spike, membrane and nucleocapsid protein, and measuring interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release thereafter. We modified a commercially available ELISA assay for IFN-γ determination in whole-blood specimens of COVID-19 convalescents. One advantage of this assay is that it does not require special equipment and can, thus, be performed in any standard laboratory. In conclusion, our study adds knowledge regarding the persistence of immunity of convalescents suffering from mild to moderate COVID-19.

Both methods detected influenza viruses A (H1N1 and H3N2) and B, human parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) types A and B, and human adenoviruses. In addition, human coronavirus (hCoV) groups I (229E‐like) and II (OC43‐like), as well as the new human metapneumovirus (hMPV), types A and B, were searched for by RT‐PCR alone. When results obtained by both methods were added, the overall percentage of patients positive for at least one respiratory virus peaked at 44.2%, involving 92/208 patients (81 pediatric, and 11 adults), while 116 patients (55.8%) were negative for any respiratory virus tested. The most common circulating virus was hRSV, infecting 54 (25.9%) patients (24 type A, and 30 type B strains), followed by hMPV, infecting 12 (5.8%) patients (7 type A and 5 type B strains). Coinfections by two respiratory viruses interested 11 (5.3%) patients, and 9 (81.8%) of these were infected by hRSV in association with another respiratory virus. In the great majority of infected children, hRSV and hMPV were associated with lower respiratory tract infections. In lung transplant recipients, viruses present in bronchoalveolar lavage appeared to be associated frequently with lower respiratory tract infections. In conclusion: the combination of immunological and molecular assays is the most sensitive approach to the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections; and infections caused by the less investigated hCoVs and hMPVs represent a fair proportion of respiratory infections.

Many chiropractic institutions, associations, and researchers have stepped up at a time of need. However, a subset of the chiropractic profession has claimed that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is clinically effective in improving one’s immunity, despite the lack of supporting scientific evidence. These unsubstantiated claims contradict official public health policy reflecting poorly on the profession. The aim of this commentary is to provide our perspective on the claims regarding SMT and clinically relevant immunity enhancement, drawing attention to the damaging ramifications these claims might have on our profession’s reputation. MAIN TEXT: The World Federation of Chiropractic released a rapid review demonstrating the lack of clinically relevant evidence regarding SMT and immunity enhancement. The current claims contradicting this review carry significant potential risk to patients. Furthermore, as a result of these misleading claims, significant media attention and public critiques of the profession are being made. We believe inaction by regulatory bodies will lead to confusion among the public and other healthcare providers, unfortunately damaging the profession’s reputation. The resulting effect on the reputation of the profession is greatly concerning to us, as students. CONCLUSION: It is our hope that all regulatory bodies will protect the public by taking appropriate action against chiropractors making unfounded claims contradicting public health policy. We believe it is the responsibility of all stakeholders in the chiropractic profession to ensure this is carried out and the standard of care is raised. We call on current chiropractors to ensure a viable profession exists moving forward.","Plener, Joshua; Csiernik, Ben; Bejarano, Geronimo; Hjertstrand, Jesper; Goodall, Benjamin",Chiropr Man Therap,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12998-020-00318-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32404205/,27

Though many might want it to, birth does not stop during a pandemic. In emergency times, birth practices need to be adjusted to safeguard the health of birthing mothers, babies, birth providers, and the general population. In Bologna, Italy, one of the emergency measures employed by local hospitals in response to COVID-19 was to suspend women’s right to be accompanied by a person of their choice for the whole duration of labor and childbirth. In this work, we look at how this measure was disputed by the local activist birth community. Through the analysis of a social campaign empowered by Voci di Nascita—an association of parents, birth providers, and activists—we examine how social actors negotiated the balance between public health and reproductive rights in a time of crisis. We argue that this process unveils several structural issues that characterize maternity care at the local and national levels, including the (re)medicalization of birth, the discourse on risk and safety, the internal fragmentation of Italian midwifery, and the fragility of reproductive rights. The Covidian experience forced the reshaping of the birth carepath during the peak of the emergency. We suggest that it also offered an opportunity to rethink how birth is conceived, experienced, and accompanied in times of unprecedented global uncertainty—and beyond.","Benaglia, Brenda; Canzini, Daniela",Front Sociol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.614271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33969049/,27

At the same time, conventional offers of prevention and health promotion rarely reach the unemployed. The JOBS Program is a health promotion program that combines job application training with elements of social learning theory and self-efficacy. Randomized field studies in the USA and Finland found significant positive effects on reintegration into the labor market and health amongst the unemployed. In this confirmatory study, we analyze whether the JOBS Program produces similar positive effects for the unemployed in Germany. METHODS: This study is designed as a country-wide, multi-center, non-blinded, two-armed, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial over 6 months. A total of approximately 1500 unemployed, who are willing to participate, are randomly assigned either to an intervention group or a waiting control group with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Guided by a team of two trainers, the intervention group completes JOBS Program Germany in small groups of 8 to 15 unemployed for a period of 1 week in units of 5 h a day. Primary outcome measures are the reintegration into the labor market, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, subjective state of health, depressive symptoms, and psychological distress. Of secondary interest are moderating variables such as socio-demographic characteristics, the duration of unemployment, and the job-search intensity. Outcomes will be repeatedly assessed via computer-assisted telephone interviews at three points in time: immediately before the intervention (pre-test), immediately after the intervention (post-test), and 6 months after the intervention has ended (6-months follow-up). DISCUSSION: This confirmatory study will provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of the JOBS Program on the reintegration and (mental) health of the unemployed in Germany. If our results from the randomized controlled trail in a country-wide field experiment confirm its effectiveness, the JOBS Program Germany could, perspectively, be implemented into the German employment promotion and social security system on a long-term basis.

With this method, we try to lay the empirical basis for the development of the model of digital monitoring and prediction of the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 in Croatia, relying on the analytical tool Google Trends (GT). Results: In Croatia search activities using GT for terms such as ""PCR +Covid"", ""PCR + test"", and symptoms ""cough + corona"", ""pneumonia + corona""; ""muscle pain + corona"" correlate strongly with officially reported cases of the disease. Google Trends tools are suitable for predicting the emergence of new COVID-19 cases in Croatia, and that the data collected by this method correlate with official data. The benefit of this method is reliable estimates that can enable public health officials to prepare and better respond to the possible return of a pandemic in certain parts of the country. If a region experiences an early, sharp increase in Covid-19-like-illness Google searches, it may be possible to focus additional resources on that region to identify the etiology of the outbreak, providing extra medical capacity or raising local media awareness as necessary. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with Covid-19 symptoms, this method can serve as an early alarm to predict the emergence of new cases of COVID-19 in the specific area in Croatia.","Juric, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253452; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.12.21253452v1?rss=1,27
658938,Public health response to COVID-19: Global perspective,2021-09-30,"The Halo Effect is a widely studied phenomenon that interests multiple disciplines. The relationship between Aesthetics Appearance and perceived Trustworthiness has especially gathered the attention of social scientists. While experimental works compared the strength of the Halo Effect in different situations (e.g. different genders’ faces), little is known about the stability of the Halo. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been urged to distance ourselves from others. Similar suggestions may alter the relationship between Aesthetic Appearance and Perceived Trustworthiness. Moreover, previous works reported that individuals’ attachment styles affected their emotional responses to the pandemic. Individuals’ attachment styles may influence the magnitude of change of the Halo. Here we investigate how priming (Social Distancing or Contact with others) affects the strength of the Halo Effect, with respect to individuals’ attachment styles. Participants (N = 298) rated the Aesthetics and Perceived Trustworthiness of strangers’ faces (N = 96) presented twice, before and after the presentation of a prime. Results revealed that individuals’ attachment styles affect the strength of the Halo. However, we found no evidence supporting the fact that different attachment styles lead to differences in the magnitude of changes after priming. Results help shed light on how attachment styles influence individuals’ impression formation.","Gabrieli, Giulio; Lim, Yun Yee; Esposito, Gianluca",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438441/,27
659306,Feedbacks from human health to household reliance on natural resources during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-10-07,"Scientific evidence plays an important role in the therapeutic decision-making process. What happens when physicians are forced to make therapeutic decisions under uncertainty? The absence of scientific guidelines at the beginning of a pandemic due to an unknown virus, such as COVID-19, could influence the perceived legitimacy of the application of non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches. This paper reports on a test of this hypothesis, in which we administered an ad hoc questionnaire to a sample of 64 Italian physicians during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy (April 2020). The questionnaire statements regarding the legitimacy of off-label or experimental drugs were framed according to three different scenarios (Normality, Emergency and COVID-19). Furthermore, as the perception of internal bodily sensations (i.e., interoception) modulates the decision-making process, we tested participants’ interoceptive sensibility using the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA). The results showed that participants were more inclined to legitimate non-evidence-based therapeutic approaches in the COVID-19 and Emergency scenarios than the Normality scenario. We also found that scores on the MAIA Trusting subscale positively predicted this difference. Our findings demonstrate that uncertain medical scenarios, involving a dramatic increase in patient volume and acuity, can increase risk-taking in therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, individual characteristics of health care providers, such as interoceptive ability, should be taken into account when constructing models to prevent the breakdown of healthcare systems in cases of severe emergency.","Salvato, Gerardo; Ovadia, Daniela; Messina, Alessandro; Bottini, Gabriella",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437629/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256806,27
659496,Is ivermectin ready to be part of a public health policy for COVID-19 prophylaxis?,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) was declared in January 2020 as a public health emergency of international concern. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) suffered from several pandemics previously. Pharmacists have vital roles to play to prevent the spread of this virus. OBJECTIVES: To assess the COVID‐19 awareness amongst pharmacists from Arabic‐speaking countries located in the MENA region, and to assess their perspectives of their role, barriers, and roles of the educational institutions/pharmaceutical associations. METHODS: An online survey was conducted to run a descriptive cross‐sectional study in Jordan from 12(th) to 22(nd) April 2020. The questionnaire was validated (face validity) and put on Facebook and directed for pharmacists only (clarified in the introduction of the questionnaire). Assessment of pharmacists’ awareness (20 questions) about pandemics and COVID‐19, their perceived roles and barriers, and roles of the educational institutions (e.g. universities) and pharmaceutical associations (e.g. Pharmacists Syndicate) was done. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS). RESULTS: Study participants (n= 2589) had a mean age of 29.3 (8.2) years and 1329 (51.5%) were females. Most of the participants were from Egypt (n= 819, 40.8%), followed by Jordan, Algeria, and Syria. Regarding the sources of information about coronavirus management, 60.8% of participants got their information from the social media. Fear from contracting the coronavirus while performing their duties was reported by the majority of pharmacists as the main barrier to delivering their roles (82.3%). The majority of pharmacists identified positive roles for the pharmaceutical institutions (74.8%) and pharmaceutical associations (63.6%). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists from the MENA countries believe they got enough education previously about pandemics, and the majority follow the latest coronavirus updates from social media. Fear was reported as the major barrier that requires resolution by the policymakers. Certain gaps in the awareness about COVID‐19 were identified.","Basheti, Iman A.; El‐hajji, Feras; Nassar, Razan; Thiab, Samar; Barakat, Muna; Basheti, Mariam; Berardi, Alberto; Saini, Bandana",Int J Clin Pract,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33550698/,27
659586,Preface of Special Issue “Cares in the Age of Communication: Health Education and Healthy Lifestyles”: Social Media and Health Communication in a Pandemic?,2020-04-10,"Viruses can be classified into archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses according to the taxonomy of the infected host. The host-constrained perception of viruses implies preference of genetic exchange between viruses and cellular organisms of their host superkingdoms and viral origins from host cells either via escape or reduction. However, viruses frequently establish non-lytic interactions with organisms and endogenize into the genomes of bacterial endosymbionts that reside in eukaryotic cells. Such interactions create opportunities for genetic exchange between viruses and organisms of non-host superkingdoms. Here, we take an atypical approach to revisit virus-cell interactions by first identifying protein fold structures in the proteomes of archaeoviruses, bacterioviruses, and eukaryoviruses and second by tracing their spread in the proteomes of superkingdoms Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. The exercise quantified protein structural homologies between viruses and organisms of their host and non-host superkingdoms and revealed likely candidates for virus-to-cell and cell-to-virus gene transfers. Unexpected lifestyle-driven genetic affiliations between bacterioviruses and Eukarya and eukaryoviruses and Bacteria were also predicted in addition to a large cohort of protein folds that were universally shared by viral and cellular proteomes and virus-specific protein folds not detected in cellular proteomes. These protein folds provide unique insights into viral origins and evolution that are generally difficult to recover with traditional sequence alignment-dependent evolutionary analyses owing to the fast mutation rates of viral gene sequences.","Malik, Shahana S.; Azem-e-Zahra, Syeda; Kim, Kyung Mo; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo; Nasir, Arshan",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.02110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29163404/,27
659641,The reproduction number of COVID-19 and its correlation with public health interventions,2020-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of observational studies report a 1.1–1.7% pooled risk of stroke among patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requiring hospitalization, but consultations for stroke and reperfusion procedures have decreased during the outbreak that occurred during the first half of the year 2020. It is still unclear whether a true increase in the risk of stroke exists among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In-hospital ischemic stroke (IHIS) complicated the 0.04–0.06% of all admissions in the pre-COVID-19 era, but its incidence has not been assessed among inpatients with COVID-19. We aimed to compare IHIS incidence among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of inpatients with non-COVID-19 illnesses from the same outbreak period and from previous periods. METHODS: This historical cohort study belongs to the COVID-19@Vallecas cohort. The incidence of IHIS was estimated for patients with SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized during March–April 2020 [COVID-19 cohort (CC)], for patients with non-COVID-19 medical illness hospitalized during the same outbreak period [2020 non-COVID-19 cohort (20NCC)], and for inpatients with non-COVID-19 illness admitted during March–April of the years 2016–2019 [historical non-COVID-19 cohort (HNCC)]. Unadjusted risk of IHIS was compared between the three cohorts, and adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of IHIS between cohorts was obtained by means of Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 8126 inpatients were included in this study. Patients in the CC were younger and more commonly men than those from the HNCC and 20NCC. Absolute risk of IHIS was 0.05% for HNCC, 0.23% for 20NCC, and 0.36% for CC, (p = 0.004 for HNCC vs. CC). Cumulative incidence for IHIS by day nine after admission, with death as a competing risk, was 0.09% for HNCC, 0.23% for 20NCC, and 0.50% for CC. In an adjusted Poisson regression model with sex, age, needing of intensive care unit admission, and cohort (HNCC as reference) as covariates, COVID-19 was an independent predictor for IHIS (IRR 6.76, 95% confidence interval 1.66–27.54, p = 0.01). A nonsignificant increase in the risk of IHIS was observed for the 20NCC (IRR 5.62, 95% confidence interval 0.93–33.9, p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was associated with an increase in the incidence of IHIS when compared with inpatients from a historical cohort. Viral infection itself may be related to the increased risk of IHIS among patients with COVID-19, but in view of our results from the 20NCC, it is likely that other factors, such as hospital saturation and overwhelming of health systems, may have played a role in the increased frequency of IHIS.

660281,Pan[dem]ic! Rational Risk Avoidance During a Health Pandemic,2021-05-31,"Disadvantaged socioeconomic position (SEP) is widely associated with disease and mortality, and there is no reason to think this will not be the case for the newly emerged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that has reached a pandemic level. Individuals with a more disadvantaged SEP are more likely to be affected by most of the known risk factors of COVID-19. SEP has been previously established as a potential determinant of infectious diseases in general. We hypothesise that SEP plays an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic either directly or indirectly via occupation, living conditions, health-related behaviours, presence of comorbidities and immune functioning. However, the influence of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 transmission, severity and outcomes is not yet known and is subject to scrutiny and investigation. Here we briefly review the extent to which SEP has been considered as one of the potential risk factors of COVID-19. From 29 eligible studies that reported the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and their potential risk factors, only one study reported the occupational position of patients with mild or severe disease. This brief overview of the literature highlights that important socioeconomic characteristics are being overlooked when data are collected. As COVID-19 spreads worldwide, it is crucial to collect and report data on socioeconomic determinants as well as race/ethnicity to identify high-risk populations. A systematic recording of socioeconomic characteristics of patients with COVID-19 will be beneficial to identify most vulnerable groups, to identify how SEP relates to COVID-19 and to develop equitable public health prevention measures, guidelines and interventions.","Khalatbari-Soltani, Saman; Cumming, Robert G; Delpierre, Cyrille; Kelly-Irving, Michelle",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385126/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214297,27

A first wave is visible up to the end of June 2020 in many regions. This article presents a review of the current knowledge on the epidemiology and prevention. The SARS-CoV‑2 predominantly replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tracts and is particularly transmitted by droplets and aerosols. The estimate for the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is between 2 and 3 and the median incubation period is 6 days (range 2–14 days). As with the related SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), superspreading events play an important role in the dissemination. A high proportion of infections are uncomplicated but moderate or severe courses develop in 5–10% of infected persons. Pneumonia, cardiac involvement and thromboembolisms are the most frequent manifestations leading to hospitalization. Risk factors for a complicated course are high age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases as well as immunodeficiency. Currently, the estimation for the infection fatality rate (IFR) is between 0.5% and 1% across all age groups. Outbreaks were limited in many regions with bundles of various measures for reduction of social contacts. The incidence for the first wave in Germany can be estimated as 0.4–1.8% and excess mortality could not be observed.","Salzberger, Bernd; Buder, Felix; Lampl, Benedikt; Ehrenstein, Boris; Hitzenbichler, Florian; Holzmann, Thomas; Schmidt, Barbara; Hanses, Frank",Nephrologe,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11560-020-00472-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343742/,27

METHODS: Descriptive study of the challenges faced in eye banking during the lockdown, and practices adopted to overcome the critical aspects in the clinical care of patients who presented with emergency corneal diseases requiring keratoplasty. RESULTS: Complete lockdown orders from the Indian government, as a strategy to control the Coronavirus pandemic, resulted in drastic reduction of all types of elective corneal transplants and eye banking activities from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020. The sudden cessation of eye banking resulted in an acute demand and supply imbalance of fresh donor corneas for transplants during this time. Our network of eye banks addressed this issue by adopting glycerol preservation of donor corneas, which were subsequently utilized for tectonic penetrating keratoplasty. The donor cornea retrieval was resumed in a strategized manner 3 weeks prior to the date of exit of the lockdown, with modified guidelines on donor suitability, screening, retrieval, processing, and harvesting from various sources. A triage of keratoplasty priority was formulated to tide over the post lockdown shortage of corneas. We performed 31 therapeutic keratoplasties during the nationwide lockdown among our network of tertiary eye care centers. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the approach and strategies to manage and tide over an unprecedented crisis situation faced by corneal surgeons in general and, specifically, the eye banking community.","Roy, Arvind; Das, Sujata; Chaurasia, Sunita; Fernandes, Merle; Murthy, Somasheila",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33120619/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.ijo_2258_20,27

This requires several trials to identify the best matching with the impaired person’s audiogram. The objective of this paper is to propose a novel reconfigurable hearing aid of low complexity with auto-adapting capability which makes it suitable for different types of hearing disabilities ranging from mild to severe intensities. The audio spectrum is divided into three regions and for each region, four different schemes are proposed. An automatic selection of the optimum scheme is proposed for all the regions based on hearing thresholds. Octave and fractional interpolation techniques are performed on a Parks-McClellan based prototype filter to generate the various sub-bands in the reconfigurable filter bank structure. The proposed structure uses only 18 coefficient multipliers which save up to 92% of multipliers when compared to other designs. The delay and matching errors are within the globally accepted limits. The hardware implementation executed on Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA development board has reaffirmed that the structure is compact and power-efficient. The proposed auto-reconfigurable structure can be used for various types of hearing impairments and can avoid the manual interventions for the selection of schemes in audiogram matching. This in turn minimizes the time to establish the best match with the audiogram. Since the proposed structure has minimal complexity, cost-effective implementation of the device is also possible.","Devis, Tomson; Manuel, Manju",Phys Eng Sci Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13246-021-01030-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228256/,27

The objective of this study was to identify the prevalence and risk factors associated with underlying anxiety and depression in orthopaedic trauma patients. METHODS: From July 2015 to December 2017, all orthopaedic trauma patients were included in the retrospective study. Patients with conditions that might affect cognitive impairment were excluded from the study. Basic demographic data were collected. All patients were screened for emotional disorders on admission using a simple questionnaire called “Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index” (HEI). Bivariate analyses and logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with a HEI score of > 8. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-two patients (8.1%) had a HEI score of > 8. About 1.0% of enrolled patients had severe emotional disorders (HEI score ≥ 17). The reasons caused by emotional disorders in patients with orthopaedic trauma were a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS), a higher visual analogue score (VAS) and type of surgery. On logistic regression, marital status was a protective factor for emotional disorders, while VAS and ISS were the risk factors for emotional disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Although a significantly low percentage of orthopaedic trauma patients in our setting have emotional disorders, traumatic orthopaedic surgeons still need to pay attention to the risk of emotional disorders and integrate effective screening tools into clinical practice to screen for these factors and stratify emotional disorders. Appropriate targeted psychological intervention and treatment should be adopted according to the stratification of emotional disorders.","Yang, Yun; Tang, Ting-ting; Chen, Mei-ru; Xiang, Mao-ying; Li, Ling-li; Hou, Xiao-ling",J Orthop Surg Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-02132-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287842/,27

Short lengths of stay raise the possibility of mother–infant dyads being less ready for discharge, defined as at least one of the three informants (i.e., mother, pediatrician, and obstetrician) believing that either the mother and/or infant should stay longer than the proposed time of discharge. This public health crisis has reduced the number of in-person well child visits, negatively impacting vaccine receipt, and anticipatory guidance. RECENT FINDINGS: Extra precautions should be taken during the transition period between postpartum discharge and follow-up in the ambulatory setting to ensure the safety of all patients and practice team members. This should include restructuring office flow by visit type and location, limiting in-person visits during well infant exams, instituting proper procedures for personal protective equipment and for cleaning of the office, expanding telehealth capabilities for care and education, and prioritizing universal vaccinations and routine well child screenings.

Previous pieces of evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. It is also known that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, is expressed in different brain areas and cell types. Thus, it is hypothesized that infection by this virus could generate or exacerbate neuropathological alterations. However, the molecular mechanisms that link COVID-19 disease and nerve damage are unclear. In this review, we describe the routes of SARS-CoV-2 invasion into the central nervous system.

This paper describes Geelong's general surgical response, surgical activity, outcomes and the effect on surgical training. METHODS: Data collected from surgical audits; hospital databases and patient's medical records were used to compare the first 7 weeks of our new service delivery (30 March to 17 May 2020) to the corresponding 7 weeks in 2019 (1 April 2019 to 19 May 2019). All surgical cases, morbidity and mortality were discussed at weekly surgical audit meetings conducted by videoconference. Treatment performance indicators were tested by chi‐squared test for proportions, and by Student's t‐test or Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables. RESULTS: Elective general surgery decreased by 45.9% but an essential service was maintained by substantially increasing our public in private operating to perform 81 cases. Despite a 30% decrease in emergency department presentations, general surgery admissions decreased only 6.1% while emergency operations increased 13.9%. We used telehealth to conduct 81.3% of outpatient appointments and 61.8% of pre‐operative anaesthetic reviews. No significant differences were found for overall surgical outcomes, including appendicectomy (perforation rates) and laparotomy (length of stay and morbidity).

Ample evidence indicated that the thermal plume controls the dispersion and transport of aerosols in the human microenvironment. Given that in calm indoor environments most air inhaled by human comes from the boundary layer where thermal plume flows through constantly, the role of thermal plume needs to be scrutinized to predict the diffusion of droplets, aerosols and other airborne carriers of the novel coronavirus around the human body for prioritizing infection control strategies. Here, we assessed the potential influences of the thermal plume on the transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens by reviewing the most pertinent evidence and analyzing key variables in the formation of thermal plume in indoor environments, e.g., ambient temperature, human posture and type of clothing. Our reviewed evidence and data indicate that the human thermal plume should facilitate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces by elevating small droplets and airborne particles into the breathing zone from lower regions and ascending respiratory droplets from the sources into the upper atmosphere. By drawing attention to aerosol transport dynamics in the human microenvironment, these insights may be useful for understanding COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, especially those intended for public use.","Sun, Shiyi; Li, Jing; Han, Jie",Environ Chem Lett,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10311-020-01178-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33495695/,27

Modifications of this template through Mannich and Friedel-Crafts reactions, coupled with nucleophilic displacement and reductive aminations led to 23 final derivatives, which were pharmacologically tested. Tryptamine derivative 17a was found to have a selective inhibitory activity against human varicella zoster virus (VZV) replication in vitro, being inactive against a variety of other DNA and RNA viruses. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study showed that the presence of a biphenyl ethyl moiety and the acetylation at the amino group of tryptamine are a prerequisite for anti-VZV activity. The novel compound shows the same activity against thymidine kinase (TK)-competent (TK(+)) and TK-deficient (TK(−)) VZV strains, pointing to a novel mechanism of antiviral action.","Musella, Simona; di Sarno, Veronica; Ciaglia, Tania; Sala, Marina; Spensiero, Antonia; Scala, Maria Carmina; Ostacolo, Carmine; Andrei, Graciela; Balzarini, Jan; Snoeck, Robert; Novellino, Ettore; Campiglia, Pietro; Bertamino, Alessia; Gomez-Monterrey, Isabel M.",Eur J Med Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2016.09.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523416307401; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0223523416307401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27639368/,27

673272,Using Insights from Behavioral Economics to Mitigate the Spread of COVID-19,2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus is endemic in peninsular Malaysia. The clinical manifestations vary depending on the incubation period of the virus as well as the immunity of the patients. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is prevalent in Malaysia where the incidence is 3.2%. It has been noted that some G6PD-deficient individuals suffer from more severe clinical presentation of dengue infection. In this study, we aim to investigate the oxidative responses of DENV2-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals. METHODOLOGY: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals were infected with DENV2 and infection rate, levels of oxidative species, nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anions (O(2) (−)), and oxidative stress were determined and compared with normal controls. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals exhibited significantly higher infection rates compared to normal controls. In an effort to explain the reason for this enhanced susceptibility, we investigated the production of NO and O(2) (−) in the monocytes of individuals with G6PD deficiency compared with normal controls. We found that levels of NO and O(2) (−) were significantly lower in the DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals compared with normal controls. Furthermore, the overall oxidative stress in DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals was significantly higher when compared to normal controls. Correlation studies between DENV-infected cells and oxidative state of monocytes further confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Altered redox state of DENV-infected monocytes from G6PD-deficient individuals appears to augment viral replication in these cells. DENV-infected G6PD-deficient individuals may contain higher viral titers, which may be significant in enhanced virus transmission. Furthermore, granulocyte dysfunction and higher viral loads in G6PD-deificient individuals may result in severe form of dengue infection.","Al-alimi, Abdullah Ahmed; Ali, Syed A.; Al-Hassan, Faisal Muti; Idris, Fauziah Mohd; Teow, Sin-Yeang; Mohd Yusoff, Narazah",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24625456/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002711,27

ARDS is characterised by diffuse alveolar damage that leads to protein-rich pulmonary oedema, local alveolar hypoventilation and atelectasis. Inadequate perfusion of these areas is the main cause of hypoxaemia in ARDS. High perfusion in relation to ventilation (V/Q<1) and shunting (V/Q=0) is not only caused by impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction but also redistribution of perfusion from obstructed lung vessels. Rebalancing the pulmonary vascular tone is a therapeutic challenge. Previous clinical trials on inhaled vasodilators (nitric oxide and prostacyclin) to enhance perfusion to high V/Q areas showed beneficial effects on hypoxaemia but not on mortality. However, specific patient populations with pulmonary hypertension may profit from treatment with inhaled vasodilators. Novel treatment targets to decrease perfusion in low V/Q areas include epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and specific leukotriene receptors. Still, lung protective ventilation and prone positioning are the best available standard of care. This review focuses on disturbed perfusion in ARDS and aims to provide basic scientists and clinicians with an overview of the vascular alterations and mechanisms of V/Q mismatch, current therapeutic strategies, and experimental approaches.","Gierhardt, Mareike; Pak, Oleg; Walmrath, Dieter; Seeger, Werner; Grimminger, Friedrich; Ghofrani, Hossein A; Weissmann, Norbert; Hecker, Matthias; Sommer, Natascha",Europ. respir. rev,https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0059-2021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34526314/,27

We aimed to start a clinical debriefing program to identify opportunities to address teamwork and patient safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We reviewed existing literature on best-practice guidelines to answer key clinical debriefing program design questions. An end-of-shift huddle format for the debriefs allowed multiple cases of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness to be discussed in the same session, promoting situational awareness and team learning. A novel ED-based clinical debriefing tool was implemented and titled Debriefing In Situ COVID-19 to Encourage Reflection and Plus-Delta in Healthcare After Shifts End (DISCOVER-PHASE). A facilitator experienced in simulation debriefings would facilitate a short (10–25 min) discussion of the relevant cases by following a scripted series of stages for debriefing. Data on the number of debriefing opportunities, frequency of utilization of debriefing, debriefing location, and professional background of the facilitator were analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, the ED treated 3386 suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 11 deaths and 77 ICU admissions. Of the 187 debriefing opportunities in the first 8-week period, 163 (87.2%) were performed. Of the 24 debriefings not performed, 21 (87.5%) of these were during the four first weeks (21/24; 87.5%). Clinical debriefings had a median duration of 10 min (IQR 7–13). They were mostly facilitated by a nurse (85.9%) and mainly performed remotely (89.8%). CONCLUSION: Debriefing with DISCOVER-PHASE during the COVID-19 pandemic were performed often, were relatively brief, and were most often led remotely by a nurse facilitator.

This led to a reorganisation of oncology care in order to reduce the risk of spreading infection between patients and healthcare staff. Here we analysed measures taken in major oncological units in Europe and the USA. METHODS: A 46-item survey was sent by email to representatives of 30 oncological centres in 12 of the most affected countries. The survey inquired about preventive measures established to reduce virus spread, patient education and processes employed for risk reduction in each oncological unit. RESULTS: Investigators from 21 centres in 10 countries answered the survey between 10 April and 6 May 2020. A triage for patients with cancer before hospital or clinic visits was conducted by 90.5% of centres before consultations, 95.2% before day care admissions and in 100% of the cases before overnight hospitalisation by means of phone calls, interactive online platforms, swab test and/or chest CT scan. Permission for caregivers to attend clinic visits was limited in many centres, with some exceptions (ie, for non-autonomous patients, in the case of a new diagnosis, when bad news was expected and for terminally ill patients). With a variable delay period, the use of personal protective equipment was unanimously mandatory, and in many centres, only targeted clinical and instrumental examinations were performed. Telemedicine was implemented in 76.2% of the centres. Separated pathways for COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients were organised, with separate inpatient units and day care areas. Self-isolation was required for COVID-19-positive or symptomatic staff, while return to work policies required a negative swab test in 76.2% of the centres. CONCLUSION: Many pragmatic measures have been quickly implemented to deal with the health emergency linked to COVID-19, although the relative efficacy of each intervention should be further analysed in large observational studies.","Onesti, Concetta Elisa; Rugo, Hope S; Generali, Daniele; Peeters, Marc; Zaman, Khalil; Wildiers, Hans; Harbeck, Nadia; Martin, Miguel; Cristofanilli, Massimo; Cortes, Javier; Tjan-Heijnen, Vivianne; Hurvitz, Sara A; Berchem, Guy; Tagliamento, Marco; Campone, Mario; Bartsch, Rupert; De Placido, Sabino; Puglisi, Fabio; Rottey, Sylvie; Müller, Volkmar; Ruhstaller, Thomas; Machiels, Jean-Pascal; Conte, PierFranco; Awada, Ahmad; Jerusalem, Guy",ESMO Open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2059702920326648; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2059702920326648; https://doi.org/10.1136/esmoopen-2020-000853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847836/,27

Sudden influx, of COVID-infected patients, in health-care facilities, has increased the generation of yellow category BMW (Y-BMW) and put substantial burden on the BMW-incineration units of India. This study presents the compromising situation of the BMW-incineration units of India, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, from 21st March 2020 to 31st August 2020. This analysis revealed that on an average each COVID-infected patient in India generates approximately 3.41 kg/d of BMW and average proportion of Y-BMW in it is 50.44%. Further, it was observed that on 13th July 2020, the total Y-BMW, generated by both the normal and COVID-infected patients, fully utilized the BMW-incineration capacity of India. Also, it was made evident that, during the study period, BMW-incineration emitted several pollutants and their concentration was in the order: NO(x) > CO > SO(x) > PM > HCl > Cd > Pb > Hg > PCBs > Ni > Cr > Be > As. Subsequently, life time cancer risk assessment depicted that with hazard quotient >10(−6), Cd may induce carcinogenic health impacts on both the adults and children of India. Therefore, to mitigate the environmental-health impacts associated with the incineration of BMW, evaluation of various options, viz., alternative technologies, substitution of raw materials and separate treatment of specific wastes, was also done. It is expected that the findings of this study may encourage the global auditory comprising scientific community and authorities to adopt alternate BMW-management strategies during the pandemic.","Thind, Parteek Singh; Sareen, Arjun; Singh, Dapinder Deep; Singh, Sandeep; John, Siby",Environ Pollut,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592442/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.116621; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749121001998; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749121001998?v=s5,27

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the outer surface protein of the cell membrane that is abundantly distributed in the heart, lungs, and kidneys and plays an important role in molecular docking of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In this study, we aimed to analyze the difference in the survival rate according to ACE2 expressions in pan-cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We downloaded clinical and genomic data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We used Kaplan-Meier with a log-rank test, and the Cox proportional hazards regression to analyze prognostic significance. RESULTS: In the Kaplan-Meier curve, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), uveal melanoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma showed statistical significance. In the Cox regression, thyroid carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme and ccRCC showed significant results. Only ccRCC had statistical significance, and high ACE2 expression is related to good prognosis. It is known that the ACE inhibitor, a primary antihypertensive agent, increases ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, we believe that the ACE inhibitor will be important to increase the lifespan of ccRCC patients. This study is the first research to offer a recommendation on the use of anti-hypertensive drugs to ccRCC patients.","Kim, Kihun; Ko, Yeji; Ko, Dai Sik; Kim, Yun Hak",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2054376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274196/,27

We screened asymptomatic HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR. Complementary viral genome sequencing was performed on positive swab specimens. A seroprevalence analysis was also performed using multiple assays. Asymptomatic health care worker cohorts had a combined swab positivity rate of 29/5776 (0.50%, 95%CI 0.32–0.75) relative to a comparative cohort of symptomatic HCWs, where 54/1597 (3.4%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic 6.8:1). SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among 996 asymptomatic HCWs with no prior known exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4–3.4%, depending on assay.

Illness severity on admission was classified according to World Health Organization (WHO) criteria: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Data collected included demographics, presenting symptoms, radiological and laboratory findings, comorbidities, functional status, treatment, and clinical outcome. There were 159 patients (52.2% women) with a median age of 85.99 (IQR: 80–98). The median Barthel index was 90 (40–100) and Charlson index was 5 (5–6). Most common presenting symptoms were fever, dyspnea, and cough. Patients had mild (8.2%), moderate (52.2%), or severe (39.6%) illness according to WHO criteria. A bilateral pulmonary involvement was seen in 86% of patients. Laboratory analysis revealed increased serum concentrations of inflammatory parameters (C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer) with an abnormal lymphocyte count [0.88 × 10(9)/L (0.5)]. Treatments included corticosteroids in 37%, and biological therapies in 17.6%. Fifty three (33.3%) patients died during hospitalization, with a median time from admission to death of 3 (IQR 1–6) days. Mortality was higher in men (55%). Deceased patients had a significantly higher frequency of dyspnea, increased inflammatory parameters, and illness severity compared to survivors. One-third of octogenarians with covid-19 died during hospitalization and most had bilateral lung involvement. A further knowledge of the characteristics and outcome of this population may assist clinicians in the decision-making process in these patients.","Capdevila-Reniu, Aina; Pellice, Martina; Prieto-González, Sergio; Ventosa, Helena; Ladino, Andrea; Naval, Jose; Rodriguez-Nuñez, Olga; César Milisenda, Jose; Moreno-Lozano, Pedro Juan; Soriano, Alex; Bosch, Xavier; López-Soto, Alfonso",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663089/; https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000024750,27

688324,Viral and bacterial investigations on the aetiology of recurrent pig neonatal diarrhoea cases in Spain,2018-04-05,"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that eliminates dysfunctional cytosolic biomolecules through vacuole-mediated sequestration and lysosomal degradation. Although the molecular mechanisms that regulate autophagy are not fully understood, recent work indicates that dysfunctional/impaired autophagic functions are associated with the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Autophagy prevents NAFLD and AFLD progression through enhanced lipid catabolism and decreasing hepatic steatosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides and increased inflammation. However, as both diseases progress, autophagy can become impaired leading to exacerbation of both pathological conditions and progression into HCC. Due to the significance of impaired autophagy in these diseases, there is increased interest in studying pathways and targets involved in maintaining efficient autophagic functions as potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we summarize how impaired autophagy affects liver function and contributes to NAFLD, AFLD, and HCC progression. We will also explore how recent discoveries could provide novel therapeutic opportunities to effectively treat these diseases.","Niture, Suryakant; Lin, Minghui; Rios-Colon, Leslimar; Qi, Qi; Moore, John T.; Kumar, Deepak",Int J Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33976943/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6675762,27

689971,COVID-SCORE Spain: Public perceptions of key government COVID-19 control measures,2021-04-19,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening complication that can ensue following Staphylococcus aureus infection. The enterotoxin produced by these bacteria (SEB) acts as a superantigen thereby activating a large proportion of T cells leading to cytokine storm and severe lung injury. Δ9Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive ingredient found in Cannabis sativa, has been shown to act as a potent anti-inflammatory agent. In the current study, we investigated the effect of THC treatment on SEB-induced ARDS in mice. While exposure to SEB resulted in acute mortality, treatment with THC led to 100% survival of mice. THC treatment significantly suppressed the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Additionally, THC elevated the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their associated cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β. Moreover, THC caused induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). THC acted through CB2 receptor as pharmacological inhibitor of CB2 receptors blocked the anti-inflammatory effects. THC-treated mice showed significant alterations in the expression of miRNA (miRs) in the lung-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused downregulation of let7a-5p which targeted SOCS1 and downregulation of miR-34-5p which caused increased expression of FoxP3, NOS1, and CSF1R. Together, these data suggested that THC-mediated alterations in miR expression in the lungs may play a critical role in the induction of immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSCs as well as suppression of cytokine storm leading to attenuation of SEB-mediated lung injury.","Mohammed, Amira; Alghetaa, Hasan; Sultan, Muthanna; Singh, Narendra P.; Nagarkatti, Prakash; Nagarkatti, Mitzi",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.00893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32612530/,27
